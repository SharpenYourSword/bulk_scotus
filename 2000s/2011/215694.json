CONCEPCION ET UX.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u2013893.      Argued November 9, 2010\u2014Decided April 27, 2011\nThe cellular telephone contract between respondents (Concepcions) and\n  petitioner (AT&T) provided for arbitration of all disputes, but did not\n  permit classwide arbitration. After the Concepcions were charged\n  sales tax on the retail value of phones provided free under their ser\n  vice contract, they sued AT&T in a California Federal District Court.\n  Their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging, inter alia,\n  that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging\n  sales tax on \u201cfree\u201d phones. The District Court denied AT&T\u2019s motion\n  to compel arbitration under the Concepcions\u2019 contract. Relying on\n  the California Supreme Court\u2019s Discover Bank decision, it found the\n  arbitration provision unconscionable because it disallowed classwide\n  proceedings. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the provision was uncon\n  scionable under California law and held that the Federal Arbitration\n  Act (FAA), which makes arbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable,\n  and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\n  for the revocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, did not preempt its\n  ruling.\nHeld: Because it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and exe\n cution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d Hines v.\n Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67, California\u2019s Discover Bank rule is pre\n empted by the FAA. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Section 2 reflects a \u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration,\u201d\n Moses H.

S. ____, ____.\n Thus, courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing\n with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546\n U. S. 440, 443, and enforce them according to their terms, Volt In\n2                AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    formation Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jun\n    ior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478. Section 2\u2019s saving clause permits\n    agreements to be invalidated by \u201cgenerally applicable contract de\n    fenses,\u201d but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or derive\n    their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at is\n    sue. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687. Pp. 4\u2013\n    5.\n       (b) In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court held that class\n    waivers in consumer arbitration agreements are unconscionable if\n    the agreement is in an adhesion contract, disputes between the par\n    ties are likely to involve small amounts of damages, and the party\n    with inferior bargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to de\n    fraud. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (c) The Concepcions claim that the Discover Bank rule is a ground\n    that \u201cexist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d\n    under FAA \u00a72. When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a\n    particular type of claim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule. But\n    the inquiry is more complex when a generally applicable doctrine is\n    alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes\n    with arbitration. Although \u00a72\u2019s saving clause preserves generally\n    applicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to preserve\n    state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\n    the FAA\u2019s objectives. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529\n    U. S. 861, 872. The FAA\u2019s overarching purpose is to ensure the en\n    forcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to\n    facilitate informal, streamlined proceedings. Parties may agree to\n    limit the issues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.\n    Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628, to arbitrate accord\n    ing to specific rules, Volt, supra, at 479, and to limit with whom they\n    will arbitrate, Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at ___. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       (d) Class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by Discover\n    Bank rather than consensual, interferes with fundamental attributes\n    of arbitration. The switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacri\n    fices arbitration\u2019s informality and makes the process slower, more\n    costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final\n    judgment. And class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen\n    dants. The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that\n    errors will go uncorrected. That risk of error may become unaccept\n    able when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are ag\n    gregated and decided at once. Arbitration is poorly suited to these\n    higher stakes. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification\n    decision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S. C. \u00a710 limits the grounds\n    on which courts can vacate arbitral awards. Pp. 12\u201318.\n584 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. \u00a72. We\nconsider whether the FAA prohibits States from condition-\ning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on\nthe availability of classwide arbitration procedures.\n                              I\n  In February 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion entered\ninto an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular\ntelephones with AT&T Mobility LCC (AT&T).1 The con-\ntract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the\nparties, but required that claims be brought in the parties\u2019\n\u201cindividual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member\nin any purported class or representative proceeding.\u201d App.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The  Concepcions\u2019 original contract was with Cingular Wireless.\nAT&T acquired Cingular in 2005 and renamed the company AT&T\nMobility in 2007. Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849, 852,\nn. 1 (CA9 2009).\n2              AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto Pet. for Cert 61a.2 The agreement authorized AT&T to\nmake unilateral amendments, which it did to the arbitra\ntion provision on several occasions. The version at issue in\nthis case reflects revisions made in December 2006, which\nthe parties agree are controlling.\n   The revised agreement provides that customers may\ninitiate dispute proceedings by completing a one-page No\ntice of Dispute form available on AT&T\u2019s Web site. AT&T\nmay then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if\nthe dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer\nmay invoke arbitration by filing a separate Demand for\nArbitration, also available on AT&T\u2019s Web site. In the\nevent the parties proceed to arbitration, the agreement\nspecifies that AT&T must pay all costs for nonfrivolous\nclaims; that arbitration must take place in the county in\nwhich the customer is billed; that, for claims of $10,000 or\nless, the customer may choose whether the arbitration\nproceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submis\nsions; that either party may bring a claim in small claims\ncourt in lieu of arbitration; and that the arbitrator may\naward any form of individual relief, including injunctions\nand presumably punitive damages. The agreement, more\nover, denies AT&T any ability to seek reimbursement of\nits attorney\u2019s fees, and, in the event that a customer re\nceives an arbitration award greater than AT&T\u2019s last\nwritten settlement offer, requires AT&T to pay a $7,500\nminimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s fees.3\n   The Concepcions purchased AT&T service, which was\nadvertised as including the provision of free phones; they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 That provision further states that \u201cthe arbitrator may not consoli\n\ndate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside\nover any form of a representative or class proceeding.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 61a.\n  3 The guaranteed minimum recovery was increased in 2009 to\n\n$10,000. Brief for Petitioner 7.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere not charged for the phones, but they were charged\n$30.22 in sales tax based on the phones\u2019 retail value. In\nMarch 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against\nAT&T in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California. The complaint was later consoli\ndated with a putative class action alleging, among other\nthings, that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and\nfraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.\n  In March 2008, AT&T moved to compel arbitration\nunder the terms of its contract with the Concepcions. The\nConcepcions opposed the motion, contending that the ar\nbitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully\nexculpatory under California law because it disallowed\nclasswide procedures. The District Court denied AT&T\u2019s\nmotion. It described AT&T\u2019s arbitration agreement fa\nvorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute\nresolution process was \u201cquick, easy to use\u201d and likely to\n\u201cpromp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer\nwithout the need to arbitrate or litigate\u201d; that the $7,500\npremium functioned as \u201ca substantial inducement for the\nconsumer to pursue the claim in arbitration\u201d if a dispute\nwas not resolved informally; and that consumers who were\nmembers of a class would likely be worse off. Laster v.\nT-Mobile USA, Inc., 2008 WL 5216255, *11\u2013*12 (SD Cal.,\nAug. 11, 2008). Nevertheless, relying on the California\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Discover Bank v. Superior\nCourt, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), the court\nfound that the arbitration provision was unconscionable\nbecause AT&T had not shown that bilateral arbitration\nadequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class\nactions. Laster, 2008 WL 5216255, *14.\n  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the provision\nunconscionable under California law as announced in\nDiscover Bank. Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d\n849, 855 (2009). It also held that the Discover Bank rule\nwas not preempted by the FAA because that rule was\n4            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply \u201ca refinement of the unconscionability analysis\napplicable to contracts generally in California.\u201d 584 F. 3d,\nat 857. In response to AT&T\u2019s argument that the Con\ncepcions\u2019 interpretation of California law discriminated\nagainst arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the conten\ntion that \u201c \u2018class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and\nexpeditiousness of arbitration\u2019 \u201d and noted that \u201c \u2018Discover\nBank placed arbitration agreements with class action\nwaivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar\nclass action litigation outside the context of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 858 (quoting Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless\nServices, Inc., 498 F. 3d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)).\n   We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  The FAA was enacted in 1925 in response to widespread\njudicial hostility to arbitration agreements. See Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,\n581 (2008). Section 2, the \u201cprimary substantive provision\nof the Act,\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury\nConstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983), provides, in relevant\npart, as follows:\n       \u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or\n    a contract evidencing a transaction involving com\n    merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\n    arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be\n    valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such\n    grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\n    of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72.\nWe have described this provision as reflecting both a\n\u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration,\u201d Moses H.\nCone, supra, at 24, and the \u201cfundamental principle that\narbitration is a matter of contract,\u201d Rent-A-Center, West,\nInc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____ , ____ (2010) (slip op., at 3).\nIn line with these principles, courts must place arbitration\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagreements on an equal footing with other contracts,\nBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.

S. 468, 478 (1989).\n   The final phrase of \u00a72, however, permits arbitration\nagreements to be declared unenforceable \u201cupon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of\nany contract.\u201d This saving clause permits agreements to\narbitrate to be invalidated by \u201cgenerally applicable con\ntract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionabil\nity,\u201d but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or\nthat derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement\nto arbitrate is at issue. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v.\nCasarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996); see also Perry v.\nThomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492\u2013493, n. 9 (1987). The question\nin this case is whether \u00a72 preempts California\u2019s rule clas\nsifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer\ncontracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as the\nDiscover Bank rule.\n   Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any\ncontract found \u201cto have been unconscionable at the time it\nwas made,\u201d or may \u201climit the application of any uncon\nscionable clause.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71670.5(a) (West\n1985). A finding of unconscionability requires \u201ca \u2018proce\ndural\u2019 and a \u2018substantive\u2019 element, the former focusing on\n\u2018oppression\u2019 or \u2018surprise\u2019 due to unequal bargaining power,\nthe latter on \u2018overly harsh\u2019 or \u2018one-sided\u2019 results.\u201d Armen\ndariz v. Foundation Health Pyschcare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal.\n4th 83, 114, 6 P. 3d 669, 690 (2000); accord, Discover\nBank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 159\u2013161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108.\n   In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court applied\nthis framework to class-action waivers in arbitration\nagreements and held as follows:\n    \u201c[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of\n6           AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the\n    contracting parties predictably involve small amounts\n    of damages, and when it is alleged that the party\n    with the superior bargaining power has carried out a\n    scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of con\n    sumers out of individually small sums of money, then\n    . . . the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of\n    the party \u2018from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or\n    willful injury to the person or property of another.\u2019\n    Under these circumstances, such waivers are uncon\n    scionable under California law and should not be en\n    forced.\u201d Id., at 162, 113 P. 3d, at 1110 (quoting Cal.\n    Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71668).\nCalifornia courts have frequently applied this rule to find\narbitration agreements unconscionable. See, e.g., Cohen v.\nDirecTV, Inc., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451\u20131453, 48 Cal.\nRptr. 3d 813, 819\u2013821 (2006); Klussman v. Cross Country\nBank, 134 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1297, 36 Cal Rptr. 3d 728,\n738\u2013739 (2005); Aral v. EarthLink, Inc., 134 Cal. App. 4th\n544, 556\u2013557, 36 Cal. Rptr. 3d 229, 237\u2013239 (2005).\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The Concepcions argue that the Discover Bank rule,\ngiven its origins in California\u2019s unconscionability doctrine\nand California\u2019s policy against exculpation, is a ground\nthat \u201cexist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any\ncontract\u201d under FAA \u00a72. Moreover, they argue that even if\nwe construe the Discover Bank rule as a prohibition on\ncollective-action waivers rather than simply an application\nof unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to\nall dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits\nwaivers of class litigation as well. See America Online,\nInc. v. Superior Ct., 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17\u201318, 108 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 699, 711\u2013713 (2001).\n  When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nparticular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward:\nThe conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. Preston v.\nFerrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353 (2008). But the inquiry becomes\nmore complex when a doctrine normally thought to be\ngenerally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here,\nunconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a\nfashion that disfavors arbitration. In Perry v. Thomas,\n482 U. S. 483 (1987), for example, we noted that the FAA\u2019s\npreemptive effect might extend even to grounds tradition\nally thought to exist \u201c \u2018at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 492, n. 9 (emphasis deleted). We\nsaid that a court may not \u201crely on the uniqueness of an\nagreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding\nthat enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would\nenable the court to effect what . . . the state legislature\ncannot.\u201d Id., at 493, n. 9.\n   An obvious illustration of this point would be a case\nfinding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public\npolicy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to pro\nvide for judicially monitored discovery. The rationaliza\ntions for such a holding are neither difficult to imagine nor\ndifferent in kind from those articulated in Discover Bank.\nA court might reason that no consumer would knowingly\nwaive his right to full discovery, as this would enable\ncompanies to hide their wrongdoing. Or the court might\nsimply say that such agreements are exculpatory\u2014re\nstricting discovery would be of greater benefit to the\ncompany than the consumer, since the former is more\nlikely to be sued than to sue. See Discover Bank, supra, at\n161, 113 P. 3d, at 1109 (arguing that class waivers are\nsimilarly one-sided). And, the reasoning would continue,\nbecause such a rule applies the general principle of uncon\nscionability or public-policy disapproval of exculpatory\nagreements, it is applicable to \u201cany\u201d contract and thus\npreserved by \u00a72 of the FAA. In practice, of course, the rule\nwould have a disproportionate impact on arbitration\n8                  AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\nagreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts\npurporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.\n  Other examples are easy to imagine. The same argu-\nment might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable\narbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal\nRules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition\nby a jury (perhaps termed \u201ca panel of twelve lay arbitra-\ntors\u201d to help avoid preemption). Such examples are not\nfanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration\nthat prompted the FAA had manifested itself in \u201ca great\nvariety\u201d of \u201cdevices and formulas\u201d declaring arbitration\nagainst public policy. Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire\nFabrics, Inc., 271 F. 2d 402, 406 (CA2 1959). And al-\nthough these statistics are not definitive, it is worth not-\ning that California\u2019s courts have been more likely to hold\ncontracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.\nBroome, An Unconscionable Application of the Uncon-\nscionability Doctrine: How the California Courts are Cir-\ncumventing the Federal Arbitration Act, 3 Hastings Bus.\nL.

Although \u00a72\u2019s saving clause preserves\ngenerally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it sug\ngests an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as\nan obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives.\nCf.

As we have said, a federal\nstatute\u2019s saving clause \u201c \u2018cannot in reason be construed as\n[allowing] a common law right, the continued existence of\nwhich would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions\nof the act.

We do not agree that\nrules requiring judicially monitored discovery or adher\nence to the Federal Rules of Evidence are \u201ca far cry from\nthis case.\u201d Brief for Respondents 32. The overarching\npurpose of the FAA, evident in the text of \u00a7\u00a72, 3, and 4,\nis to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements\naccording to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined\nproceedings.

It says that to its knowledge \u201cwe have not . . . applied the Act to\nstrike down a state statute that treats arbitrations on par with judicial\nand administrative proceedings,\u201d post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and\nthat \u201cwe should think more than twice before invalidating a state law\nthat . . . puts agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate \u2018upon\nthe same footing\u2019 \u201d post, at 4\u20135.\n10          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v.

S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 17). This purpose is readily apparent from the\nFAA\u2019s text. Section 2 makes arbitration agreements\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d as written (subject, of\ncourse, to the saving clause); \u00a73 requires courts to stay\nlitigation of arbitral claims pending arbitration of those\nclaims \u201cin accordance with the terms of the agreement\u201d;\nand \u00a74 requires courts to compel arbitration \u201cin accor\ndance with the terms of the agreement\u201d upon the motion of\neither party to the agreement (assuming that the \u201cmaking\nof the arbitration agreement or the failure . . . to perform\nthe same\u201d is not at issue). In light of these provisions,\nwe have held that parties may agree to limit the issues\nsubject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.

It can be speci\nfied, for example, that the decisionmaker be a specialist in\nthe relevant field, or that proceedings be kept confidential\nto protect trade secrets. And the informality of arbitral\nproceedings is itself desirable, reducing the cost and in\ncreasing the speed of dispute resolution. 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

Far from it . . . .\u201d\nId., at 220. It then quotes a House Report saying that\n\u201cthe costliness and delays of litigation . . . can be largely\neliminated by agreements for arbitration.\u201d Ibid. (quoting\nH. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924)). The\nconcluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins\nas follows:\n      \u201cWe therefore are not persuaded by the argument\n    that the conflict between two goals of the Arbitration\n    Act\u2014enforcement of private agreements and encour\n    agement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution\u2014\n    must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to real\n    ize the intent of the drafters.\u201d 470 U. S., at 221.\nIn the present case, of course, those \u201ctwo goals\u201d do not\nconflict\u2014and it is the dissent\u2019s view that would frustrate\nboth of them.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, our cases place it beyond\ndispute that the FAA was designed to promote arbitration.\nThey have repeatedly described the Act as \u201cembod[ying]\n[a] national policy favoring arbitration,\u201d Buckeye Check\nCashing, 546 U. S., at 443, and \u201ca liberal federal policy\nfavoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any\nstate substantive or procedural policies to the contrary,\u201d\nMoses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 24; see also Hall Street As\nsocs., 552 U. S., at 581. Thus, in Preston v. Ferrer, holding\npreempted a state-law rule requiring exhaustion of admin\nistrative remedies before arbitration, we said: \u201cA prime\nobjective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve\n\u2018streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,\u2019 \u201d which\nobjective would be \u201cfrustrated\u201d by requiring a dispute to be\nheard by an agency first. 552 U. S., at 357\u2013358. That\n12             AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrule, we said, would \u201cat the least, hinder speedy resolution\nof the controversy.\u201d Id., at 358.5\n   California\u2019s Discover Bank rule similarly interferes with\narbitration. Although the rule does not require classwide\narbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to\ndemand it ex post. The rule is limited to adhesion con\ntracts, Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 162\u2013163, 113 P. 3d,\nat 1110, but the times in which consumer contracts were\nanything other than adhesive are long past.6 Carbajal v.\nH&R Block Tax Servs., Inc., 372 F. 3d 903, 906 (CA7\n2004); see also Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1147,\n1149 (CA7 1997). The rule also requires that damages be\npredictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme\nto cheat consumers. Discover Bank, supra, at 162\u2013163,\n113 P. 3d, at 1110. The former requirement, however, is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Relying  upon nothing more indicative of congressional understand\ning than statements of witnesses in committee hearings and a press\nrelease of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the dissent suggests\nthat Congress \u201cthought that arbitration would be used primarily where\nmerchants sought to resolve disputes of fact . . . [and] possessed roughly\nequivalent bargaining power.\u201d Post, at 6. Such a limitation appears\nnowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our\ncases. \u201cRelationships between securities dealers and investors, for\nexample, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] never\ntheless held . . . that agreements to arbitrate in that context are en\nforceable.\u201d Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 33\n(1991); see also id., at 32\u201333 (allowing arbitration of claims arising\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 despite\nallegations of unequal bargaining power between employers and\nemployees). Of course the dissent\u2019s disquisition on legislative history\nfails to note that it contains nothing\u2014not even the testimony of a stray\nwitness in committee hearings\u2014that contemplates the existence of\nclass arbitration.\n  6 Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns\n\nthat attend contracts of adhesion\u2014for example, requiring class-action\nwaiver provisions in adhesive arbitration agreements to be highlighted.\nSuch steps cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its\npurpose to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced\naccording to their terms.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntoothless and malleable (the Ninth Circuit has held that\ndamages of $4,000 are sufficiently small, see Oestreicher v.\nAlienware Corp., 322 Fed. Appx. 489, 492 (2009) (unpub\nlished)), and the latter has no limiting effect, as all that is\nrequired is an allegation. Consumers remain free to bring\nand resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under Dis\ncover Bank, and some may well do so; but there is little\nincentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals\nwhen they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in\nthe process. And faced with inevitable class arbitration,\ncompanies would have less incentive to continue resolving\npotentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.\n   Although we have had little occasion to examine class\nwide arbitration, our decision in Stolt-Nielsen is instruc\ntive. In that case we held that an arbitration panel ex\nceeded its power under \u00a710(a)(4) of the FAA by imposing\nclass procedures based on policy judgments rather than\nthe arbitration agreement itself or some background prin\nciple of contract law that would affect its interpretation.\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\u201323). We then held that\nthe agreement at issue, which was silent on the question\nof class procedures, could not be interpreted to allow them\nbecause the \u201cchanges brought about by the shift from\nbilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration\u201d are \u201cfun\ndamental.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22). This is obvious as a\nstructural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent\nparties, necessitating additional and different procedures\nand involving higher stakes. Confidentiality becomes\nmore difficult. And while it is theoretically possible to\nselect an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the\nclass-certification question, arbitrators are not generally\nknowledgeable in the often-dominant procedural aspects of\ncertification, such as the protection of absent parties. The\nconclusion follows that class arbitration, to the extent it is\nmanufactured by Discover Bank rather than consensual,\nis inconsistent with the FAA.\n14            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the switch from bilateral to class arbitration\nsacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration\u2014its in\nformality\u2014and makes the process slower, more costly, and\nmore likely to generate procedural morass than final\njudgment. \u201cIn bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the\nprocedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in\norder to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution:\nlower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to\nchoose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.\u201d\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21). But before an arbitrator\nmay decide the merits of a claim in classwide procedures,\nhe must first decide, for example, whether the class itself\nmay be certified, whether the named parties are suffi\nciently representative and typical, and how discovery for\nthe class should be conducted. A cursory comparison of\nbilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference.\nAccording to the American Arbitration Association (AAA),\nthe average consumer arbitration between January and\nAugust 2007 resulted in a disposition on the merits in\nsix months, four months if the arbitration was conducted\nby documents only. AAA, Analysis of the AAA\u2019s Con\nsumer Arbitration Caseload, online at http://www.adr.org/\nsi.asp?id=5027 (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 25,\n2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). As of\nSeptember 2009, the AAA had opened 283 class arbitra\ntions. Of those, 121 remained active, and 162 had been\nsettled, withdrawn, or dismissed. Not a single one, how\never, had resulted in a final award on the merits. Brief for\nAAA as Amicus Curiae in Stolt-Nielsen, O. T. 2009, No.\n08\u20131198, pp. 22\u201324. For those cases that were no longer\nactive, the median time from filing to settlement, with\ndrawal, or dismissal\u2014not judgment on the merits\u2014was\n583 days, and the mean was 630 days.

Com\npare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations\n(effective Oct. 8, 2003), online at http://www.adr.org/\nsp.asp?id=21936, with Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23. And while\nparties can alter those procedures by contract, an alterna\ntive is not obvious. If procedures are too informal, absent\nclass members would not be bound by the arbitration. For\na class-action money judgment to bind absentees in litiga\ntion, class representatives must at all times adequately\nrepresent absent class members, and absent members\nmust be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and\na right to opt out of the class. Phillips Petroleum Co. v.\nShutts, 472 U. S. 797, 811\u2013812 (1985). At least this\namount of process would presumably be required for ab\nsent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.\n   We find it unlikely that in passing the FAA Congress\nmeant to leave the disposition of these procedural re\nquirements to an arbitrator. Indeed, class arbitration was\nnot even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA\nin 1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in\nDiscover Bank, class arbitration is a \u201crelatively recent\ndevelopment.\u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at 163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110.\nAnd it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator\nwould be entrusted with ensuring that third parties\u2019 due\nprocess rights are satisfied.\n   Third, class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen\ndants. Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The\nabsence of multilayered review makes it more likely that\nerrors will go uncorrected. Defendants are willing to\naccept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntrating a class is more desirable than litigating one, however, is not\n\nrelevant. A State cannot defend a rule requiring arbitration-by-jury by\n\nsaying that parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury. \n\n16           AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpact is limited to the size of individual disputes, and\npresumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the\ncourts. But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thou\nsands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at\nonce, the risk of an error will often become unacceptable.\nFaced with even a small chance of a devastating loss,\ndefendants will be pressured into settling questionable\nclaims. Other courts have noted the risk of \u201cin terrorem\u201d\nsettlements that class actions entail, see, e.g., Kohen v.\nPacific Inv. Management Co. LLC, 571 F. 3d 672, 677\u2013678\n(CA7 2009), and class arbitration would be no different.\n   Arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class\nlitigation. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certifi\ncation decision on an interlocutory basis and, if unsuccess\nful, may appeal from a final judgment as well. Questions\nof law are reviewed de novo and questions of fact for clear\nerror. In contrast, 9 U. S. C. \u00a710 allows a court to vacate\nan arbitral award only where the award \u201cwas procured by\ncorruption, fraud, or undue means\u201d; \u201cthere was evident\npartiality or corruption in the arbitrators\u201d; \u201cthe arbitrators\nwere guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the\nhearing . . . or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and\nmaterial to the controversy[,] or of any other misbehavior\nby which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d; or\nif the \u201carbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\nexecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award . . .\nwas not made.\u201d The AAA rules do authorize judicial re\nview of certification decisions, but this review is unlikely\nto have much effect given these limitations; review un\nder \u00a710 focuses on misconduct rather than mistake. And\nparties may not contractually expand the grounds or\nnature of judicial review. Hall Street Assocs., 552 U. S., at\n578.

But the\nsame could be said about procedures that the Concepcions\nadmit States may not superimpose on arbitration: Parties\ncould agree to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, or pursuant to a discovery process rival\ning that in litigation. Arbitration is a matter of contract,\nand the FAA requires courts to honor parties\u2019 expecta\ntions. Rent-A-Center, West, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). But what the parties in the aforementioned examples\nwould have agreed to is not arbitration as envisioned by\nthe FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be\nrequired by state law.\n   The dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary\nto prosecute small-dollar claims that might otherwise slip\nthrough the legal system. See post, at 9. But States can\nnot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA,\neven if it is desirable for unrelated reasons. Moreover, the\nclaim here was most unlikely to go unresolved. As noted\nearlier, the arbitration agreement provides that AT&T\nwill pay claimants a minimum of $7,500 and twice their\nattorney\u2019s fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater\nthan AT&T\u2019s last settlement offer. The District Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent cites three large arbitration awards (none of which\n\nstems from classwide arbitration) as evidence that parties are willing to\nsubmit large claims before an arbitrator. Post, at 7\u20138. Those examples\nmight be in point if it could be established that the size of the arbitral\ndispute was predictable when the arbitration agreement was entered.\nOtherwise, all the cases prove is that arbitrators can give huge\nawards\u2014which we have never doubted. The point is that in class\naction arbitration huge awards (with limited judicial review) will be\nentirely predictable, thus rendering arbitration unattractive. It is not\nreasonably deniable that requiring consumer disputes to be arbitrated\non a classwide basis will have a substantial deterrent effect on incen\ntives to arbitrate.\n18          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfound this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the\nindividual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not\nimmediately settled, and the Ninth Circuit admitted that\naggrieved customers who filed claims would be \u201cessen\ntially guarantee[d]\u201d to be made whole, 584 F. 3d, at 856, n.\n9. Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concep\ncions were better off under their arbitration agreement\nwith AT&T than they would have been as participants in\na class action, which \u201ccould take months, if not years,\nand which may merely yield an opportunity to submit a\nclaim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.\u201d\nLaster, 2008 WL 5216255, at *12.\n                       *     *     *\n  Because it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con\ngress,\u201d Hines v.

S. C. \u00a72.\nThe question here is whether California\u2019s Discover Bank\nrule, see Discover Bank v. Superior Ct., 36 Cal. 4th 148,\n113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), is a \u201cgroun[d] . . . for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d\n   It would be absurd to suggest that \u00a72 requires only that\na defense apply to \u201cany contract.\u201d If \u00a72 means anything,\nit is that courts cannot refuse to enforce arbitration agree\nments because of a state public policy against arbitration,\neven if the policy nominally applies to \u201cany contract.\u201d\nThere must be some additional limit on the contract de\nfenses permitted by \u00a72. Cf. ante, at 17 (opinion of the\nCourt) (state law may not require procedures that are \u201cnot\narbitration as envisioned by the FAA\u201d and \u201clac[k] its bene\nfits\u201d); post, at 5 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (state law may\nrequire only procedures that are \u201cconsistent with the use\nof arbitration\u201d).\n   I write separately to explain how I would find that limit\nin the FAA\u2019s text. As I would read it, the FAA requires\nthat an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party\nsuccessfully challenges the formation of the arbitration\n2            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                      THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nagreement, such as by proving fraud or duress. 9 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72, 4. Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of\nAppeals because a district court cannot follow both the\nFAA and the Discover Bank rule, which does not relate to\ndefects in the making of an agreement.\n   This reading of the text, however, has not been fully\ndeveloped by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41, n. 12,\nand could benefit from briefing and argument in an ap\npropriate case. Moreover, I think that the Court\u2019s test will\noften lead to the same outcome as my textual interpreta\ntion and that, when possible, it is important in interpret\ning statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority\nof the Court. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535\nU. S. 391, 411 (2002) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Therefore,\nalthough I adhere to my views on purposes-and-objectives\npre-emption, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, ___ (2009)\n(opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.\n                                I\n   The FAA generally requires courts to enforce arbitration\nagreements as written. Section 2 provides that \u201c[a] writ\nten provision in . . . a contract . . . to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . .\nshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d Significantly, the statute does not paral\nlel the words \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d by refer\nencing the grounds as exist for the \u201cinvalidation, revoca\ntion, or nonenforcement\u201d of any contract. Nor does the\nstatute use a different word or phrase entirely that might\narguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce\nability. The use of only \u201crevocation\u201d and the conspicuous\nomission of \u201cinvalidation\u201d and \u201cnonenforcement\u201d suggest\nthat the exception does not include all defenses applicable\nto any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nSee Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (\u201cIt is our\nduty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of\na statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the\none hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is\nnot obvious. The statute does not define the terms, and\ntheir ordinary meanings arguably overlap. Indeed, this\nCourt and others have referred to the concepts of revoca\nbility, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But\nthis ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress\u2019\nclear decision in \u00a72 to repeat only one of the three\nconcepts.\n  To clarify the meaning of \u00a72, it would be natural to look\nto other portions of the FAA. Statutory interpretation\nfocuses on \u201cthe language itself, the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 341 (1997). \u201cA provision that may seem am\nbiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of\nthe statutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissi\nble meanings produces a substantive effect that is com\npatible with the rest of the law.\u201d United Sav. Assn. of Tex.\nv. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.\n365, 371 (1988).\n  Examining the broader statutory scheme, \u00a74 can be read\nto clarify the scope of \u00a72\u2019s exception to the enforcement of\narbitration agreements. When a party seeks to enforce an\narbitration agreement in federal court, \u00a74 requires that\n\u201cupon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for\narbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in\nissue,\u201d the court must order arbitration \u201cin accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement.\u201d\n  Reading \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 harmoniously, the \u201cgrounds . . . for\nthe revocation\u201d preserved in \u00a72 would mean grounds re\nlated to the making of the agreement. This would require\nenforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party\n4               AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                          THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nsuccessfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of\nthe agreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mu\ntual mistake. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\nMfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403\u2013404 (1967) (interpreting \u00a74 to\npermit federal courts to adjudicate claims of \u201cfraud in the\ninducement of the arbitration clause itself\u201d because such\nclaims \u201cg[o] to the \u2018making\u2019 of the agreement to arbitrate\u201d).\nContract defenses unrelated to the making of the agree\nment\u2014such as public policy\u2014could not be the basis for\ndeclining to enforce an arbitration clause.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The interpretation I suggest would be consistent with our prece\ndent.

Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).\n   The statement in Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987), suggesting\nthat \u00a72 preserves all state-law defenses that \u201carose to govern issues\nconcerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts\ngenerally,\u201d id., at 493, n. 9, is dicta. This statement is found in a\nfootnote concerning a claim that the Court \u201cdecline[d] to address.\u201d Id.,\nat 392, n. 9. Similarly, to the extent that statements in Rent-A-Center,\nWest, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n. 1),\ncan be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses\nunder \u00a72, those statements are dicta, as well. This Court has never\naddressed the question whether the state-law \u201cgrounds\u201d referred to in\n\u00a72 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.\n   Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has ac\nknowledged is applicable under \u00a72 relates to contract formation. In\nDoctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996), this\nCourt said that fraud, duress, and unconscionability \u201cmay be applied to\ninvalidate arbitration agreements without contravening \u00a72.\u201d All three\ndefenses historically concern the making of an agreement. See Morgan\nStanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty.,\n554 U.

I think it does not.\n   In Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that \u201cclass action waivers\nare, under certain circumstances, unconscionable as unlaw\nfully exculpatory.\u201d Id., at 65, 113 P. 3d, at 1112; see\nalso id., at 161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108 (\u201c[C]lass action waivers\n[may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they\nmay operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses\nthat are contrary to public policy\u201d). The court concluded\nthat where a class-action waiver is found in an arbitration\nagreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion, such\nwaivers \u201cshould not be enforced.\u201d Id., at 163, 113 P. 3d, at\n1110. In practice, the court explained, such agreements\n\u201coperate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise\nwould be imposed under California law.\u201d Id., at 161, 113\nP. 3d, at 1108, 1109. The court did not conclude that a\ncustomer would sign such an agreement only if under the\ninfluence of fraud, duress, or delusion.\n    The court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that the arbitration\nagreement was exculpatory reveals that the Discover Bank\nrule does not concern the making of the arbitration\nagreement. Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex\nample of contracts that will not be enforced because of\npublic policy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7\u00a785.1,\n85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003). Indeed, the court explained\nthat it would not enforce the agreements because they are\n\u201c \u2018against the policy of the law.\u2019 \u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113\nP. 3d, at 1108 (quoting Cal.

C. \u00a72.\n  Thus, insofar as we seek to implement Congress\u2019 intent,\nwe should think more than twice before invalidating a\nstate law that does just what \u00a72 requires, namely, puts\nagreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate \u201cupon\nthe same footing.\u201d\n                              III\n   The majority\u2019s contrary view (that Discover Bank stands\nas an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the accomplishment of the federal law\u2019s\nobjective, ante, at 9\u201318) rests primarily upon its claims\nthat the Discover Bank rule increases the complexity of\narbitration procedures, thereby discouraging parties from\nentering into arbitration agreements, and to that extent\ndiscriminating in practice against arbitration. These\nclaims are not well founded.\n   For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes\nset aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids\nclass arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule\nthat would require \u201cultimate disposition by a jury\u201d or\n\u201cjudicially monitored discovery\u201d or use of \u201cthe Federal\nRules of Evidence.\u201d Ante, at 8, 9. Unlike the majority\u2019s\nexamples, class arbitration is consistent with the use of\narbitration. It is a form of arbitration that is well known\nin California and followed elsewhere. See, e.g., Keating v.\nSuperior Ct., 167 Cal. Rptr. 481, 492 (App. 1980) (officially\ndepublished); American Arbitration Association (AAA),\nSupplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003),\nhttp://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=21936 (as visited Apr. 25,\n2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); JAMS,\nThe Resolution Experts, Class Action Procedures (2009).\nIndeed, the AAA has told us that it has found class ar\u00ad\nbitration to be \u201ca fair, balanced, and efficient means of\nresolving class disputes.\u201d Brief for AAA as Amicus Curiae\nin Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp., O. T.\n6            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n2009, No. 08\u20131198, p. 25 (hereinafter AAA Amicus Brief).\nAnd unlike the majority\u2019s examples, the Discover Bank\nrule imposes equivalent limitations on litigation; hence\nit cannot fairly be characterized as a targeted attack on\narbitration.\n   Where does the majority get its contrary idea\u2014that\nindividual, rather than class, arbitration is a \u201cfundamen\u00ad\ntal attribut[e]\u201d of arbitration? Ante, at 9. The majority\ndoes not explain. And it is unlikely to be able to trace its\npresent view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.\n   When Congress enacted the Act, arbitration procedures\nhad not yet been fully developed. Insofar as Congress\nconsidered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well\nhave thought that arbitration would be used primarily\nwhere merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact, not\nlaw, under the customs of their industries, where the\nparties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.\nSee Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 646 (Stevens, J., dissent\u00ad\ning); Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H. R. 646 before the\nSubcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th\nCong., 1st Sess., 15 (1924); Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214\nbefore a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the\nJudiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9\u201310 (1923); Dept. of\nCommerce, Secretary Hoover Favors Arbitration\u2014Press\nRelease (Dec. 28, 1925), Herbert Hoover Papers\u2014Articles,\nAddresses, and Public Statements File\u2014No. 536, p. 2\n(Herbert Hoover Presidential Library); Cohen & Dayton,\nThe New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L. Rev. 265, 281\n(1926); AAA, Year Book on Commercial Arbitration in the\nUnited States (1927). This last mentioned feature of the\nhistory\u2014roughly equivalent bargaining power\u2014suggests,\nif anything, that California\u2019s statute is consistent with,\nand indeed may help to further, the objectives that Con\u00ad\ngress had in mind.\n   Regardless, if neither the history nor present practice\nsuggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incom\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The majority compares\nthe complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral\narbitration. See ante, at 14. And it finds the former more\ncomplex. See ibid. But, if incentives are at issue, the\nrelevant comparison is not \u201carbitration with arbitration\u201d\nbut a comparison between class arbitration and judicial\nclass actions. After all, in respect to the relevant set of\ncontracts, the Discover Bank rule similarly and equally\nsets aside clauses that forbid class procedures\u2014whether\narbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are\nat issue.\n   Why would a typical defendant (say, a business) prefer a\njudicial class action to class arbitration? AAA statistics\n\u201csuggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time\nthan the average commercial arbitration, but may take\nless time than the average class action in court.\u201d AAA\nAmicus Brief 24 (emphasis added). Data from California\ncourts confirm that class arbitrations can take considera\u00ad\nbly less time than in-court proceedings in which class\ncertification is sought. Compare ante, at 14 (providing\nstatistics for class arbitration), with Judicial Council of\nCalifornia, Administrative Office of the Courts, Class\nCertification in California: Second Interim Report from\nthe Study of California Class Action Litigation 18 (2010)\n(providing statistics for class-action litigation in California\ncourts). And a single class proceeding is surely more\nefficient than thousands of separate proceedings for iden\u00ad\ntical claims. Thus, if speedy resolution of disputes were\nall that mattered, then the Discover Bank rule would\nreinforce, not obstruct, that objective of the Act.\n   The majority\u2019s related claim that the Discover Bank\nrule will discourage the use of arbitration because\n8            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201c[a]rbitration is poorly suited to . . . higher stakes\u201d lacks\nempirical support. Ante, at 16. Indeed, the majority\nprovides no convincing reason to believe that parties are\nunwilling to submit high-stake disputes to arbitration.\nAnd there are numerous counterexamples. Loftus, Rivals\nResolve Dispute Over Drug, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16,\n2011, p. B2 (discussing $500 million settlement in dispute\nsubmitted to arbitration); Ziobro, Kraft Seeks Arbitration\nIn Fight With Starbucks Over Distribution, Wall Street\nJournal, Nov. 30, 2010, p.

Times, Nov. 30,\n1988, p. A1 (describing both companies as \u201cpleased with\nthe ruling\u201d resolving a licensing dispute).\n   Further, even though contract defenses, e.g., duress and\nunconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution proc\u00ad\ness, federal arbitration law normally leaves such matters\nto the States. Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (arbitration agreements\n\u201cmay be invalidated by \u2018generally applicable contract\ndefenses\u2019 \u201d (quoting Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,\n517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996))). A provision in a contract of\nadhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide\nvery quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase\nthe speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the\nState can forbid it. See, e.g., Hayes v. Oakridge Home, 122\nOhio St. 3d 63, 67, 2009\u2013Ohio\u20132054, \u00b619, 908 N.

The Discover Bank rule\namounts to a variation on this theme. California is free to\ndefine unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law\nis of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

(THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (suggesting that, under certain circumstances,\nCalifornia might remain free to apply its unconscionability\ndoctrine).\n   Because California applies the same legal principles to\naddress the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers\nas it does to address the unconscionability of any other\ncontractual provision, the merits of class proceedings\nshould not factor into our decision. If California had\napplied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement,\nwould it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement\nwere efficient?\n   Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of\nclass arbitrations, as it sees them. See ante, at 15\u201316\n(referring to the \u201cgreatly increase[d] risks to defendants\u201d;\nthe \u201cchance of a devastating loss\u201d pressuring defendants\n\u201cinto settling questionable claims\u201d). But class proceedings\nhave countervailing advantages. In general agreements\nthat forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small\u00ad\ndollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to\nlitigate. I suspect that it is true even here, for as the\nCourt of Appeals recognized, AT&T can avoid the $7,500\npayout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concep\u00ad\ncions\u2019 arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim\u2019s\nface value, such that \u201cthe maximum gain to a customer for\nthe hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just\n$30.22.\u201d Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849,\n855, 856 (CA9 2009).\n   What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent\nthe Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees\nstemming from a $30.22 claim? See, e.g., Carnegie v.\nHousehold Int\u2019l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe\nrealistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million\nindividual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a luna\u00ad\ntic or a fanatic sues for $30\u201d). In California\u2019s perfectly\n10          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrational view, nonclass arbitration over such sums will\nalso sometimes have the effect of depriving claimants of\ntheir claims (say, for example, where claiming the $30.22\nwere to involve filling out many forms that require techni\u00ad\ncal legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call\nis placed on hold). Discover Bank sets forth circumstances\nin which the California courts believe that the terms of\nconsumer contracts can be manipulated to insulate an\nagreement\u2019s author from liability for its own frauds by\n\u201cdeliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out\nof individually small sums of money.\u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at\n162\u2013163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110. Why is this kind of deci\u00ad\nsion\u2014weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings\nalike\u2014not California\u2019s to make?\n   Finally, the majority can find no meaningful support for\nits views in this Court\u2019s precedent. The federal Act has\nbeen in force for nearly a century. We have decided doz\u00ad\nens of cases about its requirements. We have reached\nresults that authorize complex arbitration procedures.\nE.g., Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 629 (antitrust claims\narising in international transaction are arbitrable). We\nhave upheld nondiscriminatory state laws that slow down\narbitration proceedings. E.g., Volt Information Sciences,\n489 U. S., at 477\u2013479 (California law staying arbitration\nproceedings until completion of related litigation is not\npre-empted). But we have not, to my knowledge, applied\nthe Act to strike down a state statute that treats arbitra\u00ad\ntions on par with judicial and administrative proceedings.\nCf. Preston, 552 U. S., at 355\u2013356 (Act pre-empts state law\nthat vests primary jurisdiction in state administrative\nboard).\n   At the same time, we have repeatedly referred to the\nAct\u2019s basic objective as assuring that courts treat arbitra\u00ad\ntion agreements \u201clike all other contracts.\u201d Buckeye Check\nCashing, Inc. v.

But federalism is as much a question\nof deeds as words. It often takes the form of a concrete\ndecision by this Court that respects the legitimacy of a\nState\u2019s action in an individual case. Here, recognition of\nthat federalist ideal, embodied in specific language in this\nparticular statute, should lead us to uphold California\u2019s\nlaw, not to strike it down. We do not honor federalist\nprinciples in their breach.\n  With respect, I dissent.\n",

Argued November 9, 2010\u2014Decided April 27, 2011\nThe cellular telephone contract between respondents (Concepcions) and\n  petitioner (AT&T) provided for arbitration of all disputes, but did not\n  permit classwide arbitration. After the Concepcions were charged\n  sales tax on the retail value of phones provided free under their ser\n  vice contract, they sued AT&T in a California Federal District Court.\n  Their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging, inter alia,\n  that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging\n  sales tax on \u201cfree\u201d phones. The District Court denied AT&T\u2019s motion\n  to compel arbitration under the Concepcions\u2019 contract. Relying on\n  the California Supreme Court\u2019s Discover Bank decision, it found the\n  arbitration provision unconscionable because it disallowed classwide\n  proceedings. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the provision was uncon\n  scionable under California law and held that the Federal Arbitration\n  Act (FAA), which makes arbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable,\n  and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\n  for the revocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U.

Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687. Pp. 4\u2013\n    5.\n       (b) In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court held that class\n    waivers in consumer arbitration agreements are unconscionable if\n    the agreement is in an adhesion contract, disputes between the par\n    ties are likely to involve small amounts of damages, and the party\n    with inferior bargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to de\n    fraud. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (c) The Concepcions claim that the Discover Bank rule is a ground\n    that \u201cexist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d\n    under FAA \u00a72. When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a\n    particular type of claim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule. But\n    the inquiry is more complex when a generally applicable doctrine is\n    alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes\n    with arbitration. Although \u00a72\u2019s saving clause preserves generally\n    applicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to preserve\n    state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of\n    the FAA\u2019s objectives. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529\n    U. S. 861, 872. The FAA\u2019s overarching purpose is to ensure the en\n    forcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to\n    facilitate informal, streamlined proceedings. Parties may agree to\n    limit the issues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.\n    Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628, to arbitrate accord\n    ing to specific rules, Volt, supra, at 479, and to limit with whom they\n    will arbitrate, Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at ___. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       (d) Class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by Discover\n    Bank rather than consensual, interferes with fundamental attributes\n    of arbitration. The switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacri\n    fices arbitration\u2019s informality and makes the process slower, more\n    costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final\n    judgment. And class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen\n    dants. The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that\n    errors will go uncorrected. That risk of error may become unaccept\n    able when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are ag\n    gregated and decided at once. Arbitration is poorly suited to these\n    higher stakes. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification\n    decision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S.

S. C. \u00a72. We\nconsider whether the FAA prohibits States from condition-\ning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements on\nthe availability of classwide arbitration procedures.\n                              I\n  In February 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion entered\ninto an agreement for the sale and servicing of cellular\ntelephones with AT&T Mobility LCC (AT&T).1 The con-\ntract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the\nparties, but required that claims be brought in the parties\u2019\n\u201cindividual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member\nin any purported class or representative proceeding.\u201d App.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The  Concepcions\u2019 original contract was with Cingular Wireless.\nAT&T acquired Cingular in 2005 and renamed the company AT&T\nMobility in 2007. Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849, 852,\nn. 1 (CA9 2009).\n2              AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto Pet. for Cert 61a.2 The agreement authorized AT&T to\nmake unilateral amendments, which it did to the arbitra\ntion provision on several occasions. The version at issue in\nthis case reflects revisions made in December 2006, which\nthe parties agree are controlling.\n   The revised agreement provides that customers may\ninitiate dispute proceedings by completing a one-page No\ntice of Dispute form available on AT&T\u2019s Web site. AT&T\nmay then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if\nthe dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer\nmay invoke arbitration by filing a separate Demand for\nArbitration, also available on AT&T\u2019s Web site. In the\nevent the parties proceed to arbitration, the agreement\nspecifies that AT&T must pay all costs for nonfrivolous\nclaims; that arbitration must take place in the county in\nwhich the customer is billed; that, for claims of $10,000 or\nless, the customer may choose whether the arbitration\nproceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submis\nsions; that either party may bring a claim in small claims\ncourt in lieu of arbitration; and that the arbitrator may\naward any form of individual relief, including injunctions\nand presumably punitive damages. The agreement, more\nover, denies AT&T any ability to seek reimbursement of\nits attorney\u2019s fees, and, in the event that a customer re\nceives an arbitration award greater than AT&T\u2019s last\nwritten settlement offer, requires AT&T to pay a $7,500\nminimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s fees.3\n   The Concepcions purchased AT&T service, which was\nadvertised as including the provision of free phones; they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 That provision further states that \u201cthe arbitrator may not consoli\n\ndate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside\nover any form of a representative or class proceeding.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 61a.\n  3 The guaranteed minimum recovery was increased in 2009 to\n\n$10,000.

In\nMarch 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against\nAT&T in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California. The complaint was later consoli\ndated with a putative class action alleging, among other\nthings, that AT&T had engaged in false advertising and\nfraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.\n  In March 2008, AT&T moved to compel arbitration\nunder the terms of its contract with the Concepcions. The\nConcepcions opposed the motion, contending that the ar\nbitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully\nexculpatory under California law because it disallowed\nclasswide procedures. The District Court denied AT&T\u2019s\nmotion. It described AT&T\u2019s arbitration agreement fa\nvorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute\nresolution process was \u201cquick, easy to use\u201d and likely to\n\u201cpromp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer\nwithout the need to arbitrate or litigate\u201d; that the $7,500\npremium functioned as \u201ca substantial inducement for the\nconsumer to pursue the claim in arbitration\u201d if a dispute\nwas not resolved informally; and that consumers who were\nmembers of a class would likely be worse off.

In response to AT&T\u2019s argument that the Con\ncepcions\u2019 interpretation of California law discriminated\nagainst arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the conten\ntion that \u201c \u2018class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and\nexpeditiousness of arbitration\u2019 \u201d and noted that \u201c \u2018Discover\nBank placed arbitration agreements with class action\nwaivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar\nclass action litigation outside the context of arbitration.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 858 (quoting Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless\nServices, Inc., 498 F. 3d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)).\n   We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  The FAA was enacted in 1925 in response to widespread\njudicial hostility to arbitration agreements. See Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,\n581 (2008). Section 2, the \u201cprimary substantive provision\nof the Act,\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury\nConstr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983), provides, in relevant\npart, as follows:\n       \u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or\n    a contract evidencing a transaction involving com\n    merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\n    arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be\n    valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such\n    grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\n    of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72.\nWe have described this provision as reflecting both a\n\u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration,\u201d Moses H.\nCone, supra, at 24, and the \u201cfundamental principle that\narbitration is a matter of contract,\u201d Rent-A-Center, West,\nInc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____ , ____ (2010) (slip op., at 3).\nIn line with these principles, courts must place arbitration\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. 468, 478 (1989).\n   The final phrase of \u00a72, however, permits arbitration\nagreements to be declared unenforceable \u201cupon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of\nany contract.\u201d This saving clause permits agreements to\narbitrate to be invalidated by \u201cgenerally applicable con\ntract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionabil\nity,\u201d but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or\nthat derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement\nto arbitrate is at issue. Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v.\nCasarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996); see also Perry v.\nThomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492\u2013493, n. 9 (1987). The question\nin this case is whether \u00a72 preempts California\u2019s rule clas\nsifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer\ncontracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as the\nDiscover Bank rule.\n   Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any\ncontract found \u201cto have been unconscionable at the time it\nwas made,\u201d or may \u201climit the application of any uncon\nscionable clause.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71670.5(a) (West\n1985). A finding of unconscionability requires \u201ca \u2018proce\ndural\u2019 and a \u2018substantive\u2019 element, the former focusing on\n\u2018oppression\u2019 or \u2018surprise\u2019 due to unequal bargaining power,\nthe latter on \u2018overly harsh\u2019 or \u2018one-sided\u2019 results.\u201d Armen\ndariz v. Foundation Health Pyschcare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal.\n4th 83, 114, 6 P. 3d 669, 690 (2000); accord, Discover\nBank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 159\u2013161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108.\n   In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court applied\nthis framework to class-action waivers in arbitration\nagreements and held as follows:\n    \u201c[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of\n6           AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the\n    contracting parties predictably involve small amounts\n    of damages, and when it is alleged that the party\n    with the superior bargaining power has carried out a\n    scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of con\n    sumers out of individually small sums of money, then\n    . . . the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of\n    the party \u2018from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or\n    willful injury to the person or property of another.\u2019\n    Under these circumstances, such waivers are uncon\n    scionable under California law and should not be en\n    forced.\u201d Id., at 162, 113 P. 3d, at 1110 (quoting Cal.\n    Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71668).\nCalifornia courts have frequently applied this rule to find\narbitration agreements unconscionable.

Moreover, they argue that even if\nwe construe the Discover Bank rule as a prohibition on\ncollective-action waivers rather than simply an application\nof unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to\nall dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits\nwaivers of class litigation as well.

S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nparticular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward:\nThe conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. Preston v.\nFerrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353 (2008). But the inquiry becomes\nmore complex when a doctrine normally thought to be\ngenerally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here,\nunconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a\nfashion that disfavors arbitration. In Perry v. Thomas,\n482 U. S. 483 (1987), for example, we noted that the FAA\u2019s\npreemptive effect might extend even to grounds tradition\nally thought to exist \u201c \u2018at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 492, n. 9 (emphasis deleted). We\nsaid that a court may not \u201crely on the uniqueness of an\nagreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding\nthat enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would\nenable the court to effect what . . . the state legislature\ncannot.\u201d Id., at 493, n. 9.\n   An obvious illustration of this point would be a case\nfinding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public\npolicy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to pro\nvide for judicially monitored discovery. The rationaliza\ntions for such a holding are neither difficult to imagine nor\ndifferent in kind from those articulated in Discover Bank.\nA court might reason that no consumer would knowingly\nwaive his right to full discovery, as this would enable\ncompanies to hide their wrongdoing. Or the court might\nsimply say that such agreements are exculpatory\u2014re\nstricting discovery would be of greater benefit to the\ncompany than the consumer, since the former is more\nlikely to be sued than to sue. See Discover Bank, supra, at\n161, 113 P. 3d, at 1109 (arguing that class waivers are\nsimilarly one-sided). And, the reasoning would continue,\nbecause such a rule applies the general principle of uncon\nscionability or public-policy disapproval of exculpatory\nagreements, it is applicable to \u201cany\u201d contract and thus\npreserved by \u00a72 of the FAA. In practice, of course, the rule\nwould have a disproportionate impact on arbitration\n8                  AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\nagreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts\npurporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.\n  Other examples are easy to imagine. The same argu-\nment might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable\narbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal\nRules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition\nby a jury (perhaps termed \u201ca panel of twelve lay arbitra-\ntors\u201d to help avoid preemption). Such examples are not\nfanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration\nthat prompted the FAA had manifested itself in \u201ca great\nvariety\u201d of \u201cdevices and formulas\u201d declaring arbitration\nagainst public policy. Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire\nFabrics, Inc., 271 F. 2d 402, 406 (CA2 1959). And al-\nthough these statistics are not definitive, it is worth not-\ning that California\u2019s courts have been more likely to hold\ncontracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.\nBroome, An Unconscionable Application of the Uncon-\nscionability Doctrine: How the California Courts are Cir-\ncumventing the Federal Arbitration Act, 3 Hastings Bus.\nL.

Although \u00a72\u2019s saving clause preserves\ngenerally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it sug\ngests an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as\nan obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s objectives.\nCf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 872\n(2000); Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530\nU. S. 363, 372\u2013373 (2000). As we have said, a federal\nstatute\u2019s saving clause \u201c \u2018cannot in reason be construed as\n[allowing] a common law right, the continued existence of\nwhich would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions\nof the act. In other words, the act cannot be held to\ndestroy itself.\u2019 \u201d American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.\nCentral Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U.

S. 426, 446 (1907)).\n   We differ with the Concepcions only in the application of\nthis analysis to the matter before us. We do not agree that\nrules requiring judicially monitored discovery or adher\nence to the Federal Rules of Evidence are \u201ca far cry from\nthis case.\u201d Brief for Respondents 32. The overarching\npurpose of the FAA, evident in the text of \u00a7\u00a72, 3, and 4,\nis to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements\naccording to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined\nproceedings. Requiring the availability of classwide arbi\ntration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitra\ntion and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.\n                            B\n  The \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of the FAA is to \u201censur[e] that\nprivate arbitration agreements are enforced according to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsion. It says that to its knowledge \u201cwe have not . . . applied the Act to\nstrike down a state statute that treats arbitrations on par with judicial\nand administrative proceedings,\u201d post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and\nthat \u201cwe should think more than twice before invalidating a state law\nthat . . . puts agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate \u2018upon\nthe same footing\u2019 \u201d post, at 4\u20135.\n10          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v.

S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 17). This purpose is readily apparent from the\nFAA\u2019s text. Section 2 makes arbitration agreements\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d as written (subject, of\ncourse, to the saving clause); \u00a73 requires courts to stay\nlitigation of arbitral claims pending arbitration of those\nclaims \u201cin accordance with the terms of the agreement\u201d;\nand \u00a74 requires courts to compel arbitration \u201cin accor\ndance with the terms of the agreement\u201d upon the motion of\neither party to the agreement (assuming that the \u201cmaking\nof the arbitration agreement or the failure . . . to perform\nthe same\u201d is not at issue). In light of these provisions,\nwe have held that parties may agree to limit the issues\nsubject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.

It can be speci\nfied, for example, that the decisionmaker be a specialist in\nthe relevant field, or that proceedings be kept confidential\nto protect trade secrets. And the informality of arbitral\nproceedings is itself desirable, reducing the cost and in\ncreasing the speed of dispute resolution. 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

Far from it . . . .\u201d\nId., at 220. It then quotes a House Report saying that\n\u201cthe costliness and delays of litigation . . . can be largely\neliminated by agreements for arbitration.\u201d Ibid. (quoting\nH. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924)). The\nconcluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins\nas follows:\n      \u201cWe therefore are not persuaded by the argument\n    that the conflict between two goals of the Arbitration\n    Act\u2014enforcement of private agreements and encour\n    agement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution\u2014\n    must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to real\n    ize the intent of the drafters.\u201d 470 U. S., at 221.\nIn the present case, of course, those \u201ctwo goals\u201d do not\nconflict\u2014and it is the dissent\u2019s view that would frustrate\nboth of them.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, our cases place it beyond\ndispute that the FAA was designed to promote arbitration.\nThey have repeatedly described the Act as \u201cembod[ying]\n[a] national policy favoring arbitration,\u201d Buckeye Check\nCashing, 546 U. S., at 443, and \u201ca liberal federal policy\nfavoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any\nstate substantive or procedural policies to the contrary,\u201d\nMoses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 24; see also Hall Street As\nsocs., 552 U. S., at 581. Thus, in Preston v. Ferrer, holding\npreempted a state-law rule requiring exhaustion of admin\nistrative remedies before arbitration, we said: \u201cA prime\nobjective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve\n\u2018streamlined proceedings and expeditious results,\u2019 \u201d which\nobjective would be \u201cfrustrated\u201d by requiring a dispute to be\nheard by an agency first. 552 U. S., at 357\u2013358. That\n12             AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrule, we said, would \u201cat the least, hinder speedy resolution\nof the controversy.\u201d Id., at 358.5\n   California\u2019s Discover Bank rule similarly interferes with\narbitration. Although the rule does not require classwide\narbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to\ndemand it ex post. The rule is limited to adhesion con\ntracts, Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 162\u2013163, 113 P. 3d,\nat 1110, but the times in which consumer contracts were\nanything other than adhesive are long past.6 Carbajal v.\nH&R Block Tax Servs., Inc., 372 F. 3d 903, 906 (CA7\n2004); see also Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F. 3d 1147,\n1149 (CA7 1997). The rule also requires that damages be\npredictably small, and that the consumer allege a scheme\nto cheat consumers. Discover Bank, supra, at 162\u2013163,\n113 P. 3d, at 1110. The former requirement, however, is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Relying  upon nothing more indicative of congressional understand\ning than statements of witnesses in committee hearings and a press\nrelease of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the dissent suggests\nthat Congress \u201cthought that arbitration would be used primarily where\nmerchants sought to resolve disputes of fact . . . [and] possessed roughly\nequivalent bargaining power.\u201d Post, at 6. Such a limitation appears\nnowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our\ncases. \u201cRelationships between securities dealers and investors, for\nexample, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] never\ntheless held . . . that agreements to arbitrate in that context are en\nforceable.\u201d Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 33\n(1991); see also id., at 32\u201333 (allowing arbitration of claims arising\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 despite\nallegations of unequal bargaining power between employers and\nemployees). Of course the dissent\u2019s disquisition on legislative history\nfails to note that it contains nothing\u2014not even the testimony of a stray\nwitness in committee hearings\u2014that contemplates the existence of\nclass arbitration.\n  6 Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns\n\nthat attend contracts of adhesion\u2014for example, requiring class-action\nwaiver provisions in adhesive arbitration agreements to be highlighted.\nSuch steps cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its\npurpose to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced\naccording to their terms.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntoothless and malleable (the Ninth Circuit has held that\ndamages of $4,000 are sufficiently small, see Oestreicher v.\nAlienware Corp., 322 Fed. Appx. 489, 492 (2009) (unpub\nlished)), and the latter has no limiting effect, as all that is\nrequired is an allegation. Consumers remain free to bring\nand resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under Dis\ncover Bank, and some may well do so; but there is little\nincentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals\nwhen they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in\nthe process. And faced with inevitable class arbitration,\ncompanies would have less incentive to continue resolving\npotentially duplicative claims on an individual basis.\n   Although we have had little occasion to examine class\nwide arbitration, our decision in Stolt-Nielsen is instruc\ntive. In that case we held that an arbitration panel ex\nceeded its power under \u00a710(a)(4) of the FAA by imposing\nclass procedures based on policy judgments rather than\nthe arbitration agreement itself or some background prin\nciple of contract law that would affect its interpretation.\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\u201323). We then held that\nthe agreement at issue, which was silent on the question\nof class procedures, could not be interpreted to allow them\nbecause the \u201cchanges brought about by the shift from\nbilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration\u201d are \u201cfun\ndamental.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22). This is obvious as a\nstructural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent\nparties, necessitating additional and different procedures\nand involving higher stakes. Confidentiality becomes\nmore difficult. And while it is theoretically possible to\nselect an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the\nclass-certification question, arbitrators are not generally\nknowledgeable in the often-dominant procedural aspects of\ncertification, such as the protection of absent parties. The\nconclusion follows that class arbitration, to the extent it is\nmanufactured by Discover Bank rather than consensual,\nis inconsistent with the FAA.\n14            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the switch from bilateral to class arbitration\nsacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration\u2014its in\nformality\u2014and makes the process slower, more costly, and\nmore likely to generate procedural morass than final\njudgment. \u201cIn bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the\nprocedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in\norder to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution:\nlower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to\nchoose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.\u201d\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21). But before an arbitrator\nmay decide the merits of a claim in classwide procedures,\nhe must first decide, for example, whether the class itself\nmay be certified, whether the named parties are suffi\nciently representative and typical, and how discovery for\nthe class should be conducted. A cursory comparison of\nbilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference.\nAccording to the American Arbitration Association (AAA),\nthe average consumer arbitration between January and\nAugust 2007 resulted in a disposition on the merits in\nsix months, four months if the arbitration was conducted\nby documents only. AAA, Analysis of the AAA\u2019s Con\nsumer Arbitration Caseload, online at http://www.adr.org/\nsi.asp?id=5027 (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 25,\n2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). As of\nSeptember 2009, the AAA had opened 283 class arbitra\ntions. Of those, 121 remained active, and 162 had been\nsettled, withdrawn, or dismissed. Not a single one, how\never, had resulted in a final award on the merits. Brief for\nAAA as Amicus Curiae in Stolt-Nielsen, O. T. 2009, No.\n08\u20131198, pp. 22\u201324. For those cases that were no longer\nactive, the median time from filing to settlement, with\ndrawal, or dismissal\u2014not judgment on the merits\u2014was\n583 days, and the mean was 630 days.

Com\npare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations\n(effective Oct. 8, 2003), online at http://www.adr.org/\nsp.asp?id=21936, with Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23. And while\nparties can alter those procedures by contract, an alterna\ntive is not obvious. If procedures are too informal, absent\nclass members would not be bound by the arbitration. For\na class-action money judgment to bind absentees in litiga\ntion, class representatives must at all times adequately\nrepresent absent class members, and absent members\nmust be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and\na right to opt out of the class. Phillips Petroleum Co. v.\nShutts, 472 U. S. 797, 811\u2013812 (1985). At least this\namount of process would presumably be required for ab\nsent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.\n   We find it unlikely that in passing the FAA Congress\nmeant to leave the disposition of these procedural re\nquirements to an arbitrator. Indeed, class arbitration was\nnot even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA\nin 1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in\nDiscover Bank, class arbitration is a \u201crelatively recent\ndevelopment.\u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at 163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110.\nAnd it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator\nwould be entrusted with ensuring that third parties\u2019 due\nprocess rights are satisfied.\n   Third, class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen\ndants. Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The\nabsence of multilayered review makes it more likely that\nerrors will go uncorrected. Defendants are willing to\naccept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntrating a class is more desirable than litigating one, however, is not\n\nrelevant. A State cannot defend a rule requiring arbitration-by-jury by\n\nsaying that parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury. \n\n16           AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpact is limited to the size of individual disputes, and\npresumably outweighed by savings from avoiding the\ncourts. But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thou\nsands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at\nonce, the risk of an error will often become unacceptable.\nFaced with even a small chance of a devastating loss,\ndefendants will be pressured into settling questionable\nclaims. Other courts have noted the risk of \u201cin terrorem\u201d\nsettlements that class actions entail, see, e.g., Kohen v.\nPacific Inv. Management Co. LLC, 571 F. 3d 672, 677\u2013678\n(CA7 2009), and class arbitration would be no different.\n   Arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class\nlitigation. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certifi\ncation decision on an interlocutory basis and, if unsuccess\nful, may appeal from a final judgment as well. Questions\nof law are reviewed de novo and questions of fact for clear\nerror. In contrast, 9 U. S. C. \u00a710 allows a court to vacate\nan arbitral award only where the award \u201cwas procured by\ncorruption, fraud, or undue means\u201d; \u201cthere was evident\npartiality or corruption in the arbitrators\u201d; \u201cthe arbitrators\nwere guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the\nhearing . . . or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and\nmaterial to the controversy[,] or of any other misbehavior\nby which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d; or\nif the \u201carbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\nexecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award . . .\nwas not made.\u201d The AAA rules do authorize judicial re\nview of certification decisions, but this review is unlikely\nto have much effect given these limitations; review un\nder \u00a710 focuses on misconduct rather than mistake. And\nparties may not contractually expand the grounds or\nnature of judicial review. Hall Street Assocs., 552 U. S., at\n578.

But the\nsame could be said about procedures that the Concepcions\nadmit States may not superimpose on arbitration: Parties\ncould agree to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, or pursuant to a discovery process rival\ning that in litigation. Arbitration is a matter of contract,\nand the FAA requires courts to honor parties\u2019 expecta\ntions. Rent-A-Center, West, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). But what the parties in the aforementioned examples\nwould have agreed to is not arbitration as envisioned by\nthe FAA, lacks its benefits, and therefore may not be\nrequired by state law.\n   The dissent claims that class proceedings are necessary\nto prosecute small-dollar claims that might otherwise slip\nthrough the legal system. See post, at 9. But States can\nnot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA,\neven if it is desirable for unrelated reasons. Moreover, the\nclaim here was most unlikely to go unresolved. As noted\nearlier, the arbitration agreement provides that AT&T\nwill pay claimants a minimum of $7,500 and twice their\nattorney\u2019s fees if they obtain an arbitration award greater\nthan AT&T\u2019s last settlement offer. The District Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent cites three large arbitration awards (none of which\n\nstems from classwide arbitration) as evidence that parties are willing to\nsubmit large claims before an arbitrator. Post, at 7\u20138. Those examples\nmight be in point if it could be established that the size of the arbitral\ndispute was predictable when the arbitration agreement was entered.\nOtherwise, all the cases prove is that arbitrators can give huge\nawards\u2014which we have never doubted. The point is that in class\naction arbitration huge awards (with limited judicial review) will be\nentirely predictable, thus rendering arbitration unattractive. It is not\nreasonably deniable that requiring consumer disputes to be arbitrated\non a classwide basis will have a substantial deterrent effect on incen\ntives to arbitrate.\n18          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfound this scheme sufficient to provide incentive for the\nindividual prosecution of meritorious claims that are not\nimmediately settled, and the Ninth Circuit admitted that\naggrieved customers who filed claims would be \u201cessen\ntially guarantee[d]\u201d to be made whole, 584 F. 3d, at 856, n.\n9. Indeed, the District Court concluded that the Concep\ncions were better off under their arbitration agreement\nwith AT&T than they would have been as participants in\na class action, which \u201ccould take months, if not years,\nand which may merely yield an opportunity to submit a\nclaim for recovery of a small percentage of a few dollars.\u201d\nLaster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5216255</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12.\n                       *     *     *\n  Because it \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Con\ngress,\u201d Hines v.

As I would read it, the FAA requires\nthat an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party\nsuccessfully challenges the formation of the arbitration\n2            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v.

Under this reading, I would reverse the Court of\nAppeals because a district court cannot follow both the\nFAA and the Discover Bank rule, which does not relate to\ndefects in the making of an agreement.\n   This reading of the text, however, has not been fully\ndeveloped by any party, cf. Brief for Petitioner 41, n. 12,\nand could benefit from briefing and argument in an ap\npropriate case. Moreover, I think that the Court\u2019s test will\noften lead to the same outcome as my textual interpreta\ntion and that, when possible, it is important in interpret\ning statutes to give lower courts guidance from a majority\nof the Court. See US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535\nU. S. 391, 411 (2002) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Therefore,\nalthough I adhere to my views on purposes-and-objectives\npre-emption, see Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, ___ (2009)\n(opinion concurring in judgment), I reluctantly join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion.\n                                I\n   The FAA generally requires courts to enforce arbitration\nagreements as written. Section 2 provides that \u201c[a] writ\nten provision in . . . a contract . . . to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . .\nshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d Significantly, the statute does not paral\nlel the words \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d by refer\nencing the grounds as exist for the \u201cinvalidation, revoca\ntion, or nonenforcement\u201d of any contract. Nor does the\nstatute use a different word or phrase entirely that might\narguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce\nability. The use of only \u201crevocation\u201d and the conspicuous\nomission of \u201cinvalidation\u201d and \u201cnonenforcement\u201d suggest\nthat the exception does not include all defenses applicable\nto any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. 167, 174 (2001) (\u201cIt is our\nduty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of\na statute\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the\none hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is\nnot obvious. The statute does not define the terms, and\ntheir ordinary meanings arguably overlap. Indeed, this\nCourt and others have referred to the concepts of revoca\nbility, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But\nthis ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress\u2019\nclear decision in \u00a72 to repeat only one of the three\nconcepts.\n  To clarify the meaning of \u00a72, it would be natural to look\nto other portions of the FAA. Statutory interpretation\nfocuses on \u201cthe language itself, the specific context in\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of\nthe statute as a whole.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU.

When a party seeks to enforce an\narbitration agreement in federal court, \u00a74 requires that\n\u201cupon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for\narbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in\nissue,\u201d the court must order arbitration \u201cin accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement.\u201d\n  Reading \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 harmoniously, the \u201cgrounds . . . for\nthe revocation\u201d preserved in \u00a72 would mean grounds re\nlated to the making of the agreement.

See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\nMfg. Co., 388 U.

Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).\n   The statement in Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.

This statement is found in a\nfootnote concerning a claim that the Court \u201cdecline[d] to address.\u201d Id.,\nat 392, n. 9. Similarly, to the extent that statements in Rent-A-Center,\nWest, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n. 1),\ncan be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses\nunder \u00a72, those statements are dicta, as well. This Court has never\naddressed the question whether the state-law \u201cgrounds\u201d referred to in\n\u00a72 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.\n   Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has ac\nknowledged is applicable under \u00a72 relates to contract formation. In\nDoctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.

Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex\nample of contracts that will not be enforced because of\npublic policy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts \u00a7\u00a785.1,\n85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003).

Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.\nByrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219 (1985). We have described that\npurpose as one of \u201censur[ing] judicial enforcement\u201d of\narbitration agreements.

S. 506, 511 (1974)\n(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96, at 2; emphasis added).\n   Congress was fully aware that arbitration could provide\nprocedural and cost advantages. The House Report em\u00ad\nphasized the \u201cappropriate[ness]\u201d of making arbitration\nagreements enforceable \u201cat this time when there is so\nmuch agitation against the costliness and delays of litiga\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Id., at 2. And this Court has acknowledged that\nparties may enter into arbitration agreements in order to\nexpedite the resolution of disputes. See Preston v. Ferrer,\n552 U. S. 346, 357 (2008) (discussing \u201cprime objective of\nan agreement to arbitrate\u201d). See also Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628\n(1985).\n   But we have also cautioned against thinking that Con\u00ad\ngress\u2019 primary objective was to guarantee these particular\nprocedural advantages. Rather, that primary objective\nwas to secure the \u201cenforcement\u201d of agreements to arbi\u00ad\ntrate. Dean Witter, 470 U. S., at 221. See also id., at 219\n(we \u201creject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the\nArbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution\nof claims\u201d); id., at 219, 217\u2013218 (\u201c[T]he intent of Congress\u201d\nrequires us to apply the terms of the Act without regard\nto whether the result would be \u201cpossibly inefficient\u201d); cf.\nid., at 220 (acknowledging that \u201cexpedited resolution of\ndisputes\u201d might lead parties to prefer arbitration).

C. \u00a72.\n  Thus, insofar as we seek to implement Congress\u2019 intent,\nwe should think more than twice before invalidating a\nstate law that does just what \u00a72 requires, namely, puts\nagreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate \u201cupon\nthe same footing.\u201d\n                              III\n   The majority\u2019s contrary view (that Discover Bank stands\nas an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the accomplishment of the federal law\u2019s\nobjective, ante, at 9\u201318) rests primarily upon its claims\nthat the Discover Bank rule increases the complexity of\narbitration procedures, thereby discouraging parties from\nentering into arbitration agreements, and to that extent\ndiscriminating in practice against arbitration. These\nclaims are not well founded.\n   For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes\nset aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids\nclass arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule\nthat would require \u201cultimate disposition by a jury\u201d or\n\u201cjudicially monitored discovery\u201d or use of \u201cthe Federal\nRules of Evidence.\u201d Ante, at 8, 9.

Ante, at 9. The majority\ndoes not explain. And it is unlikely to be able to trace its\npresent view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.\n   When Congress enacted the Act, arbitration procedures\nhad not yet been fully developed. Insofar as Congress\nconsidered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well\nhave thought that arbitration would be used primarily\nwhere merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact, not\nlaw, under the customs of their industries, where the\nparties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.\nSee Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 646 (Stevens, J., dissent\u00ad\ning); Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H.

The majority compares\nthe complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral\narbitration. See ante, at 14. And it finds the former more\ncomplex. See ibid. But, if incentives are at issue, the\nrelevant comparison is not \u201carbitration with arbitration\u201d\nbut a comparison between class arbitration and judicial\nclass actions. After all, in respect to the relevant set of\ncontracts, the Discover Bank rule similarly and equally\nsets aside clauses that forbid class procedures\u2014whether\narbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are\nat issue.\n   Why would a typical defendant (say, a business) prefer a\njudicial class action to class arbitration? AAA statistics\n\u201csuggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time\nthan the average commercial arbitration, but may take\nless time than the average class action in court.\u201d AAA\nAmicus Brief 24 (emphasis added). Data from California\ncourts confirm that class arbitrations can take considera\u00ad\nbly less time than in-court proceedings in which class\ncertification is sought. Compare ante, at 14 (providing\nstatistics for class arbitration), with Judicial Council of\nCalifornia, Administrative Office of the Courts, Class\nCertification in California: Second Interim Report from\nthe Study of California Class Action Litigation 18 (2010)\n(providing statistics for class-action litigation in California\ncourts). And a single class proceeding is surely more\nefficient than thousands of separate proceedings for iden\u00ad\ntical claims. Thus, if speedy resolution of disputes were\nall that mattered, then the Discover Bank rule would\nreinforce, not obstruct, that objective of the Act.\n   The majority\u2019s related claim that the Discover Bank\nrule will discourage the use of arbitration because\n8            AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201c[a]rbitration is poorly suited to . . . higher stakes\u201d lacks\nempirical support. Ante, at 16. Indeed, the majority\nprovides no convincing reason to believe that parties are\nunwilling to submit high-stake disputes to arbitration.\nAnd there are numerous counterexamples. Loftus, Rivals\nResolve Dispute Over Drug, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16,\n2011, p. B2 (discussing $500 million settlement in dispute\nsubmitted to arbitration); Ziobro, Kraft Seeks Arbitration\nIn Fight With Starbucks Over Distribution, Wall Street\nJournal, Nov. 30, 2010, p. B10 (describing initiation of an\narbitration in which the payout \u201ccould be higher\u201d than\n$1.5 billion); Markoff, Software Arbitration Ruling Gives\nI.B.M. $833 Million From Fujitsu, N. Y. Times, Nov. 30,\n1988, p. A1 (describing both companies as \u201cpleased with\nthe ruling\u201d resolving a licensing dispute).\n   Further, even though contract defenses, e.g., duress and\nunconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution proc\u00ad\ness, federal arbitration law normally leaves such matters\nto the States. Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (arbitration agreements\n\u201cmay be invalidated by \u2018generally applicable contract\ndefenses\u2019 \u201d (quoting Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,\n517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996))). A provision in a contract of\nadhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide\nvery quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase\nthe speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the\nState can forbid it. See, e.g., Hayes v. Oakridge Home, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2692037\"><a href=\"/opinion/2692037/hayes-v-oakridge-home/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67, 2009\u2013Ohio\u20132054, \u00b619, 908 N.

The Discover Bank rule\namounts to a variation on this theme. California is free to\ndefine unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law\nis of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

(THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (suggesting that, under certain circumstances,\nCalifornia might remain free to apply its unconscionability\ndoctrine).\n   Because California applies the same legal principles to\naddress the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers\nas it does to address the unconscionability of any other\ncontractual provision, the merits of class proceedings\nshould not factor into our decision. If California had\napplied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement,\nwould it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement\nwere efficient?\n   Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of\nclass arbitrations, as it sees them. See ante, at 15\u201316\n(referring to the \u201cgreatly increase[d] risks to defendants\u201d;\nthe \u201cchance of a devastating loss\u201d pressuring defendants\n\u201cinto settling questionable claims\u201d). But class proceedings\nhave countervailing advantages. In general agreements\nthat forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small\u00ad\ndollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to\nlitigate. I suspect that it is true even here, for as the\nCourt of Appeals recognized, AT&T can avoid the $7,500\npayout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concep\u00ad\ncions\u2019 arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim\u2019s\nface value, such that \u201cthe maximum gain to a customer for\nthe hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just\n$30.22.\u201d Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849,\n855, 856 (CA9 2009).\n   What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent\nthe Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees\nstemming from a $30.22 claim? See, e.g., Carnegie v.\nHousehold Int\u2019l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe\nrealistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million\nindividual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a luna\u00ad\ntic or a fanatic sues for $30\u201d). In California\u2019s perfectly\n10          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrational view, nonclass arbitration over such sums will\nalso sometimes have the effect of depriving claimants of\ntheir claims (say, for example, where claiming the $30.22\nwere to involve filling out many forms that require techni\u00ad\ncal legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call\nis placed on hold). Discover Bank sets forth circumstances\nin which the California courts believe that the terms of\nconsumer contracts can be manipulated to insulate an\nagreement\u2019s author from liability for its own frauds by\n\u201cdeliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out\nof individually small sums of money.\u201d 36 Cal. 4th, at\n162\u2013163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110. Why is this kind of deci\u00ad\nsion\u2014weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings\nalike\u2014not California\u2019s to make?\n   Finally, the majority can find no meaningful support for\nits views in this Court\u2019s precedent. The federal Act has\nbeen in force for nearly a century. We have decided doz\u00ad\nens of cases about its requirements. We have reached\nresults that authorize complex arbitration procedures.\nE.g., Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 629 (antitrust claims\narising in international transaction are arbitrable). We\nhave upheld nondiscriminatory state laws that slow down\narbitration proceedings. E.g., Volt Information Sciences,\n489 U. S., at 477\u2013479 (California law staying arbitration\nproceedings until completion of related litigation is not\npre-empted). But we have not, to my knowledge, applied\nthe Act to strike down a state statute that treats arbitra\u00ad\ntions on par with judicial and administrative proceedings.\nCf. Preston, 552 U. S., at 355\u2013356 (Act pre-empts state law\nthat vests primary jurisdiction in state administrative\nboard).\n   At the same time, we have repeatedly referred to the\nAct\u2019s basic objective as assuring that courts treat arbitra\u00ad\ntion agreements \u201clike all other contracts.\u201d Buckeye Check\nCashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 447 (2006). See\nalso, e.g., Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

(\u201cCourts are not at liberty to shirk the process\nof [contractual] construction under the empire of a belief\nthat arbitration is beneficent any more than they may\nshirk it if their belief happens to be the contrary\u201d); Cohen\n& Dayton, 12 Va. L. Rev., at 276 (the Act \u201cis no infringe\u00ad\nment upon the right of each State to decide for itself what\ncontracts shall or shall not exist under its laws\u201d).\n   These cases do not concern the merits and demerits of\nclass actions; they concern equal treatment of arbitration\ncontracts and other contracts. Since it is the latter ques\u00ad\ntion that is at issue here, I am not surprised that the\nmajority can find no meaningful precedent supporting its\ndecision.\n                            IV\n  By using the words \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at\nlaw or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress retained for the States an important role incident to\nagreements to arbitrate. 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. Through those\nwords Congress reiterated a basic federal idea that has\nlong informed the nature of this Nation\u2019s laws. We have\noften expressed this idea in opinions that set forth pre\u00ad\nsumptions. See, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S.\n470, 485 (1996) (\u201c[B]ecause the States are independent\n12          AT&T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsovereigns in our federal system, we have long presumed\nthat Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law\ncauses of action\u201d). But federalism is as much a question\nof deeds as words. It often takes the form of a concrete\ndecision by this Court that respects the legitimacy of a\nState\u2019s action in an individual case. Here, recognition of\nthat federalist ideal, embodied in specific language in this\nparticular statute, should lead us to uphold California\u2019s\nlaw, not to strike it down. We do not honor federalist\nprinciples in their breach.\n  With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
