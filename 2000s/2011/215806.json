Decided May 2, 2011 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two\ncounts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted\nmurder. He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part\nof the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of\nMitts\u2019s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as\nfollows:\n    \u201c[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt\n    whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts]\n    was found guilty of committing in the separate counts,\n    are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you\n    find are present in this case.\n       \u201cWhen all 12 members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has\n    been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors, if any, then you must return such finding\n    to the Court.\n       \u201cI instruct you as a matter of law that if you make\n    such a finding, then you must recommend to the\n    Court that the sentence of death be imposed on\n    [Mitts].\n         .           .          .           .           .\n       \u201cOn the other hand, [if] after considering all the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and tes\n    timony received at this hearing and the arguments of\n    counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove\n2                      BOBBY v.

Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 7). See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F. 3d 650, 652\n(CA6 2010) (noting that the \u201cinstructions in this case are\nthe same Ohio instructions that were given in\u201d Spisak).\nThat case, like this one, involved review of a federal ha\nbeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as rele\nvant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state\ncourt adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was con\ntrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1).\n   In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that\nhad found these instructions invalid under our decision in\nMills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). See 558 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). Up until our decision in Spisak,\nMitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions\nwere invalid under Mills. After Spisak rejected that\nclaim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that\nthe instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v.\nAlabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated\nMitts\u2019s death sentence. See 620 F. 3d, at 658.\n   In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed \u201cwhen the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d\n447 U.

Id., at 632, 642, 637. Be\ncause the scheme in Beck created a danger that the jury\nwould resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we con\ncluded that it violated due process. See id., at 638, 643.\n   According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty\nphase instructions given at Mitts\u2019s trial\u2014and the Supreme\nCourt of Ohio decision upholding their use\u2014were \u201ccon\ntrary to\u201d Beck, because they \u201cinterposed before the jury\nthe same false choice\u201d that our holding in Beck prohibits.\n620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nReferring to the instructions as \u201cacquittal-first,\u201d the Court\nof Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the\njury to first decide whether to \u201cacquit\u201d Mitts of the death\npenalty before considering \u201cmercy and some form of life\nimprisonment.\u201d Id., at 656\u2013657. Interpreting Beck to\nstand for the proposition that \u201ca jury instruction violates\ndue process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sen\ntence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the\njury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the instructions given\nduring the penalty phase of Mitts\u2019s trial unconstitutionally\n\u201cdeprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to con\nsider\u201d a life sentence. 620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The instructions here are surely not invalid under our\n4                     BOBBY v. MITTS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndecision in Beck. The concern addressed in Beck was \u201cthe\nrisk of an unwarranted conviction\u201d created when the jury\nis forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of\na capital offense and declaring him innocent of any\nwrongdoing. 447 U. S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at\n638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.

In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983),\nwe rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruc\ntion to \u201ca capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor\u2019s\npower to commute a sentence of life without possibility of\nparole.\u201d 463 U.

In so doing, we\nnoted the \u201cfundamental difference between the nature of\nthe guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the\nnature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.\u201d Id.,\nat 1007. In light of that critical distinction, we observed\nthat \u201cthe concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwar\nranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the\ndeliberative process in which the capital jury engages in\ndetermining the appropriate penalty.\u201d Id., at 1009; see\nalso Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the \u201ccentral con\ncern of Beck simply is not implicated\u201d when the \u201cjury was\nnot faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense\nof conviction (capital murder) and innocence\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

They had\njust convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder\nand two counts of attempted murder. They were specifi\ncally instructed that if they did not find that the aggravat\ning factors outweighed the mitigating factors\u2014and there\nfore did not recommend the death penalty\u2014they would\nchoose from two life sentence options. There is accord\ningly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case,\nunlike the jurors in Beck, could have been improperly\ninfluenced by a fear that a decision short of death would\nhave resulted in Mitts walking free.\n   We all but decided the question presented here in\nSpisak itself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio\ninstructions were contrary to Mills, we noted that \u201cthe\nCourt of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitu\ntional for an additional reason, that the instructions \u2018re\nquire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence\nbefore considering other sentencing alternatives.\u2019 \u201d 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Spisak v. Mitchell, 465\nF. 3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)). That is essentially the Beck\nclaim presented here. See 620 F. 3d, at 658 (holding that\na \u201cjury instruction violates due process if it requires a\nmandatory death penalty sentence that can only be\navoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity\nto consider life imprisonment\u201d).
