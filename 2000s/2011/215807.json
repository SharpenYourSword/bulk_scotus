WYOMING ET AL.\n\n          ON EXCEPTION TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n\n    No. 137, Orig. Argued January 10, 2011—Decided May 2, 2011\nArticle V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact ratified by Montana,\n  Wyoming, and North Dakota provides: “Appropriative rights to the\n  beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing\n  in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be en\n  joyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use\n  of water under the doctrine of appropriation.” 65 Stat. 666. Montana\n  filed a bill of complaint, alleging that Wyoming breached Article V(A)\n  by allowing its upstream pre-1950 water users to switch from flood to\n  sprinkler irrigation, which increases crop consumption of water and\n  decreases the volume of runoff and seepage returning to the river\n  system. Thus, even if Wyoming’s pre-1950 users divert the same\n  quantity of water as before, less water reaches downstream users in\n  Montana. Concluding that the Compact permits more efficient irri\n  gation systems so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the\n  same acreage watered in 1950, the Special Master found that Mon\n  tana’s increased-efficiency allegation failed to state a claim. Montana\n  has filed an exception.\nHeld: Because Article V(A) of the Compact incorporates the ordinary\n doctrine of appropriation without significant qualification, and be\n cause in Wyoming and Montana that doctrine allows appropriators to\n improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\n stream appropriators, Montana’s increased-efficiency allegation fails\n to state a claim for breach of the Compact under Article V(A). Pp. 4–\n 19.\n    (a) Background appropriation law principles do not support Mon\n tana’s position. The doctrine of appropriation provides that rights to\n water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority,\n starting with the first person to divert water from a natural stream\n and apply it to a “beneficial use.” Once perfected, that water right is\n2                       MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    senior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be fulfilled entirely\n    before the junior appropriators get any water. However, junior ap\n    propriators do acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when\n    they find it. Under this no-injury rule, junior users may, subject to\n    the fulfillment of the senior users’ existing rights, prevent senior us\n    ers from enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment. Here,\n    the question is whether a switch to more efficient irrigation with less\n    return flow is within Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriat\n    ive rights or is an improper enlargement of that right. Although the\n    law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the\n    Special Master correctly concluded that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users\n    may switch to sprinkler irrigation. Pp. 4–16.\n         (1) A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of\n    the no-injury rule in Montana and Wyoming, which generally con\n    cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or pur\n    pose of use. Thus, an appropriator may increase his consumption by\n    changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no\n    change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. Ordinary,\n    day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.\n    Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, if that\n    was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through\n    the years. Irrigation system improvements seem to be the same sort\n    of changes. This view is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both\n    States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but\n    neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irri\n    gation methods. Cases in both States frequently describe the no\n    injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of\n    use, and place of use. The abundance of litigation over such\n    changes—and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at\n    issue here—strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements\n    were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) The doctrine of recapture—which permits an appropriator\n    who has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own\n    runoff and seepage before it escapes his control or his property—also\n    supports treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the\n    original appropriative right. Montana and Wyoming cases appear to\n    apply this basic doctrine without any qualification based on whether\n    the return flow would re-enter the original stream or not. By using\n    sprinklers instead of flood irrigation, Wyoming’s pre-1950 water us\n    ers effectively recapture water. The sprinklers reduce loss from\n    seepage and runoff and are simply different mechanisms for increas\n    ing the volume of water available to crops without changing the\n    amount of diversion.

S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n       (3) This conclusion is consistent with the view of water law\n  scholars who have considered the question presented in this case.\n  Pp. 15–16.\n     (b) Also unpersuasive is Montana’s argument that, if background\n  appropriation law principles do not support its position, Article V(A)’s\n  “beneficial use” definition nonetheless restricts the scope of pre-1950\n  appropriative rights to the net volume of water that was actually be\n  ing consumed in 1950. Pp. 16–19.\n       (1) “Beneficial use” is “that use by which the water supply of a\n  drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities\n  of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that the term means the\n  amount of depletion, and thus any activity increasing Wyoming’s pre\n  1950 depletions beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds Article V(A)’s scope.\n  Pp. 16–17.\n       (2) Nothing in the Compact’s definition suggests such an inter\n  pretation. A plain reading indicates that “beneficial use” is a type of\n  use that depletes the water supply. This view is supported by the\n  circumstances in the signatory States when the Compact was\n  drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference for irriga\n  tion, a depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. It\n  thus it makes sense for the Compact to protect irrigation uses that\n  were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of\n  the Yellowstone River system. Montana’s reading, by contrast, would\n  drastically redefine the term. The amount of water put to “beneficial\n  use” has never been defined by net water consumption. In irrigation,\n  that amount has always included a measure of necessary loss, e.g.,\n  runoff or evaporation. If the Compact’s definition were meant to\n  drastically redefine “beneficial use,” this Court would expect far more\n  clarity. Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\n  ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which ex\n  pressly states that “the laws governing the acquisition and use of wa\n  ter under the doctrine of appropriation” control, would make little\n  sense. Pp. 17–18.\n       (3) If Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set\n  quantity of water, it could have done so plainly, as done in other\n  compacts, e.g., the Colorado River Compact of 1922.

STATE OF\n\n    WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA \n\n  ON EXCEPTION TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [May 2, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case arises out of a dispute between Montana and\nWyoming over the Yellowstone River Compact. Montana\nalleges that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the\nCompact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to\nincrease their net water consumption by improving the\nefficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems,\nMontana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the\namount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriv­\ning Montana’s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of\nwater to which they are entitled. The Special Master has\nfiled a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here,\nthat Montana’s allegation fails to state a claim because\nmore efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the\nCompact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate\nthe same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the\nSpecial Master and overrule Montana’s exception to that\nconclusion.\n                            I\n   From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River\nflows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then\nNorth Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. Several\n2                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue,\nPowder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and\ncross into Montana before joining the main stem of the\nYellowstone River. This river system’s monthly and an­\nnual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary\nwidely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and\nPowder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.\n936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it\nbecame expedient to build water storage facilities for\npreserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master 6 (hereinafter Report).\n   Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress\nsought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone\nRiver system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da­\nkota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to\nnegotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47\nStat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,\nand 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in\n1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the\nYellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.\nAct of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.\n   The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three\ntiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: “Appropria­\ntive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow­\nstone River System existing in each signatory State as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor­\ndance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of\nwater under the doctrine of appropriation.” Id., at 666.\nSecond, Article V(B) allocates to each State the “quantity\nof that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen­\ntal water supplies” for the pre-1950 uses protected by\nArticle V(A). Ibid. Third, “the remainder of the unused\nand unappropriated water” of each tributary is divided by\npercentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water\nin the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%\nin the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 666–667.\n   In February 2008, we granted Montana leave to file a\nbill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Com­\npact. 552 U. S. 1175. Montana alleged that Wyoming had\nbreached the Compact by consuming more than its share\nof the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3,\n¶8. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was ap­\npropriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses:\nirrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities;\nconducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing con­\nsumption on existing agricultural acreage.1 Id., at 3–4,\n¶¶ 9–12. According to Montana’s complaint, the Compact\ndid not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these\npractices as long as Montana’s pre-1950 users’ rights\nremained unfulfilled. Id., at 3, ¶8.\n   In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred\nthe motion to him. 555 U. S. __ (2008). After briefing and\nargument, the Special Master recommended that we deny\nWyoming’s motion, because at least some of Montana’s\nallegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master\nfound that “Article V of the Compact protects pre-1950\nappropriations in Montana from new surface and ground­\nwater diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for\nstorage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Mon­\ntana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.” Report 14–\n15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that\nMontana’s allegations regarding “efficiency improvements\n——————\n  1 Montana   has since clarified that increased consumption on existing\nacreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The\n“efficiency” of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of\nwastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or\ndeep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is\nlater available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation\nsystem loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of\nwater from the river, net water consumption is increased.\n4                     MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming” do not state a\nclaim for relief. Id., at 15. The States did not object to\nmost of the Special Master’s findings, and we have issued\norders accordingly. See 562 U. S. __ (2010); 562 U. S. __\n(2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special\nMaster’s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It\nis this exception that is before us.2\n                              II\n   Article V(A) of the Compact states that “[a]ppropriative\nrights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi­\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”\nMontana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators’ rights are\nnot “continu[ing] to be enjoyed” because upstream pre­\n1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their\nconsumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irriga­\ntion. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase\ncrop consumption of water and decrease the volume of\nrunoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder\nrivers by 25% or more.3 See Montana’s Exception and\nBrief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even\nif Wyoming’s pre-1950 water users divert the same quan­\ntity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. Ac­\ncording to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from\nallowing this practice when it deprives Montana’s pre­\n——————\n  2 Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master’s finding\n\nthat if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users\nby curtailing its post-1950 uses without “prejudic[ing] Montana’s other\nrights under the Compact,” then an intrastate remedy is “the appropri­\nate solution.” Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special\nMaster. 562 U. S. __ (2010).\n  3 For purposes of resolving Wyoming’s motion to dismiss, we take as\n\ntrue Montana’s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually\nreduce return flow to the rivers. Wyoming has not conceded that this is\ntrue. See Wyoming’s Reply to Montana’s Exception 35, n. 6.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1950 users of their full water rights.\n  The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows\nWyoming’s pre-1950 water users—diverting the same\nquantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and\nacreage as before 1950—to increase their consumption of\nwater by improving their irrigation systems even if it\nreduces the flow of water to Montana’s pre-1950 users.\nMontana makes two basic arguments: that background\nprinciples of appropriation law, to the extent they are\nincorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an in­\ncrease in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms\nof the Compact amended those principles in Montana’s\nfavor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and\nso do we.\n                              A\n   Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects\n“[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]” as\nof 1950 “in accordance with the laws governing the ac-\nquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appro­\npriation,” we begin with an overview of appropriation\ndoctrine.4 As the Special Master explained, if “[a]p­\npropriation law clearly proscribe[s] increases in consump­\ntion on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream\nappropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit\nWyoming from allowing its appropriators to make\n——————\n  4 As  with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the\nintent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily\nto the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the\nStates, we also look to Western water law more generally and authori­\nties from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed\nthat the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We\ntherefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appro­\npriation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution\nof the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or\nshrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana’s exception\nwithout prejudice to that issue. See Report 39–40.\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch increases to the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950\nuses.” Report 65.\n   As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of\nappropriation has governed water rights in Montana and\nWyoming since the 1800’s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88978\"><a href=\"/opinion/88978/basey-v-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine\nprovides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected\nand enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first\nperson to divert water from a natural stream and apply it\nto a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently\ncompleted). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry\nCreek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali\nfornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565–566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,\n§3 (“Priority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give\nthe better right”). The scope of the right is limited by the\nconcept of “beneficial use.” That concept restricts a farmer\n“to the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his\nland by making a reasonable use of the water.” 1 C.\nKinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights §586, pp.\n1007–1008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v.

Once such a water right is perfected, it is\nsenior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be ful­\nfilled entirely before those junior appropriators get any\nwater at all.\n   For our purposes, Montana’s pre-1950 water users are\nsimilar to junior appropriators. As between the States,\nthe Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre­\n1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for\nMontana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.\nBut as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal\nseniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop\nWyoming’s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising\ntheir water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Mon­\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg.\n51.\n   Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,\nhowever. As they come online, appropriators acquire\nrights to the stream basically as it exists when they find\nit. See 2 Kinney §803, at 1403–1404. Accordingly, subject\nto the fulfillment of all senior users’ existing rights, under\nthe no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users\nfrom enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment.\n1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen West­\nern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).\n   Montana’s pre-1950 users can therefore “insist that\n[Wyoming’s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly\nwithin the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the\namount of water within the extent of their appropriation\nwhich they actually apply to some beneficial use.” 2\nKinney §784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis­\nputed; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to\nmore efficient irrigation with less return flow within the\nextent of Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriative\nrights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to\nthe detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 water users?\n   As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows\nis an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65\n(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.\nL. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us\nto any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, “[n]o west­\nern state court appears to have conclusively answered the\nquestion.” Report 65.\n   Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found\nseveral reasons to conclude that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users\nmay switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the\nscope of the original appropriative right includes such a\nchange so long as no additional water is diverted from the\n8                      MONTANA v.

We agree\nwith the Special Master.5\n                             1\n   First, although the no-injury rule prevents appropria­\ntors from making certain water-right changes that would\nharm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods\ndoes not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and\nWyoming. See id., at 69. Because each new appropriator\nis entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the\ngeneral rule is that “if a change in these conditions is\nmade by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the\nflow of the water to the material injury of [the junior\nappropriator’s] rights, he may justly complain.” 2 Kinney\n§803, at 1404.\n   But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally con­\ncerns changes in the location of the diversion and the\nplace or purpose of use. Quigley v. McIntosh, 110 Mont.\n——————\n   5 The lack of clarity in this area of water law highlights the sensitive\n\nnature of our inquiry and counsels caution. Our original jurisdiction\nover cases between States brings us this dispute between Montana and\nWyoming about the meaning of their congressionally approved Yellow­\nstone River Compact. See U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). Yet, because the Compact references and the parties direct\nus to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed\nin state water law. See n. 4, supra. Our assessment of the scope of\nthese water rights is merely a federal court’s description of state law.\n   The highest court of each State, of course, remains “the final arbiter\nof what is state law.” West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 311\nU. S. 223, 236 (1940). We recognize that appropriation doctrine contin­\nues to evolve, and there are reasonable policy arguments in favor of\nboth States’ positions here. But it is not this Court’s role to guide the\ndevelopment of state water regulation. See id., at 237 (“[I]t is the duty\nof [federal courts] in every case to ascertain from all the available data\nwhat the state law is and apply it rather than to prescribe a different\nrule, however superior it may appear from the viewpoint of ‘general\nlaw’ ”). Our decision is not intended to restrict the States’ determina­\ntion of their respective appropriation doctrines.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Accordingly, certain types of changes can occur\neven though they may harm downstream appropriators.\nSee D. Getches, Water Law in a Nutshell 175 (4th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Getches). For instance, an appropriator\nmay increase his consumption by changing to a more\nwater-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in\nacreage irrigated or amount of water diverted.

Those changes are not to the\n“place of diversion, or place or purpose of use,” Quigley,\nsupra, at 505, 103 P. 2d, at 1072, and thus seem to be\nexcluded, much like crop changes or day-to-day irrigation\n10                    MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nadjustments or repairs. This is also consistent with the\nfact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating\ncertain changes to water rights, but neither required\nfarmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation\nmethods.6 See Report 69–70, 87; id., at 69 (they “do not\ngenerally have procedures for overseeing changes in water\nefficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im­\nprovements where there are no formal changes in the\nunderlying water rights”). Like the Special Master, we\nfind this to be persuasive evidence that the States consid­\nered such changes permissible.\n   Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private\nlawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency\nchanges. But it has not provided a single example from\neither State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi­\ncally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in\npoint of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,\ne.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig.

The abundance of litigation over\nsuch changes—and the absence of any litigation over the\nsort of change at issue here—strongly implies that irriga­\ntion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury\nrule and were considered within the scope of the original\nappropriative right.\n                            2\n  The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im­\nprovements in irrigation efficiency as within the original\nappropriative right.

And Montana cites no case from either\nState here in which a court has recognized, much less\nfound controlling, the idea that a water user may not\nreuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property\nsimply because it otherwise would return to the original\nstream.\n  In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without\nqualification, the basic doctrine that the original appro­\npriator may freely recapture his used water while it re­\nmains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose\non the same land. For example, in Binning v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wyo.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 P. 2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water\nfrom a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage\nfrom Binning’s property. Although the court found that\nthe man had a right to that water once Binning’s runoff\nand seepage had become a natural stream, it noted that\nhis right remained subject to Binning’s right “to use the\nwater above mentioned for beneficial purposes upon the\nland for which the seepage water was [originally] appro­\npriated.” Id., at 477, 102 P. 2d, at 63. In a later case, the\ncourt explained that the man could not “secure a perma­\nnent right to continue to receive the water” because\nBinning “might find better ways of utilizing the water on\nthe same land so that less waste and seepage would oc­\ncur.” Bower v.

Franks, 610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980),\nwater was seeping from Fuss’ property and into a pit in a\npublic right of way. Franks was the first to appropriate\nthe water from the pit. The court upheld Franks’ appro­\npriation right because the water had already escaped from\nFuss’ property. The court said that the “owner of land\nupon which seepage or waste water rises has the right to\nuse and reuse—capture and recapture—such waste wa­\nters,” but only before the water escapes his land, and “for\nuse only upon the land for which the water forming the\nseepage was originally appropriated.” Id., at 20 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Fuss thus had no superior\nright to the water that had left his property, and espe­\ncially not for reuse on other lands.\n  The law in Montana is similar. The Montana Supreme\nCourt has explained that “the general rule . . . is that the\nowner of the right to use the water—his private property\nwhile in his possession,—may collect it, recapture it, be­\nfore it leaves his possession.” Rock Creek Ditch & Flume\nCo. v.

Stone, Montana Water Law 66 (1994)\n(noting that, according to the “early cases,” while “the\nwater is still seeping and running off one’s own land, the\nlandowner is free to recapture and further use it”).\n  The right of recapture discussed in these authorities is\nbroad. As the Special Master recognized, the “language of\n14                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Wyoming Supreme Court . . . was expansive” in\nBinning, Bower, and Fuss, and “all appear to hold that an\nappropriator in Wyoming can increase his water use effi­\nciency by recovering runoff on his property or through\nother means so long as the increased consumption is on\nthe same land to which the appropriative right attaches.”\nReport 81; see also id., at 78–85; Thompson, Case Note,\nWater Law—Reusing Irrigation Waste Water on Different\nLands: A Warning to Get a New Permit, Fuss v. Franks,\n610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), 16 Land & Water L. Rev. 71, 76\n(1981) (concluding that in Wyoming, “a prior appropriator\ncan at anytime, utilize irrigation methods that are totally\nconsumptive, such as pumping the collected waste water\nback to the top of the field or installing a sprinkler system,\nthereby eliminating all waste of water”); Jones, Note,\nRights of the Original Appropriator to Recapture Water\nUsed in Irrigation, 11 Wyo. L. J. 39 (1956); Wille, Note,\nThe Right to Use Waste Water Before It Re-enters the\nStream, 12 Wyo. L. J. 47, 48 (1957).\n  The Wyoming and Montana doctrine of recapture\nstrongly suggests that improvements in irrigation effi­\nciency are within the original appropriative right of Wyo­\nming’s pre-1950 water users. By using sprinklers rather\nthan flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap­\nture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep­\nage and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,\ncruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They\nare simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume\nof water available to the crops without changing the\namount of diversion. Binning, Bower, and Fuss expressly\nacknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators\nwho have perfected their own appropriative rights are\nnonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from\nwhich their water flows. See 55 Wyo., at 474–477, 102\nP. 2d, at 63; 77 Wyo., at 100–104, 307 P. 2d, at 601–602;\n610 P. 2d, at 20.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

One scholar asserted: “[O]f course,\nincreasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of\nwater available to downstream users who may rely on\nreturn flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,\ndoes not preclude more efficient uses merely because a\ndownstream user may be injured.” Squillace, A Critical\nLook at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land & Water L. Rev.\n307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (“For example, a\nfarmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water\napplied to his land is free to change his crop or method of\napplying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%”);\nsee also Thompson, supra, at 76 (“[A] prior appropriator\ncan at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby\neliminating all waste of water”). And a national hornbook\non water law has observed:\n      “The rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged\n    water on the original land can result in more water\n    being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con­\n    suming less than the permitted amount of water and\n    plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more\n    efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water\n    that had previously been returned to the stream\n    might be consumed. This can deprive other appro­\n    priators of water on which they depend but it is al­\n    lowed since it is technically within the terms of the\n    original appropriation.” Getches 143–144.\nMontana has not identified any scholars who have reached\nthe opposite conclusion.\n  For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of\nappropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro­\npriators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the\ndetriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac­\n16                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See\nsupra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule\nin Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and\nits broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and\nthe specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in\nthe same direction, which also comports with the Special\nMaster’s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,\nif Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles\nof appropriation law, it allows Wyoming’s pre-1950 water\nusers to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the\ndetriment of Montana’s pre-1950 users.\n                              B\n  Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that\neven if background principles of appropriation law do not\nsupport its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not\nprotect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.\nMontana claims that the Compact’s definition of “benefi­\ncial use” restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro­\npriative rights to the net volume of water that was actu­\nally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special\nMaster that this argument also fails.\n                               1\n   Article V(A) protects “[a]ppropriative rights to the bene­\nficial uses of . . . water.” “Beneficial use,” in turn, is de­\nfined in Article II(H) as “that use by which the water\nsupply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em­\nployed by the activities of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana\ncontends that “beneficial use” is thus defined as the\namount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity\nthat increases pre-1950 water users’ depletions in Wyo­\nming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the\nappropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief\nfor Montana 25–28. On this basis, Montana asserts that\nthe Compact requires (subject to river conditions) that the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsame quantity of water that was reaching Montana as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, continue to do so. Id., at 26.\n                              2\n   We acknowledge that “beneficial use” refers to a type of\nuse that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.\nSee Report 61. The part of the Compact’s definition of\n“beneficial use” that refers to depletion—“that use by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted”—is fairly clear. It\nbegins with “that use,” and the words that follow merely\nexplain that “that use” must be a use that “deplete[s]” the\n“water supply.” Nothing in the language suggests that\n“beneficial use” means a measure of the amount of water\ndepleted. A “beneficial use” within the meaning of the\nCompact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water\nsupply.\n   This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum­\nstances existing in the signatory States when the Compact\nwas drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory\npreference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over\npower generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n§71–402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would\nhave been written to protect the irrigation uses that were\nlegislatively favored and represented the predominant use\nof the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–\n47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the\nCompact recognizes “the great importance of water for\nirrigation in the signatory States”).\n   Montana’s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not\nfollow from the text and would drastically redefine the\nterm “beneficial use” from its longstanding meaning. The\namount of water put to “beneficial use” has never been\ndefined by net water consumption. The quantity of water\n“beneficially used” in irrigation, for example, has always\nincluded some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,\nevaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re­\n18                MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,\nwater put to “[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con­\nsumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.” 1\nWiel §481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea­\nsonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12\nWyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial\nuse and noting that “the method of application, by flood­\ning, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial”); J. Sax, B.\nThompson, J. Leshy, & R. Adams, Legal Control of Water\nResources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation\npractices and observing that the amount of water put to\nbeneficial use “is often considerably more than the quan­\ntum actually consumed”).\n   If the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use” were\nmeant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for\nnet water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.\nFor example, the Compact could have stated that it would\nprotect “only ‘the amount of water consumed for a benefi­\ncial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.’ ”\nReport 60. Or it could have defined “beneficial use” as the\n“volume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.” More­\nover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\nordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),\nwhich expressly states that “the laws governing the acqui­\nsition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria­\ntion” control, would make little sense.\n   We agree with the Special Master that the definition of\nbeneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti­\ncle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro­\npriative rights that it protects in both States.\n                           3\n  Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee\nMontana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as\nplainly as other compacts that do just that.

The Colorado\nRiver Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of\nwater per year for “the exclusive beneficial consumptive\nuse” of several upstream States, including Wyoming. That\ncompact specifically added that “[t]he States of the Upper\nDivision will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to\nbe depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for\nany period of ten consecutive years . . . .”        National\nResources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Inter­\nstate Water Compacts, 1785–1941, p. 8 (1942).

And the best evidence we have\nshows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and\nMontana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of\ntheir irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down­\nstream appropriators. Montana’s allegation that Wyo­\nming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allow­\ning its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation\nefficiency thus fails to state a claim.

STATE OF\n\n     WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA \n\n  ON EXCEPTIONS TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                           [May 2, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.\n   Thanks to improved irrigation techniques, Wyoming’s\nfarmers and cattlemen appear to consume more of the\nwater they divert from the Yellowstone River and its\ntributaries today than they did 60 years ago—that is to\nsay, less of the diverted water ultimately finds its way\nback into the Yellowstone. The Court interprets the Yel\nlowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,\n1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the\nright to increase their consumption so long as they do not\nincrease the volume of water they diverted beyond pre\n1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that\nthe increased consumption interferes with its residents’\npre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because\nthe Court’s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident\nreading of the common law, see ante, at 7–8, and n. 5, for\nthe Compact’s definition of “beneficial use.”\n   The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water\nrights along a river, on a “first in time[,] . . . superior in\nright” basis, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459\n(1922), to those who divert its flow and apply the water to\na beneficial use. See Hinderlider v. La Plata River &\n——————\n  * The dictionary-approved term is “Wyomingite,” which is also the\nname of a type of lava, see Webster’s New International Dictionary\n2961 (2d ed. 1957). I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better.\n2                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938). The\n“beneficial use” requirement does most of the legal work.\nIt marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative\nright—irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see\nUnited States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,\n504, n. 2 (1945); and it “measure[s]” the extent of an ap\npropriator’s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,\n505 (1924); A. Tarlock, Law of Water Rights and Re\nsources §§5:66, 5:68–5:69, pp. 5–130.3, 5–130.9 to 5–\n130.10 (2010). At common law, an appropriator claims the\nvolume of water diverted and “reasonably required” by his\nintended use. Id., §§5:65–5:66, at 5–127, 5–130.2; see\nQuinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wyo.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377–378,\n92 P. 2d 568, 570–571 (1939).\n   The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to\ndefine the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel\nlowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises\nthat “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the\nwater of the Yellowstone River System existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”\n65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a “Beneficial\nUse” is one “by which the water supply of a drainage basin\nis depleted when usefully employed by the activities of\nman.” Id., at 665 (emphasis added).\n   Like the common law, this definition lays out the types\nof uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water\nan appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But\nthe Compact’s focus on whether a use depletes a river’s\nwater supply—not whether it diverts the river’s flow—\nsignificantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming\nis entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may\nlay claim only to its beneficial users’ net consumption of\nwater, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river\nminus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nriver’s channel.\n   This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives\nmeaning to the definition’s use of the word “depleted.” I\ncannot write off as an accident the choice of this word\nrather than the word consistently used elsewhere in the\nCompact: “diverted.” See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). The Compact’s authors knew\nhow to use “diverted” and “diversion” when they wanted\nto. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions\nof the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D),\n65 Stat. 665–668; and the Compact defines them in the\nsentence immediately preceding the definition of “benefi\ncial use.” See Art. II(G), id., at 665. But the Compact’s\nauthors chose to define beneficial use in terms of deple\ntion—the first and only time the Compact uses any deriva\ntive of the word “deplete.” It is in my view a clear indica\ntion that the Compact intends to break from the common\nlaw’s focus on diversion.\n   The Court reduces the Compact’s deliberate use of “de\npleted” to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to\ntoday’s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of\nuses that confer appropriative rights. “Nothing in the\nlanguage,” it says, “suggests that ‘beneficial use’ means a\nmeasure of the amount of water depleted.” Ante, at 17.\nThis is incomprehensible. On the Court’s own interpreta\ntion “beneficial use” not only defines the types of uses that\nconfer appropriative rights, but also determines the vol\nume of water to which the rights attach—viz., only that\nvolume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only\nquestion before us is whether “beneficial use” measures\nthe volume diverted or the volume depleted—and the\nlanguage of the Compact makes that clear.\n   The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of\nthe word “depleted” instead of “diverted.” Its best effort\nis the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that\nhydroelectric power generation and other disfavored,\n4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See\nibid. That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, rely\ning on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion\nwould be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accom\nplish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished\nby other provisions of the Compact. One would instead\nhave expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfa\nvored uses from the “usefu[l] . . . activities of man,”\nArt. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights.\nCf. Mont. Code Ann. §85–2–102(4) (2009) (listing types of\nbeneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively,\nhydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races—\nthe allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United\nStates offer up to explain the word “depleted”—are already\nexcluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any\nneed for appropriative rights) by the Compact’s definition\nof diversion: “the taking or removing of water from the\nYellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water\nso taken or removed is not returned directly into the\nchannel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from\nwhich it is taken.” Art. II(G), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying\nclause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric\ndams, water wheels and mill races, which, when they\ndivert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, “re\ntur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is\ntaken.”\n  The Court objects to my interpretation because the word\n“depleted” lacks the “clarity” necessary to “drastically\nredefine the term ‘beneficial use’ from its longstanding\nmeaning,” ante, at 17. According to the Court, “[t]he\namount of water put to ‘beneficial use’ has never been\ndefined by net water consumption.” Ibid. Before making\nthis statement, the Court has spent some 10 pages, ante,\nat 7–16, conducting a “sensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels\ncaution”; into a field (state water law) where the answer of\nthis Court is not conclusive and hence not ipso facto cor\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The\nCourt calls that hitherto unanswered question “the law of\nreturn flows,” ante, at 7, but it can more accurately be\ndescribed as the question whether the volume of water to\nwhich an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume\ndiverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume\ndepleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that “bene\nficial use” has never had the “longstanding meaning” the\nCourt posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to\nall water diverted from the stream rather than all water\ndepleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of\nwhich of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite\nextraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic\nefforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answer\ning a state water-law question that no court of any West\nern State has ever answered—a question that would cross\na Rabbi’s eyes—when the text in front of us provides\nthe clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned:\n“depleted.”\n   The Court suggests that if the Compact’s authors\nwanted to break from (what it considers) the common law,\nthey should have defined beneficial use as the “volume by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted.” Ante, at 18 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to\nme to have little force when the Court cannot explain what\nwork “depleted” is supposed to do other than indicate\nprecisely the same concept more concisely. And the\nCourt’s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with\ngreater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court’s advice\nwould make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact.\nThat provision allocates a fixed percentage “of the unused\nand unappropriated water” of various tributaries to each\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState for post-1950 “storage or direct diversions for benefi\ncial use on new lands or for other purposes.” 65 Stat. 666.\nBut if “beneficial use” in this last phrase means “the vol\nume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,”\nthe provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed\npercentage of unused and unappropriated water for “a\nvolume of water by which the water supply is depleted.” It\nmakes perfect sense, of course, if “beneficial use” means all\nuses that deplete the stream.\n   The Court also wonders why, “if Article V(A) were in\ntended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,” it\ndid not “d[o] so as plainly as other” interstate water com\npacts “that do just that.” Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.\nMontana does not demand a precise volume of water each\nyear; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al\nways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.\nIt merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the\nsame position relative to Wyoming’s pre-1950 users in\n2011 as they did in 1950—that whatever would have\nflowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro\npriators’ beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this\nyear’s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon\ntanans will have to make do with less or go without.\n   Because I think the Court’s disposition disregards the\ntext of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 215807, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/05/02/Montana_v._Wyoming.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 10, 2011—Decided May 2, 2011\nArticle V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact ratified by Montana,\n  Wyoming, and North Dakota provides: “Appropriative rights to the\n  beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing\n  in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be en\n  joyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use\n  of water under the doctrine of appropriation.” 65 Stat. 666. Montana\n  filed a bill of complaint, alleging that Wyoming breached Article V(A)\n  by allowing its upstream pre-1950 water users to switch from flood to\n  sprinkler irrigation, which increases crop consumption of water and\n  decreases the volume of runoff and seepage returning to the river\n  system. Thus, even if Wyoming’s pre-1950 users divert the same\n  quantity of water as before, less water reaches downstream users in\n  Montana. Concluding that the Compact permits more efficient irri\n  gation systems so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the\n  same acreage watered in 1950, the Special Master found that Mon\n  tana’s increased-efficiency allegation failed to state a claim. Montana\n  has filed an exception.\nHeld: Because Article V(A) of the Compact incorporates the ordinary\n doctrine of appropriation without significant qualification, and be\n cause in Wyoming and Montana that doctrine allows appropriators to\n improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\n stream appropriators, Montana’s increased-efficiency allegation fails\n to state a claim for breach of the Compact under Article V(A). Pp. 4–\n 19.\n    (a) Background appropriation law principles do not support Mon\n tana’s position. The doctrine of appropriation provides that rights to\n water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority,\n starting with the first person to divert water from a natural stream\n and apply it to a “beneficial use.” Once perfected, that water right is\n2                       MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    senior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be fulfilled entirely\n    before the junior appropriators get any water. However, junior ap\n    propriators do acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when\n    they find it. Under this no-injury rule, junior users may, subject to\n    the fulfillment of the senior users’ existing rights, prevent senior us\n    ers from enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment. Here,\n    the question is whether a switch to more efficient irrigation with less\n    return flow is within Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriat\n    ive rights or is an improper enlargement of that right. Although the\n    law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the\n    Special Master correctly concluded that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users\n    may switch to sprinkler irrigation. Pp. 4–16.\n         (1) A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of\n    the no-injury rule in Montana and Wyoming, which generally con\n    cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or pur\n    pose of use. Thus, an appropriator may increase his consumption by\n    changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no\n    change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. Ordinary,\n    day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.\n    Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, if that\n    was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through\n    the years. Irrigation system improvements seem to be the same sort\n    of changes. This view is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both\n    States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but\n    neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irri\n    gation methods. Cases in both States frequently describe the no\n    injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of\n    use, and place of use. The abundance of litigation over such\n    changes—and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at\n    issue here—strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements\n    were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) The doctrine of recapture—which permits an appropriator\n    who has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own\n    runoff and seepage before it escapes his control or his property—also\n    supports treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the\n    original appropriative right. Montana and Wyoming cases appear to\n    apply this basic doctrine without any qualification based on whether\n    the return flow would re-enter the original stream or not. By using\n    sprinklers instead of flood irrigation, Wyoming’s pre-1950 water us\n    ers effectively recapture water. The sprinklers reduce loss from\n    seepage and runoff and are simply different mechanisms for increas\n    ing the volume of water available to crops without changing the\n    amount of diversion.

Pp. 16–19.\n       (1) “Beneficial use” is “that use by which the water supply of a\n  drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities\n  of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that the term means the\n  amount of depletion, and thus any activity increasing Wyoming’s pre\n  1950 depletions beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds Article V(A)’s scope.\n  Pp. 16–17.\n       (2) Nothing in the Compact’s definition suggests such an inter\n  pretation. A plain reading indicates that “beneficial use” is a type of\n  use that depletes the water supply. This view is supported by the\n  circumstances in the signatory States when the Compact was\n  drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference for irriga\n  tion, a depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. It\n  thus it makes sense for the Compact to protect irrigation uses that\n  were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of\n  the Yellowstone River system. Montana’s reading, by contrast, would\n  drastically redefine the term. The amount of water put to “beneficial\n  use” has never been defined by net water consumption. In irrigation,\n  that amount has always included a measure of necessary loss, e.g.,\n  runoff or evaporation. If the Compact’s definition were meant to\n  drastically redefine “beneficial use,” this Court would expect far more\n  clarity. Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\n  ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which ex\n  pressly states that “the laws governing the acquisition and use of wa\n  ter under the doctrine of appropriation” control, would make little\n  sense. Pp. 17–18.\n       (3) If Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set\n  quantity of water, it could have done so plainly, as done in other\n  compacts, e.g., the Colorado River Compact of 1922.

STATE OF\n\n    WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA \n\n  ON EXCEPTION TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [May 2, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case arises out of a dispute between Montana and\nWyoming over the Yellowstone River Compact. Montana\nalleges that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the\nCompact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to\nincrease their net water consumption by improving the\nefficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems,\nMontana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the\namount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriv­\ning Montana’s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of\nwater to which they are entitled. The Special Master has\nfiled a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here,\nthat Montana’s allegation fails to state a claim because\nmore efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the\nCompact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate\nthe same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the\nSpecial Master and overrule Montana’s exception to that\nconclusion.\n                            I\n   From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River\nflows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then\nNorth Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River.

This river system’s monthly and an­\nnual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary\nwidely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and\nPowder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.\n936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it\nbecame expedient to build water storage facilities for\npreserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master 6 (hereinafter Report).\n   Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress\nsought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone\nRiver system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da­\nkota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to\nnegotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47\nStat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,\nand 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in\n1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the\nYellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.\nAct of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.\n   The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three\ntiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: “Appropria­\ntive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow­\nstone River System existing in each signatory State as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor­\ndance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of\nwater under the doctrine of appropriation.” Id., at 666.\nSecond, Article V(B) allocates to each State the “quantity\nof that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen­\ntal water supplies” for the pre-1950 uses protected by\nArticle V(A). Ibid. Third, “the remainder of the unused\nand unappropriated water” of each tributary is divided by\npercentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water\nin the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%\nin the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 666–667.\n   In February 2008, we granted Montana leave to file a\nbill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Com­\npact. 552 U. S. 1175. Montana alleged that Wyoming had\nbreached the Compact by consuming more than its share\nof the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3,\n¶8. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was ap­\npropriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses:\nirrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities;\nconducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing con­\nsumption on existing agricultural acreage.1 Id., at 3–4,\n¶¶ 9–12. According to Montana’s complaint, the Compact\ndid not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these\npractices as long as Montana’s pre-1950 users’ rights\nremained unfulfilled. Id., at 3, ¶8.\n   In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred\nthe motion to him. 555 U. S. __ (2008). After briefing and\nargument, the Special Master recommended that we deny\nWyoming’s motion, because at least some of Montana’s\nallegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master\nfound that “Article V of the Compact protects pre-1950\nappropriations in Montana from new surface and ground­\nwater diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for\nstorage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Mon­\ntana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.” Report 14–\n15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that\nMontana’s allegations regarding “efficiency improvements\n——————\n  1 Montana   has since clarified that increased consumption on existing\nacreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The\n“efficiency” of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of\nwastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or\ndeep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is\nlater available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation\nsystem loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of\nwater from the river, net water consumption is increased.\n4                     MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming” do not state a\nclaim for relief. Id., at 15. The States did not object to\nmost of the Special Master’s findings, and we have issued\norders accordingly. See 562 U. S. __ (2010); 562 U. S. __\n(2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special\nMaster’s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It\nis this exception that is before us.2\n                              II\n   Article V(A) of the Compact states that “[a]ppropriative\nrights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi­\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”\nMontana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators’ rights are\nnot “continu[ing] to be enjoyed” because upstream pre­\n1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their\nconsumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irriga­\ntion. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase\ncrop consumption of water and decrease the volume of\nrunoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder\nrivers by 25% or more.3 See Montana’s Exception and\nBrief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even\nif Wyoming’s pre-1950 water users divert the same quan­\ntity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. Ac­\ncording to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from\nallowing this practice when it deprives Montana’s pre­\n——————\n  2 Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master’s finding\n\nthat if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users\nby curtailing its post-1950 uses without “prejudic[ing] Montana’s other\nrights under the Compact,” then an intrastate remedy is “the appropri­\nate solution.” Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special\nMaster. 562 U. S. __ (2010).\n  3 For purposes of resolving Wyoming’s motion to dismiss, we take as\n\ntrue Montana’s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually\nreduce return flow to the rivers. Wyoming has not conceded that this is\ntrue. See Wyoming’s Reply to Montana’s Exception 35, n. 6.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1950 users of their full water rights.\n  The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows\nWyoming’s pre-1950 water users—diverting the same\nquantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and\nacreage as before 1950—to increase their consumption of\nwater by improving their irrigation systems even if it\nreduces the flow of water to Montana’s pre-1950 users.\nMontana makes two basic arguments: that background\nprinciples of appropriation law, to the extent they are\nincorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an in­\ncrease in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms\nof the Compact amended those principles in Montana’s\nfavor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and\nso do we.\n                              A\n   Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects\n“[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]” as\nof 1950 “in accordance with the laws governing the ac-\nquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appro­\npriation,” we begin with an overview of appropriation\ndoctrine.4 As the Special Master explained, if “[a]p­\npropriation law clearly proscribe[s] increases in consump­\ntion on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream\nappropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit\nWyoming from allowing its appropriators to make\n——————\n  4 As  with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the\nintent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily\nto the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the\nStates, we also look to Western water law more generally and authori­\nties from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed\nthat the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We\ntherefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appro­\npriation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution\nof the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or\nshrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana’s exception\nwithout prejudice to that issue. See Report 39–40.\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch increases to the detriment of Montana’s pre-1950\nuses.” Report 65.\n   As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of\nappropriation has governed water rights in Montana and\nWyoming since the 1800’s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,\n20 Wall. 670, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine\nprovides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected\nand enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first\nperson to divert water from a natural stream and apply it\nto a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently\ncompleted). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry\nCreek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali\nfornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565–566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,\n§3 (“Priority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give\nthe better right”). The scope of the right is limited by the\nconcept of “beneficial use.” That concept restricts a farmer\n“to the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his\nland by making a reasonable use of the water.” 1 C.\nKinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights §586, pp.\n1007–1008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v. Tintinger, 45\nMont. 154, 176–178, 122 P. 575, 583 (1912); Quinn v. John\nWhitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 376–380, 92 P. 2d 568,\n570–571 (1939). Once such a water right is perfected, it is\nsenior to any later appropriators’ rights and may be ful­\nfilled entirely before those junior appropriators get any\nwater at all.\n   For our purposes, Montana’s pre-1950 water users are\nsimilar to junior appropriators. As between the States,\nthe Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre­\n1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for\nMontana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.\nBut as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal\nseniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop\nWyoming’s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising\ntheir water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Mon­\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg.\n51.\n   Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,\nhowever. As they come online, appropriators acquire\nrights to the stream basically as it exists when they find\nit. See 2 Kinney §803, at 1403–1404. Accordingly, subject\nto the fulfillment of all senior users’ existing rights, under\nthe no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users\nfrom enlarging their rights to the junior users’ detriment.\n1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen West­\nern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).\n   Montana’s pre-1950 users can therefore “insist that\n[Wyoming’s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly\nwithin the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the\namount of water within the extent of their appropriation\nwhich they actually apply to some beneficial use.” 2\nKinney §784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis­\nputed; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to\nmore efficient irrigation with less return flow within the\nextent of Wyoming’s pre-1950 users’ existing appropriative\nrights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to\nthe detriment of Montana’s pre-1950 water users?\n   As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows\nis an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65\n(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.\nL. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us\nto any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, “[n]o west­\nern state court appears to have conclusively answered the\nquestion.” Report 65.\n   Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found\nseveral reasons to conclude that Wyoming’s pre-1950 users\nmay switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the\nscope of the original appropriative right includes such a\nchange so long as no additional water is diverted from the\n8                      MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstream and the conserved water is used on the same acre­\nage for the same agricultural purpose as before. We agree\nwith the Special Master.5\n                             1\n   First, although the no-injury rule prevents appropria­\ntors from making certain water-right changes that would\nharm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods\ndoes not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and\nWyoming. See id., at 69. Because each new appropriator\nis entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the\ngeneral rule is that “if a change in these conditions is\nmade by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the\nflow of the water to the material injury of [the junior\nappropriator’s] rights, he may justly complain.” 2 Kinney\n§803, at 1404.\n   But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally con­\ncerns changes in the location of the diversion and the\nplace or purpose of use. Quigley v. McIntosh, 110 Mont.\n——————\n   5 The lack of clarity in this area of water law highlights the sensitive\n\nnature of our inquiry and counsels caution. Our original jurisdiction\nover cases between States brings us this dispute between Montana and\nWyoming about the meaning of their congressionally approved Yellow­\nstone River Compact. See U. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). Yet, because the Compact references and the parties direct\nus to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed\nin state water law. See n. 4, supra. Our assessment of the scope of\nthese water rights is merely a federal court’s description of state law.\n   The highest court of each State, of course, remains “the final arbiter\nof what is state law.” West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 311\nU. S. 223, 236 (1940). We recognize that appropriation doctrine contin­\nues to evolve, and there are reasonable policy arguments in favor of\nboth States’ positions here. But it is not this Court’s role to guide the\ndevelopment of state water regulation. See id., at 237 (“[I]t is the duty\nof [federal courts] in every case to ascertain from all the available data\nwhat the state law is and apply it rather than to prescribe a different\nrule, however superior it may appear from the viewpoint of ‘general\nlaw’ ”). Our decision is not intended to restrict the States’ determina­\ntion of their respective appropriation doctrines.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Accordingly, certain types of changes can occur\neven though they may harm downstream appropriators.\nSee D. Getches, Water Law in a Nutshell 175 (4th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Getches). For instance, an appropriator\nmay increase his consumption by changing to a more\nwater-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in\nacreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. See id., at\n183; East Bench Irrig. Co. v. Deseret Irrig. Co., 2 Utah 2d\n170, 179, 271 P. 2d 449, 455 (1954) (assuming that farm­\ners may “legally increase the quantity of water consumed\nin irrigating their lands by changing to more water con­\nsuming crops” and adding that “it would be difficult to\nprevent . . . such increased consumptive use”). Ordinary,\nday-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not\nviolate the no-injury rule. See, e.g., 1 Wiel §56, at 51\n(“Would the fact that my pump has for years dripped\nwater onto a neighbor’s ground give him a right to say\nthat my pump must go on leaking?”). Consumption can\neven be increased by adding farm acreage, so long as that\nwas part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued\nthrough the years. See Van Tassel Real Estate & Live\nStock Co. v. Cheyenne, 49 Wyo. 333, 357–359, 54 P. 2d 906,\n913 (1936) (per curiam); 1 Hutchins 377–378; St. Onge v.\nBlakely, 76 Mont. 1, 22–24, 245 P. 532, 539 (1926).\n  Improvements to irrigation systems seem to be the sort\nof changes that fall outside the no-injury rule as it exists\nin Montana and Wyoming. Those changes are not to the\n“place of diversion, or place or purpose of use,” Quigley,\nsupra, at 505, 103 P. 2d, at 1072, and thus seem to be\nexcluded, much like crop changes or day-to-day irrigation\n10                    MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nadjustments or repairs. This is also consistent with the\nfact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating\ncertain changes to water rights, but neither required\nfarmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation\nmethods.6 See Report 69–70, 87; id., at 69 (they “do not\ngenerally have procedures for overseeing changes in water\nefficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im­\nprovements where there are no formal changes in the\nunderlying water rights”). Like the Special Master, we\nfind this to be persuasive evidence that the States consid­\nered such changes permissible.\n   Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private\nlawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency\nchanges. But it has not provided a single example from\neither State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi­\ncally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in\npoint of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,\ne.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig. Dist., 90 Mont. 344, 355–\n357, 3 P. 2d 286, 291 (1931); Thayer v. Rawlins, 594 P. 2d\n951, 955 (Wyo. 1979). The abundance of litigation over\nsuch changes—and the absence of any litigation over the\nsort of change at issue here—strongly implies that irriga­\ntion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury\nrule and were considered within the scope of the original\nappropriative right.\n                            2\n  The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im­\nprovements in irrigation efficiency as within the original\nappropriative right. Under this doctrine, an appropriator\nwho has diverted water for irrigation purposes has the\nright to recapture and reuse his own runoff and seepage\n——————\n  6 Mont. Code Ann. §89–803 (1947); Wyo.

If the senior appropriator, through scientific\nand technical advances, can utilize his water so that none\nis wasted, no other appropriator can complain”).\n   Montana contends that this rule does not apply when\nthe runoff or seepage water would, if not recaptured,\nreturn to the same stream from which it was originally\ndrawn. There is some support for Montana’s position—\nthat a beneficial user may not reuse water at all, even\nwhile it is still on his property, if it otherwise would flow\nback to the same stream—especially in Utah and Colorado\ncases. See Deseret Irrig. Co., supra, at 180–182, 271 P. 2d,\nat 456–457; Estate of Steed v. New Escalante Irrig. Co.,\n846 P. 2d 1223, 1226 (Utah 1992); Comstock v.

Rev. 541, 544, n. 18 (1965) (noting the general doctrine of recapture,\nand adding that “[t]he Colorado rule, however, is to the contrary”);\nUnited States v.

WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(asserting that, even in Utah, “where the original appro­\npriator retains possession and control of the waste and\nseepage water from irrigation of his lands, he is entitled to\nreuse these waters for his own benefit and need not return\nthem to the channel from which they were diverted” (em­\nphasis added)); Getches 139–145; Woolman v. Garringer, 1\nMont. 535 (1872). And Montana cites no case from either\nState here in which a court has recognized, much less\nfound controlling, the idea that a water user may not\nreuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property\nsimply because it otherwise would return to the original\nstream.\n  In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without\nqualification, the basic doctrine that the original appro­\npriator may freely recapture his used water while it re­\nmains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose\non the same land. For example, in Binning v. Miller, 55\nWyo. 451, 102 P. 2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water\nfrom a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage\nfrom Binning’s property. Although the court found that\nthe man had a right to that water once Binning’s runoff\nand seepage had become a natural stream, it noted that\nhis right remained subject to Binning’s right “to use the\nwater above mentioned for beneficial purposes upon the\nland for which the seepage water was [originally] appro­\npriated.” Id., at 477, 102 P. 2d, at 63. In a later case, the\ncourt explained that the man could not “secure a perma­\nnent right to continue to receive the water” because\nBinning “might find better ways of utilizing the water on\nthe same land so that less waste and seepage would oc­\ncur.” Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., 77 Wyo. 80, 101, 307\nP. 2d 593, 601 (1957).\n  Similarly, in Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., the court\nheld that Bower could appropriate water as it seeped\nacross his property from the Big Horn Canal toward a\nnearby river. Id., at 102–104, 307 P. 2d, at 602. The court\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadded, however, that Bower’s right was subject always to\nthe Big Horn Canal’s right: “No appropriator can compel\nany other appropriator to continue the waste of water\nwhich benefits the former.” Id., at 101, 307 P. 2d, at 601.\nImportantly, the court noted that “[i]f the senior appro­\npriator by a different method of irrigation can so utilize\nhis water that it is all consumed in transpiration and\nconsumptive use and no waste water returns by seepage\nor percolation to the river, no other appropriator can\ncomplain.” Ibid.\n  Finally, in Fuss v. Franks, 610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980),\nwater was seeping from Fuss’ property and into a pit in a\npublic right of way. Franks was the first to appropriate\nthe water from the pit. The court upheld Franks’ appro­\npriation right because the water had already escaped from\nFuss’ property. The court said that the “owner of land\nupon which seepage or waste water rises has the right to\nuse and reuse—capture and recapture—such waste wa­\nters,” but only before the water escapes his land, and “for\nuse only upon the land for which the water forming the\nseepage was originally appropriated.” Id., at 20 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Fuss thus had no superior\nright to the water that had left his property, and espe­\ncially not for reuse on other lands.\n  The law in Montana is similar. The Montana Supreme\nCourt has explained that “the general rule . . . is that the\nowner of the right to use the water—his private property\nwhile in his possession,—may collect it, recapture it, be­\nfore it leaves his possession.” Rock Creek Ditch & Flume\nCo. v. Miller, 93 Mont. 248, 268, 17 P. 2d 1074, 1080\n(1933); see also A. Stone, Montana Water Law 66 (1994)\n(noting that, according to the “early cases,” while “the\nwater is still seeping and running off one’s own land, the\nlandowner is free to recapture and further use it”).\n  The right of recapture discussed in these authorities is\nbroad. As the Special Master recognized, the “language of\n14                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Wyoming Supreme Court . . . was expansive” in\nBinning, Bower, and Fuss, and “all appear to hold that an\nappropriator in Wyoming can increase his water use effi­\nciency by recovering runoff on his property or through\nother means so long as the increased consumption is on\nthe same land to which the appropriative right attaches.”\nReport 81; see also id., at 78–85; Thompson, Case Note,\nWater Law—Reusing Irrigation Waste Water on Different\nLands: A Warning to Get a New Permit, Fuss v. Franks,\n610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), 16 Land & Water L. Rev. 71, 76\n(1981) (concluding that in Wyoming, “a prior appropriator\ncan at anytime, utilize irrigation methods that are totally\nconsumptive, such as pumping the collected waste water\nback to the top of the field or installing a sprinkler system,\nthereby eliminating all waste of water”); Jones, Note,\nRights of the Original Appropriator to Recapture Water\nUsed in Irrigation, 11 Wyo. L. J. 39 (1956); Wille, Note,\nThe Right to Use Waste Water Before It Re-enters the\nStream, 12 Wyo. L. J. 47, 48 (1957).\n  The Wyoming and Montana doctrine of recapture\nstrongly suggests that improvements in irrigation effi­\nciency are within the original appropriative right of Wyo­\nming’s pre-1950 water users. By using sprinklers rather\nthan flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap­\nture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep­\nage and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,\ncruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They\nare simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume\nof water available to the crops without changing the\namount of diversion. Binning, Bower, and Fuss expressly\nacknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators\nwho have perfected their own appropriative rights are\nnonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from\nwhich their water flows.

One scholar asserted: “[O]f course,\nincreasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of\nwater available to downstream users who may rely on\nreturn flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,\ndoes not preclude more efficient uses merely because a\ndownstream user may be injured.” Squillace, A Critical\nLook at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land & Water L. Rev.\n307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (“For example, a\nfarmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water\napplied to his land is free to change his crop or method of\napplying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%”);\nsee also Thompson, supra, at 76 (“[A] prior appropriator\ncan at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby\neliminating all waste of water”). And a national hornbook\non water law has observed:\n      “The rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged\n    water on the original land can result in more water\n    being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con­\n    suming less than the permitted amount of water and\n    plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more\n    efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water\n    that had previously been returned to the stream\n    might be consumed. This can deprive other appro­\n    priators of water on which they depend but it is al­\n    lowed since it is technically within the terms of the\n    original appropriation.” Getches 143–144.\nMontana has not identified any scholars who have reached\nthe opposite conclusion.\n  For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of\nappropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro­\npriators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the\ndetriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac­\n16                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See\nsupra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule\nin Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and\nits broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and\nthe specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in\nthe same direction, which also comports with the Special\nMaster’s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,\nif Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles\nof appropriation law, it allows Wyoming’s pre-1950 water\nusers to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the\ndetriment of Montana’s pre-1950 users.\n                              B\n  Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that\neven if background principles of appropriation law do not\nsupport its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not\nprotect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.\nMontana claims that the Compact’s definition of “benefi­\ncial use” restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro­\npriative rights to the net volume of water that was actu­\nally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special\nMaster that this argument also fails.\n                               1\n   Article V(A) protects “[a]ppropriative rights to the bene­\nficial uses of . . . water.” “Beneficial use,” in turn, is de­\nfined in Article II(H) as “that use by which the water\nsupply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em­\nployed by the activities of man.” 65 Stat. 665. Montana\ncontends that “beneficial use” is thus defined as the\namount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity\nthat increases pre-1950 water users’ depletions in Wyo­\nming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the\nappropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief\nfor Montana 25–28. On this basis, Montana asserts that\nthe Compact requires (subject to river conditions) that the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsame quantity of water that was reaching Montana as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, continue to do so. Id., at 26.\n                              2\n   We acknowledge that “beneficial use” refers to a type of\nuse that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.\nSee Report 61. The part of the Compact’s definition of\n“beneficial use” that refers to depletion—“that use by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted”—is fairly clear. It\nbegins with “that use,” and the words that follow merely\nexplain that “that use” must be a use that “deplete[s]” the\n“water supply.” Nothing in the language suggests that\n“beneficial use” means a measure of the amount of water\ndepleted. A “beneficial use” within the meaning of the\nCompact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water\nsupply.\n   This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum­\nstances existing in the signatory States when the Compact\nwas drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory\npreference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over\npower generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n§71–402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would\nhave been written to protect the irrigation uses that were\nlegislatively favored and represented the predominant use\nof the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–\n47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the\nCompact recognizes “the great importance of water for\nirrigation in the signatory States”).\n   Montana’s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not\nfollow from the text and would drastically redefine the\nterm “beneficial use” from its longstanding meaning. The\namount of water put to “beneficial use” has never been\ndefined by net water consumption. The quantity of water\n“beneficially used” in irrigation, for example, has always\nincluded some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,\nevaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re­\n18                MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,\nwater put to “[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con­\nsumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.” 1\nWiel §481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea­\nsonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12\nWyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial\nuse and noting that “the method of application, by flood­\ning, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial”); J. Sax, B.\nThompson, J. Leshy, & R. Adams, Legal Control of Water\nResources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation\npractices and observing that the amount of water put to\nbeneficial use “is often considerably more than the quan­\ntum actually consumed”).\n   If the Compact’s definition of “beneficial use” were\nmeant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for\nnet water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.\nFor example, the Compact could have stated that it would\nprotect “only ‘the amount of water consumed for a benefi­\ncial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.’ ”\nReport 60. Or it could have defined “beneficial use” as the\n“volume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.” More­\nover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\nordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),\nwhich expressly states that “the laws governing the acqui­\nsition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria­\ntion” control, would make little sense.\n   We agree with the Special Master that the definition of\nbeneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti­\ncle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro­\npriative rights that it protects in both States.\n                           3\n  Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee\nMontana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as\nplainly as other compacts that do just that. By 1950,\nWyoming itself had entered into at least one compact that\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefined water rights in terms of depletion. The Colorado\nRiver Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of\nwater per year for “the exclusive beneficial consumptive\nuse” of several upstream States, including Wyoming. That\ncompact specifically added that “[t]he States of the Upper\nDivision will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to\nbe depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for\nany period of ten consecutive years . . . .”        National\nResources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Inter­\nstate Water Compacts, 1785–1941, p. 8 (1942). See also\nRepublican River Compact (1943), Kan. Stat. Ann.\n§82a–518 (1997) (allocating water by the acre-foot for\nbeneficial consumptive use in Kansas, Nebraska, and\nColorado). And, even here in the Yellowstone River Com­\npact, Article V(B) unambiguously apportions the third tier\nof Yellowstone River system water by percentage. 65 Stat.\n666. The notion that Article V(A) accomplishes essen-\ntially the same sort of depletive allocation with language\nthat has a different and longstanding meaning is simply\nunpersuasive.\n                          *    *    *\n  We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect\nordinary “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of\n[water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January\n1, 1950.” Art. V(A), ibid. And the best evidence we have\nshows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and\nMontana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of\ntheir irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down­\nstream appropriators. Montana’s allegation that Wyo­\nming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allow­\ning its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation\nefficiency thus fails to state a claim. Accordingly, Mon­\ntana’s first exception to the Special Master’s First Interim\nReport is overruled.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n20              MONTANA v.

The Court interprets the Yel\nlowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,\n1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the\nright to increase their consumption so long as they do not\nincrease the volume of water they diverted beyond pre\n1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that\nthe increased consumption interferes with its residents’\npre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because\nthe Court’s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident\nreading of the common law, see ante, at 7–8, and n. 5, for\nthe Compact’s definition of “beneficial use.”\n   The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water\nrights along a river, on a “first in time[,] . . . superior in\nright” basis, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459\n(1922), to those who divert its flow and apply the water to\na beneficial use. See Hinderlider v. La Plata River &\n——————\n  * The dictionary-approved term is “Wyomingite,” which is also the\nname of a type of lava, see Webster’s New International Dictionary\n2961 (2d ed. 1957). I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better.\n2                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938). The\n“beneficial use” requirement does most of the legal work.\nIt marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative\nright—irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see\nUnited States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,\n504, n. 2 (1945); and it “measure[s]” the extent of an ap\npropriator’s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,\n505 (1924); A. Tarlock, Law of Water Rights and Re\nsources §§5:66, 5:68–5:69, pp. 5–130.3, 5–130.9 to 5–\n130.10 (2010). At common law, an appropriator claims the\nvolume of water diverted and “reasonably required” by his\nintended use. Id., §§5:65–5:66, at 5–127, 5–130.2; see\nQuinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 377–378,\n92 P. 2d 568, 570–571 (1939).\n   The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to\ndefine the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel\nlowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises\nthat “[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the\nwater of the Yellowstone River System existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.”\n65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a “Beneficial\nUse” is one “by which the water supply of a drainage basin\nis depleted when usefully employed by the activities of\nman.” Id., at 665 (emphasis added).\n   Like the common law, this definition lays out the types\nof uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water\nan appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But\nthe Compact’s focus on whether a use depletes a river’s\nwater supply—not whether it diverts the river’s flow—\nsignificantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming\nis entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may\nlay claim only to its beneficial users’ net consumption of\nwater, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river\nminus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nriver’s channel.\n   This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives\nmeaning to the definition’s use of the word “depleted.” I\ncannot write off as an accident the choice of this word\nrather than the word consistently used elsewhere in the\nCompact: “diverted.” See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). The Compact’s authors knew\nhow to use “diverted” and “diversion” when they wanted\nto. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions\nof the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D),\n65 Stat. 665–668; and the Compact defines them in the\nsentence immediately preceding the definition of “benefi\ncial use.” See Art. II(G), id., at 665. But the Compact’s\nauthors chose to define beneficial use in terms of deple\ntion—the first and only time the Compact uses any deriva\ntive of the word “deplete.” It is in my view a clear indica\ntion that the Compact intends to break from the common\nlaw’s focus on diversion.\n   The Court reduces the Compact’s deliberate use of “de\npleted” to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to\ntoday’s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of\nuses that confer appropriative rights. “Nothing in the\nlanguage,” it says, “suggests that ‘beneficial use’ means a\nmeasure of the amount of water depleted.” Ante, at 17.\nThis is incomprehensible. On the Court’s own interpreta\ntion “beneficial use” not only defines the types of uses that\nconfer appropriative rights, but also determines the vol\nume of water to which the rights attach—viz., only that\nvolume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only\nquestion before us is whether “beneficial use” measures\nthe volume diverted or the volume depleted—and the\nlanguage of the Compact makes that clear.\n   The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of\nthe word “depleted” instead of “diverted.” Its best effort\nis the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that\nhydroelectric power generation and other disfavored,\n4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See\nibid. That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, rely\ning on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion\nwould be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accom\nplish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished\nby other provisions of the Compact. One would instead\nhave expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfa\nvored uses from the “usefu[l] . . . activities of man,”\nArt. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights.\nCf. Mont. Code Ann. §85–2–102(4) (2009) (listing types of\nbeneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively,\nhydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races—\nthe allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United\nStates offer up to explain the word “depleted”—are already\nexcluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any\nneed for appropriative rights) by the Compact’s definition\nof diversion: “the taking or removing of water from the\nYellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water\nso taken or removed is not returned directly into the\nchannel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from\nwhich it is taken.” Art. II(G), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying\nclause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric\ndams, water wheels and mill races, which, when they\ndivert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, “re\ntur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is\ntaken.”\n  The Court objects to my interpretation because the word\n“depleted” lacks the “clarity” necessary to “drastically\nredefine the term ‘beneficial use’ from its longstanding\nmeaning,” ante, at 17. According to the Court, “[t]he\namount of water put to ‘beneficial use’ has never been\ndefined by net water consumption.” Ibid. Before making\nthis statement, the Court has spent some 10 pages, ante,\nat 7–16, conducting a “sensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels\ncaution”; into a field (state water law) where the answer of\nthis Court is not conclusive and hence not ipso facto cor\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The\nCourt calls that hitherto unanswered question “the law of\nreturn flows,” ante, at 7, but it can more accurately be\ndescribed as the question whether the volume of water to\nwhich an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume\ndiverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume\ndepleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that “bene\nficial use” has never had the “longstanding meaning” the\nCourt posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to\nall water diverted from the stream rather than all water\ndepleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of\nwhich of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite\nextraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic\nefforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answer\ning a state water-law question that no court of any West\nern State has ever answered—a question that would cross\na Rabbi’s eyes—when the text in front of us provides\nthe clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned:\n“depleted.”\n   The Court suggests that if the Compact’s authors\nwanted to break from (what it considers) the common law,\nthey should have defined beneficial use as the “volume by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted.” Ante, at 18 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to\nme to have little force when the Court cannot explain what\nwork “depleted” is supposed to do other than indicate\nprecisely the same concept more concisely. And the\nCourt’s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with\ngreater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court’s advice\nwould make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact.\nThat provision allocates a fixed percentage “of the unused\nand unappropriated water” of various tributaries to each\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState for post-1950 “storage or direct diversions for benefi\ncial use on new lands or for other purposes.” 65 Stat. 666.\nBut if “beneficial use” in this last phrase means “the vol\nume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,”\nthe provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed\npercentage of unused and unappropriated water for “a\nvolume of water by which the water supply is depleted.” It\nmakes perfect sense, of course, if “beneficial use” means all\nuses that deplete the stream.\n   The Court also wonders why, “if Article V(A) were in\ntended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,” it\ndid not “d[o] so as plainly as other” interstate water com\npacts “that do just that.” Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.\nMontana does not demand a precise volume of water each\nyear; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al\nways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.\nIt merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the\nsame position relative to Wyoming’s pre-1950 users in\n2011 as they did in 1950—that whatever would have\nflowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro\npriators’ beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this\nyear’s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon\ntanans will have to make do with less or go without.\n   Because I think the Court’s disposition disregards the\ntext of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/215807/", "sha1": "8bf16b449447057318772b725ada6aa8f1bed935", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-05-02T07:29:25"}
