WYOMING ET AL.\n\n          ON EXCEPTION TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n\n    No. 137, Orig. Argued January 10, 2011\u2014Decided May 2, 2011\nArticle V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact ratified by Montana,\n  Wyoming, and North Dakota provides: \u201cAppropriative rights to the\n  beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing\n  in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be en\n  joyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use\n  of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d 65 Stat. 666. Montana\n  filed a bill of complaint, alleging that Wyoming breached Article V(A)\n  by allowing its upstream pre-1950 water users to switch from flood to\n  sprinkler irrigation, which increases crop consumption of water and\n  decreases the volume of runoff and seepage returning to the river\n  system. Thus, even if Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users divert the same\n  quantity of water as before, less water reaches downstream users in\n  Montana. Concluding that the Compact permits more efficient irri\n  gation systems so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the\n  same acreage watered in 1950, the Special Master found that Mon\n  tana\u2019s increased-efficiency allegation failed to state a claim. Montana\n  has filed an exception.\nHeld: Because Article V(A) of the Compact incorporates the ordinary\n doctrine of appropriation without significant qualification, and be\n cause in Wyoming and Montana that doctrine allows appropriators to\n improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\n stream appropriators, Montana\u2019s increased-efficiency allegation fails\n to state a claim for breach of the Compact under Article V(A). Pp. 4\u2013\n 19.\n    (a) Background appropriation law principles do not support Mon\n tana\u2019s position. The doctrine of appropriation provides that rights to\n water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority,\n starting with the first person to divert water from a natural stream\n and apply it to a \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d Once perfected, that water right is\n2                       MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    senior to any later appropriators\u2019 rights and may be fulfilled entirely\n    before the junior appropriators get any water. However, junior ap\n    propriators do acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when\n    they find it. Under this no-injury rule, junior users may, subject to\n    the fulfillment of the senior users\u2019 existing rights, prevent senior us\n    ers from enlarging their rights to the junior users\u2019 detriment. Here,\n    the question is whether a switch to more efficient irrigation with less\n    return flow is within Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 existing appropriat\n    ive rights or is an improper enlargement of that right. Although the\n    law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the\n    Special Master correctly concluded that Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\n    may switch to sprinkler irrigation. Pp. 4\u201316.\n         (1) A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of\n    the no-injury rule in Montana and Wyoming, which generally con\n    cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or pur\n    pose of use. Thus, an appropriator may increase his consumption by\n    changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no\n    change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. Ordinary,\n    day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.\n    Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, if that\n    was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through\n    the years. Irrigation system improvements seem to be the same sort\n    of changes. This view is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both\n    States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but\n    neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irri\n    gation methods. Cases in both States frequently describe the no\n    injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of\n    use, and place of use. The abundance of litigation over such\n    changes\u2014and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at\n    issue here\u2014strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements\n    were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) The doctrine of recapture\u2014which permits an appropriator\n    who has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own\n    runoff and seepage before it escapes his control or his property\u2014also\n    supports treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the\n    original appropriative right. Montana and Wyoming cases appear to\n    apply this basic doctrine without any qualification based on whether\n    the return flow would re-enter the original stream or not. By using\n    sprinklers instead of flood irrigation, Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water us\n    ers effectively recapture water. The sprinklers reduce loss from\n    seepage and runoff and are simply different mechanisms for increas\n    ing the volume of water available to crops without changing the\n    amount of diversion.

S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n       (3) This conclusion is consistent with the view of water law\n  scholars who have considered the question presented in this case.\n  Pp. 15\u201316.\n     (b) Also unpersuasive is Montana\u2019s argument that, if background\n  appropriation law principles do not support its position, Article V(A)\u2019s\n  \u201cbeneficial use\u201d definition nonetheless restricts the scope of pre-1950\n  appropriative rights to the net volume of water that was actually be\n  ing consumed in 1950. Pp. 16\u201319.\n       (1) \u201cBeneficial use\u201d is \u201cthat use by which the water supply of a\n  drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities\n  of man.\u201d 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that the term means the\n  amount of depletion, and thus any activity increasing Wyoming\u2019s pre\n  1950 depletions beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds Article V(A)\u2019s scope.\n  Pp. 16\u201317.\n       (2) Nothing in the Compact\u2019s definition suggests such an inter\n  pretation. A plain reading indicates that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d is a type of\n  use that depletes the water supply. This view is supported by the\n  circumstances in the signatory States when the Compact was\n  drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference for irriga\n  tion, a depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. It\n  thus it makes sense for the Compact to protect irrigation uses that\n  were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of\n  the Yellowstone River system. Montana\u2019s reading, by contrast, would\n  drastically redefine the term. The amount of water put to \u201cbeneficial\n  use\u201d has never been defined by net water consumption. In irrigation,\n  that amount has always included a measure of necessary loss, e.g.,\n  runoff or evaporation. If the Compact\u2019s definition were meant to\n  drastically redefine \u201cbeneficial use,\u201d this Court would expect far more\n  clarity. Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\n  ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which ex\n  pressly states that \u201cthe laws governing the acquisition and use of wa\n  ter under the doctrine of appropriation\u201d control, would make little\n  sense. Pp. 17\u201318.\n       (3) If Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set\n  quantity of water, it could have done so plainly, as done in other\n  compacts, e.g., the Colorado River Compact of 1922. Pp. 18\u201319.\nException overruled.\n\n   THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC. J., and KENNEDY, GINSBURG, BREYER, ALITO, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ.,\njoined.

STATE OF\n\n    WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA \n\n  ON EXCEPTION TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [May 2, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case arises out of a dispute between Montana and\nWyoming over the Yellowstone River Compact. Montana\nalleges that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the\nCompact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to\nincrease their net water consumption by improving the\nefficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems,\nMontana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the\namount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriv\u00ad\ning Montana\u2019s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of\nwater to which they are entitled. The Special Master has\nfiled a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here,\nthat Montana\u2019s allegation fails to state a claim because\nmore efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the\nCompact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate\nthe same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the\nSpecial Master and overrule Montana\u2019s exception to that\nconclusion.\n                            I\n   From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River\nflows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then\nNorth Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. Several\n2                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue,\nPowder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and\ncross into Montana before joining the main stem of the\nYellowstone River. This river system\u2019s monthly and an\u00ad\nnual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary\nwidely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and\nPowder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.\n936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it\nbecame expedient to build water storage facilities for\npreserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master 6 (hereinafter Report).\n   Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress\nsought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone\nRiver system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da\u00ad\nkota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to\nnegotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47\nStat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,\nand 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in\n1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the\nYellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.\nAct of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.\n   The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three\ntiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: \u201cAppropria\u00ad\ntive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow\u00ad\nstone River System existing in each signatory State as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor\u00ad\ndance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of\nwater under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d Id., at 666.\nSecond, Article V(B) allocates to each State the \u201cquantity\nof that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen\u00ad\ntal water supplies\u201d for the pre-1950 uses protected by\nArticle V(A). Ibid. Third, \u201cthe remainder of the unused\nand unappropriated water\u201d of each tributary is divided by\npercentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water\nin the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%\nin the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrest goes to Montana. Id., at 666\u2013667.\n   In February 2008, we granted Montana leave to file a\nbill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Com\u00ad\npact. 552 U. S. 1175. Montana alleged that Wyoming had\nbreached the Compact by consuming more than its share\nof the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3,\n\u00b68. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was ap\u00ad\npropriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses:\nirrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities;\nconducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing con\u00ad\nsumption on existing agricultural acreage.1 Id., at 3\u20134,\n\u00b6\u00b6 9\u201312. According to Montana\u2019s complaint, the Compact\ndid not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these\npractices as long as Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 rights\nremained unfulfilled. Id., at 3, \u00b68.\n   In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred\nthe motion to him. 555 U. S. __ (2008). After briefing and\nargument, the Special Master recommended that we deny\nWyoming\u2019s motion, because at least some of Montana\u2019s\nallegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master\nfound that \u201cArticle V of the Compact protects pre-1950\nappropriations in Montana from new surface and ground\u00ad\nwater diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for\nstorage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Mon\u00ad\ntana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.\u201d Report 14\u2013\n15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that\nMontana\u2019s allegations regarding \u201cefficiency improvements\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Montana   has since clarified that increased consumption on existing\nacreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The\n\u201cefficiency\u201d of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of\nwastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or\ndeep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is\nlater available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation\nsystem loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of\nwater from the river, net water consumption is increased.\n4                     MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming\u201d do not state a\nclaim for relief. Id., at 15. The States did not object to\nmost of the Special Master\u2019s findings, and we have issued\norders accordingly. See 562 U. S. __ (2010); 562 U. S. __\n(2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special\nMaster\u2019s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It\nis this exception that is before us.2\n                              II\n   Article V(A) of the Compact states that \u201c[a]ppropriative\nrights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\u00ad\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d\nMontana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators\u2019 rights are\nnot \u201ccontinu[ing] to be enjoyed\u201d because upstream pre\u00ad\n1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their\nconsumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irriga\u00ad\ntion. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase\ncrop consumption of water and decrease the volume of\nrunoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder\nrivers by 25% or more.3 See Montana\u2019s Exception and\nBrief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even\nif Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users divert the same quan\u00ad\ntity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. Ac\u00ad\ncording to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from\nallowing this practice when it deprives Montana\u2019s pre\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master\u2019s finding\n\nthat if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users\nby curtailing its post-1950 uses without \u201cprejudic[ing] Montana\u2019s other\nrights under the Compact,\u201d then an intrastate remedy is \u201cthe appropri\u00ad\nate solution.\u201d Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special\nMaster. 562 U. S. __ (2010).\n  3 For purposes of resolving Wyoming\u2019s motion to dismiss, we take as\n\ntrue Montana\u2019s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually\nreduce return flow to the rivers. Wyoming has not conceded that this is\ntrue. See Wyoming\u2019s Reply to Montana\u2019s Exception 35, n. 6.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1950 users of their full water rights.\n  The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows\nWyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users\u2014diverting the same\nquantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and\nacreage as before 1950\u2014to increase their consumption of\nwater by improving their irrigation systems even if it\nreduces the flow of water to Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users.\nMontana makes two basic arguments: that background\nprinciples of appropriation law, to the extent they are\nincorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an in\u00ad\ncrease in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms\nof the Compact amended those principles in Montana\u2019s\nfavor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and\nso do we.\n                              A\n   Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects\n\u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]\u201d as\nof 1950 \u201cin accordance with the laws governing the ac-\nquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appro\u00ad\npriation,\u201d we begin with an overview of appropriation\ndoctrine.4 As the Special Master explained, if \u201c[a]p\u00ad\npropriation law clearly proscribe[s] increases in consump\u00ad\ntion on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream\nappropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit\nWyoming from allowing its appropriators to make\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 As  with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the\nintent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily\nto the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the\nStates, we also look to Western water law more generally and authori\u00ad\nties from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed\nthat the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We\ntherefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appro\u00ad\npriation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution\nof the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or\nshrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana\u2019s exception\nwithout prejudice to that issue. See Report 39\u201340.\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch increases to the detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950\nuses.\u201d Report 65.\n   As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of\nappropriation has governed water rights in Montana and\nWyoming since the 1800\u2019s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,\n20 Wall. 670, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine\nprovides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected\nand enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first\nperson to divert water from a natural stream and apply it\nto a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently\ncompleted). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry\nCreek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali\nfornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565\u2013566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,\n\u00a73 (\u201cPriority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give\nthe better right\u201d). The scope of the right is limited by the\nconcept of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d That concept restricts a farmer\n\u201cto the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his\nland by making a reasonable use of the water.\u201d 1 C.\nKinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights \u00a7586, pp.\n1007\u20131008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v. Tintinger, 45\nMont. 154, 176\u2013178, 122 P. 575, 583 (1912); Quinn v. John\nWhitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 376\u2013380, 92 P. 2d 568,\n570\u2013571 (1939). Once such a water right is perfected, it is\nsenior to any later appropriators\u2019 rights and may be ful\u00ad\nfilled entirely before those junior appropriators get any\nwater at all.\n   For our purposes, Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users are\nsimilar to junior appropriators. As between the States,\nthe Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre\u00ad\n1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for\nMontana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.\nBut as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal\nseniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop\nWyoming\u2019s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising\ntheir water rights.

Tr. of Oral Arg.\n51.\n   Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,\nhowever. As they come online, appropriators acquire\nrights to the stream basically as it exists when they find\nit. See 2 Kinney \u00a7803, at 1403\u20131404. Accordingly, subject\nto the fulfillment of all senior users\u2019 existing rights, under\nthe no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users\nfrom enlarging their rights to the junior users\u2019 detriment.\n1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen West\u00ad\nern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).\n   Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users can therefore \u201cinsist that\n[Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly\nwithin the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the\namount of water within the extent of their appropriation\nwhich they actually apply to some beneficial use.\u201d 2\nKinney \u00a7784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis\u00ad\nputed; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to\nmore efficient irrigation with less return flow within the\nextent of Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 existing appropriative\nrights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to\nthe detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users?\n   As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows\nis an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65\n(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.\nL. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us\nto any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, \u201c[n]o west\u00ad\nern state court appears to have conclusively answered the\nquestion.\u201d Report 65.\n   Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found\nseveral reasons to conclude that Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\nmay switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the\nscope of the original appropriative right includes such a\nchange so long as no additional water is diverted from the\n8                      MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstream and the conserved water is used on the same acre\u00ad\nage for the same agricultural purpose as before. We agree\nwith the Special Master.5\n                             1\n   First, although the no-injury rule prevents appropria\u00ad\ntors from making certain water-right changes that would\nharm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods\ndoes not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and\nWyoming. See id., at 69. Because each new appropriator\nis entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the\ngeneral rule is that \u201cif a change in these conditions is\nmade by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the\nflow of the water to the material injury of [the junior\nappropriator\u2019s] rights, he may justly complain.\u201d 2 Kinney\n\u00a7803, at 1404.\n   But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally con\u00ad\ncerns changes in the location of the diversion and the\nplace or purpose of use. Quigley v. McIntosh, 110 Mont.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The lack of clarity in this area of water law highlights the sensitive\n\nnature of our inquiry and counsels caution. Our original jurisdiction\nover cases between States brings us this dispute between Montana and\nWyoming about the meaning of their congressionally approved Yellow\u00ad\nstone River Compact. See U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71251(a). Yet, because the Compact references and the parties direct\nus to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed\nin state water law. See n. 4, supra. Our assessment of the scope of\nthese water rights is merely a federal court\u2019s description of state law.\n   The highest court of each State, of course, remains \u201cthe final arbiter\nof what is state law.\u201d West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 311\nU. S. 223, 236 (1940). We recognize that appropriation doctrine contin\u00ad\nues to evolve, and there are reasonable policy arguments in favor of\nboth States\u2019 positions here. But it is not this Court\u2019s role to guide the\ndevelopment of state water regulation. See id., at 237 (\u201c[I]t is the duty\nof [federal courts] in every case to ascertain from all the available data\nwhat the state law is and apply it rather than to prescribe a different\nrule, however superior it may appear from the viewpoint of \u2018general\nlaw\u2019 \u201d). Our decision is not intended to restrict the States\u2019 determina\u00ad\ntion of their respective appropriation doctrines.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Accordingly, certain types of changes can occur\neven though they may harm downstream appropriators.\nSee D. Getches, Water Law in a Nutshell 175 (4th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Getches). For instance, an appropriator\nmay increase his consumption by changing to a more\nwater-intensive crop so long as he makes no change in\nacreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. See id., at\n183; East Bench Irrig. Co. v. Deseret Irrig. Co., 2 Utah 2d\n170, 179, 271 P. 2d 449, 455 (1954) (assuming that farm\u00ad\ners may \u201clegally increase the quantity of water consumed\nin irrigating their lands by changing to more water con\u00ad\nsuming crops\u201d and adding that \u201cit would be difficult to\nprevent . . . such increased consumptive use\u201d). Ordinary,\nday-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not\nviolate the no-injury rule. See, e.g., 1 Wiel \u00a756, at 51\n(\u201cWould the fact that my pump has for years dripped\nwater onto a neighbor\u2019s ground give him a right to say\nthat my pump must go on leaking?\u201d). Consumption can\neven be increased by adding farm acreage, so long as that\nwas part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued\nthrough the years. See Van Tassel Real Estate & Live\nStock Co. v. Cheyenne, 49 Wyo. 333, 357\u2013359, 54 P. 2d 906,\n913 (1936) (per curiam); 1 Hutchins 377\u2013378; St. Onge v.\nBlakely, 76 Mont. 1, 22\u201324, 245 P. 532, 539 (1926).\n  Improvements to irrigation systems seem to be the sort\nof changes that fall outside the no-injury rule as it exists\nin Montana and Wyoming. Those changes are not to the\n\u201cplace of diversion, or place or purpose of use,\u201d Quigley,\nsupra, at 505, 103 P. 2d, at 1072, and thus seem to be\nexcluded, much like crop changes or day-to-day irrigation\n10                    MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nadjustments or repairs. This is also consistent with the\nfact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating\ncertain changes to water rights, but neither required\nfarmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation\nmethods.6 See Report 69\u201370, 87; id., at 69 (they \u201cdo not\ngenerally have procedures for overseeing changes in water\nefficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im\u00ad\nprovements where there are no formal changes in the\nunderlying water rights\u201d). Like the Special Master, we\nfind this to be persuasive evidence that the States consid\u00ad\nered such changes permissible.\n   Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private\nlawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency\nchanges. But it has not provided a single example from\neither State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi\u00ad\ncally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in\npoint of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,\ne.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig. Dist., 90 Mont. 344, 355\u2013\n357, 3 P. 2d 286, 291 (1931); Thayer v. Rawlins, 594 P. 2d\n951, 955 (Wyo. 1979). The abundance of litigation over\nsuch changes\u2014and the absence of any litigation over the\nsort of change at issue here\u2014strongly implies that irriga\u00ad\ntion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury\nrule and were considered within the scope of the original\nappropriative right.\n                            2\n  The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im\u00ad\nprovements in irrigation efficiency as within the original\nappropriative right. Under this doctrine, an appropriator\nwho has diverted water for irrigation purposes has the\nright to recapture and reuse his own runoff and seepage\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Mont.

United States, 263 U. S. 497, 506 (1924)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Arizona Pub.\nServ. Co. v. Long, 160 Ariz. 429, 437\u2013438, 773 P. 2d 988,\n996\u2013997 (1989) (\u201cNo appropriator can compel any other\nappropriator to continue the waste of water which benefits\nthe former. If the senior appropriator, through scientific\nand technical advances, can utilize his water so that none\nis wasted, no other appropriator can complain\u201d).\n   Montana contends that this rule does not apply when\nthe runoff or seepage water would, if not recaptured,\nreturn to the same stream from which it was originally\ndrawn. There is some support for Montana\u2019s position\u2014\nthat a beneficial user may not reuse water at all, even\nwhile it is still on his property, if it otherwise would flow\nback to the same stream\u2014especially in Utah and Colorado\ncases. See Deseret Irrig. Co., supra, at 180\u2013182, 271 P. 2d,\nat 456\u2013457; Estate of Steed v. New Escalante Irrig. Co.,\n846 P. 2d 1223, 1226 (Utah 1992); Comstock v.

Rev. 541, 544, n. 18 (1965) (noting the general doctrine of recapture,\nand adding that \u201c[t]he Colorado rule, however, is to the contrary\u201d);\nUnited States v. Tilley, 124 F. 2d 850, 858 (CA8 1941) (allowing recap\u00ad\nture by the original appropriator under Nebraska law, and noting\nColorado\u2019s opposite rule).\n12                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(asserting that, even in Utah, \u201cwhere the original appro\u00ad\npriator retains possession and control of the waste and\nseepage water from irrigation of his lands, he is entitled to\nreuse these waters for his own benefit and need not return\nthem to the channel from which they were diverted\u201d (em\u00ad\nphasis added)); Getches 139\u2013145; Woolman v. Garringer, 1\nMont. 535 (1872). And Montana cites no case from either\nState here in which a court has recognized, much less\nfound controlling, the idea that a water user may not\nreuse his own wastewater while it is still on his property\nsimply because it otherwise would return to the original\nstream.\n  In fact, Montana and Wyoming appear to apply, without\nqualification, the basic doctrine that the original appro\u00ad\npriator may freely recapture his used water while it re\u00ad\nmains on his property and reuse it for the same purpose\non the same land. For example, in Binning v. Miller, 55\nWyo. 451, 102 P. 2d 54 (1940), a man was diverting water\nfrom a creek fed largely by irrigation runoff and seepage\nfrom Binning\u2019s property. Although the court found that\nthe man had a right to that water once Binning\u2019s runoff\nand seepage had become a natural stream, it noted that\nhis right remained subject to Binning\u2019s right \u201cto use the\nwater above mentioned for beneficial purposes upon the\nland for which the seepage water was [originally] appro\u00ad\npriated.\u201d Id., at 477, 102 P. 2d, at 63. In a later case, the\ncourt explained that the man could not \u201csecure a perma\u00ad\nnent right to continue to receive the water\u201d because\nBinning \u201cmight find better ways of utilizing the water on\nthe same land so that less waste and seepage would oc\u00ad\ncur.\u201d Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., 77 Wyo. 80, 101, 307\nP. 2d 593, 601 (1957).\n  Similarly, in Bower v. Big Horn Canal Assn., the court\nheld that Bower could appropriate water as it seeped\nacross his property from the Big Horn Canal toward a\nnearby river. Id., at 102\u2013104, 307 P. 2d, at 602. The court\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadded, however, that Bower\u2019s right was subject always to\nthe Big Horn Canal\u2019s right: \u201cNo appropriator can compel\nany other appropriator to continue the waste of water\nwhich benefits the former.\u201d Id., at 101, 307 P. 2d, at 601.\nImportantly, the court noted that \u201c[i]f the senior appro\u00ad\npriator by a different method of irrigation can so utilize\nhis water that it is all consumed in transpiration and\nconsumptive use and no waste water returns by seepage\nor percolation to the river, no other appropriator can\ncomplain.\u201d Ibid.\n  Finally, in Fuss v. Franks, 610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980),\nwater was seeping from Fuss\u2019 property and into a pit in a\npublic right of way. Franks was the first to appropriate\nthe water from the pit. The court upheld Franks\u2019 appro\u00ad\npriation right because the water had already escaped from\nFuss\u2019 property. The court said that the \u201cowner of land\nupon which seepage or waste water rises has the right to\nuse and reuse\u2014capture and recapture\u2014such waste wa\u00ad\nters,\u201d but only before the water escapes his land, and \u201cfor\nuse only upon the land for which the water forming the\nseepage was originally appropriated.\u201d Id., at 20 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Fuss thus had no superior\nright to the water that had left his property, and espe\u00ad\ncially not for reuse on other lands.\n  The law in Montana is similar. The Montana Supreme\nCourt has explained that \u201cthe general rule . . . is that the\nowner of the right to use the water\u2014his private property\nwhile in his possession,\u2014may collect it, recapture it, be\u00ad\nfore it leaves his possession.\u201d Rock Creek Ditch & Flume\nCo. v.

Stone, Montana Water Law 66 (1994)\n(noting that, according to the \u201cearly cases,\u201d while \u201cthe\nwater is still seeping and running off one\u2019s own land, the\nlandowner is free to recapture and further use it\u201d).\n  The right of recapture discussed in these authorities is\nbroad. As the Special Master recognized, the \u201clanguage of\n14                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Wyoming Supreme Court . . . was expansive\u201d in\nBinning, Bower, and Fuss, and \u201call appear to hold that an\nappropriator in Wyoming can increase his water use effi\u00ad\nciency by recovering runoff on his property or through\nother means so long as the increased consumption is on\nthe same land to which the appropriative right attaches.\u201d\nReport 81; see also id., at 78\u201385; Thompson, Case Note,\nWater Law\u2014Reusing Irrigation Waste Water on Different\nLands: A Warning to Get a New Permit, Fuss v. Franks,\n610 P. 2d 17 (Wyo. 1980), 16 Land & Water L. Rev. 71, 76\n(1981) (concluding that in Wyoming, \u201ca prior appropriator\ncan at anytime, utilize irrigation methods that are totally\nconsumptive, such as pumping the collected waste water\nback to the top of the field or installing a sprinkler system,\nthereby eliminating all waste of water\u201d); Jones, Note,\nRights of the Original Appropriator to Recapture Water\nUsed in Irrigation, 11 Wyo. L. J. 39 (1956); Wille, Note,\nThe Right to Use Waste Water Before It Re-enters the\nStream, 12 Wyo. L. J. 47, 48 (1957).\n  The Wyoming and Montana doctrine of recapture\nstrongly suggests that improvements in irrigation effi\u00ad\nciency are within the original appropriative right of Wyo\u00ad\nming\u2019s pre-1950 water users. By using sprinklers rather\nthan flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap\u00ad\nture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep\u00ad\nage and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,\ncruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They\nare simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume\nof water available to the crops without changing the\namount of diversion. Binning, Bower, and Fuss expressly\nacknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators\nwho have perfected their own appropriative rights are\nnonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from\nwhich their water flows. See 55 Wyo., at 474\u2013477, 102\nP. 2d, at 63; 77 Wyo., at 100\u2013104, 307 P. 2d, at 601\u2013602;\n610 P. 2d, at 20.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

One scholar asserted: \u201c[O]f course,\nincreasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of\nwater available to downstream users who may rely on\nreturn flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,\ndoes not preclude more efficient uses merely because a\ndownstream user may be injured.\u201d Squillace, A Critical\nLook at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land & Water L. Rev.\n307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (\u201cFor example, a\nfarmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water\napplied to his land is free to change his crop or method of\napplying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%\u201d);\nsee also Thompson, supra, at 76 (\u201c[A] prior appropriator\ncan at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby\neliminating all waste of water\u201d). And a national hornbook\non water law has observed:\n      \u201cThe rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged\n    water on the original land can result in more water\n    being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con\u00ad\n    suming less than the permitted amount of water and\n    plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more\n    efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water\n    that had previously been returned to the stream\n    might be consumed. This can deprive other appro\u00ad\n    priators of water on which they depend but it is al\u00ad\n    lowed since it is technically within the terms of the\n    original appropriation.\u201d Getches 143\u2013144.\nMontana has not identified any scholars who have reached\nthe opposite conclusion.\n  For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of\nappropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro\u00ad\npriators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the\ndetriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac\u00ad\n16                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See\nsupra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule\nin Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and\nits broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and\nthe specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in\nthe same direction, which also comports with the Special\nMaster\u2019s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,\nif Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles\nof appropriation law, it allows Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water\nusers to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the\ndetriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users.\n                              B\n  Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that\neven if background principles of appropriation law do not\nsupport its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not\nprotect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.\nMontana claims that the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbenefi\u00ad\ncial use\u201d restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro\u00ad\npriative rights to the net volume of water that was actu\u00ad\nally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special\nMaster that this argument also fails.\n                               1\n   Article V(A) protects \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the bene\u00ad\nficial uses of . . . water.\u201d \u201cBeneficial use,\u201d in turn, is de\u00ad\nfined in Article II(H) as \u201cthat use by which the water\nsupply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em\u00ad\nployed by the activities of man.\u201d 65 Stat. 665. Montana\ncontends that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d is thus defined as the\namount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity\nthat increases pre-1950 water users\u2019 depletions in Wyo\u00ad\nming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the\nappropriative rights that Article V(A) protects.

Id., at 26.\n                              2\n   We acknowledge that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d refers to a type of\nuse that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.\nSee Report 61. The part of the Compact\u2019s definition of\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d that refers to depletion\u2014\u201cthat use by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted\u201d\u2014is fairly clear. It\nbegins with \u201cthat use,\u201d and the words that follow merely\nexplain that \u201cthat use\u201d must be a use that \u201cdeplete[s]\u201d the\n\u201cwater supply.\u201d Nothing in the language suggests that\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d means a measure of the amount of water\ndepleted. A \u201cbeneficial use\u201d within the meaning of the\nCompact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water\nsupply.\n   This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum\u00ad\nstances existing in the signatory States when the Compact\nwas drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory\npreference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over\npower generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a771\u2013402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would\nhave been written to protect the irrigation uses that were\nlegislatively favored and represented the predominant use\nof the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45\u2013\n47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the\nCompact recognizes \u201cthe great importance of water for\nirrigation in the signatory States\u201d).\n   Montana\u2019s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not\nfollow from the text and would drastically redefine the\nterm \u201cbeneficial use\u201d from its longstanding meaning. The\namount of water put to \u201cbeneficial use\u201d has never been\ndefined by net water consumption. The quantity of water\n\u201cbeneficially used\u201d in irrigation, for example, has always\nincluded some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,\nevaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re\u00ad\n18                MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,\nwater put to \u201c[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con\u00ad\nsumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.\u201d 1\nWiel \u00a7481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea\u00ad\nsonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12\nWyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial\nuse and noting that \u201cthe method of application, by flood\u00ad\ning, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial\u201d); J. Sax, B.\nThompson, J. Leshy, & R. Adams, Legal Control of Water\nResources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation\npractices and observing that the amount of water put to\nbeneficial use \u201cis often considerably more than the quan\u00ad\ntum actually consumed\u201d).\n   If the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d were\nmeant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for\nnet water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.\nFor example, the Compact could have stated that it would\nprotect \u201conly \u2018the amount of water consumed for a benefi\u00ad\ncial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.\u2019 \u201d\nReport 60. Or it could have defined \u201cbeneficial use\u201d as the\n\u201cvolume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.\u201d More\u00ad\nover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\nordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),\nwhich expressly states that \u201cthe laws governing the acqui\u00ad\nsition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria\u00ad\ntion\u201d control, would make little sense.\n   We agree with the Special Master that the definition of\nbeneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti\u00ad\ncle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro\u00ad\npriative rights that it protects in both States.\n                           3\n  Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee\nMontana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as\nplainly as other compacts that do just that. By 1950,\nWyoming itself had entered into at least one compact that\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefined water rights in terms of depletion. The Colorado\nRiver Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of\nwater per year for \u201cthe exclusive beneficial consumptive\nuse\u201d of several upstream States, including Wyoming. That\ncompact specifically added that \u201c[t]he States of the Upper\nDivision will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to\nbe depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for\nany period of ten consecutive years . . . .\u201d        National\nResources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Inter\u00ad\nstate Water Compacts, 1785\u20131941, p. 8 (1942).

And, even here in the Yellowstone River Com\u00ad\npact, Article V(B) unambiguously apportions the third tier\nof Yellowstone River system water by percentage. 65 Stat.\n666. The notion that Article V(A) accomplishes essen-\ntially the same sort of depletive allocation with language\nthat has a different and longstanding meaning is simply\nunpersuasive.\n                          *    *    *\n  We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect\nordinary \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of\n[water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January\n1, 1950.\u201d Art. V(A), ibid. And the best evidence we have\nshows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and\nMontana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of\ntheir irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\u00ad\nstream appropriators. Montana\u2019s allegation that Wyo\u00ad\nming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allow\u00ad\ning its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation\nefficiency thus fails to state a claim.

The Court interprets the Yel\nlowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,\n1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the\nright to increase their consumption so long as they do not\nincrease the volume of water they diverted beyond pre\n1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that\nthe increased consumption interferes with its residents\u2019\npre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because\nthe Court\u2019s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident\nreading of the common law, see ante, at 7\u20138, and n. 5, for\nthe Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d\n   The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water\nrights along a river, on a \u201cfirst in time[,] . . . superior in\nright\u201d basis, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459\n(1922), to those who divert its flow and apply the water to\na beneficial use. See Hinderlider v.

I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better.\n2                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938). The\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d requirement does most of the legal work.\nIt marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative\nright\u2014irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see\nUnited States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,\n504, n. 2 (1945); and it \u201cmeasure[s]\u201d the extent of an ap\npropriator\u2019s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,\n505 (1924); A. Tarlock, Law of Water Rights and Re\nsources \u00a7\u00a75:66, 5:68\u20135:69, pp. 5\u2013130.3, 5\u2013130.9 to 5\u2013\n130.10 (2010). At common law, an appropriator claims the\nvolume of water diverted and \u201creasonably required\u201d by his\nintended use. Id., \u00a7\u00a75:65\u20135:66, at 5\u2013127, 5\u2013130.2; see\nQuinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., 54 Wyo. 367, 377\u2013378,\n92 P. 2d 568, 570\u2013571 (1939).\n   The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to\ndefine the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel\nlowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises\nthat \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the\nwater of the Yellowstone River System existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d\n65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a \u201cBeneficial\nUse\u201d is one \u201cby which the water supply of a drainage basin\nis depleted when usefully employed by the activities of\nman.\u201d Id., at 665 (emphasis added).\n   Like the common law, this definition lays out the types\nof uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water\nan appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But\nthe Compact\u2019s focus on whether a use depletes a river\u2019s\nwater supply\u2014not whether it diverts the river\u2019s flow\u2014\nsignificantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming\nis entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may\nlay claim only to its beneficial users\u2019 net consumption of\nwater, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river\nminus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nriver\u2019s channel.\n   This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives\nmeaning to the definition\u2019s use of the word \u201cdepleted.\u201d I\ncannot write off as an accident the choice of this word\nrather than the word consistently used elsewhere in the\nCompact: \u201cdiverted.\u201d See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). The Compact\u2019s authors knew\nhow to use \u201cdiverted\u201d and \u201cdiversion\u201d when they wanted\nto. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions\nof the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D),\n65 Stat. 665\u2013668; and the Compact defines them in the\nsentence immediately preceding the definition of \u201cbenefi\ncial use.\u201d See Art. II(G), id., at 665. But the Compact\u2019s\nauthors chose to define beneficial use in terms of deple\ntion\u2014the first and only time the Compact uses any deriva\ntive of the word \u201cdeplete.\u201d It is in my view a clear indica\ntion that the Compact intends to break from the common\nlaw\u2019s focus on diversion.\n   The Court reduces the Compact\u2019s deliberate use of \u201cde\npleted\u201d to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to\ntoday\u2019s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of\nuses that confer appropriative rights. \u201cNothing in the\nlanguage,\u201d it says, \u201csuggests that \u2018beneficial use\u2019 means a\nmeasure of the amount of water depleted.\u201d Ante, at 17.\nThis is incomprehensible. On the Court\u2019s own interpreta\ntion \u201cbeneficial use\u201d not only defines the types of uses that\nconfer appropriative rights, but also determines the vol\nume of water to which the rights attach\u2014viz., only that\nvolume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only\nquestion before us is whether \u201cbeneficial use\u201d measures\nthe volume diverted or the volume depleted\u2014and the\nlanguage of the Compact makes that clear.\n   The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of\nthe word \u201cdepleted\u201d instead of \u201cdiverted.\u201d Its best effort\nis the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that\nhydroelectric power generation and other disfavored,\n4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See\nibid. That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, rely\ning on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion\nwould be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accom\nplish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished\nby other provisions of the Compact. One would instead\nhave expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfa\nvored uses from the \u201cusefu[l] . . . activities of man,\u201d\nArt. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights.\nCf. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a785\u20132\u2013102(4) (2009) (listing types of\nbeneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively,\nhydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races\u2014\nthe allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United\nStates offer up to explain the word \u201cdepleted\u201d\u2014are already\nexcluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any\nneed for appropriative rights) by the Compact\u2019s definition\nof diversion: \u201cthe taking or removing of water from the\nYellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water\nso taken or removed is not returned directly into the\nchannel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from\nwhich it is taken.\u201d Art. II(G), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying\nclause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric\ndams, water wheels and mill races, which, when they\ndivert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, \u201cre\ntur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is\ntaken.\u201d\n  The Court objects to my interpretation because the word\n\u201cdepleted\u201d lacks the \u201cclarity\u201d necessary to \u201cdrastically\nredefine the term \u2018beneficial use\u2019 from its longstanding\nmeaning,\u201d ante, at 17. According to the Court, \u201c[t]he\namount of water put to \u2018beneficial use\u2019 has never been\ndefined by net water consumption.\u201d Ibid. Before making\nthis statement, the Court has spent some 10 pages, ante,\nat 7\u201316, conducting a \u201csensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels\ncaution\u201d; into a field (state water law) where the answer of\nthis Court is not conclusive and hence not ipso facto cor\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The\nCourt calls that hitherto unanswered question \u201cthe law of\nreturn flows,\u201d ante, at 7, but it can more accurately be\ndescribed as the question whether the volume of water to\nwhich an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume\ndiverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume\ndepleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that \u201cbene\nficial use\u201d has never had the \u201clongstanding meaning\u201d the\nCourt posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to\nall water diverted from the stream rather than all water\ndepleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of\nwhich of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite\nextraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic\nefforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answer\ning a state water-law question that no court of any West\nern State has ever answered\u2014a question that would cross\na Rabbi\u2019s eyes\u2014when the text in front of us provides\nthe clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned:\n\u201cdepleted.\u201d\n   The Court suggests that if the Compact\u2019s authors\nwanted to break from (what it considers) the common law,\nthey should have defined beneficial use as the \u201cvolume by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted.\u201d Ante, at 18 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to\nme to have little force when the Court cannot explain what\nwork \u201cdepleted\u201d is supposed to do other than indicate\nprecisely the same concept more concisely. And the\nCourt\u2019s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with\ngreater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court\u2019s advice\nwould make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact.\nThat provision allocates a fixed percentage \u201cof the unused\nand unappropriated water\u201d of various tributaries to each\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState for post-1950 \u201cstorage or direct diversions for benefi\ncial use on new lands or for other purposes.\u201d 65 Stat. 666.\nBut if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d in this last phrase means \u201cthe vol\nume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,\u201d\nthe provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed\npercentage of unused and unappropriated water for \u201ca\nvolume of water by which the water supply is depleted.\u201d It\nmakes perfect sense, of course, if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d means all\nuses that deplete the stream.\n   The Court also wonders why, \u201cif Article V(A) were in\ntended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,\u201d it\ndid not \u201cd[o] so as plainly as other\u201d interstate water com\npacts \u201cthat do just that.\u201d Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.\nMontana does not demand a precise volume of water each\nyear; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al\nways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.\nIt merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the\nsame position relative to Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users in\n2011 as they did in 1950\u2014that whatever would have\nflowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro\npriators\u2019 beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this\nyear\u2019s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon\ntanans will have to make do with less or go without.\n   Because I think the Court\u2019s disposition disregards the\ntext of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued January 10, 2011\u2014Decided May 2, 2011\nArticle V(A) of the Yellowstone River Compact ratified by Montana,\n  Wyoming, and North Dakota provides: \u201cAppropriative rights to the\n  beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing\n  in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be en\n  joyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use\n  of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d 65 Stat. 666. Montana\n  filed a bill of complaint, alleging that Wyoming breached Article V(A)\n  by allowing its upstream pre-1950 water users to switch from flood to\n  sprinkler irrigation, which increases crop consumption of water and\n  decreases the volume of runoff and seepage returning to the river\n  system. Thus, even if Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users divert the same\n  quantity of water as before, less water reaches downstream users in\n  Montana. Concluding that the Compact permits more efficient irri\n  gation systems so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the\n  same acreage watered in 1950, the Special Master found that Mon\n  tana\u2019s increased-efficiency allegation failed to state a claim. Montana\n  has filed an exception.\nHeld: Because Article V(A) of the Compact incorporates the ordinary\n doctrine of appropriation without significant qualification, and be\n cause in Wyoming and Montana that doctrine allows appropriators to\n improve their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\n stream appropriators, Montana\u2019s increased-efficiency allegation fails\n to state a claim for breach of the Compact under Article V(A). Pp. 4\u2013\n 19.\n    (a) Background appropriation law principles do not support Mon\n tana\u2019s position. The doctrine of appropriation provides that rights to\n water for irrigation are perfected and enforced in order of seniority,\n starting with the first person to divert water from a natural stream\n and apply it to a \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d Once perfected, that water right is\n2                       MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    senior to any later appropriators\u2019 rights and may be fulfilled entirely\n    before the junior appropriators get any water. However, junior ap\n    propriators do acquire rights to the stream basically as it exists when\n    they find it. Under this no-injury rule, junior users may, subject to\n    the fulfillment of the senior users\u2019 existing rights, prevent senior us\n    ers from enlarging their rights to the junior users\u2019 detriment. Here,\n    the question is whether a switch to more efficient irrigation with less\n    return flow is within Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 existing appropriat\n    ive rights or is an improper enlargement of that right. Although the\n    law of return flows is an unclear area of appropriation doctrine, the\n    Special Master correctly concluded that Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\n    may switch to sprinkler irrigation. Pp. 4\u201316.\n         (1) A change in irrigation methods does not appear to run afoul of\n    the no-injury rule in Montana and Wyoming, which generally con\n    cerns changes in the location of the diversion and the place or pur\n    pose of use. Thus, an appropriator may increase his consumption by\n    changing to a more water-intensive crop so long as he makes no\n    change in acreage irrigated or amount of water diverted. Ordinary,\n    day-to-day operational changes or repairs also do not violate the rule.\n    Consumption can even be increased by adding farm acreage, if that\n    was part of the plan from the start, and diligently pursued through\n    the years. Irrigation system improvements seem to be the same sort\n    of changes. This view is consistent with the fact that by 1950 both\n    States had statutes regulating certain changes to water rights, but\n    neither required farmers to take official action before adjusting irri\n    gation methods. Cases in both States frequently describe the no\n    injury rule as applying to changes in point of diversion, purpose of\n    use, and place of use. The abundance of litigation over such\n    changes\u2014and the absence of any litigation over the sort of change at\n    issue here\u2014strongly implies that irrigation efficiency improvements\n    were considered within the scope of the original appropriative right.\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) The doctrine of recapture\u2014which permits an appropriator\n    who has diverted water for irrigation to recapture and reuse his own\n    runoff and seepage before it escapes his control or his property\u2014also\n    supports treating irrigation efficiency improvements as within the\n    original appropriative right. Montana and Wyoming cases appear to\n    apply this basic doctrine without any qualification based on whether\n    the return flow would re-enter the original stream or not. By using\n    sprinklers instead of flood irrigation, Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water us\n    ers effectively recapture water. The sprinklers reduce loss from\n    seepage and runoff and are simply different mechanisms for increas\n    ing the volume of water available to crops without changing the\n    amount of diversion.

Pp. 16\u201319.\n       (1) \u201cBeneficial use\u201d is \u201cthat use by which the water supply of a\n  drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed by the activities\n  of man.\u201d 65 Stat. 665. Montana contends that the term means the\n  amount of depletion, and thus any activity increasing Wyoming\u2019s pre\n  1950 depletions beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds Article V(A)\u2019s scope.\n  Pp. 16\u201317.\n       (2) Nothing in the Compact\u2019s definition suggests such an inter\n  pretation. A plain reading indicates that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d is a type of\n  use that depletes the water supply. This view is supported by the\n  circumstances in the signatory States when the Compact was\n  drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory preference for irriga\n  tion, a depletive use, over power generation, a nondepletive use. It\n  thus it makes sense for the Compact to protect irrigation uses that\n  were legislatively favored and represented the predominant use of\n  the Yellowstone River system. Montana\u2019s reading, by contrast, would\n  drastically redefine the term. The amount of water put to \u201cbeneficial\n  use\u201d has never been defined by net water consumption. In irrigation,\n  that amount has always included a measure of necessary loss, e.g.,\n  runoff or evaporation. If the Compact\u2019s definition were meant to\n  drastically redefine \u201cbeneficial use,\u201d this Court would expect far more\n  clarity. Moreover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\n  ordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A), which ex\n  pressly states that \u201cthe laws governing the acquisition and use of wa\n  ter under the doctrine of appropriation\u201d control, would make little\n  sense. Pp. 17\u201318.\n       (3) If Article V(A) were intended to guarantee Montana a set\n  quantity of water, it could have done so plainly, as done in other\n  compacts, e.g., the Colorado River Compact of 1922.

STATE OF\n\n    WYOMING AND STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA \n\n  ON EXCEPTION TO THE REPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [May 2, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case arises out of a dispute between Montana and\nWyoming over the Yellowstone River Compact. Montana\nalleges that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the\nCompact by allowing its pre-1950 water appropriators to\nincrease their net water consumption by improving the\nefficiency of their irrigation systems. The new systems,\nMontana alleges, employ sprinklers that reduce the\namount of wastewater returned to the river, thus depriv\u00ad\ning Montana\u2019s downstream pre-1950 appropriators of\nwater to which they are entitled. The Special Master has\nfiled a First Interim Report determining, as relevant here,\nthat Montana\u2019s allegation fails to state a claim because\nmore efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the\nCompact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate\nthe same acreage watered in 1950. We agree with the\nSpecial Master and overrule Montana\u2019s exception to that\nconclusion.\n                            I\n   From its headwaters in Wyoming, the Yellowstone River\nflows nearly 700 miles northeast into Montana and then\nNorth Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. Several\n2                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof its tributaries, including the Clarks Fork, Tongue,\nPowder, and Bighorn Rivers, also begin in Wyoming and\ncross into Montana before joining the main stem of the\nYellowstone River. This river system\u2019s monthly and an\u00ad\nnual flows, which are dictated largely by snow melt, vary\nwidely. In 1964, for example, the flow in the Tongue and\nPowder Rivers was nearly 10 times the 1961 flow. App.\n936. As the rivers came into heavy use for irrigation, it\nbecame expedient to build water storage facilities for\npreserving the heaviest flows. See First Interim Report of\nSpecial Master 6 (hereinafter Report).\n   Before funding new water storage facilities, Congress\nsought agreement as to the allocation of the Yellowstone\nRiver system among Wyoming, Montana, and North Da\u00ad\nkota. In 1932, Congress granted the States permission to\nnegotiate a compact. See Act of June 14, 1932, ch. 253, 47\nStat. 306. Draft compacts were produced in 1935, 1942,\nand 1944, but none was fully agreed upon. Finally, in\n1951 Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota ratified the\nYellowstone River Compact, and Congress consented to it.\nAct of Oct. 30, 1951, 65 Stat. 663.\n   The Yellowstone River Compact divides water into three\ntiers of priority. First, Article V(A) provides: \u201cAppropria\u00ad\ntive rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellow\u00ad\nstone River System existing in each signatory State as of\nJanuary 1, 1950, shall continue to be enjoyed in accor\u00ad\ndance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of\nwater under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d Id., at 666.\nSecond, Article V(B) allocates to each State the \u201cquantity\nof that water as shall be necessary to provide supplemen\u00ad\ntal water supplies\u201d for the pre-1950 uses protected by\nArticle V(A). Ibid. Third, \u201cthe remainder of the unused\nand unappropriated water\u201d of each tributary is divided by\npercentage: Wyoming receives 60% of the remaining water\nin the Clarks Fork River, 80% in the Bighorn River, 40%\nin the Tongue River, and 42% in the Powder River; the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 666\u2013667.\n   In February 2008, we granted Montana leave to file a\nbill of complaint against Wyoming for breach of the Com\u00ad\npact. 552 U. S. 1175. Montana alleged that Wyoming had\nbreached the Compact by consuming more than its share\nof the Tongue and Powder Rivers. Bill of Complaint 3,\n\u00b68. Specifically, Montana claimed that Wyoming was ap\u00ad\npropriating water for a number of new, post-1950 uses:\nirrigating new acreage; building new storage facilities;\nconducting new groundwater pumping; and increasing con\u00ad\nsumption on existing agricultural acreage.1 Id., at 3\u20134,\n\u00b6\u00b6 9\u201312. According to Montana\u2019s complaint, the Compact\ndid not permit Wyoming to use water for any of these\npractices as long as Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 rights\nremained unfulfilled. Id., at 3, \u00b68.\n   In response, Wyoming filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint. We appointed a Special Master and referred\nthe motion to him. 555 U. S. __ (2008). After briefing and\nargument, the Special Master recommended that we deny\nWyoming\u2019s motion, because at least some of Montana\u2019s\nallegations state a claim for relief. The Special Master\nfound that \u201cArticle V of the Compact protects pre-1950\nappropriations in Montana from new surface and ground\u00ad\nwater diversions in Wyoming, whether for direct use or for\nstorage, that prevent adequate water from reaching Mon\u00ad\ntana to satisfy those pre-1950 appropriations.\u201d Report 14\u2013\n15. But the Special Master agreed with Wyoming that\nMontana\u2019s allegations regarding \u201cefficiency improvements\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Montana   has since clarified that increased consumption on existing\nacreage refers to the use of more efficient irrigation systems. The\n\u201cefficiency\u201d of irrigation for our purposes refers to the amount of\nwastewater that is lost, for example, to evaporation, seepage, runoff, or\ndeep percolation. Some of the lost water returns to the river and is\nlater available for downstream users. A more efficient irrigation\nsystem loses less water; thus, though it may draw the same volume of\nwater from the river, net water consumption is increased.\n4                     MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nby pre-1950 appropriators in Wyoming\u201d do not state a\nclaim for relief. Id., at 15. The States did not object to\nmost of the Special Master\u2019s findings, and we have issued\norders accordingly. See 562 U. S. __ (2010); 562 U. S. __\n(2010). Montana has filed an exception to the Special\nMaster\u2019s rejection of its increased-efficiency allegation. It\nis this exception that is before us.2\n                              II\n   Article V(A) of the Compact states that \u201c[a]ppropriative\nrights to the beneficial uses of [water] . . . existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\u00ad\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d\nMontana claims that its pre-1950 appropriators\u2019 rights are\nnot \u201ccontinu[ing] to be enjoyed\u201d because upstream pre\u00ad\n1950 appropriators in Wyoming have increased their\nconsumption by switching from flood to sprinkler irriga\u00ad\ntion. Montana alleges that sprinkler systems increase\ncrop consumption of water and decrease the volume of\nrunoff and seepage that returns to the Tongue and Powder\nrivers by 25% or more.3 See Montana\u2019s Exception and\nBrief 3 (hereinafter Brief for Montana). As a result, even\nif Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users divert the same quan\u00ad\ntity of water as before, less water reaches Montana. Ac\u00ad\ncording to Montana, Article V(A) prohibits Wyoming from\nallowing this practice when it deprives Montana\u2019s pre\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Montana also raised an exception to the Special Master\u2019s finding\n\nthat if Montana can remedy the shortage of water to its pre-1950 users\nby curtailing its post-1950 uses without \u201cprejudic[ing] Montana\u2019s other\nrights under the Compact,\u201d then an intrastate remedy is \u201cthe appropri\u00ad\nate solution.\u201d Report 15. We recommitted this exception to the Special\nMaster. 562 U. S. __ (2010).\n  3 For purposes of resolving Wyoming\u2019s motion to dismiss, we take as\n\ntrue Montana\u2019s allegation that the new sprinkler systems actually\nreduce return flow to the rivers. Wyoming has not conceded that this is\ntrue. See Wyoming\u2019s Reply to Montana\u2019s Exception 35, n. 6.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1950 users of their full water rights.\n  The question, therefore, is whether Article V(A) allows\nWyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water users\u2014diverting the same\nquantity of water for the same irrigation purpose and\nacreage as before 1950\u2014to increase their consumption of\nwater by improving their irrigation systems even if it\nreduces the flow of water to Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users.\nMontana makes two basic arguments: that background\nprinciples of appropriation law, to the extent they are\nincorporated into the Compact, do not allow such an in\u00ad\ncrease in consumption; and that even if they do, the terms\nof the Compact amended those principles in Montana\u2019s\nfavor. The Special Master rejected these arguments, and\nso do we.\n                              A\n   Because Article V(A) of the Compact protects\n\u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water]\u201d as\nof 1950 \u201cin accordance with the laws governing the ac-\nquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appro\u00ad\npriation,\u201d we begin with an overview of appropriation\ndoctrine.4 As the Special Master explained, if \u201c[a]p\u00ad\npropriation law clearly proscribe[s] increases in consump\u00ad\ntion on existing acreage to the detriment of downstream\nappropriators, the Compact arguably would prohibit\nWyoming from allowing its appropriators to make\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 As  with all contracts, we interpret the Compact according to the\nintent of the parties, here the signatory States. We thus look primarily\nto the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana, but, like the\nStates, we also look to Western water law more generally and authori\u00ad\nties from before and after 1950. The States appear to have assumed\nthat the doctrine has not changed in a way directly relevant here. We\ntherefore do not decide whether Article V(A) intended to freeze appro\u00ad\npriation law as it stood in 1949, or whether it incorporates the evolution\nof the doctrine over time, allowing Compact-protected rights to grow or\nshrink accordingly. We resolve the matter of Montana\u2019s exception\nwithout prejudice to that issue. See Report 39\u201340.\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch increases to the detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950\nuses.\u201d Report 65.\n   As is typical west of the 100th meridian, the doctrine of\nappropriation has governed water rights in Montana and\nWyoming since the 1800\u2019s. See, e.g., Basey v. Gallagher,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88978\"><a href=\"/opinion/88978/basey-v-gallagher/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 (1875). As relevant here, the doctrine\nprovides that rights to water for irrigation are perfected\nand enforced in order of seniority, starting with the first\nperson to divert water from a natural stream and apply it\nto a beneficial use (or to begin such a project, if diligently\ncompleted). See Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry\nCreek Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92, 98 (1938); Arizona v. Cali\nfornia, 298 U. S. 558, 565\u2013566 (1936); Wyo. Const., Art. 8,\n\u00a73 (\u201cPriority of appropriation for beneficial uses shall give\nthe better right\u201d). The scope of the right is limited by the\nconcept of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d That concept restricts a farmer\n\u201cto the amount of water that is necessary to irrigate his\nland by making a reasonable use of the water.\u201d 1 C.\nKinney, Law of Irrigation and Water Rights \u00a7586, pp.\n1007\u20131008 (2d ed. 1912) (hereinafter Kinney) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Bailey v.

Once such a water right is perfected, it is\nsenior to any later appropriators\u2019 rights and may be ful\u00ad\nfilled entirely before those junior appropriators get any\nwater at all.\n   For our purposes, Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users are\nsimilar to junior appropriators. As between the States,\nthe Compact assigned the same seniority level to all pre\u00ad\n1950 water users in Montana and Wyoming. See Brief for\nMontana 23; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.\nBut as Montana concedes, precisely because of this equal\nseniority, its downstream pre-1950 users cannot stop\nWyoming\u2019s upstream pre-1950 users from fully exercising\ntheir water rights. Thus, when the rivers are low, Mon\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg.\n51.\n   Junior appropriators are not completely without rights,\nhowever. As they come online, appropriators acquire\nrights to the stream basically as it exists when they find\nit. See 2 Kinney \u00a7803, at 1403\u20131404. Accordingly, subject\nto the fulfillment of all senior users\u2019 existing rights, under\nthe no-injury rule junior users can prevent senior users\nfrom enlarging their rights to the junior users\u2019 detriment.\n1 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen West\u00ad\nern States 573 (1971) (hereinafter Hutchins).\n   Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users can therefore \u201cinsist that\n[Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users] confine themselves strictly\nwithin the rights which the law gives them, that is, to the\namount of water within the extent of their appropriation\nwhich they actually apply to some beneficial use.\u201d 2\nKinney \u00a7784, at 1366. That general proposition is undis\u00ad\nputed; the dispute here is in its application. Is a switch to\nmore efficient irrigation with less return flow within the\nextent of Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\u2019 existing appropriative\nrights, or is it an improper enlargement of that right to\nthe detriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 water users?\n   As the Special Master observed, the law of return flows\nis an unclear area of appropriation doctrine. Report 65\n(citing Trelease, Reclamation Water Rights, 32 Rocky Mt.\nL. Rev. 464, 469 (1960)). The States have not directed us\nto any case on all fours with this one. Indeed, \u201c[n]o west\u00ad\nern state court appears to have conclusively answered the\nquestion.\u201d Report 65.\n   Despite the lack of clarity, the Special Master found\nseveral reasons to conclude that Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users\nmay switch to sprinkler irrigation. He found that the\nscope of the original appropriative right includes such a\nchange so long as no additional water is diverted from the\n8                      MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstream and the conserved water is used on the same acre\u00ad\nage for the same agricultural purpose as before. We agree\nwith the Special Master.5\n                             1\n   First, although the no-injury rule prevents appropria\u00ad\ntors from making certain water-right changes that would\nharm other appropriators, a change in irrigation methods\ndoes not appear to run afoul of that rule in Montana and\nWyoming. See id., at 69. Because each new appropriator\nis entitled to the stream as it exists when he finds it, the\ngeneral rule is that \u201cif a change in these conditions is\nmade by [a senior] appropriator, which interferes with the\nflow of the water to the material injury of [the junior\nappropriator\u2019s] rights, he may justly complain.\u201d 2 Kinney\n\u00a7803, at 1404.\n   But the no-injury rule is not absolute; it generally con\u00ad\ncerns changes in the location of the diversion and the\nplace or purpose of use.

S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71251(a). Yet, because the Compact references and the parties direct\nus to principles of appropriation doctrine, we find ourselves immersed\nin state water law. See n. 4, supra. Our assessment of the scope of\nthese water rights is merely a federal court\u2019s description of state law.\n   The highest court of each State, of course, remains \u201cthe final arbiter\nof what is state law.\u201d West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 311\nU. S. 223, 236 (1940). We recognize that appropriation doctrine contin\u00ad\nues to evolve, and there are reasonable policy arguments in favor of\nboth States\u2019 positions here. But it is not this Court\u2019s role to guide the\ndevelopment of state water regulation. See id., at 237 (\u201c[I]t is the duty\nof [federal courts] in every case to ascertain from all the available data\nwhat the state law is and apply it rather than to prescribe a different\nrule, however superior it may appear from the viewpoint of \u2018general\nlaw\u2019 \u201d).

This is also consistent with the\nfact that by 1950 both States had statutes regulating\ncertain changes to water rights, but neither required\nfarmers to take official action before adjusting irrigation\nmethods.6 See Report 69\u201370, 87; id., at 69 (they \u201cdo not\ngenerally have procedures for overseeing changes in water\nefficiencies stemming from crop shifts or irrigation im\u00ad\nprovements where there are no formal changes in the\nunderlying water rights\u201d). Like the Special Master, we\nfind this to be persuasive evidence that the States consid\u00ad\nered such changes permissible.\n   Montana argues that, regardless of the statutes, private\nlawsuits could be brought to challenge such efficiency\nchanges. But it has not provided a single example from\neither State. Instead, Montana and Wyoming cases typi\u00ad\ncally describe the no-injury rule as applying to changes in\npoint of diversion, purpose of use, and place of use. See,\ne.g., Maclay v. Missoula Irrig.

The abundance of litigation over\nsuch changes\u2014and the absence of any litigation over the\nsort of change at issue here\u2014strongly implies that irriga\u00ad\ntion efficiency improvements do not violate the no-injury\nrule and were considered within the scope of the original\nappropriative right.\n                            2\n  The doctrine of recapture also supports treating im\u00ad\nprovements in irrigation efficiency as within the original\nappropriative right.

The court upheld Franks\u2019 appro\u00ad\npriation right because the water had already escaped from\nFuss\u2019 property.

By using sprinklers rather\nthan flood irrigation, those water users effectively recap\u00ad\nture water. The sprinklers, by reducing loss due to seep\u00ad\nage and runoff, operate much like, if more efficiently than,\ncruder recapture systems involving ditches or pits. They\nare simply different mechanisms for increasing the volume\nof water available to the crops without changing the\namount of diversion. Binning, Bower, and Fuss expressly\nacknowledged that in such situations, lower appropriators\nwho have perfected their own appropriative rights are\nnonetheless at the mercy of the property owners from\nwhich their water flows.

One scholar asserted: \u201c[O]f course,\nincreasing efficiency at one site may reduce the amount of\nwater available to downstream users who may rely on\nreturn flows from other users. [Wyoming] law, however,\ndoes not preclude more efficient uses merely because a\ndownstream user may be injured.\u201d Squillace, A Critical\nLook at Wyoming Water Law, 24 Land & Water L. Rev.\n307, 331 (1989); see id., at 331, n. 156 (\u201cFor example, a\nfarmer who traditionally consumes only 50% of the water\napplied to his land is free to change his crop or method of\napplying water so as to increase his consumption to 60%\u201d);\nsee also Thompson, supra, at 76 (\u201c[A] prior appropriator\ncan at anytime . . . instal[l] a sprinkler system, thereby\neliminating all waste of water\u201d). And a national hornbook\non water law has observed:\n      \u201cThe rule allowing recapture and reuse of salvaged\n    water on the original land can result in more water\n    being consumed. For instance, if a water user is con\u00ad\n    suming less than the permitted amount of water and\n    plants a more water-intensive crop or puts in a more\n    efficient irrigation system, most or all of the water\n    that had previously been returned to the stream\n    might be consumed. This can deprive other appro\u00ad\n    priators of water on which they depend but it is al\u00ad\n    lowed since it is technically within the terms of the\n    original appropriation.\u201d Getches 143\u2013144.\nMontana has not identified any scholars who have reached\nthe opposite conclusion.\n  For all of these reasons, we hold that the doctrine of\nappropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appro\u00ad\npriators to improve their irrigation systems, even to the\ndetriment of downstream appropriators. We readily ac\u00ad\n16                 MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nknowledge that this area of law is far from clear. See\nsupra, at 7. But the apparent scope of the no-injury rule\nin Wyoming and Montana, the doctrine of recapture and\nits broad reach in Wyoming and Montana case law, and\nthe specific conclusions of water law scholars all point in\nthe same direction, which also comports with the Special\nMaster\u2019s exhaustive discussion and findings. Accordingly,\nif Article V(A) simply incorporates background principles\nof appropriation law, it allows Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 water\nusers to improve their irrigation efficiency, even to the\ndetriment of Montana\u2019s pre-1950 users.\n                              B\n  Montana, however, takes another tack. It argues that\neven if background principles of appropriation law do not\nsupport its position, Article V(A) of the Compact does not\nprotect the full scope of ordinary appropriative rights.\nMontana claims that the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbenefi\u00ad\ncial use\u201d restricts the scope of protected pre-1950 appro\u00ad\npriative rights to the net volume of water that was actu\u00ad\nally being consumed in 1950. We agree with the Special\nMaster that this argument also fails.\n                               1\n   Article V(A) protects \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the bene\u00ad\nficial uses of . . . water.\u201d \u201cBeneficial use,\u201d in turn, is de\u00ad\nfined in Article II(H) as \u201cthat use by which the water\nsupply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully em\u00ad\nployed by the activities of man.\u201d 65 Stat. 665. Montana\ncontends that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d is thus defined as the\namount of depletion. According to Montana, any activity\nthat increases pre-1950 water users\u2019 depletions in Wyo\u00ad\nming beyond pre-1950 levels exceeds the scope of the\nappropriative rights that Article V(A) protects. See Brief\nfor Montana 25\u201328. On this basis, Montana asserts that\nthe Compact requires (subject to river conditions) that the\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 26.\n                              2\n   We acknowledge that \u201cbeneficial use\u201d refers to a type of\nuse that involves some depletion, as all irrigation does.\nSee Report 61. The part of the Compact\u2019s definition of\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d that refers to depletion\u2014\u201cthat use by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted\u201d\u2014is fairly clear. It\nbegins with \u201cthat use,\u201d and the words that follow merely\nexplain that \u201cthat use\u201d must be a use that \u201cdeplete[s]\u201d the\n\u201cwater supply.\u201d Nothing in the language suggests that\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d means a measure of the amount of water\ndepleted. A \u201cbeneficial use\u201d within the meaning of the\nCompact, therefore, is a type of use that depletes the water\nsupply.\n   This plain reading makes sense in light of the circum\u00ad\nstances existing in the signatory States when the Compact\nwas drafted. At that time, Wyoming had a statutory\npreference for irrigation, a type of depletive use, over\npower generation, a nondepletive use. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a771\u2013402 (1945). It makes sense that the Compact would\nhave been written to protect the irrigation uses that were\nlegislatively favored and represented the predominant use\nof the Yellowstone River system. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45\u2013\n47; 65 Stat. 663 (Compact Preamble) (noting that the\nCompact recognizes \u201cthe great importance of water for\nirrigation in the signatory States\u201d).\n   Montana\u2019s reading of the Compact, by contrast, does not\nfollow from the text and would drastically redefine the\nterm \u201cbeneficial use\u201d from its longstanding meaning. The\namount of water put to \u201cbeneficial use\u201d has never been\ndefined by net water consumption. The quantity of water\n\u201cbeneficially used\u201d in irrigation, for example, has always\nincluded some measure of necessary loss such as runoff,\nevaporation, deep percolation, leakage, and seepage (re\u00ad\n18                MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngardless of whether any of it returns to the stream). So,\nwater put to \u201c[b]eneficial use is not what is actually con\u00ad\nsumed, but what is actually necessary in good faith.\u201d 1\nWiel \u00a7481, at 509; see also Trelease, The Concept of Rea\u00ad\nsonable Beneficial Use in the Law of Surface Streams, 12\nWyo. L. J. 1, 10 (1957) (listing irrigation as a beneficial\nuse and noting that \u201cthe method of application, by flood\u00ad\ning, channeling, or sprinkling, is immaterial\u201d); J. Sax, B.\nThompson, J. Leshy, & R. Adams, Legal Control of Water\nResources 131 (4th ed. 2006) (discussing normal irrigation\npractices and observing that the amount of water put to\nbeneficial use \u201cis often considerably more than the quan\u00ad\ntum actually consumed\u201d).\n   If the Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d were\nmeant to drastically redefine the term into shorthand for\nnet water consumption, we would expect far more clarity.\nFor example, the Compact could have stated that it would\nprotect \u201conly \u2018the amount of water consumed for a benefi\u00ad\ncial use in each signatory state as of January 1, 1950.\u2019 \u201d\nReport 60. Or it could have defined \u201cbeneficial use\u201d as the\n\u201cvolume by which the water supply . . . is depleted.\u201d More\u00ad\nover, if the Compact effected a dramatic reframing of\nordinary appropriation principles, the rest of Article V(A),\nwhich expressly states that \u201cthe laws governing the acqui\u00ad\nsition and use of water under the doctrine of appropria\u00ad\ntion\u201d control, would make little sense.\n   We agree with the Special Master that the definition of\nbeneficial use in the Compact is unremarkable. Arti\u00ad\ncle V(A) does not change the scope of the pre-1950 appro\u00ad\npriative rights that it protects in both States.\n                           3\n  Finally, if Article V(A) were intended to guarantee\nMontana a set quantity of water, it could have done so as\nplainly as other compacts that do just that. By 1950,\nWyoming itself had entered into at least one compact that\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndefined water rights in terms of depletion. The Colorado\nRiver Compact of 1922 apportioned 7,500,000 acre-feet of\nwater per year for \u201cthe exclusive beneficial consumptive\nuse\u201d of several upstream States, including Wyoming. That\ncompact specifically added that \u201c[t]he States of the Upper\nDivision will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to\nbe depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for\nany period of ten consecutive years . . . .\u201d        National\nResources Planning Bd., Water Resources Comm., Inter\u00ad\nstate Water Compacts, 1785\u20131941, p. 8 (1942). See also\nRepublican River Compact (1943), Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a782a\u2013518 (1997) (allocating water by the acre-foot for\nbeneficial consumptive use in Kansas, Nebraska, and\nColorado). And, even here in the Yellowstone River Com\u00ad\npact, Article V(B) unambiguously apportions the third tier\nof Yellowstone River system water by percentage. 65 Stat.\n666. The notion that Article V(A) accomplishes essen-\ntially the same sort of depletive allocation with language\nthat has a different and longstanding meaning is simply\nunpersuasive.\n                          *    *    *\n  We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect\nordinary \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of\n[water] . . . existing in each signatory State as of January\n1, 1950.\u201d Art. V(A), ibid. And the best evidence we have\nshows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and\nMontana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of\ntheir irrigation systems, even to the detriment of down\u00ad\nstream appropriators. Montana\u2019s allegation that Wyo\u00ad\nming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allow\u00ad\ning its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation\nefficiency thus fails to state a claim.

The Court interprets the Yel\nlowstone River Compact (Compact), see Act of Oct. 30,\n1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663, to grant those Wyomans* the\nright to increase their consumption so long as they do not\nincrease the volume of water they diverted beyond pre\n1950 levels. Thus, it holds, Montana cannot complain that\nthe increased consumption interferes with its residents\u2019\npre-1950 appropriative water rights. I disagree because\nthe Court\u2019s analysis substitutes its none-too-confident\nreading of the common law, see ante, at 7\u20138, and n. 5, for\nthe Compact\u2019s definition of \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d\n   The doctrine of appropriation allocates perpetual water\nrights along a river, on a \u201cfirst in time[,] . . . superior in\nright\u201d basis, Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459\n(1922), to those who divert its flow and apply the water to\na beneficial use. See Hinderlider v.

The\n\u201cbeneficial use\u201d requirement does most of the legal work.\nIt marks the types of uses that confer an appropriative\nright\u2014irrigation being a paradigmatic example, see\nUnited States v. Willow River Power Co., 324 U. S. 499,\n504, n. 2 (1945); and it \u201cmeasure[s]\u201d the extent of an ap\npropriator\u2019s claim, see Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497,\n505 (1924); A.

At common law, an appropriator claims the\nvolume of water diverted and \u201creasonably required\u201d by his\nintended use. Id., \u00a7\u00a75:65\u20135:66, at 5\u2013127, 5\u2013130.2; see\nQuinn v. John Whitaker Ranch Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wyo.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377\u2013378,\n92 P. 2d 568, 570\u2013571 (1939).\n   The Compact borrows the concept of appropriation to\ndefine the rights of pre-1950 water users along the Yel\nlowstone River and its tributaries. Article V(A) promises\nthat \u201c[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the\nwater of the Yellowstone River System existing in each\nsignatory State as of January 1, 1950, shall continue to be\nenjoyed in accordance with the laws governing the acquisi\ntion and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation.\u201d\n65 Stat. 666. Article II(H) elaborates that a \u201cBeneficial\nUse\u201d is one \u201cby which the water supply of a drainage basin\nis depleted when usefully employed by the activities of\nman.\u201d Id., at 665 (emphasis added).\n   Like the common law, this definition lays out the types\nof uses that qualify as beneficial and the volume of water\nan appropriator may claim through his beneficial use. But\nthe Compact\u2019s focus on whether a use depletes a river\u2019s\nwater supply\u2014not whether it diverts the river\u2019s flow\u2014\nsignificantly limits the volume of water to which Wyoming\nis entitled. For purposes of the Compact, Wyoming may\nlay claim only to its beneficial users\u2019 net consumption of\nwater, that is, the volume of water diverted from the river\nminus the volume that flows (or seeps) back into the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nriver\u2019s channel.\n   This interpretation, and only this interpretation, gives\nmeaning to the definition\u2019s use of the word \u201cdepleted.\u201d I\ncannot write off as an accident the choice of this word\nrather than the word consistently used elsewhere in the\nCompact: \u201cdiverted.\u201d See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). The Compact\u2019s authors knew\nhow to use \u201cdiverted\u201d and \u201cdiversion\u201d when they wanted\nto. Those two words appear repeatedly in other provisions\nof the Compact, see Arts. II(G); V(B), (C); VII(A), (C), (D),\n65 Stat. 665\u2013668; and the Compact defines them in the\nsentence immediately preceding the definition of \u201cbenefi\ncial use.\u201d See Art. II(G), id., at 665. But the Compact\u2019s\nauthors chose to define beneficial use in terms of deple\ntion\u2014the first and only time the Compact uses any deriva\ntive of the word \u201cdeplete.\u201d It is in my view a clear indica\ntion that the Compact intends to break from the common\nlaw\u2019s focus on diversion.\n   The Court reduces the Compact\u2019s deliberate use of \u201cde\npleted\u201d to an inconsequential slip of the pen. According to\ntoday\u2019s majority, Article II(H) speaks only to the types of\nuses that confer appropriative rights. \u201cNothing in the\nlanguage,\u201d it says, \u201csuggests that \u2018beneficial use\u2019 means a\nmeasure of the amount of water depleted.\u201d Ante, at 17.\nThis is incomprehensible. On the Court\u2019s own interpreta\ntion \u201cbeneficial use\u201d not only defines the types of uses that\nconfer appropriative rights, but also determines the vol\nume of water to which the rights attach\u2014viz., only that\nvolume put to one of the specified types of uses. The only\nquestion before us is whether \u201cbeneficial use\u201d measures\nthe volume diverted or the volume depleted\u2014and the\nlanguage of the Compact makes that clear.\n   The Court provides no plausible explanation for use of\nthe word \u201cdepleted\u201d instead of \u201cdiverted.\u201d Its best effort\nis the suggestion that the word was used to ensure that\nhydroelectric power generation and other disfavored,\n4                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnondepletive uses do not confer appropriative rights. See\nibid. That is highly unlikely, for two reasons. First, rely\ning on a subtle distinction between depletion and diversion\nwould be one of the clumsiest ways imaginable to accom\nplish that simple goal, if it was not already accomplished\nby other provisions of the Compact. One would instead\nhave expected the Compact simply to exclude the disfa\nvored uses from the \u201cusefu[l] . . . activities of man,\u201d\nArt. II(H), 65 Stat. 665, which confer appropriative rights.\nCf. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a785\u20132\u2013102(4) (2009) (listing types of\nbeneficial uses). Second, and even more conclusively,\nhydroelectric generation, water wheels, and mill races\u2014\nthe allegedly disfavored uses Wyoming and the United\nStates offer up to explain the word \u201cdepleted\u201d\u2014are already\nexcluded from appropriative rights (and probably from any\nneed for appropriative rights) by the Compact\u2019s definition\nof diversion: \u201cthe taking or removing of water from the\nYellowstone River or any tributary thereof when the water\nso taken or removed is not returned directly into the\nchannel of the Yellowstone River or of the tributary from\nwhich it is taken.\u201d Art. II(G), 65 Stat. 665. The modifying\nclause seems specifically designed to exclude hydroelectric\ndams, water wheels and mill races, which, when they\ndivert water from the Yellowstone or its tributaries, \u201cre\ntur[n it] directly into the channel . . . from which it is\ntaken.\u201d\n  The Court objects to my interpretation because the word\n\u201cdepleted\u201d lacks the \u201cclarity\u201d necessary to \u201cdrastically\nredefine the term \u2018beneficial use\u2019 from its longstanding\nmeaning,\u201d ante, at 17. According to the Court, \u201c[t]he\namount of water put to \u2018beneficial use\u2019 has never been\ndefined by net water consumption.\u201d Ibid. Before making\nthis statement, the Court has spent some 10 pages, ante,\nat 7\u201316, conducting a \u201csensitive . . . inquiry [that] counsels\ncaution\u201d; into a field (state water law) where the answer of\nthis Court is not conclusive and hence not ipso facto cor\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The\nCourt calls that hitherto unanswered question \u201cthe law of\nreturn flows,\u201d ante, at 7, but it can more accurately be\ndescribed as the question whether the volume of water to\nwhich an appropriator acquires rights is the entire volume\ndiverted for a beneficial use, or rather only the volume\ndepleted by the beneficial use. Which is to say that \u201cbene\nficial use\u201d has never had the \u201clongstanding meaning\u201d the\nCourt posits. If it has in the past been assumed to refer to\nall water diverted from the stream rather than all water\ndepleted from the stream, that is only because the issue of\nwhich of the two it means has never arisen. I find it quite\nextraordinary that the Court should expend such heroic\nefforts (imagine how many cases had to be read!) answer\ning a state water-law question that no court of any West\nern State has ever answered\u2014a question that would cross\na Rabbi\u2019s eyes\u2014when the text in front of us provides\nthe clear answer insofar as this Compact is concerned:\n\u201cdepleted.\u201d\n   The Court suggests that if the Compact\u2019s authors\nwanted to break from (what it considers) the common law,\nthey should have defined beneficial use as the \u201cvolume by\nwhich the water supply . . . is depleted.\u201d Ante, at 18 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). That objection seems to\nme to have little force when the Court cannot explain what\nwork \u201cdepleted\u201d is supposed to do other than indicate\nprecisely the same concept more concisely. And the\nCourt\u2019s helpful drafting tip proves that speaking with\ngreater clarity is not so easy. Following the Court\u2019s advice\nwould make nonsense of Article V(B) of the Compact.\nThat provision allocates a fixed percentage \u201cof the unused\nand unappropriated water\u201d of various tributaries to each\n6                  MONTANA v. WYOMING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nState for post-1950 \u201cstorage or direct diversions for benefi\ncial use on new lands or for other purposes.\u201d 65 Stat. 666.\nBut if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d in this last phrase means \u201cthe vol\nume of water by which . . . the water supply is depleted,\u201d\nthe provision makes no sense. It would allocate a fixed\npercentage of unused and unappropriated water for \u201ca\nvolume of water by which the water supply is depleted.\u201d It\nmakes perfect sense, of course, if \u201cbeneficial use\u201d means all\nuses that deplete the stream.\n   The Court also wonders why, \u201cif Article V(A) were in\ntended to guarantee Montana a set quantity of water,\u201d it\ndid not \u201cd[o] so as plainly as other\u201d interstate water com\npacts \u201cthat do just that.\u201d Ante, at 18. This is a straw man.\nMontana does not demand a precise volume of water each\nyear; nor does it insist that its pre-1950 water users al\nways receive enough water to satisfy their pre-1950 needs.\nIt merely asks that its pre-1950 water users occupy the\nsame position relative to Wyoming\u2019s pre-1950 users in\n2011 as they did in 1950\u2014that whatever would have\nflowed back into the Yellowstone after Wyoming appro\npriators\u2019 beneficial uses in 1950 if the river then had this\nyear\u2019s flow, will also flow back this year. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 13, 16, 24. In dry years, that may mean some Mon\ntanans will have to make do with less or go without.\n   Because I think the Court\u2019s disposition disregards the\ntext of the Compact, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
