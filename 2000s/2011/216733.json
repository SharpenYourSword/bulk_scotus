KING\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n    No. 09–1272. Argued January 12, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011\nPolice officers in Lexington, Kentucky, followed a suspected drug dealer\n  to an apartment complex. They smelled marijuana outside an\n  apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence. As\n  soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises coming from\n  the apartment; the officers believed that these noises were consistent\n  with the destruction of evidence. The officers announced their intent\n  to enter the apartment, kicked in the door, and found respondent and\n  others. They saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of\n  the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent\n  search. The Circuit Court denied respondent’s motion to suppress\n  the evidence, holding that exigent circumstances—the need to pre\n  vent destruction of evidence—justified the warrantless entry. Re\n  spondent entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to ap\n  peal the suppression ruling, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals\n  affirmed. The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. The court as\n  sumed that exigent circumstances existed, but it nonetheless invali\n  dated the search. The exigent circumstances rule did not apply, the\n  court held, because the police should have foreseen that their conduct\n  would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.\nHeld:\n    1. The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not\n create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct\n that violates the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 5–16.\n       (a) The Fourth Amendment expressly imposes two requirements:\n All searches and seizures must be reasonable; and a warrant may not\n be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope\n of the authorized search is set out with particularity. Although\n “ ‘searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are pre\n sumptively unreasonable,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398,\n2                          KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    403, this presumption may be overcome when “ ‘the exigencies of the\n    situation’ make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a]\n    warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\n    Amendment,” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394. One such exi\n    gency is the need “to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.”\n    Brigham City, supra, at 403. Pp. 5–6.\n         (b) Under the “police-created exigency” doctrine, which lower\n    courts have developed as an exception to the exigent circumstances\n    rule, exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when\n    the exigency was “created” or “manufactured” by the conduct of the\n    police. The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for de\n    termining when police impermissibly create an exigency. Pp. 7–8.\n         (c) The proper test follows from the principle that permits war\n    rantless searches: warrantless searches are allowed when the cir\n    cumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth\n    Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement. Thus, a\n    warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when\n    the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to\n    engage in conduct violating the Fourth Amendment. A similar ap\n    proach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.\n    For example, officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have\n    not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from\n    which the observation of the evidence is made, see Horton v. Califor\n    nia, 496 U. S. 128, 136–140; and they may seek consent-based en\n    counters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consen\n    sual encounter occurs, see INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 217, n. 5.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n         (d) Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have\n    imposed additional requirements—asking whether officers “ ‘deliber\n    ately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to\n    avoid the warrant requirement,’ ” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 656 (case below);\n    reasoning that police may not rely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasona\n    bly foreseeable that [their] investigative tactics . . . would create the\n    exigent circumstances,’ ”ibid.; faulting officers for knocking on a door\n    when they had sufficient evidence to seek a warrant but did not do\n    so; and finding that officers created or manufactured an exigency\n    when their investigation was contrary to standard or good law en\n    forcement practices. Such requirements are unsound and are thus\n    rejected. Pp. 10–14.\n         (e) Respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly cre\n    ated when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable\n    person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable, but that\n    approach is also flawed. The ability of officers to respond to an exi\n    gency cannot turn on such subtleties as the officers’ tone of voice in\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. A\n  forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone\n  is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough,\n  occupants may not know who is at their doorstep. Respondent’s test\n  would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they\n  may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock with\n  out running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in most\n  cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether\n  that threshold had been passed. Pp. 14–15.\n     2. Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence\n  that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened\n  to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment. Pp. 16–\n  19.\n        (a) Any question about whether an exigency existed here is bet\n  ter addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand. P. 17.\n        (b) Assuming an exigency did exist, the officers’ conduct—\n  banging on the door and announcing their presence—was entirely\n  consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Respondent has pointed to\n  no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort\n  of “demand” to enter the apartment, much less a demand that\n  amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment. If there is\n  contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Court’s at\n  tention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.\n  Finally, the record makes clear that the officers’ announcement that\n  they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency\n  arose.

In this case, we\nconsider whether this rule applies when police, by knock­\ning on the door of a residence and announcing their pres­\nence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.\nThe Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent cir­\ncumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand be­\ncause the police should have foreseen that their conduct\nwould prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evi­\ndence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent circum­\nstances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry\ninto the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In\nsuch a situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lex­\nington, Kentucky. Police officers set up a controlled buy of\ncrack cocaine outside an apartment complex. Undercover\n2                     KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nOfficer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an un­\nmarked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal oc­\ncurred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on\nthe suspect. He told the officers that the suspect was\nmoving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment\nbuilding, and he urged them to “hurry up and get there”\nbefore the suspect entered an apartment. App. 20.\n  In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers\ndrove into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and\nran to the breezeway. Just as they entered the breezeway,\nthey heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of\nburnt marijuana. At the end of the breezeway, the officers\nsaw two apartments, one on the left and one on the right,\nand they did not know which apartment the suspect had\nentered. Gibbons had radioed that the suspect was run­\nning into the apartment on the right, but the officers did\nnot hear this statement because they had already left\ntheir vehicles. Because they smelled marijuana smoke\nemanating from the apartment on the left, they ap­\nproached the door of that apartment.\n  Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who\napproached the door, testified that the officers banged on\nthe left apartment door “as loud as [they] could” and an­\nnounced, “ ‘This is the police’ ” or “ ‘Police, police, police.’ ”\nId., at 22–23. Cobb said that “[a]s soon as [the officers]\nstarted banging on the door,” they “could hear people\ninside moving,” and “[i]t sounded as [though] things were\nbeing moved inside the apartment.” Id., at 24. These\nnoises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug­\nrelated evidence was about to be destroyed.\n  At that point, the officers announced that they “were\ngoing to make entry inside the apartment.” Ibid. Cobb\nthen kicked in the door, the officers entered the apart­\nment, and they found three people in the front room:\nrespondent Hollis King, respondent’s girlfriend, and a\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nguest who was smoking marijuana.1 The officers per­\nformed a protective sweep of the apartment during which\nthey saw marijuana and powder cocaine in plain view. In\na subsequent search, they also discovered crack cocaine,\ncash, and drug paraphernalia.\n  Police eventually entered the apartment on the right.\nInside, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the\ninitial target of their investigation.\n                              B\n   In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury\ncharged respondent with trafficking in marijuana, first­\ndegree trafficking in a controlled substance, and second­\ndegree persistent felony offender status. Respondent filed\na motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless\nsearch, but the Circuit Court denied the motion. The\nCircuit Court concluded that the officers had probable\ncause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the\nofficers “properly conducted [the investigation] by initially\nknocking on the door of the apartment unit and awaiting\nthe response or consensual entry.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n9a. Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry,\nthe court held, because “there was no response at all to the\nknocking,” and because “Officer Cobb heard movement in\nthe apartment which he reasonably concluded were per­\nsons in the act of destroying evidence, particularly narcot­\nics because of the smell.” Ibid. Respondent then entered a\nconditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the\ndenial of his suppression motion. The court sentenced\nrespondent to 11 years’ imprisonment.\n   The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that\n——————\n  1 Respondent’s girlfriend leased the apartment, but respondent stayed\n\nthere part of the time, and his child lived there. Based on these facts,\nKentucky conceded in state court that respondent has Fourth Amend­\nment standing to challenge the search. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a;\nsee also 302 S. W. 3d 649, 652 (Ky. 2010).\n4                        KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry\nbecause the police reasonably believed that evidence\nwould be destroyed. The police did not impermissibly\ncreate the exigency, the court explained, because they did\nnot deliberately evade the warrant requirement.\n   The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. 302 S. W. 3d\n649 (2010). As a preliminary matter, the court observed\nthat there was “certainly some question as to whether the\nsound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was suffi­\ncient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.” Id.,\nat 655. But the court did not answer that question. In­\nstead, it “assume[d] for the purpose of argument that\nexigent circumstances existed.” Ibid.\n   To determine whether police impermissibly created the\nexigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a\ntwo-part test. First, the court held, police cannot “deliber­\nately creat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith\nintent to avoid the warrant requirement.” Id., at 656\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Second, even absent\nbad faith, the court concluded, police may not rely on\nexigent circumstances if “it was reasonably foreseeable\nthat the investigative tactics employed by the police would\ncreate the exigent circumstances.” Ibid. (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted). Although the court found no evi­\ndence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could\nnot justify the search because it was reasonably foresee­\nable that the occupants would destroy evidence when the\npolice knocked on the door and announced their presence.\nIbid.\n   We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).2\n——————\n  2 After we granted certiorari, respondent filed a motion to dismiss the\n\npetition as improvidently granted, which we denied. 562 U. S. ___\n(2010). Respondent’s principal argument was that the case was moot\nbecause, after the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed his conviction, the\nCircuit Court dismissed the charges against him. Respondent’s argu­\nment is foreclosed by United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U. S.\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                        II \n\n                        A\n\n  The Fourth Amendment provides: \n\n       “The right of the people to be secure in their per­\n     sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreason­\n     able searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\n     no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n     supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\n     describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n     things to be seized.”\n   The text of the Amendment thus expressly imposes two\nrequirements. First, all searches and seizures must be\nreasonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued unless\nprobable cause is properly established and the scope of the\nauthorized search is set out with particularity. See Payton\nv. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 584 (1980).\n   Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not\nspecify when a search warrant must be obtained, this\nCourt has inferred that a warrant must generally be\nsecured. “It is a ‘basic principle of Fourth Amendment\nlaw,’ ” we have often said, “ ‘that searches and seizures\ninside a home without a warrant are presumptively un­\nreasonable.’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403\n(2006) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559\n(2004)). But we have also recognized that this presump­\ntion may be overcome in some circumstances because\n“[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also\n——————\n579, 581, n. 2 (1983). As we explained in Villamonte-Marquez, our\nreversal of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “would reinstate the\njudgment of conviction and the sentence entered” by the Circuit Court.\nIbid. The absence of an indictment does not change matters. See\nibid. (“Upon respondents’ conviction and sentence, the indictment that\nwas returned against them was merged into their convictions and\nsentences”).\n6                        KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nMichigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 2). Accordingly, the warrant requirement is\nsubject to certain reasonable exceptions. Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403.\n   One well-recognized exception applies when “ ‘the exi­\ngencies of the situation’ make the needs of law en­\nforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is\nobjectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”\nMincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978); see also\nPayton, supra, at 590 (“[T]he Fourth Amendment has\ndrawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent\nexigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably\nbe crossed without a warrant”).\n   This Court has identified several exigencies that may\njustify a warrantless search of a home. See Brigham City,\n547 U. S., at 403. Under the “emergency aid” exception,\nfor example, “officers may enter a home without a warrant\nto render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or\nto protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid.; see\nalso, e.g., Fisher, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding\nwarrantless home entry based on emergency aid excep­\ntion). Police officers may enter premises without a war­\nrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. See\nUnited States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42–43 (1976).\nAnd—what is relevant here—the need “to prevent the\nimminent destruction of evidence” has long been recog­\nnized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.\nBrigham City, supra, at 403; see also Georgia v. Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson, 495\nU. S. 91, 100 (1990).3\n——————\n   3 Preventing the destruction of evidence may also justify dispensing\n\nwith Fourth Amendment requirements in other contexts. See, e.g.,\nRichards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 395–396 (1997) (failure to comply\nwith the knock-and-announce requirement was justified because “the\ncircumstances . . . show[ed] that the officers had a reasonable suspicion\nthat [a suspect] might destroy evidence if given further opportunity to\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) \n                  7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Over the years, lower courts have developed an excep­\ntion to the exigent circumstances rule, the so-called “po­\nlice-created exigency” doctrine. Under this doctrine, police\nmay not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evi­\ndence when that exigency was “created” or “manufactured”\nby the conduct of the police. See, e.g., United States v.\nChambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (“[F]or a war­\nrantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be\nresponding to an unanticipated exigency rather than\nsimply creating the exigency for themselves”); United\nStates v. Gould, 364 F. 3d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc)\n(“[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a war­\nrantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not\ndo so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by\nthe agents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   In applying this exception for the “creation” or “manu­\nfacturing” of an exigency by the police, courts require\nsomething more than mere proof that fear of detection by\nthe police caused the destruction of evidence. An addi­\ntional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth\nCircuit has recognized, “in some sense the police always\ncreate the exigent circumstances.” United States v. Duchi,\n906 F. 2d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990). That is to say, in the\nvast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by\npersons who are engaged in illegal conduct, the reason for\nthe destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the\nhands of law enforcement. Destruction of evidence issues\nprobably occur most frequently in drug cases because\ndrugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a\n——————\ndo so”); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770–771 (1966) (war­\nrantless testing for blood-alcohol content was justified based on poten­\ntial destruction of evidence); cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U. S. 31,\n37–40 (2003) (15 to 20 seconds was a reasonable time for officers to wait\nafter knocking and announcing their presence where there was a risk\nthat suspect would dispose of cocaine).\n8                            KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\ntoilet or rinsing them down a drain. Persons in possession\nof valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they\nfear discovery by the police. Consequently, a rule that\nprecludes the police from making a warrantless entry to\nprevent the destruction of evidence whenever their con­\nduct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the\nreach of this well-established exception to the warrant\nrequirement.\n   Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result,\nthe lower courts have held that the police-created exigency\ndoctrine requires more than simple causation, but the\nlower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied.\nIndeed, the petition in this case maintains that “[t]here\nare currently five different tests being used by the United\nStates Courts of Appeals,” Pet. for Cert. 11, and that some\nstate courts have crafted additional tests, id., at 19–20.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts,\nthe answer to the question presented in this case follows\ndirectly and clearly from the principle that permits war­\nrantless searches in the first place. As previously noted,\nwarrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances\nmake it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.\nTherefore, the answer to the question before us is that the\nexigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search\nwhen the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is\nreasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the police\ndid not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,\nwarrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is\nreasonable and thus allowed.4\n——————\n    4 There   is a strong argument to be made that, at least in most circum­\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have taken a similar approach in other cases involv­\ning warrantless searches. For example, we have held that\nlaw enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view,\nprovided that they have not violated the Fourth Amend­\nment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of\nthe evidence is made. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S.\n128, 136–140 (1990). As we put it in Horton, “[i]t is . . . an\nessential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of\nincriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the\nFourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which\nthe evidence could be plainly viewed.” Id., at 136. So long\nas this prerequisite is satisfied, however, it does not mat­\nter that the officer who makes the observation may have\ngone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with\nthe hope of being able to view and seize the evidence. See\nid., at 138 (“The fact that an officer is interested in an\nitem of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of\na search should not invalidate its seizure”). Instead, the\nFourth Amendment requires only that the steps preceding\nthe seizure be lawful. See id., at 136–137.\n   Similarly, officers may seek consent-based encounters if\nthey are lawfully present in the place where the consen­\nsual encounter occurs. See INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S.\n210, 217, n. 5 (1984) (noting that officers who entered\ninto consent-based encounters with employees in a factory\nbuilding were “lawfully present [in the factory] pursuant\nto consent or a warrant”). If consent is freely given, it\nmakes no difference that an officer may have approached\nthe person with the hope or expectation of obtaining con­\nsent. See id., at 216 (“While most citizens will respond to\na police request, the fact that people do so, and do so\n——————\nstances, the exigent circumstances rule should not apply where the\npolice, without a warrant or any legally sound basis for a warrantless\nentry, threaten that they will enter without permission unless admit­\nted. In this case, however, no such actual threat was made, and there­\nfore we have no need to reach that question.\n10                   KENTUCKY v.

See United States v.\nMacDonald, 916 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law\nenforcement officers “do not impermissibly create exigent\ncircumstances” when they “act in an entirely lawful man­\nner”); State v.

Some courts, including the Kentucky Su­\npreme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers “ ‘de­\nliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad\nfaith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.’ ” 302 S. W.\n3d, at 656 (quoting Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 590); see also, e.g.,\nChambers, 395 F. 3d, at 566; United States v. Socey, 846\nF. 2d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); United States v. Rengifo,\n858 F. 2d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).\n   This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence. “Our cases have re­\npeatedly rejected” a subjective approach, asking only\nwhether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the\naction.” ’Brigham City, 547 U.

Indeed, we have never held,\noutside limited contexts such as an “inventory search or\nadministrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive\ninvalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the\nFourth Amendment.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.\n806, 812 (1996); see also Brigham City, supra, at 405.\n   The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than\nsubjective intent, are clear.

Some courts, again including\nthe Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not\nrely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasonably foreseeable that\nthe investigative tactics employed by the police would\ncreate the exigent circumstances.’ ” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656\n(quoting Mann v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2342951\"><a href=\"/opinion/2342951/mann-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172, 161 S. W. 3d\n826, 834 (2004)); see also, e.g., United States v. Mowatt,\n513 F. 3d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts applying this\ntest have invalidated warrantless home searches on the\nground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police\nofficers, by knocking on the door and announcing their\npresence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.\nSee, e.g., id., at 402–403; 302 S. W. 3d, at 656.\n   Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected\nthe notion that police may seize evidence without a war­\nrant only when they come across the evidence by happen­\nstance. In Horton, as noted, we held that the police may\nseize evidence in plain view even though the officers may\nbe “interested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to\nfind it in the course of a search.” 496 U. S., at 138.\n   Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also\nintroduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability. For\nexample, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the\ndoor of premises occupied by a person who may be in­\nvolved in the drug trade, there is some possibility that the\noccupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy\nthem. Under a reasonable foreseeability test, it would be\nnecessary to quantify the degree of predictability that\nmust be reached before the police-created exigency doc­\ntrine comes into play.\n   A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such\n12                   KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan approach would produce. Suppose that the officers in\nthe present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus\nknew only that there was a 50% chance that the fleeing\nsuspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than\nthe apartment on the right. Under those circumstances,\nwould it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occu­\npants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy\nevidence upon learning that the police were at the door?\nOr suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect\nhad disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with\n3, 5, 10, or even 20 units? If the police chose a door at\nrandom and knocked for the purpose of asking the occu­\npants if they knew a person who fit the description of the\nsuspect, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that\nthe occupants would seek to destroy evidence?\n  We have noted that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness\nmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are\noften forced to make split-second judgments—in circum­\nstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.”\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396–397 (1989). The\nreasonable foreseeability test would create unacceptable\nand unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers\nwho must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for\njudges who would be required to determine after the fact\nwhether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock\non the door was reasonably foreseeable based on what the\nofficers knew at the time.\n  Probable cause and time to secure a warrant. Some\ncourts, in applying the police-created exigency doctrine,\nfault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring evidence\nthat is sufficient to establish probable cause to search\nparticular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but\ninstead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an\noccupant or to obtain consent to search. See, e.g., Cham\nbers, supra, at 569 (citing “[t]he failure to seek a warrant\nin the face of plentiful probable cause” as a factor indicat­\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning that the police deliberately created the exigency).\n   This approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate\nlaw enforcement strategies. There are many entirely\nproper reasons why police may not want to seek a search\nwarrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed\nto establish probable cause is acquired. Without attempt­\ning to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons, we\nnote a few.\n   First, the police may wish to speak with the occupants of\na dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek\nauthorization for a search. They may think that a short\nand simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for\nand execute a warrant. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,\n412 U. S. 218, 228 (1973). Second, the police may want to\nask an occupant of the premises for consent to search\nbecause doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome\nthan applying for a warrant. A consensual search also\n“may result in considerably less inconvenience” and em­\nbarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted\npursuant to a warrant. Ibid. Third, law enforcement\nofficers may wish to obtain more evidence before submit­\nting what might otherwise be considered a marginal war­\nrant application. Fourth, prosecutors may wish to wait\nuntil they acquire evidence that can justify a search that\nis broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is\nlikely to authorize based on the evidence then available.\nAnd finally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want\nto execute a search that will disclose the existence of an\ninvestigation because doing so may interfere with the\nacquisition of additional evidence against those already\nunder suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet\nunknown participants in a criminal scheme.\n   We have said that “[l]aw enforcement officers are under\nno constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investiga­\ntion the moment they have the minimum evidence to\nestablish probable cause.” Hoffa v. United States, 385\n14                  KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to\napply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time\nafter obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is\nnowhere to be found in the Constitution.\n   Standard or good investigative tactics. Finally, some\nlower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers\nmay be found to have created or manufactured an exi­\ngency if the court concludes that the course of their inves­\ntigation was “contrary to standard or good law enforce­\nment practices (or to the policies or practices of their\njurisdictions).” Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 591. This approach\nfails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers\nand authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that\nare the province of those who are responsible for federal\nand state law enforcement agencies.\n                             C\n  Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those\ndiscussed above, but his rule is also flawed. Respondent\ncontends that law enforcement officers impermissibly\ncreate an exigency when they “engage in conduct that\nwould cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is\nimminent and inevitable.” Brief for Respondent 24. In\nrespondent’s view, relevant factors include the officers’\ntone of voice in announcing their presence and the force­\nfulness of their knocks. But the ability of law enforcement\nofficers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such\nsubtleties.\n  Police officers may have a very good reason to announce\ntheir presence loudly and to knock on the door with some\nforce. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the\noccupants that someone is at the door. Cf. United States v.\nBanks, 540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police “rapped hard\nenough on the door to be heard by officers at the back\ndoor” and announced their presence, but defendant “was\nin the shower and testified that he heard nothing”).

S. ____ (2011)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthermore, unless police officers identify themselves loudly\nenough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.\nOfficers are permitted—indeed, encouraged—to identify\nthemselves to citizens, and “in many circumstances this\nis cause for assurance, not discomfort.” United States v.\nDrayton, 536 U. S. 194, 204 (2002). Citizens who are\nstartled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the\nsight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their door­\nstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police\nofficers. Others may appreciate the opportunity to make\nan informed decision about whether to answer the door to\nthe police.\n   If respondent’s test were adopted, it would be extremely\ndifficult for police officers to know how loudly they may\nannounce their presence or how forcefully they may knock\non a door without running afoul of the police-created\nexigency rule. And in most cases, it would be nearly im­\npossible for a court to determine whether that threshold\nhad been passed. The Fourth Amendment does not re­\nquire the nebulous and impractical test that respondent\nproposes.5\n——————\n  5 Contrary to respondent’s argument, see Brief for Respondent 13–18,\n\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 (1948), does not require affir­\nmance in this case. In Johnson, officers noticed the smell of burning\nopium emanating from a hotel room. They then knocked on the door\nand demanded entry. Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant\nof the room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and\ndiscovered opium and drug paraphernalia. Id., at 11.\n  Defending the legality of the search, the Government attempted to\njustify the warrantless search of the room as a valid search incident to\na lawful arrest. See Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States,\nO. T. 1947, No. 329, pp. 13, 16, 36. The Government did not contend\nthat the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of\nevidence. Although the officers said that they heard a “ ‘shuffling’ ”\nnoise inside the room after they knocked on the door, 333 U. S., at 12,\nthe Government did not claim that this particular noise was a noise\nthat would have led a reasonable officer to think that evidence was\nabout to be destroyed. Thus, Johnson is simply not a case about\n16                      KENTUCKY v. KING \n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               D\n\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circum­\nstances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to\npremises by means of an actual or threatened violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample\nprotection for the privacy rights that the Amendment\nprotects.\n   When law enforcement officers who are not armed with\na warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any\nprivate citizen might do. And whether the person who\nknocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak\nis a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no\nobligation to open the door or to speak. Cf. Florida v.\nRoyer, 460 U. S. 491, 497–498 (1983). (“[H]e may decline\nto listen to the questions at all and may go on his way”).\nWhen the police knock on a door but the occupants choose\nnot to respond or to speak, “the investigation will have\nreached a conspicuously low point,” and the occupants\n“will have the kind of warning that even the most elabo­\nrate security system cannot provide.” Chambers, 395\nF. 3d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occu­\npant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers,\nthe occupant need not allow the officers to enter the prem­\nises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.\n   Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitu­\ntional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evi­\ndence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless\nexigent-circumstances search that may ensue.\n\n\n——————\nexigent circumstances. See id., at 14–15 (noting that if “exceptional\ncircumstances” existed—for example, if a “suspect was fleeing or likely\nto take flight” or if “evidence or contraband was threatened with\nremoval or destruction”—then “it may be contended that a magistrate’s\nwarrant for search may be dispensed with”).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Any warrantless entry based on\nexigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a\ngenuine exigency. See Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406.\nThe trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals found\nthat there was a real exigency in this case, but the Ken­\ntucky Supreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, ob­\nserving that there was “certainly some question as to\nwhether the sound of persons moving [inside the apart­\nment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being\ndestroyed.” 302 S. W. 3d, at 655. The Kentucky Supreme\nCourt “assum[ed] for the purpose of argument that exigent\ncircumstances existed,” ibid., and it held that the police\nhad impermissibly manufactured the exigency.\n   We, too, assume for purposes of argument that an exi­\ngency existed. We decide only the question on which the\nKentucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted\ncertiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermis­\nsibly create an exigency? Any question about whether an\nexigency actually existed is better addressed by the Ken­\ntucky Supreme Court on remand. See Kirk v. Louisiana,\n536 U. S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (reversing state­\ncourt judgment that exigent circumstances were not re­\nquired for warrantless home entry and remanding for\nstate court to determine whether exigent circumstances\nwere present).\n                            B\n  In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either\nviolated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so\nprior to the point when they entered the apartment.\n18                    KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nOfficer Cobb testified without contradiction that the offi­\ncers “banged on the door as loud as [they] could” and\nannounced either “ ‘Police, police, police’ ” or “ ‘This is the\npolice.’ ” App. 22–23. This conduct was entirely consistent\nwith the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no\nother evidence that might show that the officers either\nviolated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for\nexample, by announcing that they would break down the\ndoor if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).\n  Respondent argues that the officers “demanded” entry to\nthe apartment, but he has not pointed to any evidence in\nthe record that supports this assertion. He relies on a\npassing statement made by the trial court in its opinion\ndenying respondent’s motion to suppress. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 3a–4a. In recounting the events that preceded\nthe search, the judge wrote that the officers “banged on\nthe door of the apartment on the back left of the breeze­\nway identifying themselves as police officers and demand\ning that the door be opened by the persons inside.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added and deleted). However, at a later point\nin this opinion, the judge stated that the officers “initially\nknock[ed] on the door of the apartment unit and await[ed]\nthe response or consensual entry.” Id., at 9a. This later\nstatement is consistent with the testimony at the suppres­\nsion hearing and with the findings of the state appellate\ncourts. See 302 S. W. 3d, at 651 (The officers “knocked\nloudly on the back left apartment door and announced\n‘police’ ”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a (The officers “knock[ed]\non the door and announc[ed] themselves as police”); App.\n22–24. There is no evidence of a “demand” of any sort,\nmuch less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate\nthe Fourth Amendment. If there is contradictory evidence\nthat has not been brought to our attention, the state court\nmay elect to address that matter on remand.\n  Finally, respondent claims that the officers “explained to\n[the occupants that the officers] were going to make entry\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninside the apartment,” id., at 24, but the record is clear\nthat the officers did not make this statement until after\nthe exigency arose. As Officer Cobb testified, the officers\n“knew that there was possibly something that was going to\nbe destroyed inside the apartment,” and “[a]t that point,\n. . . [they] explained . . . [that they] were going to make\nentry.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Given that this an­\nnouncement was made after the exigency arose, it could\nnot have created the exigency.\n                        *     *     *\n  Like the court below, we assume for purposes of argu­\nment that an exigency existed. Because the officers in this\ncase did not violate or threaten to violate the Fourth\nAmendment prior to the exigency, we hold that the exi­\ngency justified the warrantless search of the apartment.\n  The judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court is re­\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neu\ntral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then\nbreak the door down, nevermind that they had ample time\nto obtain a warrant. I dissent from the Court’s reduction\nof the Fourth Amendment’s force.\n    The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people “[t]he\nright . . . to be secure in their . . . houses . . . against un\nreasonable searches and seizures.” Warrants to search,\nthe Amendment further instructs, shall issue only upon a\nshowing of “probable cause” to believe criminal activity is\nafoot. These complementary provisions are designed to\nensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral\nmagistrate before undertaking a search or seizure. Excep\ntions to the warrant requirement, this Court has ex\nplained, must be “few in number and carefully delineated,”\nif the main rule is to remain hardy. United States v.\nUnited States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407\nU. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S.\n27, 31 (2001).\n   This case involves a principal exception to the warrant\nrequirement, the exception applicable in “exigent circum\nstances.” See ante, at 6–7. “[C]arefully delineated,” the\nexception should govern only in genuine emergency situa\n2                   KENTUCKY v.

Circumstances qualify as “exigent” when there is an\nimminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that\nevidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect\nwill escape. Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403\n(2006). The question presented: May police, who could\npause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dis\npense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creat\ning exigent circumstances? I would answer no, as did the\nKentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must exist, I\nwould rule, when the police come on the scene, not subse\nquent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.\n                              I\n  Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence\nshould have controlled the Court’s ruling: First, “whenever\npractical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial ap\nproval of searches and seizures through the warrant pro\ncedure,” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968); second,\nunwarranted “searches and seizures inside a home” bear\nheightened scrutiny, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,\n586 (1980). The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson\nobserved, ranks among the “fundamental distinctions\nbetween our form of government, where officers are un-\nder the law, and the police-state where they are the law.”\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The\nCourt has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in\nthe main, “per se unreasonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437\nU. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S.\n551, 559 (2004). “[T]he police bear a heavy burden,” the\nCourt has cautioned, “when attempting to demonstrate an\nurgent need that might justify warrantless searches.”\nWelsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1984).\n  That heavy burden has not been carried here. There\nwas little risk that drug-related evidence would have been\ndestroyed had the police delayed the search pending\na magistrate’s authorization.

Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the\nknock at the apartment door, the occupants were appre\nhensive about police proximity.\n   In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with\ngreater force than in our homes, our most private space\nwhich, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to\nspecial protection.’ ” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103,\n115, and n. 4 (2006); Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 99\n(1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Home intrusions, the\nCourt has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which . . .\nthe Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U.

S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth\nAmendment’s] very core stands the right of a man to\nretreat to his own home and there be free from unreason\nable governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[S]earches and seizures\ninside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presump\ntively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403\n(quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our\nhomes remain if police, armed with no warrant, can pound\non doors at will and, on hearing sounds indicative of\nthings moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of\nunlawful activity?\n                               II\n    As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case,\nKentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emer\ngencies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant\n. . . threaten[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Schmerber\nv. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v.\nUnited States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within\nthis exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now\nor never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v.\nKentucky, 413 U.

KING\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only\non the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless\nsearch; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken\nby the police preceding the warrantless search.” United\nStates v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also\nUnited States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005)\n(“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause\nwhen they believe in advance they will find contraband or\nevidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to\nobtain a warrant,” therefore, “disentitles the officer from\nrelying on subsequent exigent circumstances.” S. Saltz\nburg & D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th\ned. 2007).\n   Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exi\ngent circumstances” exception, the result in this case\nshould not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s\nentry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seep\ning under the apartment door into the hallway, the Ken\ntucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police\n“probable cause . . . sufficient . . . to obtain a warrant to\nsearch the . . . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).\nAs that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for\nthe police to post officers on the premises while proceeding\nto obtain a warrant authorizing their entry. Id., at\n654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be\nof no importance whether police could have obtained a\nwarrant”).\n   In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing\noutside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium\nand heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room.\n333 U.

When possible, “a warrant must generally be\nsecured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 5. There is\nevery reason to conclude that securing a warrant was\nentirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the\nFourth Amendment’s dominion.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   * The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer]\nknocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’\nwas to conceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief\nfor United States in Johnson v.

KING\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n    No. 09–1272. Argued January 12, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011\nPolice officers in Lexington, Kentucky, followed a suspected drug dealer\n  to an apartment complex. They smelled marijuana outside an\n  apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence. As\n  soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises coming from\n  the apartment; the officers believed that these noises were consistent\n  with the destruction of evidence. The officers announced their intent\n  to enter the apartment, kicked in the door, and found respondent and\n  others. They saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of\n  the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent\n  search. The Circuit Court denied respondent’s motion to suppress\n  the evidence, holding that exigent circumstances—the need to pre\n  vent destruction of evidence—justified the warrantless entry. Re\n  spondent entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to ap\n  peal the suppression ruling, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals\n  affirmed. The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. The court as\n  sumed that exigent circumstances existed, but it nonetheless invali\n  dated the search. The exigent circumstances rule did not apply, the\n  court held, because the police should have foreseen that their conduct\n  would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.\nHeld:\n    1. The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not\n create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct\n that violates the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 5–16.\n       (a) The Fourth Amendment expressly imposes two requirements:\n All searches and seizures must be reasonable; and a warrant may not\n be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope\n of the authorized search is set out with particularity. Although\n “ ‘searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are pre\n sumptively unreasonable,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398,\n2                          KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    403, this presumption may be overcome when “ ‘the exigencies of the\n    situation’ make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a]\n    warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\n    Amendment,” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394. One such exi\n    gency is the need “to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.”\n    Brigham City, supra, at 403. Pp. 5–6.\n         (b) Under the “police-created exigency” doctrine, which lower\n    courts have developed as an exception to the exigent circumstances\n    rule, exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when\n    the exigency was “created” or “manufactured” by the conduct of the\n    police. The lower courts have not agreed, however, on the test for de\n    termining when police impermissibly create an exigency. Pp. 7–8.\n         (c) The proper test follows from the principle that permits war\n    rantless searches: warrantless searches are allowed when the cir\n    cumstances make it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth\n    Amendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement. Thus, a\n    warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when\n    the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to\n    engage in conduct violating the Fourth Amendment. A similar ap\n    proach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.\n    For example, officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have\n    not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from\n    which the observation of the evidence is made, see Horton v. Califor\n    nia, 496 U. S. 128, 136–140; and they may seek consent-based en\n    counters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consen\n    sual encounter occurs, see INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 217, n. 5.\n    Pp. 8–10.\n         (d) Some courts, including the Kentucky Supreme Court, have\n    imposed additional requirements—asking whether officers “ ‘deliber\n    ately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to\n    avoid the warrant requirement,’ ” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 656 (case below);\n    reasoning that police may not rely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasona\n    bly foreseeable that [their] investigative tactics . . . would create the\n    exigent circumstances,’ ”ibid.; faulting officers for knocking on a door\n    when they had sufficient evidence to seek a warrant but did not do\n    so; and finding that officers created or manufactured an exigency\n    when their investigation was contrary to standard or good law en\n    forcement practices. Such requirements are unsound and are thus\n    rejected. Pp. 10–14.\n         (e) Respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly cre\n    ated when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable\n    person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable, but that\n    approach is also flawed. The ability of officers to respond to an exi\n    gency cannot turn on such subtleties as the officers’ tone of voice in\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks. A\n  forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone\n  is at the door, and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough,\n  occupants may not know who is at their doorstep. Respondent’s test\n  would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they\n  may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock with\n  out running afoul of the police-created exigency rule. And in most\n  cases, it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether\n  that threshold had been passed. Pp. 14–15.\n     2. Assuming that an exigency existed here, there is no evidence\n  that the officers either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened\n  to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment. Pp. 16–\n  19.\n        (a) Any question about whether an exigency existed here is bet\n  ter addressed by the Kentucky Supreme Court on remand. P. 17.\n        (b) Assuming an exigency did exist, the officers’ conduct—\n  banging on the door and announcing their presence—was entirely\n  consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Respondent has pointed to\n  no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort\n  of “demand” to enter the apartment, much less a demand that\n  amounts to a threat to violate the Fourth Amendment. If there is\n  contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this Court’s at\n  tention, the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.\n  Finally, the record makes clear that the officers’ announcement that\n  they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency\n  arose.

In this case, we\nconsider whether this rule applies when police, by knock­\ning on the door of a residence and announcing their pres­\nence, cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.\nThe Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent cir­\ncumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand be­\ncause the police should have foreseen that their conduct\nwould prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evi­\ndence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent circum­\nstances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their entry\ninto the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In\nsuch a situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lex­\nington, Kentucky. Police officers set up a controlled buy of\ncrack cocaine outside an apartment complex. Undercover\n2                     KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nOfficer Gibbons watched the deal take place from an un­\nmarked car in a nearby parking lot. After the deal oc­\ncurred, Gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on\nthe suspect. He told the officers that the suspect was\nmoving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment\nbuilding, and he urged them to “hurry up and get there”\nbefore the suspect entered an apartment. App. 20.\n  In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers\ndrove into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and\nran to the breezeway. Just as they entered the breezeway,\nthey heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of\nburnt marijuana. At the end of the breezeway, the officers\nsaw two apartments, one on the left and one on the right,\nand they did not know which apartment the suspect had\nentered. Gibbons had radioed that the suspect was run­\nning into the apartment on the right, but the officers did\nnot hear this statement because they had already left\ntheir vehicles. Because they smelled marijuana smoke\nemanating from the apartment on the left, they ap­\nproached the door of that apartment.\n  Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who\napproached the door, testified that the officers banged on\nthe left apartment door “as loud as [they] could” and an­\nnounced, “ ‘This is the police’ ” or “ ‘Police, police, police.’ ”\nId., at 22–23. Cobb said that “[a]s soon as [the officers]\nstarted banging on the door,” they “could hear people\ninside moving,” and “[i]t sounded as [though] things were\nbeing moved inside the apartment.” Id., at 24. These\nnoises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that drug­\nrelated evidence was about to be destroyed.\n  At that point, the officers announced that they “were\ngoing to make entry inside the apartment.” Ibid. Cobb\nthen kicked in the door, the officers entered the apart­\nment, and they found three people in the front room:\nrespondent Hollis King, respondent’s girlfriend, and a\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

In\na subsequent search, they also discovered crack cocaine,\ncash, and drug paraphernalia.\n  Police eventually entered the apartment on the right.\nInside, they found the suspected drug dealer who was the\ninitial target of their investigation.\n                              B\n   In the Fayette County Circuit Court, a grand jury\ncharged respondent with trafficking in marijuana, first­\ndegree trafficking in a controlled substance, and second­\ndegree persistent felony offender status. Respondent filed\na motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless\nsearch, but the Circuit Court denied the motion. The\nCircuit Court concluded that the officers had probable\ncause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the\nofficers “properly conducted [the investigation] by initially\nknocking on the door of the apartment unit and awaiting\nthe response or consensual entry.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n9a. Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry,\nthe court held, because “there was no response at all to the\nknocking,” and because “Officer Cobb heard movement in\nthe apartment which he reasonably concluded were per­\nsons in the act of destroying evidence, particularly narcot­\nics because of the smell.” Ibid. Respondent then entered a\nconditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the\ndenial of his suppression motion. The court sentenced\nrespondent to 11 years’ imprisonment.\n   The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that\n——————\n  1 Respondent’s girlfriend leased the apartment, but respondent stayed\n\nthere part of the time, and his child lived there. Based on these facts,\nKentucky conceded in state court that respondent has Fourth Amend­\nment standing to challenge the search. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a;\nsee also 302 S. W. 3d 649, 652 (Ky. 2010).\n4                        KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry\nbecause the police reasonably believed that evidence\nwould be destroyed. The police did not impermissibly\ncreate the exigency, the court explained, because they did\nnot deliberately evade the warrant requirement.\n   The Supreme Court of Kentucky reversed. 302 S. W. 3d\n649 (2010). As a preliminary matter, the court observed\nthat there was “certainly some question as to whether the\nsound of persons moving [inside the apartment] was suffi­\ncient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.” Id.,\nat 655. But the court did not answer that question. In­\nstead, it “assume[d] for the purpose of argument that\nexigent circumstances existed.” Ibid.\n   To determine whether police impermissibly created the\nexigency, the Supreme Court of Kentucky announced a\ntwo-part test. First, the court held, police cannot “deliber­\nately creat[e] the exigent circumstances with the bad faith\nintent to avoid the warrant requirement.” Id., at 656\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Second, even absent\nbad faith, the court concluded, police may not rely on\nexigent circumstances if “it was reasonably foreseeable\nthat the investigative tactics employed by the police would\ncreate the exigent circumstances.” Ibid. (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted). Although the court found no evi­\ndence of bad faith, it held that exigent circumstances could\nnot justify the search because it was reasonably foresee­\nable that the occupants would destroy evidence when the\npolice knocked on the door and announced their presence.\nIbid.\n   We granted certiorari. 561 U.

First, all searches and seizures must be\nreasonable. Second, a warrant may not be issued unless\nprobable cause is properly established and the scope of the\nauthorized search is set out with particularity. See Payton\nv. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 584 (1980).\n   Although the text of the Fourth Amendment does not\nspecify when a search warrant must be obtained, this\nCourt has inferred that a warrant must generally be\nsecured. “It is a ‘basic principle of Fourth Amendment\nlaw,’ ” we have often said, “ ‘that searches and seizures\ninside a home without a warrant are presumptively un­\nreasonable.’ ” Brigham City v.

But we have also recognized that this presump­\ntion may be overcome in some circumstances because\n“[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City, supra, at 403; see also\n——————\n579, 581, n. 2 (1983). As we explained in Villamonte-Marquez, our\nreversal of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision “would reinstate the\njudgment of conviction and the sentence entered” by the Circuit Court.\nIbid. The absence of an indictment does not change matters. See\nibid. (“Upon respondents’ conviction and sentence, the indictment that\nwas returned against them was merged into their convictions and\nsentences”).\n6                        KENTUCKY v.

Accordingly, the warrant requirement is\nsubject to certain reasonable exceptions. Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403.\n   One well-recognized exception applies when “ ‘the exi­\ngencies of the situation’ make the needs of law en­\nforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is\nobjectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”\nMincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978); see also\nPayton, supra, at 590 (“[T]he Fourth Amendment has\ndrawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent\nexigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably\nbe crossed without a warrant”).\n   This Court has identified several exigencies that may\njustify a warrantless search of a home. See Brigham City,\n547 U. S., at 403. Under the “emergency aid” exception,\nfor example, “officers may enter a home without a warrant\nto render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or\nto protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid.; see\nalso, e.g., Fisher, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (upholding\nwarrantless home entry based on emergency aid excep­\ntion). Police officers may enter premises without a war­\nrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. See\nUnited States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42–43 (1976).\nAnd—what is relevant here—the need “to prevent the\nimminent destruction of evidence” has long been recog­\nnized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.\nBrigham City, supra, at 403; see also Georgia v. Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson, 495\nU. S. 91, 100 (1990).3\n——————\n   3 Preventing the destruction of evidence may also justify dispensing\n\nwith Fourth Amendment requirements in other contexts. See, e.g.,\nRichards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 395–396 (1997) (failure to comply\nwith the knock-and-announce requirement was justified because “the\ncircumstances . . . show[ed] that the officers had a reasonable suspicion\nthat [a suspect] might destroy evidence if given further opportunity to\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Under this doctrine, police\nmay not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evi­\ndence when that exigency was “created” or “manufactured”\nby the conduct of the police. See, e.g., United States v.\nChambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 566 (CA6 2005) (“[F]or a war­\nrantless search to stand, law enforcement officers must be\nresponding to an unanticipated exigency rather than\nsimply creating the exigency for themselves”); United\nStates v. Gould, 364 F. 3d 578, 590 (CA5 2004) (en banc)\n(“[A]lthough exigent circumstances may justify a war­\nrantless probable cause entry into the home, they will not\ndo so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by\nthe agents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   In applying this exception for the “creation” or “manu­\nfacturing” of an exigency by the police, courts require\nsomething more than mere proof that fear of detection by\nthe police caused the destruction of evidence. An addi­\ntional showing is obviously needed because, as the Eighth\nCircuit has recognized, “in some sense the police always\ncreate the exigent circumstances.” United States v. Duchi,\n906 F. 2d 1278, 1284 (CA8 1990). That is to say, in the\nvast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by\npersons who are engaged in illegal conduct, the reason for\nthe destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the\nhands of law enforcement. Destruction of evidence issues\nprobably occur most frequently in drug cases because\ndrugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a\n——————\ndo so”); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770–771 (1966) (war­\nrantless testing for blood-alcohol content was justified based on poten­\ntial destruction of evidence); cf. United States v. Banks, 540 U. S. 31,\n37–40 (2003) (15 to 20 seconds was a reasonable time for officers to wait\nafter knocking and announcing their presence where there was a risk\nthat suspect would dispose of cocaine).\n8                            KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\ntoilet or rinsing them down a drain. Persons in possession\nof valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they\nfear discovery by the police. Consequently, a rule that\nprecludes the police from making a warrantless entry to\nprevent the destruction of evidence whenever their con­\nduct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the\nreach of this well-established exception to the warrant\nrequirement.\n   Presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result,\nthe lower courts have held that the police-created exigency\ndoctrine requires more than simple causation, but the\nlower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied.\nIndeed, the petition in this case maintains that “[t]here\nare currently five different tests being used by the United\nStates Courts of Appeals,” Pet. for Cert. 11, and that some\nstate courts have crafted additional tests, id., at 19–20.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts,\nthe answer to the question presented in this case follows\ndirectly and clearly from the principle that permits war­\nrantless searches in the first place. As previously noted,\nwarrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances\nmake it reasonable, within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment, to dispense with the warrant requirement.\nTherefore, the answer to the question before us is that the\nexigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search\nwhen the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is\nreasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the police\ndid not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to\nengage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,\nwarrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is\nreasonable and thus allowed.4\n——————\n    4 There   is a strong argument to be made that, at least in most circum­\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have taken a similar approach in other cases involv­\ning warrantless searches. For example, we have held that\nlaw enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view,\nprovided that they have not violated the Fourth Amend­\nment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of\nthe evidence is made. See Horton v. California, 496 U. S.\n128, 136–140 (1990). As we put it in Horton, “[i]t is . . . an\nessential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of\nincriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the\nFourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which\nthe evidence could be plainly viewed.” Id., at 136. So long\nas this prerequisite is satisfied, however, it does not mat­\nter that the officer who makes the observation may have\ngone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with\nthe hope of being able to view and seize the evidence. See\nid., at 138 (“The fact that an officer is interested in an\nitem of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of\na search should not invalidate its seizure”). Instead, the\nFourth Amendment requires only that the steps preceding\nthe seizure be lawful. See id., at 136–137.\n   Similarly, officers may seek consent-based encounters if\nthey are lawfully present in the place where the consen­\nsual encounter occurs. See INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S.\n210, 217, n. 5 (1984) (noting that officers who entered\ninto consent-based encounters with employees in a factory\nbuilding were “lawfully present [in the factory] pursuant\nto consent or a warrant”). If consent is freely given, it\nmakes no difference that an officer may have approached\nthe person with the hope or expectation of obtaining con­\nsent. See id., at 216 (“While most citizens will respond to\na police request, the fact that people do so, and do so\n——————\nstances, the exigent circumstances rule should not apply where the\npolice, without a warrant or any legally sound basis for a warrantless\nentry, threaten that they will enter without permission unless admit­\nted. In this case, however, no such actual threat was made, and there­\nfore we have no need to reach that question.\n10                   KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout being told they are free not to respond, hardly\neliminates the consensual nature of the response”).\n                                B\n   Some lower courts have adopted a rule that is similar to\nthe one that we recognize today. See United States v.\nMacDonald, 916 F. 2d 766, 772 (CA2 1990) (en banc) (law\nenforcement officers “do not impermissibly create exigent\ncircumstances” when they “act in an entirely lawful man­\nner”); State v. Robinson, 2010 WI 80, ¶32, 327 Wis. 2d 302,\n326–328, 786 N. W. 2d 463, 475–476 (2010). But others,\nincluding the Kentucky Supreme Court, have imposed\nadditional requirements that are unsound and that we\nnow reject.\n   Bad faith. Some courts, including the Kentucky Su­\npreme Court, ask whether law enforcement officers “ ‘de­\nliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad\nfaith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.’ ” 302 S. W.\n3d, at 656 (quoting Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 590); see also, e.g.,\nChambers, 395 F. 3d, at 566; United States v. Socey, 846\nF. 2d 1439, 1448 (CADC 1988); United States v. Rengifo,\n858 F. 2d 800, 804 (CA1 1988).\n   This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence. “Our cases have re­\npeatedly rejected” a subjective approach, asking only\nwhether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the\naction.” ’Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 404 (alteration and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Fisher, 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–5). Indeed, we have never held,\noutside limited contexts such as an “inventory search or\nadministrative inspection . . . , that an officer’s motive\ninvalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the\nFourth Amendment.” Whren v. United States, 517 U. S.\n806, 812 (1996); see also Brigham City, supra, at 405.\n   The reasons for looking to objective factors, rather than\nsubjective intent, are clear. Legal tests based on reason­\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Some courts, again including\nthe Kentucky Supreme Court, hold that police may not\nrely on an exigency if “ ‘it was reasonably foreseeable that\nthe investigative tactics employed by the police would\ncreate the exigent circumstances.’ ” 302 S. W. 3d, at 656\n(quoting Mann v. State, 357 Ark. 159, 172, 161 S. W. 3d\n826, 834 (2004)); see also, e.g., United States v. Mowatt,\n513 F. 3d 395, 402 (CA4 2008). Courts applying this\ntest have invalidated warrantless home searches on the\nground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police\nofficers, by knocking on the door and announcing their\npresence, would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.\nSee, e.g., id., at 402–403; 302 S. W. 3d, at 656.\n   Contrary to this reasoning, however, we have rejected\nthe notion that police may seize evidence without a war­\nrant only when they come across the evidence by happen­\nstance. In Horton, as noted, we held that the police may\nseize evidence in plain view even though the officers may\nbe “interested in an item of evidence and fully expec[t] to\nfind it in the course of a search.” 496 U. S., at 138.\n   Adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also\nintroduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability. For\nexample, whenever law enforcement officers knock on the\ndoor of premises occupied by a person who may be in­\nvolved in the drug trade, there is some possibility that the\noccupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy\nthem. Under a reasonable foreseeability test, it would be\nnecessary to quantify the degree of predictability that\nmust be reached before the police-created exigency doc­\ntrine comes into play.\n   A simple example illustrates the difficulties that such\n12                   KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan approach would produce. Suppose that the officers in\nthe present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus\nknew only that there was a 50% chance that the fleeing\nsuspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than\nthe apartment on the right. Under those circumstances,\nwould it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occu­\npants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy\nevidence upon learning that the police were at the door?\nOr suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect\nhad disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with\n3, 5, 10, or even 20 units? If the police chose a door at\nrandom and knocked for the purpose of asking the occu­\npants if they knew a person who fit the description of the\nsuspect, would it have been reasonably foreseeable that\nthe occupants would seek to destroy evidence?\n  We have noted that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness\nmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are\noften forced to make split-second judgments—in circum­\nstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.”\nGraham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396–397 (1989). The\nreasonable foreseeability test would create unacceptable\nand unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers\nwho must make quick decisions in the field, as well as for\njudges who would be required to determine after the fact\nwhether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock\non the door was reasonably foreseeable based on what the\nofficers knew at the time.\n  Probable cause and time to secure a warrant. Some\ncourts, in applying the police-created exigency doctrine,\nfault law enforcement officers if, after acquiring evidence\nthat is sufficient to establish probable cause to search\nparticular premises, the officers do not seek a warrant but\ninstead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an\noccupant or to obtain consent to search. See, e.g., Cham\nbers, supra, at 569 (citing “[t]he failure to seek a warrant\nin the face of plentiful probable cause” as a factor indicat­\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning that the police deliberately created the exigency).\n   This approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate\nlaw enforcement strategies. There are many entirely\nproper reasons why police may not want to seek a search\nwarrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed\nto establish probable cause is acquired. Without attempt­\ning to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons, we\nnote a few.\n   First, the police may wish to speak with the occupants of\na dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek\nauthorization for a search. They may think that a short\nand simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for\nand execute a warrant. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,\n412 U. S. 218, 228 (1973). Second, the police may want to\nask an occupant of the premises for consent to search\nbecause doing so is simpler, faster, and less burdensome\nthan applying for a warrant. A consensual search also\n“may result in considerably less inconvenience” and em­\nbarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted\npursuant to a warrant. Ibid. Third, law enforcement\nofficers may wish to obtain more evidence before submit­\nting what might otherwise be considered a marginal war­\nrant application. Fourth, prosecutors may wish to wait\nuntil they acquire evidence that can justify a search that\nis broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is\nlikely to authorize based on the evidence then available.\nAnd finally, in many cases, law enforcement may not want\nto execute a search that will disclose the existence of an\ninvestigation because doing so may interfere with the\nacquisition of additional evidence against those already\nunder suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet\nunknown participants in a criminal scheme.\n   We have said that “[l]aw enforcement officers are under\nno constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investiga­\ntion the moment they have the minimum evidence to\nestablish probable cause.” Hoffa v. United States, 385\n14                  KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 293, 310 (1966). Faulting the police for failing to\napply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time\nafter obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is\nnowhere to be found in the Constitution.\n   Standard or good investigative tactics. Finally, some\nlower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers\nmay be found to have created or manufactured an exi­\ngency if the court concludes that the course of their inves­\ntigation was “contrary to standard or good law enforce­\nment practices (or to the policies or practices of their\njurisdictions).” Gould, 364 F. 3d, at 591. This approach\nfails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers\nand authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that\nare the province of those who are responsible for federal\nand state law enforcement agencies.\n                             C\n  Respondent argues for a rule that differs from those\ndiscussed above, but his rule is also flawed. Respondent\ncontends that law enforcement officers impermissibly\ncreate an exigency when they “engage in conduct that\nwould cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is\nimminent and inevitable.” Brief for Respondent 24. In\nrespondent’s view, relevant factors include the officers’\ntone of voice in announcing their presence and the force­\nfulness of their knocks. But the ability of law enforcement\nofficers to respond to an exigency cannot turn on such\nsubtleties.\n  Police officers may have a very good reason to announce\ntheir presence loudly and to knock on the door with some\nforce. A forceful knock may be necessary to alert the\noccupants that someone is at the door. Cf. United States v.\nBanks, 540 U. S. 31, 33 (2003) (Police “rapped hard\nenough on the door to be heard by officers at the back\ndoor” and announced their presence, but defendant “was\nin the shower and testified that he heard nothing”).

S. ____ (2011)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthermore, unless police officers identify themselves loudly\nenough, occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.\nOfficers are permitted—indeed, encouraged—to identify\nthemselves to citizens, and “in many circumstances this\nis cause for assurance, not discomfort.” United States v.\nDrayton, 536 U. S. 194, 204 (2002). Citizens who are\nstartled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the\nsight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their door­\nstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police\nofficers. Others may appreciate the opportunity to make\nan informed decision about whether to answer the door to\nthe police.\n   If respondent’s test were adopted, it would be extremely\ndifficult for police officers to know how loudly they may\nannounce their presence or how forcefully they may knock\non a door without running afoul of the police-created\nexigency rule. And in most cases, it would be nearly im­\npossible for a court to determine whether that threshold\nhad been passed. The Fourth Amendment does not re­\nquire the nebulous and impractical test that respondent\nproposes.5\n——————\n  5 Contrary to respondent’s argument, see Brief for Respondent 13–18,\n\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 (1948), does not require affir­\nmance in this case. In Johnson, officers noticed the smell of burning\nopium emanating from a hotel room. They then knocked on the door\nand demanded entry. Upon seeing that Johnson was the only occupant\nof the room, they placed her under arrest, searched the room, and\ndiscovered opium and drug paraphernalia. Id., at 11.\n  Defending the legality of the search, the Government attempted to\njustify the warrantless search of the room as a valid search incident to\na lawful arrest. See Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States,\nO. T. 1947, No. 329, pp. 13, 16, 36. The Government did not contend\nthat the officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of\nevidence. Although the officers said that they heard a “ ‘shuffling’ ”\nnoise inside the room after they knocked on the door, 333 U. S., at 12,\nthe Government did not claim that this particular noise was a noise\nthat would have led a reasonable officer to think that evidence was\nabout to be destroyed. Thus, Johnson is simply not a case about\n16                      KENTUCKY v. KING \n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               D\n\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the exigent circum­\nstances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to\npremises by means of an actual or threatened violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment. This holding provides ample\nprotection for the privacy rights that the Amendment\nprotects.\n   When law enforcement officers who are not armed with\na warrant knock on a door, they do no more than any\nprivate citizen might do. And whether the person who\nknocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak\nis a police officer or a private citizen, the occupant has no\nobligation to open the door or to speak. Cf. Florida v.\nRoyer, 460 U. S. 491, 497–498 (1983). (“[H]e may decline\nto listen to the questions at all and may go on his way”).\nWhen the police knock on a door but the occupants choose\nnot to respond or to speak, “the investigation will have\nreached a conspicuously low point,” and the occupants\n“will have the kind of warning that even the most elabo­\nrate security system cannot provide.” Chambers, 395\nF. 3d, at 577 (Sutton, J., dissenting). And even if an occu­\npant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers,\nthe occupant need not allow the officers to enter the prem­\nises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.\n   Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitu­\ntional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evi­\ndence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless\nexigent-circumstances search that may ensue.\n\n\n——————\nexigent circumstances. See id., at 14–15 (noting that if “exceptional\ncircumstances” existed—for example, if a “suspect was fleeing or likely\nto take flight” or if “evidence or contraband was threatened with\nremoval or destruction”—then “it may be contended that a magistrate’s\nwarrant for search may be dispensed with”).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Any warrantless entry based on\nexigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a\ngenuine exigency. See Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406.\nThe trial court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals found\nthat there was a real exigency in this case, but the Ken­\ntucky Supreme Court expressed doubt on this issue, ob­\nserving that there was “certainly some question as to\nwhether the sound of persons moving [inside the apart­\nment] was sufficient to establish that evidence was being\ndestroyed.” 302 S. W. 3d, at 655. The Kentucky Supreme\nCourt “assum[ed] for the purpose of argument that exigent\ncircumstances existed,” ibid., and it held that the police\nhad impermissibly manufactured the exigency.\n   We, too, assume for purposes of argument that an exi­\ngency existed. We decide only the question on which the\nKentucky Supreme Court ruled and on which we granted\ncertiorari: Under what circumstances do police impermis­\nsibly create an exigency? Any question about whether an\nexigency actually existed is better addressed by the Ken­\ntucky Supreme Court on remand. See Kirk v. Louisiana,\n536 U. S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (reversing state­\ncourt judgment that exigent circumstances were not re­\nquired for warrantless home entry and remanding for\nstate court to determine whether exigent circumstances\nwere present).\n                            B\n  In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either\nviolated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so\nprior to the point when they entered the apartment.\n18                    KENTUCKY v.

This conduct was entirely consistent\nwith the Fourth Amendment, and we are aware of no\nother evidence that might show that the officers either\nviolated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so (for\nexample, by announcing that they would break down the\ndoor if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).\n  Respondent argues that the officers “demanded” entry to\nthe apartment, but he has not pointed to any evidence in\nthe record that supports this assertion. He relies on a\npassing statement made by the trial court in its opinion\ndenying respondent’s motion to suppress. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 3a–4a. In recounting the events that preceded\nthe search, the judge wrote that the officers “banged on\nthe door of the apartment on the back left of the breeze­\nway identifying themselves as police officers and demand\ning that the door be opened by the persons inside.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added and deleted). However, at a later point\nin this opinion, the judge stated that the officers “initially\nknock[ed] on the door of the apartment unit and await[ed]\nthe response or consensual entry.” Id., at 9a. This later\nstatement is consistent with the testimony at the suppres­\nsion hearing and with the findings of the state appellate\ncourts. See 302 S. W. 3d, at 651 (The officers “knocked\nloudly on the back left apartment door and announced\n‘police’ ”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a (The officers “knock[ed]\non the door and announc[ed] themselves as police”); App.\n22–24. There is no evidence of a “demand” of any sort,\nmuch less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate\nthe Fourth Amendment. If there is contradictory evidence\nthat has not been brought to our attention, the state court\nmay elect to address that matter on remand.\n  Finally, respondent claims that the officers “explained to\n[the occupants that the officers] were going to make entry\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninside the apartment,” id., at 24, but the record is clear\nthat the officers did not make this statement until after\nthe exigency arose. As Officer Cobb testified, the officers\n“knew that there was possibly something that was going to\nbe destroyed inside the apartment,” and “[a]t that point,\n. . . [they] explained . . . [that they] were going to make\nentry.” Ibid. (emphasis added). Given that this an­\nnouncement was made after the exigency arose, it could\nnot have created the exigency.\n                        *     *     *\n  Like the court below, we assume for purposes of argu­\nment that an exigency existed. Because the officers in this\ncase did not violate or threaten to violate the Fourth\nAmendment prior to the exigency, we hold that the exi­\ngency justified the warrantless search of the apartment.\n  The judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court is re­\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

HOLLIS DESHAUN KING\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                      KENTUCKY\n\n                         [May 16, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.\n   The Court today arms the police with a way routinely to\ndishonor the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement in\ndrug cases. In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neu\ntral magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then\nbreak the door down, nevermind that they had ample time\nto obtain a warrant. I dissent from the Court’s reduction\nof the Fourth Amendment’s force.\n    The Fourth Amendment guarantees to the people “[t]he\nright . . . to be secure in their . . . houses . . . against un\nreasonable searches and seizures.” Warrants to search,\nthe Amendment further instructs, shall issue only upon a\nshowing of “probable cause” to believe criminal activity is\nafoot. These complementary provisions are designed to\nensure that police will seek the authorization of a neutral\nmagistrate before undertaking a search or seizure. Excep\ntions to the warrant requirement, this Court has ex\nplained, must be “few in number and carefully delineated,”\nif the main rule is to remain hardy. United States v.\nUnited States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407\nU. S. 297, 318 (1972); see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S.\n27, 31 (2001).\n   This case involves a principal exception to the warrant\nrequirement, the exception applicable in “exigent circum\nstances.” See ante, at 6–7. “[C]arefully delineated,” the\nexception should govern only in genuine emergency situa\n2                   KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntions. Circumstances qualify as “exigent” when there is an\nimminent risk of death or serious injury, or danger that\nevidence will be immediately destroyed, or that a suspect\nwill escape. Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403\n(2006). The question presented: May police, who could\npause to gain the approval of a neutral magistrate, dis\npense with the need to get a warrant by themselves creat\ning exigent circumstances? I would answer no, as did the\nKentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must exist, I\nwould rule, when the police come on the scene, not subse\nquent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.\n                              I\n  Two pillars of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence\nshould have controlled the Court’s ruling: First, “whenever\npractical, [the police must] obtain advance judicial ap\nproval of searches and seizures through the warrant pro\ncedure,” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968); second,\nunwarranted “searches and seizures inside a home” bear\nheightened scrutiny, Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,\n586 (1980). The warrant requirement, Justice Jackson\nobserved, ranks among the “fundamental distinctions\nbetween our form of government, where officers are un-\nder the law, and the police-state where they are the law.”\nJohnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948). The\nCourt has accordingly declared warrantless searches, in\nthe main, “per se unreasonable.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437\nU. S. 385, 390 (1978); see also Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S.\n551, 559 (2004). “[T]he police bear a heavy burden,” the\nCourt has cautioned, “when attempting to demonstrate an\nurgent need that might justify warrantless searches.”\nWelsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 749–750 (1984).\n  That heavy burden has not been carried here. There\nwas little risk that drug-related evidence would have been\ndestroyed had the police delayed the search pending\na magistrate’s authorization. As the Court recognizes,\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)              3\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n“[p]ersons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to\ndestroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.”\nAnte, at 8. Nothing in the record shows that, prior to the\nknock at the apartment door, the occupants were appre\nhensive about police proximity.\n   In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with\ngreater force than in our homes, our most private space\nwhich, for centuries, has been regarded as “ ‘entitled to\nspecial protection.’ ” Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103,\n115, and n. 4 (2006); Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 99\n(1998) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Home intrusions, the\nCourt has said, are indeed “the chief evil against which . . .\nthe Fourth Amendment is directed.” Payton, 445 U. S., at\n585 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Silverman v.\nUnited States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961) (“At [the Fourth\nAmendment’s] very core stands the right of a man to\nretreat to his own home and there be free from unreason\nable governmental intrusion.”). “ ‘[S]earches and seizures\ninside a home without a warrant are [therefore] presump\ntively unreasonable.’ ” Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403\n(quoting Groh, 540 U. S., at 559). How “secure” do our\nhomes remain if police, armed with no warrant, can pound\non doors at will and, on hearing sounds indicative of\nthings moving, forcibly enter and search for evidence of\nunlawful activity?\n                               II\n    As above noted, to justify the police activity in this case,\nKentucky invoked the once-guarded exception for emer\ngencies “in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant\n. . . threaten[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Schmerber\nv. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (quoting Preston v.\nUnited States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). To fit within\nthis exception, “police action literally must be [taken] ‘now\nor never’ to preserve the evidence of the crime.” Roaden v.\nKentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).\n4                    KENTUCKY v. KING\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The existence of a genuine emergency depends not only\non the state of necessity at the time of the warrantless\nsearch; it depends, first and foremost, on “actions taken\nby the police preceding the warrantless search.” United\nStates v. Coles, 437 F. 3d 361, 367 (CA3 2006). See also\nUnited States v. Chambers, 395 F. 3d 563, 565 (CA6 2005)\n(“[O]fficers must seek a warrant based on probable cause\nwhen they believe in advance they will find contraband or\nevidence of a crime.”). “[W]asting a clear opportunity to\nobtain a warrant,” therefore, “disentitles the officer from\nrelying on subsequent exigent circumstances.” S. Saltz\nburg & D. Capra, American Criminal Procedure 376 (8th\ned. 2007).\n   Under an appropriately reined-in “emergency” or “exi\ngent circumstances” exception, the result in this case\nshould not be in doubt. The target of the investigation’s\nentry into the building, and the smell of marijuana seep\ning under the apartment door into the hallway, the Ken\ntucky Supreme Court rightly determined, gave the police\n“probable cause . . . sufficient . . . to obtain a warrant to\nsearch the . . . apartment.” 302 S. W. 3d 649, 653 (2010).\nAs that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for\nthe police to post officers on the premises while proceeding\nto obtain a warrant authorizing their entry. Id., at\n654. Before this Court, Kentucky does not urge otherwise.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35, n. 13 (asserting “[i]t should be\nof no importance whether police could have obtained a\nwarrant”).\n   In Johnson, the Court confronted this scenario: standing\noutside a hotel room, the police smelled burning opium\nand heard “some shuffling or noise” coming from the room.\n333 U. S., at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). Could\nthe police enter the room without a warrant? The Court\nanswered no. Explaining why, the Court said:\n    “The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n     is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual but to\n     a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security\n     and freedom from surveillance. When the right of\n     privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is,\n     as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not a\n     policeman . . . .\n           .            .          .            .          .\n        “If the officers in this case were excused from the\n     constitutional duty of presenting their evidence to a\n     magistrate, it is difficult to think of [any] case in\n     which [a warrant] should be required.” Id., at 14–15.\nI agree, and would not allow an expedient knock to over\nride the warrant requirement.* Instead, I would accord\nthat core requirement of the Fourth Amendment full\nrespect. When possible, “a warrant must generally be\nsecured,” the Court acknowledges. Ante, at 5. There is\nevery reason to conclude that securing a warrant was\nentirely feasible in this case, and no reason to contract the\nFourth Amendment’s dominion.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   * The Court in Johnson was informed that “when [the officer]\nknocked on [Johnson’s] door the ‘first thing that naturally struck [her]’\nwas to conceal the opium and the equipment for smoking it.” See Brief\nfor United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 1947, No. 329,\np. 17, n. 6. Had the Government in Johnson urged that the “shuffling\nor noise” indicated evidence was at risk, would the result have\nchanged? Justice Jackson’s recognition of the primacy of the warrant\nrequirement suggests not. But see ante, at 15, n. 5 (distinguishing\nJohnson on the ground that the Government did not contend “that\nthe officers entered the room in order to prevent the destruction of\nevidence”).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/216733/", "sha1": "d6d302503591bbd2ba8a5d23f7d8a202ad7d95db", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-05-16T07:20:34"}
