AMARA ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY \n\n     AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–804.      Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 16, 2011\nUntil 1998, petitioner CIGNA Corporation’s pension plan provided a\n retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and\n length of service. Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash\n balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, in\n creased by compound interest. The new plan translated already\n earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the\n cash balance account. Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the\n CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plan’s\n adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNA’s notice of the\n changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain\n respects provided them with less generous benefits. The District\n Court found that CIGNA’s disclosures violated its obligations under\n §§102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Se\n curity Act of 1974 (ERISA). In determining relief, it found that\n CIGNA’s notice defects had caused the employees “likely harm.” It\n then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits ac\n cordingly, finding its authority in ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), which author\n izes a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil action” to “re\n cover benefits due . . . under the terms of his plan.” The Second\n Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Although §502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority\n to reform CIGNA’s plan, relief is authorized by §502(a)(3), which al\n lows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to obtain other appropri\n ate equitable relief” to redress violations of ERISA “or the [plan’s]\n terms.” Pp. 12–20.\n       (a) The court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It ordered the\n2                         CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    terms of the plan reformed. Step 2: It ordered CIGNA to enforce the\n    plan as reformed. Step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by\n    the “terms of [the reformed] plan” and is thus consistent with\n    §502(a)(1)(B). However, that provision—which speaks of “enforc[ing]”\n    the plan’s terms, not changing them—does not suggest that it author\n    izes a court to alter those terms here, where the change, akin to re\n    forming a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a con\n    tract as written and more like an equitable remedy. Nor can the\n    Court accept the Solicitor General’s alternative rationale: that the\n    District Court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they\n    are plan terms. That reading cannot be squared with ERISA §102(a),\n    which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descrip\n    tions, but does not suggest that information about the plan provided\n    by those disclosures is itself part of the plan.               Nothing in\n    §502(a)(1)(B) suggests the contrary. The Solicitor General’s reading\n    also cannot be squared with the statute’s division of authority be\n    tween a plan’s sponsor—who, like a trust’s settlor, creates the plan’s\n    basic terms and conditions, executes a written instrument containing\n    those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument a proce\n    dure for making amendments—and the plan’s administrator—a trus\n    tee-like fiduciary who manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so,\n    and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions. ER-\n    ISA carefully distinguishes these roles, and there is no reason to be\n    lieve that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the\n    administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summa\n    ries, even when, as here, the administrator is also the plan sponsor.\n    Finally, it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a\n    summary’s language legally binding with the basic summary plan\n    description objective of clear, simple communication. Pp. 12–15.\n         (b) This Court has interpreted §502(a)(3)’s phrase “appropriate\n    equitable relief” as referring to “ ‘those categories of relief ’ ” that, be\n    fore the merger of law and equity,“ ‘were typically available in eq\n    uity.’ ” Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356,\n    361. This case—concerning a beneficiary’s suit against a plan fiduci\n    ary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a\n    plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust)—is the kind of lawsuit\n    that, before the merger, could have been brought only in an equity\n    court, where the remedies available were traditionally considered eq\n    uitable remedies. The District Court’s injunctions obviously fall\n    within this category. The other relief it ordered closely resembles\n    three forms of traditional equitable relief. First, what the court did\n    here may be regarded as the reformation of the plan’s terms, in order\n    to remedy false or misleading information CIGNA provided. The\n    power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  and is used to prevent fraud. Second, the part of the remedy holding\n  CIGNA to its promise that the new plan would not take from its em\n  ployees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel, also a tradi\n  tional equitable remedy. Third, the injunctions require the plan ad\n  ministrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them\n  under the plan as reformed. Equity courts possessed the power to\n  provide monetary “compensation” for a loss resulting from a trustee’s\n  breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee’s unjust enrichment. That\n  surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fidu\n  ciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.\n  Pp. 16–20.\n     2. Because §502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable relief” for\n  violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm will depend on\n  the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief. That\n  court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance, but there are\n  several equitable principles that it might apply on remand. Neither\n  ERISA’s relevant substantive provisions nor §502(a)(3) sets a particu\n  lar standard for determining harm. And equity law provides no gen\n  eral principle that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a\n  remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement arises, it is\n  because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that re\n  quirement. Thus, when a court exercises authority under §502(a)(3)\n  to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental\n  reliance must be made. However, equity courts did not insist on a\n  detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where\n  a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected\n  the substance of a contract. Nor did they require a detrimental reli\n  ance showing when they ordered surcharge. They simply ordered a\n  trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee’s breach of trust.\n  This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance require\n  ment. To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3)\n  only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of\n  detrimental reliance. But it might also come from the loss of a right\n  protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. It is not difficult to\n  imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here,\n  in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not them\n  selves act in reliance on the summaries. Thus, to obtain relief by\n  surcharge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or\n  beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need\n  show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.\n  Pp. 20–22.\n348 Fed.

Previously,\nthe plan provided a retiring employee with a defined\nbenefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of\nhis preretirement salary and length of service. The new\nplan provided most retiring employees with a (lump sum)\ncash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual\ncontribution from CIGNA as increased by compound inter\nest. Because many employees had already earned at least\nsome old-plan benefits, the new plan translated already\nearned benefits into an opening amount in the employee’s\ncash balance account.\n  Respondents, acting on behalf of approximately 25,000\nbeneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (which is also a\npetitioner here), challenged CIGNA’s adoption of the new\nplan. They claimed in part that CIGNA had failed to give\nthem proper notice of changes to their benefits, particu\nlarly because the new plan in certain respects provided\n2                  CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem with less generous benefits. See Employee Retire\nment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) §§102(a),\n104(b), 204(h), 88 Stat. 841, 848, 862, as amended, 29\nU. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).\n  The District Court agreed that the disclosures made by\nCIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA. In deter\nmining relief, the court found that CIGNA’s notice failures\nhad caused the employees “likely harm.” The Court then\nreformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits\naccordingly. It found legal authority for doing so in\nERISA §502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B) (authoriz\ning a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil\naction” to “recover benefits due to him under the terms of\nhis plan”).\n  We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied\nthe correct legal standard, namely, a “likely harm” stan\ndard, in determining that CIGNA’s notice violations\ncaused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal\nrelief. To reach that question, we must first consider a\nmore general matter—whether the ERISA section just\nmentioned (ERISA’s recovery-of-benefits-due provision,\n§502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District\nCourt provided. We conclude that it does not authorize\nthis relief. Nonetheless, we find that a different equity\nrelated ERISA provision, to which the District Court also\nreferred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that\nthe court entered. §502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3).\n  Section 502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable\nrelief ” for violations of ERISA. Accordingly, the relevant\nstandard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by\nwhich the District Court provides relief. We leave it to the\nDistrict Court to conduct that analysis in the first in\nstance, but we identify equitable principles that the court\nmight apply on remand.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             I\n\n   Because our decision rests in important part upon the\ncircumstances present here, we shall describe those cir\ncumstances in some detail. We still simplify in doing so.\nBut the interested reader can find a more thorough de\nscription in two District Court opinions, which set forth\nthat court’s findings reached after a lengthy trial.

Calculated either way, the annuity\nwould approach 60 percent of a longtime employee’s final\nsalary. A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say,\n$160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity\npaying the employee about $96,000 per year until his\ndeath. The plan offered many employees at least one\nother benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and re\nceive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.\n   In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a news\nletter announcing that it intended to put in place a new\npension plan. The new plan would substitute an “account\nbalance plan” for CIGNA’s pre-existing defined-benefit\nsystem. App. 991a (emphasis deleted). The newsletter\nadded that the old plan would end on December 31, 1997,\nthat CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan\n4                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply\nretroactively to January 1, 1998.\n   Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details. Its\nnew plan created an individual retirement account for\neach employee. (The account consisted of a bookkeeping\nentry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.) Each year\nCIGNA would contribute to the employee’s individual\naccount an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5\npercent of the employee’s salary, depending upon age,\nlength of service, and certain other factors. The account\nbalance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to\nthe return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter per\ncent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9\npercent). Upon retirement the employee would receive the\namount then in his or her individual account—in the form\nof either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum\nthen would buy. As promised, CIGNA would open the\naccounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1,\n1998.\n   But what about the retirement benefits that employees\nhad already earned prior to January 1, 1998? CIGNA\npromised to make an initial contribution to the individ\nual’s account equal to the value of that employee’s already\nearned benefits. And the new plan set forth a method for\ncalculating that initial contribution. The method con\nsisted of calculating the amount as of the employee’s\n(future) retirement date of the annuity to which the em\nployee’s salary and length of service already (i.e., as of\nDecember 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting\nthat sum to its present (i.e., January 1, 1998) value.\n   An example will help: Imagine an employee born on\nJanuary 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on\nhis 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preced\ning the plan changeover) earned an average salary of\n$100,000 per year. As of January 1, 1998, the old plan\nwould have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n$100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 12⁄3 percent, or\n$11,667 per year—when he retired in 2031 at age 65. The\n2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until\ndeath depends upon interest rates and mortality assump\ntions at that time. If we assume the annuity would pay 7\npercent until the holder’s death (and we use the mortality\nassumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporat\ning the mortality table prescribed by Rev. Rul. 95–6,\n1995–1 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an\nannuity would be about $120,500. And CIGNA should\ninitially deposit in this individual’s account on January 1,\n1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33\nyears later, in 2031, when the individual retires. If we\nassume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that\namount presently (i.e., as of January 1, 1998) equals about\n$24,000. And (with one further mortality-related adjust\nment that we shall describe infra, at 6–7) that is the\namount, more or less, that the new plan’s transition rules\nwould have required CIGNA initially to deposit. Then\nCIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the\ndeposited amounts would earn compound interest. When\nthe employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump\nsum.\n   The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An\nemployee would receive upon retirement either (1) the\namount to which he or she had become entitled as of\nJanuary 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her\nindividual account, whichever was greater. Thus, the\nemployee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less\nthan an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.\n                            B\n                            1\n   The District Court found that CIGNA’s initial descrip\ntions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and\nmisled its employees. In November 1997, for example,\n6                   CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCIGNA sent the employees a newsletter that said the new\nplan would “significantly enhance” its “retirement pro\ngram,” would produce “an overall improvement in . . .\nretirement benefits,” and would provide “the same benefit\nsecurity” with “steadier benefit growth.” App. 990a, 991a,\n993a. CIGNA also told its employees that they would “see\nthe growth in [their] total retirement benefits from\nCIGNA every year,” id., at 952a, that its initial deposit\n“represent[ed] the full value of the benefit [they] earned\nfor service before 1998,” Record E–503 (Exh. 98), and that\n“[o]ne advantage the company will not get from the re\ntirement program changes is cost savings.” App. 993a.\n   In fact, the new plan saved the company $10 million\nannually (though CIGNA later said it devoted the savings\nto other employee benefits). Its initial deposit did not\n“represen[t] the full value of the benefit” that employees\nhad “earned for service before 1998.” And the plan made a\nsignificant number of employees worse off in at least the\nfollowing specific ways:\n   First, the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that\nthe old plan offered many CIGNA employees the right to\nretire early (beginning at age 55) with only somewhat\nreduced benefits. This right was valuable. For example,\nas of January 1, 1998, respondent Janice Amara had\nearned vested age-55 retirement benefits of $1,833 per\nmonth, but CIGNA’s initial deposit in her new-plan indi\nvidual retirement account (ignoring this benefit) would\nhave allowed her at age 55 to buy an annuity benefit of\nonly $900 per month.\n   Second, as we previously indicated but did not explain,\nsupra at 5, the new plan adjusted CIGNA’s initial deposit\ndownward to account for the fact that, unlike the old\nplan’s lifetime annuity, an employee’s survivors would\nreceive the new plan’s benefits (namely, the amount in the\nemployee’s individual account) even if the employee died\nbefore retiring. The downward adjustment consisted of\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmultiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the prob\nability that the employee would live until retirement—a\n90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old,\nsupra, at 4–5. And that meant that CIGNA’s initial de\nposit in our example—the amount that was supposed to\ngrow to $120,500 by 2031—would be less than $22,000,\nnot $24,000 (the number we computed). The employee, of\ncourse, would receive a benefit in return—namely, a form\nof life insurance. But at least some employees might have\npreferred the retirement benefit and consequently could\nreasonably have thought it important to know that the\nnew plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned\nbenefits for a life insurance policy that they might not\nhave wanted.\n   Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest\nrates from CIGNA to its employees. Under the old plan,\nCIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that\npaid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling inter\nest rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for\nthat annuity. And falling interest rates also meant that\nany sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow\nmore slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set\naside more money to make any specific sum available at\nretirement. Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to\nbuy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific\nsum. The employee would simply receive whatever sum\nhis account contained. And falling interest rates meant\nthat the account’s lump sum would earn less money each\nyear after the employee retired. Annuities, for example,\nwould become more expensive (any fixed purchase price\npaying for less annual income). At the same time falling\ninterest meant that the individual account would grow\nmore slowly over time, leaving the employee with less\nmoney at retirement.\n   Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leav\ning CIGNA’s employees better off under the new plan.\n8                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nBut the latter advantage does not cancel out the former\ndisadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse. And\nthat means that most of CIGNA’s employees would have\npreferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.\n  The amounts likely involved are significant. If, in our\nexample, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4\npercent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in\n2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent\nwe assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an\ninitial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that\nemployee the $11,667 annual annuity payment to which\nhe had already become entitled. Indeed, that $24,000 that\nCIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life\ninsurance problem) would have provided enough money to\nbuy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an\nannual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than\n$11,667).\n  We recognize that the employee in our example (like\nothers) might have continued to work for CIGNA after\nJanuary 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have\nearned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was\nworth far more than $11,667. But that is so because\nCIGNA made an additional contribution for each year\nworked after January 1, 1998. If interest rates fell (as\nthey did), it would take the employee several additional\nyears of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to\nwhere he had already been (under the old plan) as of\nJanuary 1, 1998—a phenomenon known in pension jargon\nas “wear away,” see 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 303–304 (referring\nto respondents’ requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).\n  The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees\nnothing about any of these features of the new plan—\nwhich individually and together made clear that CIGNA’s\ndescriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.\nThe District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally\nmisled its employees. A focus group and many employees\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked CIGNA, for example, to “ ‘[d]isclose details’ ” about\nthe plan, to provide “ ‘individual comparisons,’ ” or to show\n“ ‘[a]n actual projection for retirement.’ ” Id., at 342. But\nCIGNA did not do so. Instead (in the words of one inter\nnal document), it “ ‘focus[ed] on NOT providing employees\nbefore and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.’ ”\nId., at 343.\n    The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that\nCIGNA’s representations (and omissions) about the plan,\nmade between November 1997 (when it announced the\nplan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect)\nviolated:\n    (a) ERISA §204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg.\n§1.411(d)–6, 26 CFR §1.411(d)–6 (2000), which (as it ex\nisted at the relevant time) forbade an amendment of a\npension plan that would “provide for a significant reduc\ntion in the rate of future benefit accrual” unless the plan\nadministrator also sent a “written notice” that provided\neither the text of the amendment or summarized its likely\neffects, 29 U. S. C. §1054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001);\nTreas. Reg. §1.411(d)–6, Q&A–10, 63 Fed. Reg. 68682\n(1998); and\n    (b) ERISA §§102(a) and 104(b), which require a plan\nadministrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan\ndescriptions and with summaries of material modifica\ntions, “written in a manner calculated to be understood by\nthe average plan participant,” that are “sufficiently accu\nrate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such par\nticipants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations\nunder the plan,” 29 U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed.\nand Supp. III).\n                            2\n  The District Court then turned to the remedy. First, the\ncourt agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom\nCIGNA’s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain\n10                CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelief. But it did not require each individual member of\nthe relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual\ninjury. Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented\nhad raised a presumption of “likely harm” suffered by the\nmembers of the relevant employee class, and (2) that\nCIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect\nto some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that\npresumption. It concluded that this unrebutted showing\nwas sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.\n   Second, the court noted that §204(h) had been inter\npreted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of\nplan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to\nthe 2001 amendment that made this power explicit. 559\nF. Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing Frommert v. Conkright, 433\nF. 3d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(6) (2006\ned.) (entitling participants to benefits “without regard to\n[the] amendment” in case of an “egregious failure”). But\nthe court also thought that granting this relief here would\nharm, not help, the injured employees. That is because\nthe notice failures all concerned the new plan that took\neffect in December 1998. The court thought that the\nnotices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits,\neffective December 31, 1997, were valid. To strike the new\nplan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not\nhelp CIGNA’s employees.\n   The court considered treating the November 1997 notice\nas a sham or treating that notice and the later 1998 no\ntices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.\nBut it pointed out that respondents “ha[d] argued none of\nthese things.” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208. And it said that\nthe court would “not make these arguments now on [re\nspondents’] behalf.” Ibid.\n   Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan’s\nguarantee. It erased the portion that assured participants\nwho retired the greater of “A” (that which they had al\nready earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan,\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n$11,667 in our example) or “B” (that which they would\nearn via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan,\nincluding CIGNA’s initial deposit). And it substituted a\nprovision that would guarantee each employee “A” (that\nwhich they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997,\nunder the old plan) plus “B” (that which they would earn\nvia CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan, exclud\ning CIGNA’s initial deposit). In our example, the District\nCourt’s remedy would no longer force our employee to\nchoose upon retirement either an $11,667 annuity or his\nnew plan benefits (including both CIGNA’s annual depos\nits and CIGNA’s initial deposit). It would give him an\n$11,667 annuity plus his new plan benefits (with CIGNA’s\nannual deposits but without CIGNA’s initial deposit).\n    Fourth, the court “order[ed] and enjoin[ed] the CIGNA\nPlan to reform its records to reflect that all class members\n. . . now receive [the just described] ‘A + B’ benefits,” and\nthat it pay appropriate benefits to those class members\nwho had already retired. Id., at 222.\n    Fifth, the court held that ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) provided\nthe legal authority to enter this relief. That provision\nstates that a “civil action may be brought” by a plan “par\nticipant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to him\nunder the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).\nThe court wrote that its orders in effect awarded “benefits\nunder the terms of the plan” as reformed. 559 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 212.\n    At the same time the court considered whether ERISA\n§502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.\nThat provision states that a civil action may be brought\n    “by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to en\n    join any act or practice which violates any provision of\n    this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to ob\n    tain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress\n    such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this\n12                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     subchapter or the terms of the plan.”       29 U. S. C.\n     §1132(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nThe District Court decided not to answer this question\nbecause (1) it had just decided that the same relief was\navailable under §502(a)(1)(B), regardless, cf. Varity Corp.\nv. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 515 (1996); and (2) the Supreme\nCourt has “issued several opinions . . . that have severely\ncurtailed the kinds of relief that are available under\n§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205 (citing Sereboff v.\nMid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006);\nGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.\n204 (2002); and Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S.\n248 (1993)).\n                             3\n   The parties cross-appealed the District Court’s judg\nment. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued\na brief summary order, rejecting all their claims, and\naffirming “the judgment of the district court for substan\ntially the reasons stated” in the District Court’s “well\nreasoned and scholarly opinions.” 348 Fed. Appx. 627\n(2009). The parties filed cross-petitions for writs of certio\nrari in this Court. We granted the request in CIGNA’s\npetition to consider whether a showing of “likely harm” is\nsufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits\nbased on faulty disclosures.\n                             II\n  CIGNA in the merits briefing raises a preliminary\nquestion. Brief for Petitioners 13–20. It argues first and\nforemost that the statutory provision upon which the\nDistrict Court rested its orders, namely, the provision for\nrecovery of plan benefits, §502(a)(1)(B), does not in fact\nauthorize the District Court to enter the kind of relief it\nentered here.    And for that reason, CIGNA argues,\nwhether the District Court did or did not use a proper\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard for determining harm is beside the point. We\nbelieve that this preliminary question is closely enough\nrelated to the question presented that we shall consider it\nat the outset.\n                              A\n   The District Court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It\nordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they pro\nvided an “A plus B,” rather than a “greater of A or B”\nguarantee). Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator\n(which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as re\nformed. One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with\n§502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the\nright to bring a civil action to “recover benefits due . . .\nunder the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).\nAnd step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the\n“terms of [the] plan” as reformed.\n   But what about step 1? Where does §502(a)(1)(B) grant\na court the power to change the terms of the plan as they\npreviously existed? The statutory language speaks of\n“enforc[ing]” the “terms of the plan,” not of changing them.\n29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added). The provision\nallows a court to look outside the plan’s written language\nin deciding what those terms are, i.e., what the language\nmeans. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526\nU. S. 358, 377–379 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms\nof an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of\nstate insurance rules). But we have found nothing sug\ngesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those\nterms, at least not in present circumstances, where that\nchange, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like\nthe simple enforcement of a contract as written and more\nlike an equitable remedy. See infra, at 18.\n   Nor can we accept the Solicitor General’s alternative\nrationale seeking to justify the use of this provision. The\nSolicitor General says that the District Court did enforce\n14                  CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plan’s terms as written, adding that the “plan” in\ncludes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan\ndescriptions. In other words, in the view of the Solicitor\nGeneral, the terms of the summaries are terms of the\nplan.\n   Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries\nas plan “terms” (which it did not, see supra, at 10–11),\nhowever, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily\nrequired plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifica\ntions) necessarily may be enforced (under §502(a)(1)(B)) as\nthe terms of the plan itself. For one thing, it is difficult to\nsquare the Solicitor General’s reading of the statute with\nERISA §102(a), the provision that obliges plan adminis\ntrators to furnish summary plan descriptions. The syntax\nof that provision, requiring that participants and benefici\naries be advised of their rights and obligations “under the\nplan,” suggests that the information about the plan pro\nvided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.\nSee 29 U. S. C. §1022(a). Nothing in §502(a)(1)(B) (or, as\nfar as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.\n   Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General’s\nreading with the statute’s division of authority between a\nplan’s sponsor and the plan’s administrator. The plan’s\nsponsor (e.g., the employer), like a trust’s settlor, creates\nthe basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a\nwritten instrument containing those terms and conditions,\nand provides in that instrument “a procedure” for making\namendments. §402, 29 U. S. C. §1102. The plan’s admin\nistrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows\nits terms in doing so, and provides participants with the\nsummary documents that describe the plan (and modifica\ntions) in readily understandable form. §§3(21)(A), 101(a),\n102, 104, 29 U. S. C. §§1002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024\n(2006 ed. and Supp. III). Here, the District Court found\nthat the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles. See 534\nF. Supp. 2d, at 331. But that is not always the case.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRegardless, we have found that ERISA carefully distin\nguishes these roles. See, e.g., Varity Corp., 516 U. S., at\n498. And we have no reason to believe that the statute\nintends to mix the responsibilities by giving the adminis\ntrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including\nthem in the summary plan descriptions. See Curtiss-\nWright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 81–85 (1995).\n  Finally, we find it difficult to reconcile the Solicitor\nGeneral’s interpretation with the basic summary plan\ndescription objective: clear, simple communication. See\n§§2(a), 102(a), 29 U. S. C. §1001(a), 1022(a) (2006 ed.). To\nmake the language of a plan summary legally binding\ncould well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity\nand comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in\nthe language of lawyers. Consider the difference between\na will and the summary of a will or between a property\ndeed and its summary. Consider, too, the length of Part I\nof this opinion, and then consider how much longer Part I\nwould have to be if we had to include all the qualifications\nand nuances that a plan drafter might have found impor\ntant and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance.\nThe District Court’s opinions take up 109 pages of the\nFederal Supplement. None of this is to say that plan\nadministrators can avoid providing complete and accurate\nsummaries of plan terms in the manner required by\nERISA and its implementing regulations. But we fear\nthat the Solicitor General’s rule might bring about com\nplexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the\nsummaries.\n  For these reasons taken together we conclude that the\nsummary documents, important as they are, provide\ncommunication with beneficiaries about the plan, but that\ntheir statements do not themselves constitute the terms of\nthe plan for purposes of §502(a)(1)(B). We also conclude\nthat the District Court could not find authority in that\nsection to reform CIGNA’s plan as written.\n16                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n   If §502(a)(1)(B) does not authorize entry of the relief\nhere at issue, what about nearby §502(a)(3)? That provi\nsion allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to\nobtain other appropriate equitable relief ” to redress viola\ntions of (here relevant) parts of ERISA “or the terms of the\nplan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). The\nDistrict Court strongly implied, but did not directly hold,\nthat it would base its relief upon this subsection were it\nnot for (1) the fact that the preceding “plan benefits due”\nprovision, §502(a)(1)(B), provided sufficient authority; and\n(2) certain cases from this Court that narrowed the appli\ncation of the term “appropriate equitable relief,” see, e.g.,\nMertens, 508 U. S. 248; Great-West, 534 U. S. 204. Our\nholding in Part II–A, supra, removes the District Court’s\nfirst obstacle. And given the likelihood that, on remand,\nthe District Court will turn to and rely upon this alterna\ntive subsection, we consider the court’s second concern.\nWe find that concern misplaced.\n   We have interpreted the term “appropriate equitable\nrelief ” in §502(a)(3) as referring to “ ‘those categories of\nrelief ’ ” that, traditionally speaking (i.e., prior to the\nmerger of law and equity) “ ‘were typically available in\nequity.’ ” Sereboff, 547 U. S., at 361 (quoting Mertens, 508\nU. S., at 256). In Mertens, we applied this principle to a\nclaim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary\nagainst a private firm that provided a trustee with actuar\nial services. We found that the plaintiff sought “nothing\nother than compensatory damages” against a nonfiduci\nary. Id., at 253, 255 (emphasis deleted). And we held that\nsuch a claim, traditionally speaking, was legal, not equi\ntable, in nature. Id., at 255.\n   In Great-West, we considered a claim brought by a fidu\nciary against a tort-award-winning beneficiary seeking\nmonetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan\nhad previously made on the beneficiary’s behalf. We noted\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to (or a\nconstructive trust imposed upon) money that the benefici\nary had received from the tort-case defendant. But we\nnoted that the money in question was not the “particular”\nmoney that the tort defendant had paid. And, tradition\nally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive\ntrust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds\nin question were “particular funds or property in the\ndefendant’s possession.” 534 U. S., at 213 (emphasis\nadded).\n   The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary\nagainst a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as\na trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typi\ncally treats as a trust). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 253, n. 4 (2008); Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 496–497. It is the kind of lawsuit that,\nbefore the merger of law and equity, respondents could\nhave brought only in a court of equity, not a court of law.\n4 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M.

AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrict Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.\nThat is because equity chancellors developed a host of\nother “distinctively equitable” remedies—remedies that\nwere “fitted to the nature of the primary right” they were\nintended to protect. 1 S. Symons, Pomeroy’s Equity Juris\nprudence §108, pp. 139–140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter\nPomeroy). See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on\nEquity Jurisprudence §692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter\nStory). Indeed, a maxim of equity states that “[e]quity\nsuffers not a right to be without a remedy.” R. Francis,\nMaxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823). And the relief\nentered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive\nrelief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable\nremedies.\n   First, what the District Court did here may be regarded\nas the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to\nremedy the false or misleading information CIGNA pro\nvided. The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with\nthe power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional\npower of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used\nto prevent fraud. See Baltzer v. Raleigh & Augusta R. Co.,\n115 U. S. 634, 645 (1885) (“[I]t is well settled that equity\nwould reform the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if\nthe mistake or fraud were shown”); Hearne v.

S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the District Court’s remedy essentially held\nCIGNA to what it had promised, namely, that the new\nplan would not take from its employees benefits they had\nalready accrued. This aspect of the remedy resembles\nestoppel, a traditional equitable remedy. See, e.g., E.\nMerwin, Principles of Equity and Equity Pleading §910\n(H. Merwin ed. 1895); 3 Pomeroy §804. Equitable estoppel\n“operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the\nsame position he would have been in had the representa\ntions been true.” Eaton §62, at 176. And, as Justice Story\nlong ago pointed out, equitable estoppel “forms a very\nessential element in . . . fair dealing, and rebuke of all\nfraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of\ncourts of equity constantly to promote.” 2 Story §1533, at\n776.\n   Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan\nadministrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries\nmoney owed them under the plan as reformed. But the\nfact that this relief takes the form of a money payment\ndoes not remove it from the category of traditionally equi\ntable relief. Equity courts possessed the power to provide\nrelief in the form of monetary “compensation” for a loss\nresulting from a trustee’s breach of duty, or to prevent the\ntrustee’s unjust enrichment.        Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts §95, and Comment a (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2,\n2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton §§211–212,\nat 440. Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this\nkind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes\ncalled a “surcharge,” was “exclusively equitable.” Princess\nLida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456, 464\n(1939); Third Restatement §95, and Comment a; G. Bogert\n& G.

AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbill being filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a\nbreach of trust”); 1 J. Perry, A Treatise on the Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §17, p. 13 (2d ed. 1874) (common-law\nattempts “to punish trustees for a breach of trust in dam\nages, . . . w[ere] soon abandoned”).\n  The surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust\ncommitted by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a\nduty imposed upon that fiduciary. See Second Restate\nment §201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy §1079; 2 Story §§1261,\n1268. Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is\nconcerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike\nthe defendant in Mertens, is analogous to a trustee makes\na critical difference. See 508 U. S., at 262–263. In sum,\ncontrary to the District Court’s fears, the types of reme\ndies the court entered here fall within the scope of the\nterm “appropriate equitable relief ” in §502(a)(3).\n                             III\n  Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the\nDistrict Court. We cannot know with certainty which\nremedy the District Court understood itself to be impos\ning, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate\nto exercise its discretion under §502(a)(3) to impose that\nremedy on remand. We need not decide which remedies\nare appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve\nthe parties’ dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in\ndetermining whether members of the relevant employee\nclass were injured.\n  The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set\nforth any particular standard for determining harm. They\nsimply require the plan administrator to write and to\ndistribute written notices that are “sufficiently accurate\nand comprehensive to reasonably apprise” plan partici\npants and beneficiaries of “their rights and obligations\nunder the plan.” §102(a); see also §§104(b), 204(h). Nor\ncan we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision,\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter “appropri\nate equitable relief ” to redress ERISA “violations”). Hence\nany requirement of harm must come from the law of\nequity.\n   Looking to the law of equity, there is no general princi\nple that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a\nremedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement\narises, it is because the specific remedy being contem\nplated imposes such a requirement. Thus, as CIGNA\npoints out, when equity courts used the remedy of estop\npel, they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental\nreliance, i.e., that the defendant’s statement “in truth,\ninfluenced the conduct of ” the plaintiff, causing “preju\ndic[e].” Eaton §61, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy §805. Accord\ningly, when a court exercises its authority under\n§502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a\nshowing of detrimental reliance must be made.\n   But this showing is not always necessary for other\nequitable remedies. Equity courts, for example, would\nreform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of\nthe contracting parties where “fraudulent suppression[s],\nomission[s], or insertion[s],” 1 Story §154, at 149, “mate\nrial[ly] . . . affect[ed]” the “substance” of the contract, even\nif the “complaining part[y]” was negligent in not realizing\nits mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a\nstandard of “reasonable prudence” and violate a legal\nduty. 3 Pomeroy §§856, 856b, at 334, 340–341; see Balt\nzer, 115 U. S., at 645; Eaton §307(b).\n   Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimen\ntal reliance in cases where they ordered “surcharge.”\nRather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made\nwhole following a trustee’s breach of trust. In such in\nstances equity courts would “mold the relief to protect the\nrights of the beneficiary according to the situation in\nvolved.” Bogert §861, at 4. This flexible approach belies a\nstrict requirement of “detrimental reliance.”\n22                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge\na trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott & Ascher §24.9,\na fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3) only upon a\nshowing of actual harm—proved (under the default rule\nfor civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence. That\nactual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reli\nance, but it might also come from the loss of a right pro\ntected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. In the\npresent case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure\nto provide proper summary information, in violation of the\nstatute, injured employees even if they did not themselves\nact in reliance on summary documents—which they might\nnot themselves have seen—for they may have thought\nfellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would\nhave let them know if, say, plan changes would likely\nprove harmful. We doubt that Congress would have\nwanted to bar those employees from relief.\n   The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a\nlimited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by sur\ncharge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan partici\npant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured\nhim or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm\nand causation. Although it is not always necessary to\nmeet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words\n“detrimental reliance,” actual harm must be shown.\n   We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are\nnot asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are\nasked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude\nthat the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from\nequitable principles, as modified by the obligations and\ninjuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related\ncircumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too\nvarious in nature to insist that harm must always meet\nthat more vigorous “detrimental harm” standard when\nequity imposed no such strict requirement.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for\nmisrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD).\nI do not join the Court’s opinion because I see no need and\nno justification for saying anything more than that.\n  Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan partici\npant or beneficiary may bring a civil action “to recover\nbenefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce\nhis rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his\nrights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”\nERISA defines the word “plan” as “an employee welfare\nbenefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan\nwhich is both,” 29 U. S. C. §1002(3), and it requires that\na “plan” “be established and maintained pursuant to a\nwritten instrument,” §1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is\na disclosure meant “to reasonably apprise [plan] partici\npants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations\nunder the plan.” §1022(a). It would be peculiar for a doc\nument meant to “apprise” participants of their rights\n“under the plan” to be itself part of the “plan.” Any doubt\n2                   CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat it is not is eliminated by ERISA’s repeated differen\ntiation of SPDs from the “written instruments” that con\nstitute a plan, see, e.g., §§1029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA’s\nassignment to different entities of responsibility for draft\ning and amending SPDs on the one hand and plans on the\nother, see §§1002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIII), 1024(b)(1); Beck v. PACE Int’l Union, 551 U. S. 96,\n101 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its pur\npose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan\nif it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor\nomissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising\nthe plan.\n   Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.\nThe District Court based the relief it awarded upon\nERISA §502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought\nthat the “benefits” due “under the terms of the plan,” 29\nU. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either\nbecause the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable\nof somehow modifying the plan. Under either justifica\ntion, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a\nplan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so pro\nvides. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514\nU. S. 73, 79, 85 (1995). I would go no further.\n   The Court, however, ventures on to address a different\nquestion: whether respondents may recover under\n§502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants “to\nobtain other appropriate equitable relief.” 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to\nanswer this question, stating that it “need not consider\nwhether any relief ordered under §502(a)(1)(B) would also\nbe available under §502(a)(3).” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d, at 205, and said\nthat “in view of these knotty issues . . . the Court need not,\nand does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief\nunder §502(a)(3),” id., at 206.\n   It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues\nthat a lower court “need not, and does not, decide,” see\nCooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S.\n157, 168–169 (2004), and this case presents no exceptional\nreason to do so. To the contrary, it presents additional\nreasons not to do so. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248 (1993), the case the District Court feared had\n“severely curtailed the kinds of relief . . . available under\n§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, is cited exactly one\ntime in the parties’ briefs—by the CIGNA petitioners for\nthe utterly unrelated proposition that ERISA contains\na “ ‘carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners 2. And there is no discussion whatso\never of contract reformation or surcharge in the briefs of\nthe parties or even amici.1\n   The opinion for the Court states that the District Court\n“strongly implied . . . that it would base its relief upon\n[§502(a)(3)] were it not for (1) the fact that . . .\n§502(a)(1)(B) . . . provided sufficient authority; and (2)\ncertain cases from this Court that narrowed the applica\ntion of the term ‘appropriate equitable relief.’ ” Ante, at 16.\nI find no such implication whatever—not even a weak one.\nThe District Court simply said that §502(a)(1)(B) provided\nrelief, and that under our cases §502(a)(3) might not do so.\nWhile some Members of this Court have sought to divine\nwhat legislators would have prescribed beyond what they\ndid prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought\nto guess what district judges would have decided beyond\n——————\n  1 “[P]lan reformation” makes an appearance in one sentence of one\n\nfootnote of the Government’s brief, see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 30, n. 9. This cameo hardly qualifies as “discussion.”\n4                    CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                 SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhat they did decide. And this, bear in mind, is not just a\nguess as to what the District Court would have done if it\nhad known that its §502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today\nhold) improper. The apparent answer to that is that it\nwould have denied relief, since it thought itself con\nstrained by “certain cases from this Court that [have]\nnarrowed [§502(a)(3)],” ante, at 16. No, the course the\nCourt guesses about is what the District Court would have\ndone if it had known both that §502(a)(1)(B) denies relief\nand that §502(a)(3) provides it. This speculation upon\nspeculation hardly renders our discussion of §502(a)(3)\nrelevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.\n  Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond\nme. It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to\ndemonstrate—by blatant dictum, if necessary—that, by\nGeorge, plan members misled by an SPD will be compen\nsated. That they will normally be compensated is not in\ndoubt. As the opinion for the Court notes, ante, at 10, the\nSecond Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the\ninvalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper\nnotice, by reason of §204(h), which reads:\n    “An applicable pension plan may not be amended so\n    as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of\n    future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator\n    provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each\n    applicable individual . . . .” 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(1).\nThis provision appears a natural fit to respondents’ claim,\nwhich is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its\nplan, but that CIGNA “failed to give them proper notice of\nchanges to their benefits.” Ante, at 1. It was inapplicable\nhere only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the\nmanner in which respondents chose to argue the case. 2\n——————\n  2 The District Court found that §204(h) was unhelpful because\n\nCIGNA had provided a valid notice of its decision to freeze benefits\nunder the old plan.

S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Rather than attempting to read the District Judge’s\npalm, I would simply remand. If the District Court dis\nmisses the case based on an incorrect reading of Mertens,\nthe Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second\nCircuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari. The\nCourt’s discussion of the relief available under §502(a)(3)\nand Mertens is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor\nthe District Court. The District Court need not read any\nof it—and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we\nmay very well reverse. Even if we adhere to our dicta that\ncontract reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are “ ‘dis\ntinctively equitable’ remedies,” ante, at 18, it is far from\nclear that they are available remedies in this case. The\nopinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that\nthey are and disclaims the implication, see ante, at 20.\n   Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering\nthe terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement\nof the parties “owing to the fraud of one of the parties and\nmistake of the other.” 27 Williston on Contracts §69:55,\np. 160 (4th ed. 2010). But here, the Court would be em\nploying that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in\nresponse to a third party’s misrepresentations—not those\nof a party to the contract. The SPD is not part of the\nERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan’s sponsor.\nAlthough in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the\nSPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when\nwriting the plan, and as administrator when preparing the\nSPD. ERISA “carefully distinguishes these roles,” ante, at\n15; see also Beck, 551 U. S., at 101, and nothing the Court\ncites suggests that they blend together when performed by\n——————\ndefective §204(h) notice, the freeze would return to force, and respon\ndents would be worse off. Respondents might (and likely should) have\nargued that the notice for the freeze was itself void, but they “argued\nnone of these things,” and the District Court declined to “make these\narguments now on [their] behalf.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

AMARA\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe same entity.\n   Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third\nparty was an agent of a contracting party and its misrep\nresentations could thus be attributed to it under agency\nlaw. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is\nunlikely here. An ERISA administrator’s duty to provide\nemployees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S. C.\n§1024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the\nsponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity.\nMoreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as\nagent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case,\nand were the administrator contracting with employees as\nan agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the\nSPD would be part of the plan or would amend it—exactly\nwhat the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II–A, ante,\nat 13–15. And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished\nmonths after an employee accepts a pension or benefit\nplan. §1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate\nmutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is\nnot retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.\n   Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better\nsuited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that re\nspondents might be able to recover under §502(a)(3) pur\nsuant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably\nmakes this concession only because questions of reliance\nwould be individualized and potentially inappropriate for\nclass-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not\nconcede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same\nproblem. The amount for which an administrator may\nbe surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the\n“actual harm” suffered by an employee, ante, at 22—that\nis, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost\nopportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott\n& W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §205, pp. 237–243 (4th ed.\n1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of course\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Argued November 30, 2010—Decided May 16, 2011\nUntil 1998, petitioner CIGNA Corporation’s pension plan provided a\n retiring employee with an annuity based on preretirement salary and\n length of service. Its new plan replaced that annuity with a cash\n balance based on a defined annual contribution from CIGNA, in\n creased by compound interest. The new plan translated already\n earned benefits under the old plan into an opening amount in the\n cash balance account. Respondents, on behalf of beneficiaries of the\n CIGNA Pension Plan (also a petitioner), challenged the new plan’s\n adoption, claiming, as relevant here, that CIGNA’s notice of the\n changes was improper, particularly because the new plan in certain\n respects provided them with less generous benefits. The District\n Court found that CIGNA’s disclosures violated its obligations under\n §§102(a), 104(b), and 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Se\n curity Act of 1974 (ERISA). In determining relief, it found that\n CIGNA’s notice defects had caused the employees “likely harm.” It\n then reformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits ac\n cordingly, finding its authority in ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), which author\n izes a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil action” to “re\n cover benefits due . . . under the terms of his plan.” The Second\n Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Although §502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority\n to reform CIGNA’s plan, relief is authorized by §502(a)(3), which al\n lows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to obtain other appropri\n ate equitable relief” to redress violations of ERISA “or the [plan’s]\n terms.” Pp. 12–20.\n       (a) The court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It ordered the\n2                         CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    terms of the plan reformed. Step 2: It ordered CIGNA to enforce the\n    plan as reformed. Step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by\n    the “terms of [the reformed] plan” and is thus consistent with\n    §502(a)(1)(B). However, that provision—which speaks of “enforc[ing]”\n    the plan’s terms, not changing them—does not suggest that it author\n    izes a court to alter those terms here, where the change, akin to re\n    forming a contract, seems less like the simple enforcement of a con\n    tract as written and more like an equitable remedy. Nor can the\n    Court accept the Solicitor General’s alternative rationale: that the\n    District Court enforced the summary plan descriptions and that they\n    are plan terms. That reading cannot be squared with ERISA §102(a),\n    which obliges plan administrators to furnish summary plan descrip\n    tions, but does not suggest that information about the plan provided\n    by those disclosures is itself part of the plan.               Nothing in\n    §502(a)(1)(B) suggests the contrary. The Solicitor General’s reading\n    also cannot be squared with the statute’s division of authority be\n    tween a plan’s sponsor—who, like a trust’s settlor, creates the plan’s\n    basic terms and conditions, executes a written instrument containing\n    those terms and conditions, and provides in that instrument a proce\n    dure for making amendments—and the plan’s administrator—a trus\n    tee-like fiduciary who manages the plan, follows its terms in doing so,\n    and provides participants with the summary plan descriptions. ER-\n    ISA carefully distinguishes these roles, and there is no reason to be\n    lieve that the statute intends to mix the responsibilities by giving the\n    administrator the power to set plan terms indirectly in the summa\n    ries, even when, as here, the administrator is also the plan sponsor.\n    Finally, it is difficult to reconcile an interpretation that would make a\n    summary’s language legally binding with the basic summary plan\n    description objective of clear, simple communication. Pp. 12–15.\n         (b) This Court has interpreted §502(a)(3)’s phrase “appropriate\n    equitable relief” as referring to “ ‘those categories of relief ’ ” that, be\n    fore the merger of law and equity,“ ‘were typically available in eq\n    uity.’ ” Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356,\n    361. This case—concerning a beneficiary’s suit against a plan fiduci\n    ary (whom ERISA typically treats as a trustee) about the terms of a\n    plan (which ERISA typically treats as a trust)—is the kind of lawsuit\n    that, before the merger, could have been brought only in an equity\n    court, where the remedies available were traditionally considered eq\n    uitable remedies. The District Court’s injunctions obviously fall\n    within this category. The other relief it ordered closely resembles\n    three forms of traditional equitable relief. First, what the court did\n    here may be regarded as the reformation of the plan’s terms, in order\n    to remedy false or misleading information CIGNA provided. The\n    power to reform contracts is a traditional power of an equity court\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  and is used to prevent fraud. Second, the part of the remedy holding\n  CIGNA to its promise that the new plan would not take from its em\n  ployees previously accrued benefits resembles estoppel, also a tradi\n  tional equitable remedy. Third, the injunctions require the plan ad\n  ministrator to pay already retired beneficiaries money owed them\n  under the plan as reformed. Equity courts possessed the power to\n  provide monetary “compensation” for a loss resulting from a trustee’s\n  breach of duty, or to prevent the trustee’s unjust enrichment. That\n  surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust committed by a fidu\n  ciary encompassing any violation of duty imposed on that fiduciary.\n  Pp. 16–20.\n     2. Because §502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable relief” for\n  violations of ERISA, the relevant standard of harm will depend on\n  the equitable theory by which the District Court provides relief. That\n  court is to conduct the analysis in the first instance, but there are\n  several equitable principles that it might apply on remand. Neither\n  ERISA’s relevant substantive provisions nor §502(a)(3) sets a particu\n  lar standard for determining harm. And equity law provides no gen\n  eral principle that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a\n  remedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement arises, it is\n  because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes that re\n  quirement. Thus, when a court exercises authority under §502(a)(3)\n  to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a showing of detrimental\n  reliance must be made. However, equity courts did not insist on a\n  detrimental reliance showing where they ordered reformation where\n  a fraudulent suppression, omission, or insertion materially affected\n  the substance of a contract. Nor did they require a detrimental reli\n  ance showing when they ordered surcharge. They simply ordered a\n  trust or beneficiary made whole following a trustee’s breach of trust.\n  This flexible approach belies a strict detrimental reliance require\n  ment. To be sure, a fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3)\n  only upon a showing of actual harm, and such harm may consist of\n  detrimental reliance. But it might also come from the loss of a right\n  protected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. It is not difficult to\n  imagine how the failure to provide proper summary information here,\n  in violation of ERISA, injured employees even if they did not them\n  selves act in reliance on the summaries. Thus, to obtain relief by\n  surcharge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or\n  beneficiary must show that the violation caused injury, but need\n  show only actual harm and causation, not detrimental reliance.\n  Pp. 20–22.\n348 Fed.

Previously,\nthe plan provided a retiring employee with a defined\nbenefit in the form of an annuity calculated on the basis of\nhis preretirement salary and length of service. The new\nplan provided most retiring employees with a (lump sum)\ncash balance calculated on the basis of a defined annual\ncontribution from CIGNA as increased by compound inter\nest. Because many employees had already earned at least\nsome old-plan benefits, the new plan translated already\nearned benefits into an opening amount in the employee’s\ncash balance account.\n  Respondents, acting on behalf of approximately 25,000\nbeneficiaries of the CIGNA Pension Plan (which is also a\npetitioner here), challenged CIGNA’s adoption of the new\nplan. They claimed in part that CIGNA had failed to give\nthem proper notice of changes to their benefits, particu\nlarly because the new plan in certain respects provided\n2                  CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthem with less generous benefits. See Employee Retire\nment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) §§102(a),\n104(b), 204(h), 88 Stat. 841, 848, 862, as amended, 29\nU. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b), 1054(h).\n  The District Court agreed that the disclosures made by\nCIGNA violated its obligations under ERISA. In deter\nmining relief, the court found that CIGNA’s notice failures\nhad caused the employees “likely harm.” The Court then\nreformed the new plan and ordered CIGNA to pay benefits\naccordingly. It found legal authority for doing so in\nERISA §502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B) (authoriz\ning a plan “participant or beneficiary” to bring a “civil\naction” to “recover benefits due to him under the terms of\nhis plan”).\n  We agreed to decide whether the District Court applied\nthe correct legal standard, namely, a “likely harm” stan\ndard, in determining that CIGNA’s notice violations\ncaused its employees sufficient injury to warrant legal\nrelief. To reach that question, we must first consider a\nmore general matter—whether the ERISA section just\nmentioned (ERISA’s recovery-of-benefits-due provision,\n§502(a)(1)(B)) authorizes entry of the relief the District\nCourt provided. We conclude that it does not authorize\nthis relief. Nonetheless, we find that a different equity\nrelated ERISA provision, to which the District Court also\nreferred, authorizes forms of relief similar to those that\nthe court entered. §502(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3).\n  Section 502(a)(3) authorizes “appropriate equitable\nrelief ” for violations of ERISA. Accordingly, the relevant\nstandard of harm will depend upon the equitable theory by\nwhich the District Court provides relief. We leave it to the\nDistrict Court to conduct that analysis in the first in\nstance, but we identify equitable principles that the court\nmight apply on remand.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             I\n\n   Because our decision rests in important part upon the\ncircumstances present here, we shall describe those cir\ncumstances in some detail. We still simplify in doing so.\nBut the interested reader can find a more thorough de\nscription in two District Court opinions, which set forth\nthat court’s findings reached after a lengthy trial. See 559\nF. Supp. 2d 192 (Conn. 2008); 534 F. Supp. 2d 288 (Conn.\n2008).\n                             A\n   Under CIGNA’s pre-1998 defined-benefit retirement\nplan, an employee with at least five years service would\nreceive an annuity annually paying an amount that de\npended upon the employee’s salary and length of service.\nDepending on when the employee had joined CIGNA, the\nannuity would equal either (1) 2 percent of the employee’s\naverage salary over his final three years with CIGNA,\nmultiplied by the number of years worked (up to 30); or (2)\n12⁄3 percent of the employee’s average salary over his final\nfive years with CIGNA, multiplied by the number of years\nworked (up to 35). Calculated either way, the annuity\nwould approach 60 percent of a longtime employee’s final\nsalary. A well-paid longtime employee, earning, say,\n$160,000 per year, could receive a retirement annuity\npaying the employee about $96,000 per year until his\ndeath. The plan offered many employees at least one\nother benefit: They could retire early, at age 55, and re\nceive an only-somewhat-reduced annuity.\n   In November 1997, CIGNA sent its employees a news\nletter announcing that it intended to put in place a new\npension plan. The new plan would substitute an “account\nbalance plan” for CIGNA’s pre-existing defined-benefit\nsystem. App. 991a (emphasis deleted). The newsletter\nadded that the old plan would end on December 31, 1997,\nthat CIGNA would introduce (and describe) the new plan\n4                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsometime during 1998, and that the new plan would apply\nretroactively to January 1, 1998.\n   Eleven months later CIGNA filled in the details. Its\nnew plan created an individual retirement account for\neach employee. (The account consisted of a bookkeeping\nentry backed by a CIGNA-funded trust.) Each year\nCIGNA would contribute to the employee’s individual\naccount an amount equal to between 3 percent and 8.5\npercent of the employee’s salary, depending upon age,\nlength of service, and certain other factors. The account\nbalance would earn compound interest at a rate equal to\nthe return on 5-year treasury bills plus one-quarter per\ncent (but no less than 4.5 percent and no greater than 9\npercent). Upon retirement the employee would receive the\namount then in his or her individual account—in the form\nof either a lump sum or whatever annuity the lump sum\nthen would buy. As promised, CIGNA would open the\naccounts and begin to make contributions as of January 1,\n1998.\n   But what about the retirement benefits that employees\nhad already earned prior to January 1, 1998? CIGNA\npromised to make an initial contribution to the individ\nual’s account equal to the value of that employee’s already\nearned benefits. And the new plan set forth a method for\ncalculating that initial contribution. The method con\nsisted of calculating the amount as of the employee’s\n(future) retirement date of the annuity to which the em\nployee’s salary and length of service already (i.e., as of\nDecember 31, 1997) entitled him and then discounting\nthat sum to its present (i.e., January 1, 1998) value.\n   An example will help: Imagine an employee born on\nJanuary 1, 1966, who joined CIGNA in January 1991 on\nhis 25th birthday, and who (during the five years preced\ning the plan changeover) earned an average salary of\n$100,000 per year. As of January 1, 1998, the old plan\nwould have entitled that employee to an annuity equal to\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n$100,000 times 7 (years then worked) times 12⁄3 percent, or\n$11,667 per year—when he retired in 2031 at age 65. The\n2031 price of an annuity paying $11,667 per year until\ndeath depends upon interest rates and mortality assump\ntions at that time. If we assume the annuity would pay 7\npercent until the holder’s death (and we use the mortality\nassumptions used by the plan, see App. 407a (incorporat\ning the mortality table prescribed by Rev. Rul. 95–6,\n1995–1 Cum. Bull. 80)), then the 2031 price of such an\nannuity would be about $120,500. And CIGNA should\ninitially deposit in this individual’s account on January 1,\n1998, an amount that will grow to become $120,500, 33\nyears later, in 2031, when the individual retires. If we\nassume a 5 percent average interest rate, then that\namount presently (i.e., as of January 1, 1998) equals about\n$24,000. And (with one further mortality-related adjust\nment that we shall describe infra, at 6–7) that is the\namount, more or less, that the new plan’s transition rules\nwould have required CIGNA initially to deposit. Then\nCIGNA would make further annual deposits, and all the\ndeposited amounts would earn compound interest. When\nthe employee retired, he would receive the resulting lump\nsum.\n   The new plan also provided employees a guarantee: An\nemployee would receive upon retirement either (1) the\namount to which he or she had become entitled as of\nJanuary 1, 1998, or (2) the amount then in his or her\nindividual account, whichever was greater. Thus, the\nemployee in our example would receive (in 2031) no less\nthan an annuity paying $11,667 per year for life.\n                            B\n                            1\n   The District Court found that CIGNA’s initial descrip\ntions of its new plan were significantly incomplete and\nmisled its employees. In November 1997, for example,\n6                   CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCIGNA sent the employees a newsletter that said the new\nplan would “significantly enhance” its “retirement pro\ngram,” would produce “an overall improvement in . . .\nretirement benefits,” and would provide “the same benefit\nsecurity” with “steadier benefit growth.” App. 990a, 991a,\n993a. CIGNA also told its employees that they would “see\nthe growth in [their] total retirement benefits from\nCIGNA every year,” id., at 952a, that its initial deposit\n“represent[ed] the full value of the benefit [they] earned\nfor service before 1998,” Record E–503 (Exh. 98), and that\n“[o]ne advantage the company will not get from the re\ntirement program changes is cost savings.” App. 993a.\n   In fact, the new plan saved the company $10 million\nannually (though CIGNA later said it devoted the savings\nto other employee benefits). Its initial deposit did not\n“represen[t] the full value of the benefit” that employees\nhad “earned for service before 1998.” And the plan made a\nsignificant number of employees worse off in at least the\nfollowing specific ways:\n   First, the initial deposit calculation ignored the fact that\nthe old plan offered many CIGNA employees the right to\nretire early (beginning at age 55) with only somewhat\nreduced benefits. This right was valuable. For example,\nas of January 1, 1998, respondent Janice Amara had\nearned vested age-55 retirement benefits of $1,833 per\nmonth, but CIGNA’s initial deposit in her new-plan indi\nvidual retirement account (ignoring this benefit) would\nhave allowed her at age 55 to buy an annuity benefit of\nonly $900 per month.\n   Second, as we previously indicated but did not explain,\nsupra at 5, the new plan adjusted CIGNA’s initial deposit\ndownward to account for the fact that, unlike the old\nplan’s lifetime annuity, an employee’s survivors would\nreceive the new plan’s benefits (namely, the amount in the\nemployee’s individual account) even if the employee died\nbefore retiring. The downward adjustment consisted of\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmultiplying the otherwise-required deposit by the prob\nability that the employee would live until retirement—a\n90 percent probability in the example of our 32-year-old,\nsupra, at 4–5. And that meant that CIGNA’s initial de\nposit in our example—the amount that was supposed to\ngrow to $120,500 by 2031—would be less than $22,000,\nnot $24,000 (the number we computed). The employee, of\ncourse, would receive a benefit in return—namely, a form\nof life insurance. But at least some employees might have\npreferred the retirement benefit and consequently could\nreasonably have thought it important to know that the\nnew plan traded away one-tenth of their already-earned\nbenefits for a life insurance policy that they might not\nhave wanted.\n   Third, the new plan shifted the risk of a fall in interest\nrates from CIGNA to its employees. Under the old plan,\nCIGNA had to buy a retiring employee an annuity that\npaid a specified sum irrespective of whether falling inter\nest rates made it more expensive for CIGNA to pay for\nthat annuity. And falling interest rates also meant that\nany sum CIGNA set aside to buy that annuity would grow\nmore slowly over time, thereby requiring CIGNA to set\naside more money to make any specific sum available at\nretirement. Under the new plan CIGNA did not have to\nbuy a retiring employee an annuity that paid a specific\nsum. The employee would simply receive whatever sum\nhis account contained. And falling interest rates meant\nthat the account’s lump sum would earn less money each\nyear after the employee retired. Annuities, for example,\nwould become more expensive (any fixed purchase price\npaying for less annual income). At the same time falling\ninterest meant that the individual account would grow\nmore slowly over time, leaving the employee with less\nmoney at retirement.\n   Of course, interest rates might rise instead of fall, leav\ning CIGNA’s employees better off under the new plan.\n8                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nBut the latter advantage does not cancel out the former\ndisadvantage, for most individuals are risk averse. And\nthat means that most of CIGNA’s employees would have\npreferred that CIGNA, rather than they, bear these risks.\n  The amounts likely involved are significant. If, in our\nexample, interest rates between 1998 and 2031 averaged 4\npercent rather than the 5 percent we assumed, and if in\n2031 annuities paid 6 percent rather than the 7 percent\nwe assumed, then CIGNA would have had to make an\ninitial deposit of $35,500 (not $24,000) to assure that\nemployee the $11,667 annual annuity payment to which\nhe had already become entitled. Indeed, that $24,000 that\nCIGNA would have contributed (leaving aside the life\ninsurance problem) would have provided enough money to\nbuy (in 2031) an annuity that assured the employee an\nannual payment of only about $8,000 (rather than\n$11,667).\n  We recognize that the employee in our example (like\nothers) might have continued to work for CIGNA after\nJanuary 1, 1998; and he would thereby eventually have\nearned a pension that, by the time of his retirement, was\nworth far more than $11,667. But that is so because\nCIGNA made an additional contribution for each year\nworked after January 1, 1998. If interest rates fell (as\nthey did), it would take the employee several additional\nyears of work simply to catch up (under the new plan) to\nwhere he had already been (under the old plan) as of\nJanuary 1, 1998—a phenomenon known in pension jargon\nas “wear away,” see 534 F. Supp. 2d, at 303–304 (referring\nto respondents’ requiring 6 to 10 years to catch up).\n  The District Court found that CIGNA told its employees\nnothing about any of these features of the new plan—\nwhich individually and together made clear that CIGNA’s\ndescriptions of the plan were incomplete and inaccurate.\nThe District Court also found that CIGNA intentionally\nmisled its employees. A focus group and many employees\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked CIGNA, for example, to “ ‘[d]isclose details’ ” about\nthe plan, to provide “ ‘individual comparisons,’ ” or to show\n“ ‘[a]n actual projection for retirement.’ ” Id., at 342. But\nCIGNA did not do so. Instead (in the words of one inter\nnal document), it “ ‘focus[ed] on NOT providing employees\nbefore and after samples of the Pension Plan changes.’ ”\nId., at 343.\n    The District Court concluded, as a matter of law, that\nCIGNA’s representations (and omissions) about the plan,\nmade between November 1997 (when it announced the\nplan) and December 1998 (when it put the plan into effect)\nviolated:\n    (a) ERISA §204(h), implemented by Treas. Reg.\n§1.411(d)–6, 26 CFR §1.411(d)–6 (2000), which (as it ex\nisted at the relevant time) forbade an amendment of a\npension plan that would “provide for a significant reduc\ntion in the rate of future benefit accrual” unless the plan\nadministrator also sent a “written notice” that provided\neither the text of the amendment or summarized its likely\neffects, 29 U. S. C. §1054(h) (2000 ed.) (amended 2001);\nTreas. Reg. §1.411(d)–6, Q&A–10, 63 Fed. Reg. 68682\n(1998); and\n    (b) ERISA §§102(a) and 104(b), which require a plan\nadministrator to provide beneficiaries with summary plan\ndescriptions and with summaries of material modifica\ntions, “written in a manner calculated to be understood by\nthe average plan participant,” that are “sufficiently accu\nrate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such par\nticipants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations\nunder the plan,” 29 U. S. C. §§1022(a), 1024(b) (2006 ed.\nand Supp. III).\n                            2\n  The District Court then turned to the remedy. First, the\ncourt agreed with CIGNA that only employees whom\nCIGNA’s disclosure failures had harmed could obtain\n10                CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelief. But it did not require each individual member of\nthe relevant CIGNA employee class to show individual\ninjury. Rather, it found (1) that the evidence presented\nhad raised a presumption of “likely harm” suffered by the\nmembers of the relevant employee class, and (2) that\nCIGNA, though free to offer contrary evidence in respect\nto some or all of those employees, had failed to rebut that\npresumption. It concluded that this unrebutted showing\nwas sufficient to warrant class-applicable relief.\n   Second, the court noted that §204(h) had been inter\npreted by the Second Circuit to permit the invalidation of\nplan amendments not preceded by a proper notice, prior to\nthe 2001 amendment that made this power explicit. 559\nF. Supp. 2d, at 207 (citing Frommert v. Conkright, 433\nF. 3d 254, 263 (2006)); see 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(6) (2006\ned.) (entitling participants to benefits “without regard to\n[the] amendment” in case of an “egregious failure”). But\nthe court also thought that granting this relief here would\nharm, not help, the injured employees. That is because\nthe notice failures all concerned the new plan that took\neffect in December 1998. The court thought that the\nnotices in respect to the freezing of old-plan benefits,\neffective December 31, 1997, were valid. To strike the new\nplan while leaving in effect the frozen old plan would not\nhelp CIGNA’s employees.\n   The court considered treating the November 1997 notice\nas a sham or treating that notice and the later 1998 no\ntices as part and parcel of a single set of related events.\nBut it pointed out that respondents “ha[d] argued none of\nthese things.” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 208. And it said that\nthe court would “not make these arguments now on [re\nspondents’] behalf.” Ibid.\n   Third, the court reformed the terms of the new plan’s\nguarantee. It erased the portion that assured participants\nwho retired the greater of “A” (that which they had al\nready earned as of December 31, 1997, under the old plan,\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n$11,667 in our example) or “B” (that which they would\nearn via CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan,\nincluding CIGNA’s initial deposit). And it substituted a\nprovision that would guarantee each employee “A” (that\nwhich they had already earned, as of December 31, 1997,\nunder the old plan) plus “B” (that which they would earn\nvia CIGNA’s annual deposits under the new plan, exclud\ning CIGNA’s initial deposit). In our example, the District\nCourt’s remedy would no longer force our employee to\nchoose upon retirement either an $11,667 annuity or his\nnew plan benefits (including both CIGNA’s annual depos\nits and CIGNA’s initial deposit). It would give him an\n$11,667 annuity plus his new plan benefits (with CIGNA’s\nannual deposits but without CIGNA’s initial deposit).\n    Fourth, the court “order[ed] and enjoin[ed] the CIGNA\nPlan to reform its records to reflect that all class members\n. . . now receive [the just described] ‘A + B’ benefits,” and\nthat it pay appropriate benefits to those class members\nwho had already retired. Id., at 222.\n    Fifth, the court held that ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) provided\nthe legal authority to enter this relief. That provision\nstates that a “civil action may be brought” by a plan “par\nticipant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to him\nunder the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).\nThe court wrote that its orders in effect awarded “benefits\nunder the terms of the plan” as reformed. 559 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 212.\n    At the same time the court considered whether ERISA\n§502(a)(3) also provided legal authority to enter this relief.\nThat provision states that a civil action may be brought\n    “by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to en\n    join any act or practice which violates any provision of\n    this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to ob\n    tain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress\n    such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this\n12                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     subchapter or the terms of the plan.”       29 U. S. C.\n     §1132(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nThe District Court decided not to answer this question\nbecause (1) it had just decided that the same relief was\navailable under §502(a)(1)(B), regardless, cf. Varity Corp.\nv. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 515 (1996); and (2) the Supreme\nCourt has “issued several opinions . . . that have severely\ncurtailed the kinds of relief that are available under\n§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205 (citing Sereboff v.\nMid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006);\nGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.\n204 (2002); and Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S.\n248 (1993)).\n                             3\n   The parties cross-appealed the District Court’s judg\nment. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued\na brief summary order, rejecting all their claims, and\naffirming “the judgment of the district court for substan\ntially the reasons stated” in the District Court’s “well\nreasoned and scholarly opinions.” 348 Fed. Appx. 627\n(2009). The parties filed cross-petitions for writs of certio\nrari in this Court. We granted the request in CIGNA’s\npetition to consider whether a showing of “likely harm” is\nsufficient to entitle plan participants to recover benefits\nbased on faulty disclosures.\n                             II\n  CIGNA in the merits briefing raises a preliminary\nquestion. Brief for Petitioners 13–20. It argues first and\nforemost that the statutory provision upon which the\nDistrict Court rested its orders, namely, the provision for\nrecovery of plan benefits, §502(a)(1)(B), does not in fact\nauthorize the District Court to enter the kind of relief it\nentered here.    And for that reason, CIGNA argues,\nwhether the District Court did or did not use a proper\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard for determining harm is beside the point. We\nbelieve that this preliminary question is closely enough\nrelated to the question presented that we shall consider it\nat the outset.\n                              A\n   The District Court ordered relief in two steps. Step 1: It\nordered the terms of the plan reformed (so that they pro\nvided an “A plus B,” rather than a “greater of A or B”\nguarantee). Step 2: It ordered the plan administrator\n(which it found to be CIGNA) to enforce the plan as re\nformed. One can fairly describe step 2 as consistent with\n§502(a)(1)(B), for that provision grants a participant the\nright to bring a civil action to “recover benefits due . . .\nunder the terms of his plan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B).\nAnd step 2 orders recovery of the benefits provided by the\n“terms of [the] plan” as reformed.\n   But what about step 1? Where does §502(a)(1)(B) grant\na court the power to change the terms of the plan as they\npreviously existed? The statutory language speaks of\n“enforc[ing]” the “terms of the plan,” not of changing them.\n29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(l)(B) (emphasis added). The provision\nallows a court to look outside the plan’s written language\nin deciding what those terms are, i.e., what the language\nmeans. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526\nU. S. 358, 377–379 (1999) (permitting the insurance terms\nof an ERISA-governed plan to be interpreted in light of\nstate insurance rules). But we have found nothing sug\ngesting that the provision authorizes a court to alter those\nterms, at least not in present circumstances, where that\nchange, akin to the reform of a contract, seems less like\nthe simple enforcement of a contract as written and more\nlike an equitable remedy. See infra, at 18.\n   Nor can we accept the Solicitor General’s alternative\nrationale seeking to justify the use of this provision. The\nSolicitor General says that the District Court did enforce\n14                  CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plan’s terms as written, adding that the “plan” in\ncludes the disclosures that constituted the summary plan\ndescriptions. In other words, in the view of the Solicitor\nGeneral, the terms of the summaries are terms of the\nplan.\n   Even if the District Court had viewed the summaries\nas plan “terms” (which it did not, see supra, at 10–11),\nhowever, we cannot agree that the terms of statutorily\nrequired plan summaries (or summaries of plan modifica\ntions) necessarily may be enforced (under §502(a)(1)(B)) as\nthe terms of the plan itself. For one thing, it is difficult to\nsquare the Solicitor General’s reading of the statute with\nERISA §102(a), the provision that obliges plan adminis\ntrators to furnish summary plan descriptions. The syntax\nof that provision, requiring that participants and benefici\naries be advised of their rights and obligations “under the\nplan,” suggests that the information about the plan pro\nvided by those disclosures is not itself part of the plan.\nSee 29 U. S. C. §1022(a). Nothing in §502(a)(1)(B) (or, as\nfar as we can tell, anywhere else) suggests the contrary.\n   Nor do we find it easy to square the Solicitor General’s\nreading with the statute’s division of authority between a\nplan’s sponsor and the plan’s administrator. The plan’s\nsponsor (e.g., the employer), like a trust’s settlor, creates\nthe basic terms and conditions of the plan, executes a\nwritten instrument containing those terms and conditions,\nand provides in that instrument “a procedure” for making\namendments. §402, 29 U. S. C. §1102. The plan’s admin\nistrator, a trustee-like fiduciary, manages the plan, follows\nits terms in doing so, and provides participants with the\nsummary documents that describe the plan (and modifica\ntions) in readily understandable form. §§3(21)(A), 101(a),\n102, 104, 29 U. S. C. §§1002(21)(A), 1021(a), 1022, 1024\n(2006 ed. and Supp. III). Here, the District Court found\nthat the same entity, CIGNA, filled both roles. See 534\nF. Supp. 2d, at 331. But that is not always the case.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRegardless, we have found that ERISA carefully distin\nguishes these roles. See, e.g., Varity Corp., 516 U. S., at\n498. And we have no reason to believe that the statute\nintends to mix the responsibilities by giving the adminis\ntrator the power to set plan terms indirectly by including\nthem in the summary plan descriptions. See Curtiss-\nWright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 81–85 (1995).\n  Finally, we find it difficult to reconcile the Solicitor\nGeneral’s interpretation with the basic summary plan\ndescription objective: clear, simple communication. See\n§§2(a), 102(a), 29 U. S. C. §1001(a), 1022(a) (2006 ed.). To\nmake the language of a plan summary legally binding\ncould well lead plan administrators to sacrifice simplicity\nand comprehensibility in order to describe plan terms in\nthe language of lawyers. Consider the difference between\na will and the summary of a will or between a property\ndeed and its summary. Consider, too, the length of Part I\nof this opinion, and then consider how much longer Part I\nwould have to be if we had to include all the qualifications\nand nuances that a plan drafter might have found impor\ntant and feared to omit lest they lose all legal significance.\nThe District Court’s opinions take up 109 pages of the\nFederal Supplement. None of this is to say that plan\nadministrators can avoid providing complete and accurate\nsummaries of plan terms in the manner required by\nERISA and its implementing regulations. But we fear\nthat the Solicitor General’s rule might bring about com\nplexity that would defeat the fundamental purpose of the\nsummaries.\n  For these reasons taken together we conclude that the\nsummary documents, important as they are, provide\ncommunication with beneficiaries about the plan, but that\ntheir statements do not themselves constitute the terms of\nthe plan for purposes of §502(a)(1)(B). We also conclude\nthat the District Court could not find authority in that\nsection to reform CIGNA’s plan as written.\n16                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n   If §502(a)(1)(B) does not authorize entry of the relief\nhere at issue, what about nearby §502(a)(3)? That provi\nsion allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary “to\nobtain other appropriate equitable relief ” to redress viola\ntions of (here relevant) parts of ERISA “or the terms of the\nplan.” 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). The\nDistrict Court strongly implied, but did not directly hold,\nthat it would base its relief upon this subsection were it\nnot for (1) the fact that the preceding “plan benefits due”\nprovision, §502(a)(1)(B), provided sufficient authority; and\n(2) certain cases from this Court that narrowed the appli\ncation of the term “appropriate equitable relief,” see, e.g.,\nMertens, 508 U. S. 248; Great-West, 534 U. S. 204. Our\nholding in Part II–A, supra, removes the District Court’s\nfirst obstacle. And given the likelihood that, on remand,\nthe District Court will turn to and rely upon this alterna\ntive subsection, we consider the court’s second concern.\nWe find that concern misplaced.\n   We have interpreted the term “appropriate equitable\nrelief ” in §502(a)(3) as referring to “ ‘those categories of\nrelief ’ ” that, traditionally speaking (i.e., prior to the\nmerger of law and equity) “ ‘were typically available in\nequity.’ ” Sereboff, 547 U. S., at 361 (quoting Mertens, 508\nU. S., at 256). In Mertens, we applied this principle to a\nclaim seeking money damages brought by a beneficiary\nagainst a private firm that provided a trustee with actuar\nial services. We found that the plaintiff sought “nothing\nother than compensatory damages” against a nonfiduci\nary. Id., at 253, 255 (emphasis deleted). And we held that\nsuch a claim, traditionally speaking, was legal, not equi\ntable, in nature. Id., at 255.\n   In Great-West, we considered a claim brought by a fidu\nciary against a tort-award-winning beneficiary seeking\nmonetary reimbursement for medical outlays that the plan\nhad previously made on the beneficiary’s behalf. We noted\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the fiduciary sought to obtain a lien attaching to (or a\nconstructive trust imposed upon) money that the benefici\nary had received from the tort-case defendant. But we\nnoted that the money in question was not the “particular”\nmoney that the tort defendant had paid. And, tradition\nally speaking, relief that sought a lien or a constructive\ntrust was legal relief, not equitable relief, unless the funds\nin question were “particular funds or property in the\ndefendant’s possession.” 534 U. S., at 213 (emphasis\nadded).\n   The case before us concerns a suit by a beneficiary\nagainst a plan fiduciary (whom ERISA typically treats as\na trustee) about the terms of a plan (which ERISA typi\ncally treats as a trust). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 253, n. 4 (2008); Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 496–497. It is the kind of lawsuit that,\nbefore the merger of law and equity, respondents could\nhave brought only in a court of equity, not a court of law.\n4 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Trusts §24.1, p. 1654\n(5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott & Ascher) (“Trusts are,\nand always have been, the bailiwick of the courts of eq\nuity”); Duvall v. Craig, 2 Wheat. 45, 56 (1817) (a trustee\nwas “only suable in equity”).\n   With the exception of the relief now provided by\n§502(a)(1)(B), Restatement (Second) of Trusts §§198(1)–(2)\n(1957) (hereinafter Second Restatement); 4 Scott & Ascher\n§24.2.1, the remedies available to those courts of equity\nwere traditionally considered equitable remedies, see\nSecond Restatement §199; J. Adams, Doctrine of Equity:\nA Commentary on the Law as Administered by the Court\nof Chancery 61 (7th Am. ed. 1881) (hereinafter Adams);\n4 Scott & Ascher §24.2.\n   The District Court’s affirmative and negative injunc\ntions obviously fall within this category. Mertens, supra,\nat 256 (identifying injunctions, mandamus, and restitution\nas equitable relief ). And other relief ordered by the Dis\n18                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrict Court resembles forms of traditional equitable relief.\nThat is because equity chancellors developed a host of\nother “distinctively equitable” remedies—remedies that\nwere “fitted to the nature of the primary right” they were\nintended to protect. 1 S. Symons, Pomeroy’s Equity Juris\nprudence §108, pp. 139–140 (5th ed. 1941) (hereinafter\nPomeroy). See generally 1 J. Story, Commentaries on\nEquity Jurisprudence §692 (12th ed. 1877) (hereinafter\nStory). Indeed, a maxim of equity states that “[e]quity\nsuffers not a right to be without a remedy.” R. Francis,\nMaxims of Equity 29 (1st Am. ed. 1823). And the relief\nentered here, insofar as it does not consist of injunctive\nrelief, closely resembles three other traditional equitable\nremedies.\n   First, what the District Court did here may be regarded\nas the reformation of the terms of the plan, in order to\nremedy the false or misleading information CIGNA pro\nvided. The power to reform contracts (as contrasted with\nthe power to enforce contracts as written) is a traditional\npower of an equity court, not a court of law, and was used\nto prevent fraud. See Baltzer v. Raleigh & Augusta R. Co.,\n115 U. S. 634, 645 (1885) (“[I]t is well settled that equity\nwould reform the contract, and enforce it, as reformed, if\nthe mistake or fraud were shown”); Hearne v. Marine Ins.\nCo., 20 Wall. 488, 490 (1874) (“The reformation of written\ncontracts for fraud or mistake is an ordinary head of eq\nuity jurisdiction”); Bradford v. Union Bank of Tenn., 13\nHow. 57, 66 (1852); J. Eaton, Handbook of Equity Juris\nprudence §306, p. 618 (1901) (hereinafter Eaton) (courts of\ncommon law could only void or enforce, but not reform, a\ncontract); 4 Pomeroy §1375, at 1000 (reformation “chiefly\noccasioned by fraud or mistake,” which were themselves\nconcerns of equity courts); 1 Story §§152–154; see also 4\nPomeroy §1375, at 999 (equity often considered refor\nmation a “preparatory step” that “establishes the real\ncontract”).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the District Court’s remedy essentially held\nCIGNA to what it had promised, namely, that the new\nplan would not take from its employees benefits they had\nalready accrued. This aspect of the remedy resembles\nestoppel, a traditional equitable remedy. See, e.g., E.\nMerwin, Principles of Equity and Equity Pleading §910\n(H. Merwin ed. 1895); 3 Pomeroy §804. Equitable estoppel\n“operates to place the person entitled to its benefit in the\nsame position he would have been in had the representa\ntions been true.” Eaton §62, at 176. And, as Justice Story\nlong ago pointed out, equitable estoppel “forms a very\nessential element in . . . fair dealing, and rebuke of all\nfraudulent misrepresentation, which it is the boast of\ncourts of equity constantly to promote.” 2 Story §1533, at\n776.\n   Third, the District Court injunctions require the plan\nadministrator to pay to already retired beneficiaries\nmoney owed them under the plan as reformed. But the\nfact that this relief takes the form of a money payment\ndoes not remove it from the category of traditionally equi\ntable relief. Equity courts possessed the power to provide\nrelief in the form of monetary “compensation” for a loss\nresulting from a trustee’s breach of duty, or to prevent the\ntrustee’s unjust enrichment.        Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts §95, and Comment a (Tent. Draft No. 5, Mar. 2,\n2009) (hereinafter Third Restatement); Eaton §§211–212,\nat 440. Indeed, prior to the merger of law and equity this\nkind of monetary remedy against a trustee, sometimes\ncalled a “surcharge,” was “exclusively equitable.” Princess\nLida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456, 464\n(1939); Third Restatement §95, and Comment a; G. Bogert\n& G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees §862 (rev. 2d ed. 1995)\n(hereinafter Bogert); 4 Scott & Ascher §§24.2, 24.9, at\n1659–1660, 1686; Second Restatement §197; see also\nManhattan Bank of Memphis v. Walker, 130 U. S. 267, 271\n(1889) (“The suit is plainly one of equitable cognizance, the\n20                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbill being filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a\nbreach of trust”); 1 J. Perry, A Treatise on the Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §17, p. 13 (2d ed. 1874) (common-law\nattempts “to punish trustees for a breach of trust in dam\nages, . . . w[ere] soon abandoned”).\n  The surcharge remedy extended to a breach of trust\ncommitted by a fiduciary encompassing any violation of a\nduty imposed upon that fiduciary. See Second Restate\nment §201; Adams 59; 4 Pomeroy §1079; 2 Story §§1261,\n1268. Thus, insofar as an award of make-whole relief is\nconcerned, the fact that the defendant in this case, unlike\nthe defendant in Mertens, is analogous to a trustee makes\na critical difference. See 508 U. S., at 262–263. In sum,\ncontrary to the District Court’s fears, the types of reme\ndies the court entered here fall within the scope of the\nterm “appropriate equitable relief ” in §502(a)(3).\n                             III\n  Section 502(a)(3) invokes the equitable powers of the\nDistrict Court. We cannot know with certainty which\nremedy the District Court understood itself to be impos\ning, nor whether the District Court will find it appropriate\nto exercise its discretion under §502(a)(3) to impose that\nremedy on remand. We need not decide which remedies\nare appropriate on the facts of this case in order to resolve\nthe parties’ dispute as to the appropriate legal standard in\ndetermining whether members of the relevant employee\nclass were injured.\n  The relevant substantive provisions of ERISA do not set\nforth any particular standard for determining harm. They\nsimply require the plan administrator to write and to\ndistribute written notices that are “sufficiently accurate\nand comprehensive to reasonably apprise” plan partici\npants and beneficiaries of “their rights and obligations\nunder the plan.” §102(a); see also §§104(b), 204(h). Nor\ncan we find a definite standard in the ERISA provision,\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§502(a)(3) (which authorizes the court to enter “appropri\nate equitable relief ” to redress ERISA “violations”). Hence\nany requirement of harm must come from the law of\nequity.\n   Looking to the law of equity, there is no general princi\nple that “detrimental reliance” must be proved before a\nremedy is decreed. To the extent any such requirement\narises, it is because the specific remedy being contem\nplated imposes such a requirement. Thus, as CIGNA\npoints out, when equity courts used the remedy of estop\npel, they insisted upon a showing akin to detrimental\nreliance, i.e., that the defendant’s statement “in truth,\ninfluenced the conduct of ” the plaintiff, causing “preju\ndic[e].” Eaton §61, at 175; see 3 Pomeroy §805. Accord\ningly, when a court exercises its authority under\n§502(a)(3) to impose a remedy equivalent to estoppel, a\nshowing of detrimental reliance must be made.\n   But this showing is not always necessary for other\nequitable remedies. Equity courts, for example, would\nreform contracts to reflect the mutual understanding of\nthe contracting parties where “fraudulent suppression[s],\nomission[s], or insertion[s],” 1 Story §154, at 149, “mate\nrial[ly] . . . affect[ed]” the “substance” of the contract, even\nif the “complaining part[y]” was negligent in not realizing\nits mistake, as long as its negligence did not fall below a\nstandard of “reasonable prudence” and violate a legal\nduty. 3 Pomeroy §§856, 856b, at 334, 340–341; see Balt\nzer, 115 U. S., at 645; Eaton §307(b).\n   Nor did equity courts insist upon a showing of detrimen\ntal reliance in cases where they ordered “surcharge.”\nRather, they simply ordered a trust or beneficiary made\nwhole following a trustee’s breach of trust. In such in\nstances equity courts would “mold the relief to protect the\nrights of the beneficiary according to the situation in\nvolved.” Bogert §861, at 4. This flexible approach belies a\nstrict requirement of “detrimental reliance.”\n22                 CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   To be sure, just as a court of equity would not surcharge\na trustee for a nonexistent harm, 4 Scott & Ascher §24.9,\na fiduciary can be surcharged under §502(a)(3) only upon a\nshowing of actual harm—proved (under the default rule\nfor civil cases) by a preponderance of the evidence. That\nactual harm may sometimes consist of detrimental reli\nance, but it might also come from the loss of a right pro\ntected by ERISA or its trust-law antecedents. In the\npresent case, it is not difficult to imagine how the failure\nto provide proper summary information, in violation of the\nstatute, injured employees even if they did not themselves\nact in reliance on summary documents—which they might\nnot themselves have seen—for they may have thought\nfellow employees, or informal workplace discussion, would\nhave let them know if, say, plan changes would likely\nprove harmful. We doubt that Congress would have\nwanted to bar those employees from relief.\n   The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a\nlimited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by sur\ncharge for violations of §§102(a) and 104(b), a plan partici\npant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured\nhim or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm\nand causation. Although it is not always necessary to\nmeet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words\n“detrimental reliance,” actual harm must be shown.\n   We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are\nnot asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are\nasked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude\nthat the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from\nequitable principles, as modified by the obligations and\ninjuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related\ncircumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too\nvarious in nature to insist that harm must always meet\nthat more vigorous “detrimental harm” standard when\nequity imposed no such strict requirement.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), does not authorize relief for\nmisrepresentations in a summary plan description (SPD).\nI do not join the Court’s opinion because I see no need and\nno justification for saying anything more than that.\n  Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA states that a plan partici\npant or beneficiary may bring a civil action “to recover\nbenefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce\nhis rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his\nrights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.”\nERISA defines the word “plan” as “an employee welfare\nbenefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan\nwhich is both,” 29 U. S. C. §1002(3), and it requires that\na “plan” “be established and maintained pursuant to a\nwritten instrument,” §1102(a)(1). An SPD, in contrast, is\na disclosure meant “to reasonably apprise [plan] partici\npants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations\nunder the plan.” §1022(a). It would be peculiar for a doc\nument meant to “apprise” participants of their rights\n“under the plan” to be itself part of the “plan.” Any doubt\n2                   CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat it is not is eliminated by ERISA’s repeated differen\ntiation of SPDs from the “written instruments” that con\nstitute a plan, see, e.g., §§1029(c), 1024(b)(2), and ERISA’s\nassignment to different entities of responsibility for draft\ning and amending SPDs on the one hand and plans on the\nother, see §§1002(1), (2)(A); 1021(a) (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIII), 1024(b)(1); Beck v. PACE Int’l Union, 551 U. S. 96,\n101 (2007). An SPD, moreover, would not fulfill its pur\npose of providing an easily accessible summary of the plan\nif it were an authoritative part of the plan itself; the minor\nomissions appropriate for a summary would risk revising\nthe plan.\n   Nothing else needs to be said to dispose of this case.\nThe District Court based the relief it awarded upon\nERISA §502(a)(1)(B), and that provision alone. It thought\nthat the “benefits” due “under the terms of the plan,” 29\nU. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), could derive from an SPD, either\nbecause the SPD is part of the plan or because it is capable\nof somehow modifying the plan. Under either justifica\ntion, that conclusion is wrong. An SPD is separate from a\nplan, and cannot amend a plan unless the plan so pro\nvides. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514\nU. S. 73, 79, 85 (1995). I would go no further.\n   The Court, however, ventures on to address a different\nquestion: whether respondents may recover under\n§502(a)(3) of ERISA, which allows plan participants “to\nobtain other appropriate equitable relief.” 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(a)(3). The District Court expressly declined to\nanswer this question, stating that it “need not consider\nwhether any relief ordered under §502(a)(1)(B) would also\nbe available under §502(a)(3).” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 205\n(Conn. 2008). It did note that §502(a)(3) might not help\nrespondents because that provision authorizes only relief\nthat was “ ‘typically available in equity.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S.\n204, 210 (2002)). But it described this question as “par\n                   Cite as: 563 U.

Supp. 2d, at 205, and said\nthat “in view of these knotty issues . . . the Court need not,\nand does not, decide whether Plaintiffs could obtain relief\nunder §502(a)(3),” id., at 206.\n   It is assuredly not our normal practice to decide issues\nthat a lower court “need not, and does not, decide,” see\nCooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S.\n157, 168–169 (2004), and this case presents no exceptional\nreason to do so. To the contrary, it presents additional\nreasons not to do so. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248 (1993), the case the District Court feared had\n“severely curtailed the kinds of relief . . . available under\n§502(a)(3),” 559 F. Supp. 2d, at 205, is cited exactly one\ntime in the parties’ briefs—by the CIGNA petitioners for\nthe utterly unrelated proposition that ERISA contains\na “ ‘carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme.’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners 2. And there is no discussion whatso\never of contract reformation or surcharge in the briefs of\nthe parties or even amici.1\n   The opinion for the Court states that the District Court\n“strongly implied . . . that it would base its relief upon\n[§502(a)(3)] were it not for (1) the fact that . . .\n§502(a)(1)(B) . . . provided sufficient authority; and (2)\ncertain cases from this Court that narrowed the applica\ntion of the term ‘appropriate equitable relief.’ ” Ante, at 16.\nI find no such implication whatever—not even a weak one.\nThe District Court simply said that §502(a)(1)(B) provided\nrelief, and that under our cases §502(a)(3) might not do so.\nWhile some Members of this Court have sought to divine\nwhat legislators would have prescribed beyond what they\ndid prescribe, none to my knowledge has hitherto sought\nto guess what district judges would have decided beyond\n——————\n  1 “[P]lan reformation” makes an appearance in one sentence of one\n\nfootnote of the Government’s brief, see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 30, n. 9. This cameo hardly qualifies as “discussion.”\n4                    CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n                 SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhat they did decide. And this, bear in mind, is not just a\nguess as to what the District Court would have done if it\nhad known that its §502(a)(1)(B) relief was (as we today\nhold) improper. The apparent answer to that is that it\nwould have denied relief, since it thought itself con\nstrained by “certain cases from this Court that [have]\nnarrowed [§502(a)(3)],” ante, at 16. No, the course the\nCourt guesses about is what the District Court would have\ndone if it had known both that §502(a)(1)(B) denies relief\nand that §502(a)(3) provides it. This speculation upon\nspeculation hardly renders our discussion of §502(a)(3)\nrelevant to the decision below; it is utterly irrelevant.\n  Why the Court embarks on this peculiar path is beyond\nme. It cannot even be explained by an eagerness to\ndemonstrate—by blatant dictum, if necessary—that, by\nGeorge, plan members misled by an SPD will be compen\nsated. That they will normally be compensated is not in\ndoubt. As the opinion for the Court notes, ante, at 10, the\nSecond Circuit has interpreted ERISA as permitting the\ninvalidation of plan amendments not preceded by proper\nnotice, by reason of §204(h), which reads:\n    “An applicable pension plan may not be amended so\n    as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of\n    future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator\n    provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each\n    applicable individual . . . .” 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)(1).\nThis provision appears a natural fit to respondents’ claim,\nwhich is not that CIGNA was prohibited from changing its\nplan, but that CIGNA “failed to give them proper notice of\nchanges to their benefits.” Ante, at 1. It was inapplicable\nhere only because of the peculiar facts of this case and the\nmanner in which respondents chose to argue the case. 2\n——————\n  2 The District Court found that §204(h) was unhelpful because\n\nCIGNA had provided a valid notice of its decision to freeze benefits\nunder the old plan. If the new plan were invalidated because of a\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Rather than attempting to read the District Judge’s\npalm, I would simply remand. If the District Court dis\nmisses the case based on an incorrect reading of Mertens,\nthe Second Circuit can correct its error, and if the Second\nCircuit does not do so this Court can grant certiorari. The\nCourt’s discussion of the relief available under §502(a)(3)\nand Mertens is purely dicta, binding upon neither us nor\nthe District Court. The District Court need not read any\nof it—and, indeed, if it takes our suggestions to heart, we\nmay very well reverse. Even if we adhere to our dicta that\ncontract reformation, estoppel, and surcharge are “ ‘dis\ntinctively equitable’ remedies,” ante, at 18, it is far from\nclear that they are available remedies in this case. The\nopinion for the Court does not say (much less hold) that\nthey are and disclaims the implication, see ante, at 20.\n   Contract reformation is a standard remedy for altering\nthe terms of a writing that fails to express the agreement\nof the parties “owing to the fraud of one of the parties and\nmistake of the other.” 27 Williston on Contracts §69:55,\np. 160 (4th ed. 2010). But here, the Court would be em\nploying that doctrine to alter the terms of a contract in\nresponse to a third party’s misrepresentations—not those\nof a party to the contract. The SPD is not part of the\nERISA plan, and it was not written by the plan’s sponsor.\nAlthough in this case CIGNA wrote both the plan and the\nSPD, it did so in different capacities: as sponsor when\nwriting the plan, and as administrator when preparing the\nSPD. ERISA “carefully distinguishes these roles,” ante, at\n15; see also Beck, 551 U. S., at 101, and nothing the Court\ncites suggests that they blend together when performed by\n——————\ndefective §204(h) notice, the freeze would return to force, and respon\ndents would be worse off. Respondents might (and likely should) have\nargued that the notice for the freeze was itself void, but they “argued\nnone of these things,” and the District Court declined to “make these\narguments now on [their] behalf.” 559 F. Supp. 2d 192, 208 (Conn.\n2008).\n6                  CIGNA CORP. v. AMARA\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe same entity.\n   Admittedly, reformation might be available if the third\nparty was an agent of a contracting party and its misrep\nresentations could thus be attributed to it under agency\nlaw. But such a relationship has not been alleged and is\nunlikely here. An ERISA administrator’s duty to provide\nemployees with an SPD arises by statute, 29 U. S. C.\n§1024(b)(1), and not by reason of its relationship to the\nsponsor. The administrator is a legally distinct entity.\nMoreover, it is incoherent to think of the administrator as\nagent and the sponsor as principal. Were this the case,\nand were the administrator contracting with employees as\nan agent of the sponsor in producing the SPD, then the\nSPD would be part of the plan or would amend it—exactly\nwhat the opinion for the Court rejects in Part II–A, ante,\nat 13–15. And, in any event, SPDs may be furnished\nmonths after an employee accepts a pension or benefit\nplan. §1024(b)(1). Reformation is meant to effectuate\nmutual intent at the time of contracting, and that intent is\nnot retroactively revised by subsequent misstatements.\n   Equitable estoppel and surcharge are perhaps better\nsuited to the facts of this case. CIGNA admits that re\nspondents might be able to recover under §502(a)(3) pur\nsuant to an equitable estoppel theory, but it presumably\nmakes this concession only because questions of reliance\nwould be individualized and potentially inappropriate for\nclass-action treatment. Surcharge (which CIGNA does not\nconcede and which is not briefed) may encounter the same\nproblem. The amount for which an administrator may\nbe surcharged is, as the opinion for the Court notes, the\n“actual harm” suffered by an employee, ante, at 22—that\nis, harm stemming from reliance on the SPD or the lost\nopportunity to contest or react to the switch. Cf. 3 A. Scott\n& W. Fratcher, Law of Trusts §205, pp. 237–243 (4th ed.\n1988). A remedy relating only to that harm would of course\n                      Cite as: 563 U.
