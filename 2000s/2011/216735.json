UNITED STATES EX\n                REL. KIRK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10–188.      Argued March 1, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011\nThe public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally fore\n  closes private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or\n  fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are “based\n  upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,\n  civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or\n  Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investiga\n  tion, or from the news media.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Respon\n  dent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, pe\n  titioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false\n  claims for payment under its federal contracts. To support his alle\n  gations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor\n  Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed\n  under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. §552.\n  Granting Schindler’s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded,\n  inter alia, that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdic\n  tion over Kirk’s allegations that were based on information disclosed\n  in a Government “report” or “investigation.” The Second Circuit va\n  cated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency’s response to a\n  FOIA request is neither a “report” nor an “investigation.”\nHeld: A federal agency’s written response to a FOIA request for records\n constitutes a “report” within the meaning of the FCA’s public disclo\n sure bar. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) “[R]eport” in this context carries its ordinary meaning. Pp. 4–8.\n      (1) Because the FCA does not define “report,” the Court looks\n first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Finan\n cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___. Dictionaries define “report” as,\n for example, something that gives information. This ordinary mean\n2         SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                        EX REL. KIRK \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    ing is consistent with the public disclosure bar’s generally broad\n    scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.\n    United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the\n    other sources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially “news\n    media.” Pp. 4–6.\n          (2) Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower defini\n    tion of “report.” The Second Circuit committed the very error this\n    Court reversed in Graham County. In applying the noscitur a sociis\n    canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for “report” was man\n    dated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclo\n    sure listed in the statute—in particular, the reference to “news me\n    dia.” See 559 U. S., at ___. Applying the ordinary meaning of\n    “report” also does not render superfluous the other sources of public\n    disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) The DOL’s three written FOIA responses in this case, along\n    with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are “reports”\n    within the public disclosure bar’s ordinary meaning. FOIA requires\n    each agency receiving a request to “notify the person making such re\n    quest of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C.\n    §552(a)(6)(A)(i). Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted\n    FOIA regulations mandating a written response. Such agency re\n    sponses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of “report”\n    as, e.g., something that gives information. Moreover, any records\n    produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as\n    if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report. Pp. 8–\n    9.\n       (c) This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be\n    anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written\n    FOIA responses. Pp. 9–14.\n          (1) The Court’s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclo\n    sure bar’s drafting history. If anything, the drafting history supports\n    this Court’s holding. Kirk’s case seems a classic example of the “op\n    portunistic” litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to\n    discourage. Id., at ___. Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing\n    and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he dis\n    covers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially\n    reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA. Pp. 9–11.\n          (2) Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA\n    responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences. Kirk argues\n    that the Court’s ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator pos\n    sessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a\n    request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents\n    by way of a FOIA request. Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unre\n    quested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Court is not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms,\n  the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth\n  ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma\n  lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar’s scope\n  and some did not. Moreover, Kirk’s assertion that potential defen\n  dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\n  request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at\n  ___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits\n  that have long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within the\n  public disclosure bar’s meaning. Pp. 11–13.\n       (3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,\n  Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define “report”\n  to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents—e.g.,\n  the Justice Department’s annual report of FOIA statistics—that are\n  indisputably reports. Pp. 13–14.\n     (d) Whether Kirk’s suit is “based upon . . . allegations or transac\n  tions” disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on\n  remand.

This case concerns\nthe FCA’s public disclosure bar, which generally forecloses\nqui tam suits that are “based upon the public disclosure of\nallegations or transactions . . . in a congressional, adminis\ntrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).1\nWe must decide whether a federal agency’s written re\nsponse to a request for records under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.

That Act requires contractors like\nSchindler to report certain information to the Secretary of\nLabor, including how many of its employees are “qualified\ncovered veterans” under the statute.            38 U. S. C.\n§4212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to\nagree in each of its contracts that it would “submit VETS–\n100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.” 48\nCFR §52.222–37(c) (2008); see also §22.1310(b).\n  Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran\nwho served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and\nSchindler from 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk\nresigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as\nSchindler’s efforts to force him out.3\n  In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler\nunder the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties\nand treble damages on persons who submit false or\n——————\n    2 Thefacts in this Part, which we must accept as true, are taken\nfrom the amended complaint and the filings submitted in opposition to\nSchindler’s motion to dismiss.\n  3 Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor’s Office of Fed\n\neral Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), claiming that he had\nbeen “improperly demoted and constructively terminated by Schindler\ndespite his status as a Vietnam era veteran.” App. 23a. The OFCCP\ninvestigated Schindler’s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi\ncient evidence to support Kirk’s claim. In November 2009, the Depart\nment of Labor affirmed the OFCCP’s finding. 601 F. 3d 94, 99 (CA2\n2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The FCA authorizes both civil actions\nby the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to\nenforce its provisions. §3730. When, as here, the Gov\nernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the\nprivate relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of\nthe proceeds of the action. §3730(d)(2).\n   In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al\nleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false\nclaims for payment under its Government contracts.\nAccording to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA’s\nreporting requirements by failing to file certain required\nVETS–100 reports and including false information in\nthose it did file. The company’s claims for payment were\nfalse, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified\nits compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the\namount of damages he sought on behalf of the United\nStates, but he asserted that the value of Schindler’s\nVEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.\n   To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information\nhis wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of\nLabor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.\nKirk had sought all VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler\nfor the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by\nletter or e-mail to each request with information about the\nrecords found for each year, including years for which no\nresponsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.\nKirk that it found no VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler\nin 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,\nthe DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports\nfiled by Schindler, 99 in all.\n   Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,\nincluding that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived\nthe District Court of jurisdiction. See §3730(e)(4)(A). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion, concluding that most of\nKirk’s allegations failed to state a claim and that the\n4        SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

The court effectively held\nthat an agency’s response to a FOIA request is neither a\n“report” nor an “investigation” within the meaning of the\nFCA’s public disclosure bar. See id., at 103–111 (agreeing\nwith United States ex rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare\nWest, 445 F. 3d 1147 (CA9 2006), and disagreeing with\nUnited States ex rel. Mistick PBT v.

C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote\n    omitted).\n   Because the statute does not define “report,” we look\nfirst to the word’s ordinary meaning. See Gross v. FBL\nFinancial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 7) (“Statutory construction must begin with the lan\nguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the\nordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses\nthe legislative purpose” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995) (“When terms used in a statute are undefined, we\ngive them their ordinary meaning”). A “report” is “some\nthing that gives information” or a “notification,” Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or “[a]n\nofficial or formal statement of facts or proceedings,”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990). See also 13\nOxford English Dictionary 650 (2d ed. 1989) (“[a]n account\nbrought by one person to another”); American Heritage\nDictionary 1103 (1981) (“[a]n account or announcement\nthat is prepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal\nor organized form”); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d\ned. 1987) (“an account or statement describing in detail an\nevent, situation, or the like”).\n   This broad ordinary meaning of “report” is consistent\nwith the generally broad scope of the FCA’s public disclo\nsure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the\nmeaning of one word in the public disclosure bar, we must\nconsider the provision’s “entire text,” read as an “inte\ngrated whole.” Graham County Soil and Water Conserva\ntion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\n___, n. 12 (2010) (slip op., at 8, 12, n. 12); see also Tyler v.\nCain, 533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001) (“We do not . . . construe\nthe meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum”). The other\nsources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially\n“news media,” suggest that the public disclosure bar pro\n6      SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                      EX REL. KIRK \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nvides “a broa[d] sweep.” Graham County, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 8). The statute also mentions “administrative\nhearings” twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive\nness even at the risk of redundancy.\n   The phrase “allegations or transactions” in §3730(e)\n(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo\nsure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of\n“allegations” but also “transactions,” a term that courts\nhave recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,\nMoore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U. S. 593, 610\n(1926) (“ ‘Transaction’ is a word of flexible meaning”);\nHamilton v. United Healthcare of La., Inc., 310 F. 3d 385,\n391 (CA5 2002) (“[T]he ordinary meaning of the term\n‘transaction’ is a broad reference to many different types of\nbusiness dealings between parties”).\n                              2\n  Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower\ndefinition of “report.” The Court of Appeals, in holding\nthat FOIA responses were not “reports,” looked to the\nwords “hearing, audit, or investigation,” and the phrase\n“criminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings.” It con\ncluded that all of these sources “connote the synthesis of\ninformation in an investigatory context” to “serve some\nend of the government.” 601 F. 3d, at 107; cf. Brief for\nRespondent 30, n. 15 (“Each is part of the government’s\nongoing effort to fight fraud”). Applying the noscitur a\nsociis canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that\nthese “ ‘neighboring words’ ” mandated a narrower mean\ning for “report” than its ordinary meaning. 601 F. 3d, at\n107.\n  The Court of Appeals committed the very error we re\nversed in Graham County. Like the Fourth Circuit in that\ncase, the Second Circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis\ncanon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the\nexclusion of the rest of the statute.

We emphasized in Graham County that “all of the\nsources [of public disclosure] listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) pro\nvide interpretive guidance.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). When all of the sources are considered, the reference\nto “news media”—which the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider—suggests a much broader scope. Ibid.\n  The Government similarly errs by focusing only on\nthe adjectives “congressional, administrative, or [GAO],”5\nwhich precede “report.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that\nthe public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports\n“analogous to those that Congress and the GAO would\nissue or conduct.” Ibid. As we explained in Graham\nCounty, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing\nmore than that a “report” must be governmental. See 559\nU. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n. 7). The governmental\nnature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.\n  Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of “report” does\nnot render superfluous the other sources of public disclo\nsure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading “report”\nto mean “something that gives information” would sub\nsume the other words in the phrase “report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” Brief for Respondent 23. But\nKirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are\nprocesses “to obtain information.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThose processes are thus clearly different from “something\nthat gives information.” Moreover, the statute contem\nplates some redundancy: An “audit,” for example, will\noften be a type of “investigation.”\n  We are not persuaded that we should adopt a “different,\nsomewhat special meaning” of “report” over the word’s\n\n——————\n  5 Although the statute refers to the “Government Accounting Office,”\nit is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office,\nalso known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability\nOffice.

In Graham\nCounty, we rejected several arguments for construing the\nstatute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole “touch\nstone” in the statutory text is “public disclosure.” 559\nU. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 19). We chose in that case\nsimply to give the text its “most natura[l] read[ing],” id., at\n___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.\n                              B\n   A written agency response to a FOIA request falls\nwithin the ordinary meaning of “report.” FOIA requires\neach agency receiving a request to “notify the person\nmaking such request of [its] determination and the\nreasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an\nagency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi\ntionally “set forth the names and titles or positions of each\nperson responsible for the denial,” “make a reasonable\neffort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,” and\n“provide any such estimate to the person making the\nrequest.” §§552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted\nmore detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man\ndating a response in writing. See 29 CFR §70.21(a) (2009)\n(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request\nand a description of the manner in which records will be\ndisclosed); §§70.21(b)–(c) (requiring a “brief statement of\nthe reason or reasons for [a] denial,” as well as written\nnotification if a record “cannot be located or has been\ndestroyed” (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal\nagencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR §16.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);\n43 CFR §2.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR §1.7 (2010)\n(Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is\n“something that gives information,” a “notification,” and\nan “official or formal statement of facts.”\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Any records the agency produces along with its written\nFOIA response are part of that response, “just as if they\nhad been reproduced as an appendix to a printed report.”\nMistick, 186 F. 3d, at 384, n. 5. Nothing in the public\ndisclosure bar suggests that a document and its attach\nments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.\nIf an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record\nattached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed “in” that FOIA\nresponse and, therefore, disclosed “in” a report for the\npurposes of the public disclosure bar.6\n   The DOL’s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk,\nalong with their attached records, are thus reports within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response\nwas an “official or formal statement” that “[gave] informa\ntion” and “notif[ied]” Mrs. Kirk of the agency’s resolution\nof her FOIA request.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   In interpreting a statute, “[o]ur inquiry must cease if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous,” as we have\nfound, and “ ‘the statutory scheme is coherent and consis\ntent.’ ” Robinson v.

We are not persuaded by asser\ntions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclo\nsure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.\n                             1\n  The drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not\ncontradict our holding.

Accordingly, this Court upheld the recovery of a\nrelator, even though the Government claimed that he had\ndiscovered the basis for his lawsuit by reading a federal\ncriminal indictment. See United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943).         In response, Congress\namended the statute to preclude such “parasitic” qui tam\nactions based on “evidence or information in the posses\nsion of the United States . . . at the time such suit was\nbrought.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Then, in 1986, Congress re\nplaced the so-called Government knowledge bar with the\nnarrower public disclosure bar. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that it would be incon\nsistent with this drafting history to hold that written\nFOIA responses are reports. The court reasoned that\ndoing so would “essentially resurrect, in a significant\nsubset of cases, the government possession standard . . .\nrepudiated in 1986.” 601 F. 3d, at 109.\n  We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion. As a\nthreshold matter, “the drafting history of the public disclo\nsure bar raises more questions than it answers.” Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). In any event, it is\nhardly inconsistent with the drafting history to read the\npublic disclosure bar as operating similarly to the Gov\nernment knowledge bar in a “subset of cases.” 601 F. 3d,\nat 109. As we have observed, “[r]ather than simply repeal\nthe Government knowledge bar,” the public disclosure bar\nwas “an effort to strike a balance between encouraging\nprivate persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic\nlawsuits.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (emphasis\nadded).\n  If anything, the drafting history supports our holding.\nThe sort of case that Kirk has brought seems to us a clas\nsic example of the “opportunistic” litigation that the public\ndisclosure bar is designed to discourage.

Although Kirk alleges that he\nbecame suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran\nworking at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same\nFOIA requests and then filed the same suit. Similarly,\nanyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certifica\ntion requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discov\ners a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and\npotentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the\nFCA. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America et al. as Amici Curiae 20 (“Government\ncontractors . . . are required to submit certifications re\nlated to everything from how they dispose of hazardous\nmaterials to their affirmative action plans” (citing 40\nU.

C. §793)).7\n                             2\n  Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written\nFOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.\nFOIA requires agencies to release some records even\nabsent a request. See 5 U. S. C. §§552(a)(1), (2). Kirk\nargues that it would be strange that two relators could\nobtain copies of the same document but that only the\nrelator who got the document in response to a FOIA re\nquest would find his case barred.\n  This argument assumes that records released under\nFOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not\nfall within the public disclosure bar. We do not decide\nthat question.

By its plain\nterms, the public disclosure bar applies to some meth-\nods of public disclosure and not to others. See Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (“[T]he FCA’s public\ndisclosure bar . . . deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui\ntam suits when the relevant information has already\nentered the public domain through certain channels”\n(emphasis added)). It would not be anomalous if some\nmethods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the\npublic disclosure bar and some did not.\n  We also are not concerned that potential defendants will\nnow insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\nrequest for incriminating documents. This argument\nassumes that the public disclosure of information in a\nwritten FOIA response forever taints that information for\npurposes of the public disclosure bar. But it may be that a\nrelator who comes by that information from a different\nsource has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not\n“based upon” the initial public disclosure. 31 U. S. C.\n§3730(e)(4)(A). That question has divided the Courts of\nAppeals, and we do not resolve it here. See Glaser v.\nWound Care Consultants, Inc., 570 F. 3d 907, 915 (CA7\n2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also\nbe that such a relator qualifies for the “original source”\nexception.8\n  In any event, the notion that potential defendants will\nmake FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability\n——————\n   8 An “original source” is “an individual who has direct and independ\n\nent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based\nand has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before\nfiling an action under this section which is based on the information.”\n§3730(e)(4)(B). Some Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed the\nexception to limit “original sources” to those who were the cause of the\npublic disclosure, while others have been more generous. See United\nStates ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L. P., 579 F. 3d 13, 22\n(CA1 2009) (describing a three-way split among the Courts of Appeals).\nThat question is not before us, and we do not decide it.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S., at ___\n(slip op., at 19) (rejecting as “strained speculation” an\nargument that local governments will manipulate the\npublic disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no\nsuggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that\nhave long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar.\n                              B\n    Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk\nand his amici have provided no principled way to define\n“report” to exclude FOIA responses without excluding\nother documents that are indisputably reports. The Gov\nernment, for example, struggled to settle on a single defi\nnition. Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19 (“report” must be read to “reflect a focus on situations\nin which the government is conducting, or has completed,\nsome focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant\nfacts”) with id., at 21 (“A FOIA response is not a ‘report’\n. . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncov\nering the truth of any matter”), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\n(“[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency\n. . . is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a sub\nstantive analysis of information”). It is difficult to see how\nthe Department of Justice’s “Annual Report” of FOIA\nstatistics—something that is indisputably a Government\nreport—would qualify under the latter two definitions.\nSee Dept. of Justice, Freedom of Information Act An-\nnual Report, Fiscal Year 2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/\nannual_report/2010/cover.htm (as visited May 12, 2011,\nand available in Clerk of Court’s case file); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual report\nis a report). And even if the first definition arguably\nencompasses that report, it would seem also to include\nFOIA responses, which convey the results of a Govern\nment agency’s “focused inquiry.”\n14     SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

Similarly, government ‘hear\n    ing[s and] audit[s]’ are processes by which information\n    is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a\n    government entity’s knowledge of a given subject or,\n    often, determining whether a party is in compliance\n    with applicable law. . . .\n       “In this context, the term ‘report’ most readily bears\n    a narrower meaning than simply ‘something that\n    gives information.’ Rather, it connotes the compila\n    tion or analysis of information with the aim of synthe\n    sizing that information in order to serve some end of\n    the government, as in a ‘hearing’ or ‘audit.’ It does\n    not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic produc\n    tion of documents in response to a FOIA request made\n    by a member of the public.” 601 F. 3d 94, 107 (2010)\n    (citations omitted).\nFocusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of\nAppeals observed that DOL’s responses did not “synthe\nsize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Argued March 1, 2011—Decided May 16, 2011\nThe public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally fore\n  closes private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or\n  fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are “based\n  upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,\n  civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or\n  Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investiga\n  tion, or from the news media.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Respon\n  dent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, pe\n  titioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false\n  claims for payment under its federal contracts. To support his alle\n  gations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor\n  Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed\n  under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. §552.\n  Granting Schindler’s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded,\n  inter alia, that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdic\n  tion over Kirk’s allegations that were based on information disclosed\n  in a Government “report” or “investigation.” The Second Circuit va\n  cated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency’s response to a\n  FOIA request is neither a “report” nor an “investigation.”\nHeld: A federal agency’s written response to a FOIA request for records\n constitutes a “report” within the meaning of the FCA’s public disclo\n sure bar.

Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the\n    other sources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially “news\n    media.” Pp. 4–6.\n          (2) Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower defini\n    tion of “report.” The Second Circuit committed the very error this\n    Court reversed in Graham County. In applying the noscitur a sociis\n    canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for “report” was man\n    dated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclo\n    sure listed in the statute—in particular, the reference to “news me\n    dia.” See 559 U. S., at ___. Applying the ordinary meaning of\n    “report” also does not render superfluous the other sources of public\n    disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Pp. 6–8.\n       (b) The DOL’s three written FOIA responses in this case, along\n    with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are “reports”\n    within the public disclosure bar’s ordinary meaning. FOIA requires\n    each agency receiving a request to “notify the person making such re\n    quest of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C.\n    §552(a)(6)(A)(i). Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted\n    FOIA regulations mandating a written response. Such agency re\n    sponses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of “report”\n    as, e.g., something that gives information. Moreover, any records\n    produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as\n    if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report. Pp. 8–\n    9.\n       (c) This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be\n    anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written\n    FOIA responses. Pp. 9–14.\n          (1) The Court’s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclo\n    sure bar’s drafting history. If anything, the drafting history supports\n    this Court’s holding. Kirk’s case seems a classic example of the “op\n    portunistic” litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to\n    discourage. Id., at ___. Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing\n    and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he dis\n    covers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially\n    reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA. Pp. 9–11.\n          (2) Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA\n    responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences. Kirk argues\n    that the Court’s ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator pos\n    sessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a\n    request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents\n    by way of a FOIA request. Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unre\n    quested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

By its plain terms,\n  the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth\n  ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma\n  lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar’s scope\n  and some did not. Moreover, Kirk’s assertion that potential defen\n  dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\n  request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at\n  ___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits\n  that have long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within the\n  public disclosure bar’s meaning. Pp. 11–13.\n       (3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,\n  Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define “report”\n  to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents—e.g.,\n  the Justice Department’s annual report of FOIA statistics—that are\n  indisputably reports. Pp. 13–14.\n     (d) Whether Kirk’s suit is “based upon . . . allegations or transac\n  tions” disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on\n  remand.

This case concerns\nthe FCA’s public disclosure bar, which generally forecloses\nqui tam suits that are “based upon the public disclosure of\nallegations or transactions . . . in a congressional, adminis\ntrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).1\nWe must decide whether a federal agency’s written re\nsponse to a request for records under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.

That Act requires contractors like\nSchindler to report certain information to the Secretary of\nLabor, including how many of its employees are “qualified\ncovered veterans” under the statute.            38 U. S. C.\n§4212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to\nagree in each of its contracts that it would “submit VETS–\n100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.” 48\nCFR §52.222–37(c) (2008); see also §22.1310(b).\n  Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran\nwho served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and\nSchindler from 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk\nresigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as\nSchindler’s efforts to force him out.3\n  In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler\nunder the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties\nand treble damages on persons who submit false or\n——————\n    2 Thefacts in this Part, which we must accept as true, are taken\nfrom the amended complaint and the filings submitted in opposition to\nSchindler’s motion to dismiss.\n  3 Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor’s Office of Fed\n\neral Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), claiming that he had\nbeen “improperly demoted and constructively terminated by Schindler\ndespite his status as a Vietnam era veteran.” App. 23a. The OFCCP\ninvestigated Schindler’s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi\ncient evidence to support Kirk’s claim. In November 2009, the Depart\nment of Labor affirmed the OFCCP’s finding. 601 F. 3d 94, 99 (CA2\n2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The FCA authorizes both civil actions\nby the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to\nenforce its provisions. §3730. When, as here, the Gov\nernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the\nprivate relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of\nthe proceeds of the action. §3730(d)(2).\n   In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al\nleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false\nclaims for payment under its Government contracts.\nAccording to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA’s\nreporting requirements by failing to file certain required\nVETS–100 reports and including false information in\nthose it did file. The company’s claims for payment were\nfalse, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified\nits compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the\namount of damages he sought on behalf of the United\nStates, but he asserted that the value of Schindler’s\nVEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.\n   To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information\nhis wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of\nLabor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.\nKirk had sought all VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler\nfor the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by\nletter or e-mail to each request with information about the\nrecords found for each year, including years for which no\nresponsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.\nKirk that it found no VETS–100 reports filed by Schindler\nin 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,\nthe DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports\nfiled by Schindler, 99 in all.\n   Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,\nincluding that the FCA’s public disclosure bar deprived\nthe District Court of jurisdiction. See §3730(e)(4)(A). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion, concluding that most of\nKirk’s allegations failed to state a claim and that the\n4        SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

Supp. 2d 448 (SDNY 2009).\n  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated and\nremanded. 601 F. 3d 94 (2010). The court effectively held\nthat an agency’s response to a FOIA request is neither a\n“report” nor an “investigation” within the meaning of the\nFCA’s public disclosure bar. See id., at 103–111 (agreeing\nwith United States ex rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare\nWest, 445 F. 3d 1147 (CA9 2006), and disagreeing with\nUnited States ex rel. Mistick PBT v.

C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote\n    omitted).\n   Because the statute does not define “report,” we look\nfirst to the word’s ordinary meaning. See Gross v. FBL\nFinancial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 7) (“Statutory construction must begin with the lan\nguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the\nordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses\nthe legislative purpose” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995) (“When terms used in a statute are undefined, we\ngive them their ordinary meaning”). A “report” is “some\nthing that gives information” or a “notification,” Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or “[a]n\nofficial or formal statement of facts or proceedings,”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990). See also 13\nOxford English Dictionary 650 (2d ed. 1989) (“[a]n account\nbrought by one person to another”); American Heritage\nDictionary 1103 (1981) (“[a]n account or announcement\nthat is prepared, presented, or delivered, usually in formal\nor organized form”); Random House Dictionary 1634 (2d\ned. 1987) (“an account or statement describing in detail an\nevent, situation, or the like”).\n   This broad ordinary meaning of “report” is consistent\nwith the generally broad scope of the FCA’s public disclo\nsure bar. As we explained last Term, to determine the\nmeaning of one word in the public disclosure bar, we must\nconsider the provision’s “entire text,” read as an “inte\ngrated whole.” Graham County Soil and Water Conserva\ntion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\n___, n. 12 (2010) (slip op., at 8, 12, n. 12); see also Tyler v.\nCain, 533 U. S. 656, 662 (2001) (“We do not . . . construe\nthe meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum”). The other\nsources of public disclosure in §3730(e)(4)(A), especially\n“news media,” suggest that the public disclosure bar pro\n6      SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                      EX REL. KIRK \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nvides “a broa[d] sweep.” Graham County, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 8). The statute also mentions “administrative\nhearings” twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive\nness even at the risk of redundancy.\n   The phrase “allegations or transactions” in §3730(e)\n(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo\nsure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of\n“allegations” but also “transactions,” a term that courts\nhave recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,\nMoore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U. S. 593, 610\n(1926) (“ ‘Transaction’ is a word of flexible meaning”);\nHamilton v. United Healthcare of La., Inc., 310 F. 3d 385,\n391 (CA5 2002) (“[T]he ordinary meaning of the term\n‘transaction’ is a broad reference to many different types of\nbusiness dealings between parties”).\n                              2\n  Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower\ndefinition of “report.” The Court of Appeals, in holding\nthat FOIA responses were not “reports,” looked to the\nwords “hearing, audit, or investigation,” and the phrase\n“criminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings.” It con\ncluded that all of these sources “connote the synthesis of\ninformation in an investigatory context” to “serve some\nend of the government.” 601 F. 3d, at 107; cf. Brief for\nRespondent 30, n. 15 (“Each is part of the government’s\nongoing effort to fight fraud”). Applying the noscitur a\nsociis canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that\nthese “ ‘neighboring words’ ” mandated a narrower mean\ning for “report” than its ordinary meaning. 601 F. 3d, at\n107.\n  The Court of Appeals committed the very error we re\nversed in Graham County. Like the Fourth Circuit in that\ncase, the Second Circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis\ncanon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the\nexclusion of the rest of the statute. See 601 F. 3d, at 107,\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nn. 6. We emphasized in Graham County that “all of the\nsources [of public disclosure] listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) pro\nvide interpretive guidance.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). When all of the sources are considered, the reference\nto “news media”—which the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider—suggests a much broader scope. Ibid.\n  The Government similarly errs by focusing only on\nthe adjectives “congressional, administrative, or [GAO],”5\nwhich precede “report.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that\nthe public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports\n“analogous to those that Congress and the GAO would\nissue or conduct.” Ibid. As we explained in Graham\nCounty, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing\nmore than that a “report” must be governmental. See 559\nU. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n. 7). The governmental\nnature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.\n  Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of “report” does\nnot render superfluous the other sources of public disclo\nsure in §3730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading “report”\nto mean “something that gives information” would sub\nsume the other words in the phrase “report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” Brief for Respondent 23. But\nKirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are\nprocesses “to obtain information.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThose processes are thus clearly different from “something\nthat gives information.” Moreover, the statute contem\nplates some redundancy: An “audit,” for example, will\noften be a type of “investigation.”\n  We are not persuaded that we should adopt a “different,\nsomewhat special meaning” of “report” over the word’s\n\n——————\n  5 Although the statute refers to the “Government Accounting Office,”\nit is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office,\nalso known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability\nOffice.

Indeed, we have cautioned recently\nagainst interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way\ninconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In Graham\nCounty, we rejected several arguments for construing the\nstatute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole “touch\nstone” in the statutory text is “public disclosure.” 559\nU. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 19). We chose in that case\nsimply to give the text its “most natura[l] read[ing],” id., at\n___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.\n                              B\n   A written agency response to a FOIA request falls\nwithin the ordinary meaning of “report.” FOIA requires\neach agency receiving a request to “notify the person\nmaking such request of [its] determination and the\nreasons therefor.” 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an\nagency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi\ntionally “set forth the names and titles or positions of each\nperson responsible for the denial,” “make a reasonable\neffort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,” and\n“provide any such estimate to the person making the\nrequest.” §§552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted\nmore detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man\ndating a response in writing. See 29 CFR §70.21(a) (2009)\n(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request\nand a description of the manner in which records will be\ndisclosed); §§70.21(b)–(c) (requiring a “brief statement of\nthe reason or reasons for [a] denial,” as well as written\nnotification if a record “cannot be located or has been\ndestroyed” (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal\nagencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR §16.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);\n43 CFR §2.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR §1.7 (2010)\n(Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is\n“something that gives information,” a “notification,” and\nan “official or formal statement of facts.”\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Nothing in the public\ndisclosure bar suggests that a document and its attach\nments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.\nIf an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record\nattached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed “in” that FOIA\nresponse and, therefore, disclosed “in” a report for the\npurposes of the public disclosure bar.6\n   The DOL’s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk,\nalong with their attached records, are thus reports within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response\nwas an “official or formal statement” that “[gave] informa\ntion” and “notif[ied]” Mrs. Kirk of the agency’s resolution\nof her FOIA request.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   In interpreting a statute, “[o]ur inquiry must cease if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous,” as we have\nfound, and “ ‘the statutory scheme is coherent and consis\ntent.’ ” Robinson v.

See United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943).         In response, Congress\namended the statute to preclude such “parasitic” qui tam\nactions based on “evidence or information in the posses\nsion of the United States . . . at the time such suit was\nbrought.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Then, in 1986, Congress re\nplaced the so-called Government knowledge bar with the\nnarrower public disclosure bar. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that it would be incon\nsistent with this drafting history to hold that written\nFOIA responses are reports. The court reasoned that\ndoing so would “essentially resurrect, in a significant\nsubset of cases, the government possession standard . . .\nrepudiated in 1986.” 601 F. 3d, at 109.\n  We disagree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion. As a\nthreshold matter, “the drafting history of the public disclo\nsure bar raises more questions than it answers.” Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). In any event, it is\nhardly inconsistent with the drafting history to read the\npublic disclosure bar as operating similarly to the Gov\nernment knowledge bar in a “subset of cases.” 601 F. 3d,\nat 109. As we have observed, “[r]ather than simply repeal\nthe Government knowledge bar,” the public disclosure bar\nwas “an effort to strike a balance between encouraging\nprivate persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic\nlawsuits.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (emphasis\nadded).\n  If anything, the drafting history supports our holding.\nThe sort of case that Kirk has brought seems to us a clas\nsic example of the “opportunistic” litigation that the public\ndisclosure bar is designed to discourage.

Although Kirk alleges that he\nbecame suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran\nworking at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same\nFOIA requests and then filed the same suit. Similarly,\nanyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certifica\ntion requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discov\ners a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and\npotentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the\nFCA. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America et al. as Amici Curiae 20 (“Government\ncontractors . . . are required to submit certifications re\nlated to everything from how they dispose of hazardous\nmaterials to their affirmative action plans” (citing 40\nU.

C. §793)).7\n                             2\n  Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written\nFOIA responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences.\nFOIA requires agencies to release some records even\nabsent a request. See 5 U. S. C. §§552(a)(1), (2). Kirk\nargues that it would be strange that two relators could\nobtain copies of the same document but that only the\nrelator who got the document in response to a FOIA re\nquest would find his case barred.\n  This argument assumes that records released under\nFOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not\nfall within the public disclosure bar. We do not decide\nthat question. But even assuming, as Kirk does, that such\nrecords are not covered by the public disclosure bar, we\n\n——————\n  7 There is no merit to the suggestion that the public disclosure bar is\n\nintended only to exclude qui tam suits that “ride the investigatory\ncoattails of the government’s own processes.” Brief for Taxpayers\nAgainst Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 25, 26; see Graham\nCounty, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (rejecting the argument that\nthe public disclosure bar applies only to allegations or transactions that\n“have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer”).\n12      SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

By its plain\nterms, the public disclosure bar applies to some meth-\nods of public disclosure and not to others. See Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (“[T]he FCA’s public\ndisclosure bar . . . deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui\ntam suits when the relevant information has already\nentered the public domain through certain channels”\n(emphasis added)). It would not be anomalous if some\nmethods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the\npublic disclosure bar and some did not.\n  We also are not concerned that potential defendants will\nnow insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\nrequest for incriminating documents. This argument\nassumes that the public disclosure of information in a\nwritten FOIA response forever taints that information for\npurposes of the public disclosure bar. But it may be that a\nrelator who comes by that information from a different\nsource has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not\n“based upon” the initial public disclosure. 31 U. S. C.\n§3730(e)(4)(A). That question has divided the Courts of\nAppeals, and we do not resolve it here. See Glaser v.\nWound Care Consultants, Inc., 570 F. 3d 907, 915 (CA7\n2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also\nbe that such a relator qualifies for the “original source”\nexception.8\n  In any event, the notion that potential defendants will\nmake FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability\n——————\n   8 An “original source” is “an individual who has direct and independ\n\nent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based\nand has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before\nfiling an action under this section which is based on the information.”\n§3730(e)(4)(B). Some Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed the\nexception to limit “original sources” to those who were the cause of the\npublic disclosure, while others have been more generous. See United\nStates ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L. P., 579 F. 3d 13, 22\n(CA1 2009) (describing a three-way split among the Courts of Appeals).\nThat question is not before us, and we do not decide it.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nis pure speculation. Cf. Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 19) (rejecting as “strained speculation” an\nargument that local governments will manipulate the\npublic disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no\nsuggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that\nhave long held that FOIA responses are “reports” within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar.\n                              B\n    Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk\nand his amici have provided no principled way to define\n“report” to exclude FOIA responses without excluding\nother documents that are indisputably reports. The Gov\nernment, for example, struggled to settle on a single defi\nnition. Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19 (“report” must be read to “reflect a focus on situations\nin which the government is conducting, or has completed,\nsome focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant\nfacts”) with id., at 21 (“A FOIA response is not a ‘report’\n. . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncov\nering the truth of any matter”), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\n(“[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency\n. . . is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a sub\nstantive analysis of information”). It is difficult to see how\nthe Department of Justice’s “Annual Report” of FOIA\nstatistics—something that is indisputably a Government\nreport—would qualify under the latter two definitions.\nSee Dept. of Justice, Freedom of Information Act An-\nnual Report, Fiscal Year 2010, http://www.justice.gov/oip/\nannual_report/2010/cover.htm (as visited May 12, 2011,\nand available in Clerk of Court’s case file); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 19 (Kirk conceding that the DOJ annual report\nis a report). And even if the first definition arguably\nencompasses that report, it would seem also to include\nFOIA responses, which convey the results of a Govern\nment agency’s “focused inquiry.”\n14     SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

Kirk’s first suggestion\nwould exclude “a lot of things that are labeled . . . report,”\nid., at 22, and the second—the definition advanced by the\nCourt of Appeals—would seem to include written FOIA\nresponses, id., at 28–29. In the end, it appears that the\n“only argument is that FOIA is a different kind of mis\nsion”—“a special case.” Id., at 31.

The DOL responses re\nvealed that, in some years, Schindler filed no information,\nwhile in some other years, the corporation filed false in\nformation.

I would affirm the Second Circuit’s\njudgment as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and\nhistory of the FCA’s public disclosure bar.\n  The Court finds no “textual basis” for the Second Cir\ncuit’s interpretation of the statutory language. Ante, at 6.\nBut the Court of Appeals’ opinion considered text as well\nas context. Leaving aside the term “report,” the court\nexplained:\n    “All of the other terms in [§3730(e)(4)(A)’s] list of\n    enumerated sources connote the synthesis of informa\n    tion in an investigatory context. ‘[C]riminal, civil,\n    [and] administrative hearings,’ for instance, all entail\n    a government inquiry into a given subject, here into\n    an alleged case of fraud. Similarly, government ‘hear\n    ing[s and] audit[s]’ are processes by which information\n    is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a\n    government entity’s knowledge of a given subject or,\n    often, determining whether a party is in compliance\n    with applicable law. . . .\n       “In this context, the term ‘report’ most readily bears\n    a narrower meaning than simply ‘something that\n    gives information.’ Rather, it connotes the compila\n    tion or analysis of information with the aim of synthe\n    sizing that information in order to serve some end of\n    the government, as in a ‘hearing’ or ‘audit.’ It does\n    not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic produc\n    tion of documents in response to a FOIA request made\n    by a member of the public.” 601 F. 3d 94, 107 (2010)\n    (citations omitted).\nFocusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of\nAppeals observed that DOL’s responses did not “synthe\nsize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

United\nStates ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)],” ante, at 6; the\nCourt of Appeals used the noscitur a sociis canon only “as\na guide in sifting through the common understandings of\n‘report’ and ‘investigation’ to discover their intended\nmeaning within the FCA.” 601 F. 3d, at 108, n. 6. The\ncourt explained:\n    “We . . . have not used the canon to impose commonal\n    ity on terms that ‘do not share any . . . core of mean\n    ing,’ Graham County, [559 U.

To the contrary, the terms ‘hearing,’ ‘re\n    port,’ ‘audit,’ and ‘investigation’ all refer to processes\n    of uncovering and analyzing information or to the\n    products of those processes. Our interpretation fo\n    cuses on their shared ‘core of meaning.’ ” Ibid.\n   The Court faults the Court of Appeals for not consider\ning §3730(e)(4)(A)’s “reference to ‘news media,’ ” ante, at 7,\nsuggesting that this omission overlooked Graham County’s\nobservation that “all of the sources [of public disclosure]\nlisted in §3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.”\n559 U.

The facts also\n    illustrate how an overbroad reading of the jurisdic\n    tional bar would prevent an individual with inde\n    pendent but partial knowledge of a possible fraud\n    would be barred from bringing a lawsuit that is nei\n    ther parasitic nor frivolous.” 601 F. 3d, at 110 (cita\n    tion omitted).\n   By ranking DOL’s ministerial response an “administra\ntive . . . report,” akin to a “Government Accounting Office\nreport,” §3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted), the Court weak\nens the force of the FCA as a weapon against fraud on\nthe part of Government contractors.
