UNITED STATES EX\n                REL. KIRK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013188.      Argued March 1, 2011\u2014Decided May 16, 2011\nThe public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally fore\n  closes private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or\n  fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are \u201cbased\n  upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,\n  civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or\n  Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investiga\n  tion, or from the news media.\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Respon\n  dent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, pe\n  titioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false\n  claims for payment under its federal contracts. To support his alle\n  gations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor\n  Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed\n  under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552.\n  Granting Schindler\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded,\n  inter alia, that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdic\n  tion over Kirk\u2019s allegations that were based on information disclosed\n  in a Government \u201creport\u201d or \u201cinvestigation.\u201d The Second Circuit va\n  cated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency\u2019s response to a\n  FOIA request is neither a \u201creport\u201d nor an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\nHeld: A federal agency\u2019s written response to a FOIA request for records\n constitutes a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of the FCA\u2019s public disclo\n sure bar. Pp. 4\u201314.\n    (a) \u201c[R]eport\u201d in this context carries its ordinary meaning. Pp. 4\u20138.\n      (1) Because the FCA does not define \u201creport,\u201d the Court looks\n first to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Finan\n cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___. Dictionaries define \u201creport\u201d as,\n for example, something that gives information. This ordinary mean\n2         SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                        EX REL. KIRK \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    ing is consistent with the public disclosure bar\u2019s generally broad\n    scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.\n    United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the\n    other sources of public disclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), especially \u201cnews\n    media.\u201d Pp. 4\u20136.\n          (2) Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower defini\n    tion of \u201creport.\u201d The Second Circuit committed the very error this\n    Court reversed in Graham County. In applying the noscitur a sociis\n    canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for \u201creport\u201d was man\n    dated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclo\n    sure listed in the statute\u2014in particular, the reference to \u201cnews me\n    dia.\u201d See 559 U. S., at ___. Applying the ordinary meaning of\n    \u201creport\u201d also does not render superfluous the other sources of public\n    disclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses in this case, along\n    with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are \u201creports\u201d\n    within the public disclosure bar\u2019s ordinary meaning. FOIA requires\n    each agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person making such re\n    quest of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7552(a)(6)(A)(i). Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted\n    FOIA regulations mandating a written response. Such agency re\n    sponses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d\n    as, e.g., something that gives information. Moreover, any records\n    produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as\n    if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report. Pp. 8\u2013\n    9.\n       (c) This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be\n    anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written\n    FOIA responses. Pp. 9\u201314.\n          (1) The Court\u2019s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclo\n    sure bar\u2019s drafting history. If anything, the drafting history supports\n    this Court\u2019s holding. Kirk\u2019s case seems a classic example of the \u201cop\n    portunistic\u201d litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to\n    discourage. Id., at ___. Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing\n    and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he dis\n    covers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially\n    reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA. Pp. 9\u201311.\n          (2) Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA\n    responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences. Kirk argues\n    that the Court\u2019s ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator pos\n    sessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a\n    request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents\n    by way of a FOIA request. Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unre\n    quested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Court is not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms,\n  the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth\n  ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma\n  lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar\u2019s scope\n  and some did not. Moreover, Kirk\u2019s assertion that potential defen\n  dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\n  request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at\n  ___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits\n  that have long held that FOIA responses are \u201creports\u201d within the\n  public disclosure bar\u2019s meaning. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,\n  Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define \u201creport\u201d\n  to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents\u2014e.g.,\n  the Justice Department\u2019s annual report of FOIA statistics\u2014that are\n  indisputably reports. Pp. 13\u201314.\n     (d) Whether Kirk\u2019s suit is \u201cbased upon . . . allegations or transac\n  tions\u201d disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on\n  remand. P. 14.\n601 F. 3d 94, reversed and remanded.\n\n  THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC. J., and SCALIA, KENNEDY, and ALITO, JJ., joined.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a73729\u20133733,\nprohibits submitting false or fraudulent claims for pay\nment to the United States, \u00a73729(a), and authorizes qui\ntam suits, in which private parties bring civil actions in\nthe Government\u2019s name, \u00a73730(b)(1). This case concerns\nthe FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar, which generally forecloses\nqui tam suits that are \u201cbased upon the public disclosure of\nallegations or transactions . . . in a congressional, adminis\ntrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).1\nWe must decide whether a federal agency\u2019s written re\nsponse to a request for records under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.

UNITED STATES \n\n                           EX REL. KIRK \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\nWe hold that it does.\n                               I\n  Petitioner Schindler Elevator Corporation manufac\ntures, installs, and services elevators and escalators.2 In\n1989, Schindler acquired Millar Elevator Industries, Inc.,\nand the two companies merged in 2002.\n  Since 1999, Schindler and the United States have en\ntered into hundreds of contracts that are subject to the\nVietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act of\n1972 (VEVRAA). That Act requires contractors like\nSchindler to report certain information to the Secretary of\nLabor, including how many of its employees are \u201cqualified\ncovered veterans\u201d under the statute.            38 U. S. C.\n\u00a74212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to\nagree in each of its contracts that it would \u201csubmit VETS\u2013\n100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.\u201d 48\nCFR \u00a752.222\u201337(c) (2008); see also \u00a722.1310(b).\n  Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran\nwho served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and\nSchindler from 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk\nresigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as\nSchindler\u2019s efforts to force him out.3\n  In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler\nunder the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties\nand treble damages on persons who submit false or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thefacts in this Part, which we must accept as true, are taken\nfrom the amended complaint and the filings submitted in opposition to\nSchindler\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n  3 Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Fed\n\neral Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), claiming that he had\nbeen \u201cimproperly demoted and constructively terminated by Schindler\ndespite his status as a Vietnam era veteran.\u201d App. 23a. The OFCCP\ninvestigated Schindler\u2019s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi\ncient evidence to support Kirk\u2019s claim. In November 2009, the Depart\nment of Labor affirmed the OFCCP\u2019s finding. 601 F. 3d 94, 99 (CA2\n2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfraudulent claims for payment to the United States. 31\nU. S. C. \u00a73729(a). The FCA authorizes both civil actions\nby the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to\nenforce its provisions. \u00a73730. When, as here, the Gov\nernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the\nprivate relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of\nthe proceeds of the action. \u00a73730(d)(2).\n   In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al\nleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false\nclaims for payment under its Government contracts.\nAccording to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA\u2019s\nreporting requirements by failing to file certain required\nVETS\u2013100 reports and including false information in\nthose it did file. The company\u2019s claims for payment were\nfalse, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified\nits compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the\namount of damages he sought on behalf of the United\nStates, but he asserted that the value of Schindler\u2019s\nVEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.\n   To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information\nhis wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of\nLabor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.\nKirk had sought all VETS\u2013100 reports filed by Schindler\nfor the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by\nletter or e-mail to each request with information about the\nrecords found for each year, including years for which no\nresponsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.\nKirk that it found no VETS\u2013100 reports filed by Schindler\nin 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,\nthe DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports\nfiled by Schindler, 99 in all.\n   Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,\nincluding that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived\nthe District Court of jurisdiction. See \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion, concluding that most of\nKirk\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim and that the\n4        SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                        EX REL.

Supp. 2d 448 (SDNY 2009).\n  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated and\nremanded. 601 F. 3d 94 (2010). The court effectively held\nthat an agency\u2019s response to a FOIA request is neither a\n\u201creport\u201d nor an \u201cinvestigation\u201d within the meaning of the\nFCA\u2019s public disclosure bar. See id., at 103\u2013111 (agreeing\nwith United States ex rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare\nWest, 445 F. 3d 1147 (CA9 2006), and disagreeing with\nUnited States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Housing Auth. of\nPittsburgh, 186 F. 3d 376 (CA3 1999)). We granted certio\nrari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and now reverse and remand.\n                            II\n  Schindler argues that \u201creport\u201d in the FCA\u2019s public dis\nclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the\nDOL\u2019s written responses to Mrs. Kirk\u2019s FOIA requests are\ntherefore \u201creports.\u201d We agree.4\n                         A\n                         1\n  Adopted in 1986, the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar pro\nvides:\n       \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or adminis\n       trative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or\n       Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit,\n       or investigation, or from the news media, unless the\n       action is brought by the Attorney General or the\n       person bringing the action is an original source of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 Becausewe conclude that a written response to a FOIA request\nqualifies as a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of the public disclosure bar,\nwe need not address whether an agency\u2019s search in response to a FOIA\nrequest also qualifies as an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote\n    omitted).\n   Because the statute does not define \u201creport,\u201d we look\nfirst to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. See Gross v. FBL\nFinancial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 7) (\u201cStatutory construction must begin with the lan\nguage employed by Congress and the assumption that the\nordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses\nthe legislative purpose\u201d (internal quotation marks omit\nted)); Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995) (\u201cWhen terms used in a statute are undefined, we\ngive them their ordinary meaning\u201d). A \u201creport\u201d is \u201csome\nthing that gives information\u201d or a \u201cnotification,\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or \u201c[a]n\nofficial or formal statement of facts or proceedings,\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990).

As we explained last Term, to determine the\nmeaning of one word in the public disclosure bar, we must\nconsider the provision\u2019s \u201centire text,\u201d read as an \u201cinte\ngrated whole.\u201d Graham County Soil and Water Conserva\ntion Dist. v.

The statute also mentions \u201cadministrative\nhearings\u201d twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive\nness even at the risk of redundancy.\n   The phrase \u201callegations or transactions\u201d in \u00a73730(e)\n(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo\nsure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of\n\u201callegations\u201d but also \u201ctransactions,\u201d a term that courts\nhave recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,\nMoore v. New York Cotton Exchange, 270 U. S. 593, 610\n(1926) (\u201c \u2018Transaction\u2019 is a word of flexible meaning\u201d);\nHamilton v. United Healthcare of La., Inc., 310 F. 3d 385,\n391 (CA5 2002) (\u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of the term\n\u2018transaction\u2019 is a broad reference to many different types of\nbusiness dealings between parties\u201d).\n                              2\n  Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower\ndefinition of \u201creport.\u201d The Court of Appeals, in holding\nthat FOIA responses were not \u201creports,\u201d looked to the\nwords \u201chearing, audit, or investigation,\u201d and the phrase\n\u201ccriminal, civil, [and] administrative hearings.\u201d It con\ncluded that all of these sources \u201cconnote the synthesis of\ninformation in an investigatory context\u201d to \u201cserve some\nend of the government.\u201d 601 F. 3d, at 107; cf. Brief for\nRespondent 30, n. 15 (\u201cEach is part of the government\u2019s\nongoing effort to fight fraud\u201d). Applying the noscitur a\nsociis canon, the Court of Appeals then determined that\nthese \u201c \u2018neighboring words\u2019 \u201d mandated a narrower mean\ning for \u201creport\u201d than its ordinary meaning. 601 F. 3d, at\n107.\n  The Court of Appeals committed the very error we re\nversed in Graham County. Like the Fourth Circuit in that\ncase, the Second Circuit here applied the noscitur a sociis\ncanon only to the immediately surrounding words, to the\nexclusion of the rest of the statute.

We emphasized in Graham County that \u201call of the\nsources [of public disclosure] listed in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) pro\nvide interpretive guidance.\u201d 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). When all of the sources are considered, the reference\nto \u201cnews media\u201d\u2014which the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider\u2014suggests a much broader scope. Ibid.\n  The Government similarly errs by focusing only on\nthe adjectives \u201ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO],\u201d5\nwhich precede \u201creport.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that\nthe public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports\n\u201canalogous to those that Congress and the GAO would\nissue or conduct.\u201d Ibid. As we explained in Graham\nCounty, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing\nmore than that a \u201creport\u201d must be governmental. See 559\nU. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n. 7). The governmental\nnature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.\n  Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d does\nnot render superfluous the other sources of public disclo\nsure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading \u201creport\u201d\nto mean \u201csomething that gives information\u201d would sub\nsume the other words in the phrase \u201creport, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. But\nKirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are\nprocesses \u201cto obtain information.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThose processes are thus clearly different from \u201csomething\nthat gives information.\u201d Moreover, the statute contem\nplates some redundancy: An \u201caudit,\u201d for example, will\noften be a type of \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\n  We are not persuaded that we should adopt a \u201cdifferent,\nsomewhat special meaning\u201d of \u201creport\u201d over the word\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although the statute refers to the \u201cGovernment Accounting Office,\u201d\nit is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office,\nalso known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability\nOffice. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 6, n. 6).\n8      SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                      EX REL.

Indeed, we have cautioned recently\nagainst interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way\ninconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In Graham\nCounty, we rejected several arguments for construing the\nstatute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole \u201ctouch\nstone\u201d in the statutory text is \u201cpublic disclosure.\u201d 559\nU. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 19). We chose in that case\nsimply to give the text its \u201cmost natura[l] read[ing],\u201d id., at\n___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.\n                              B\n   A written agency response to a FOIA request falls\nwithin the ordinary meaning of \u201creport.\u201d FOIA requires\neach agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person\nmaking such request of [its] determination and the\nreasons therefor.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an\nagency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi\ntionally \u201cset forth the names and titles or positions of each\nperson responsible for the denial,\u201d \u201cmake a reasonable\neffort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,\u201d and\n\u201cprovide any such estimate to the person making the\nrequest.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted\nmore detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man\ndating a response in writing. See 29 CFR \u00a770.21(a) (2009)\n(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request\nand a description of the manner in which records will be\ndisclosed); \u00a7\u00a770.21(b)\u2013(c) (requiring a \u201cbrief statement of\nthe reason or reasons for [a] denial,\u201d as well as written\nnotification if a record \u201ccannot be located or has been\ndestroyed\u201d (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal\nagencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR \u00a716.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);\n43 CFR \u00a72.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR \u00a71.7 (2010)\n(Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is\n\u201csomething that gives information,\u201d a \u201cnotification,\u201d and\nan \u201cofficial or formal statement of facts.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Nothing in the public\ndisclosure bar suggests that a document and its attach\nments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.\nIf an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record\nattached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed \u201cin\u201d that FOIA\nresponse and, therefore, disclosed \u201cin\u201d a report for the\npurposes of the public disclosure bar.6\n   The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk,\nalong with their attached records, are thus reports within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response\nwas an \u201cofficial or formal statement\u201d that \u201c[gave] informa\ntion\u201d and \u201cnotif[ied]\u201d Mrs. Kirk of the agency\u2019s resolution\nof her FOIA request.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   In interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur inquiry must cease if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous,\u201d as we have\nfound, and \u201c \u2018the statutory scheme is coherent and consis\ntent.\u2019 \u201d Robinson v.

We are not persuaded by asser\ntions that it would be anomalous to read the public disclo\nsure bar to encompass written FOIA responses.\n                             1\n  The drafting history of the public disclosure bar does not\ncontradict our holding. As originally enacted in 1863, the\nFCA placed no restriction on the sources from which a qui\ntam relator could acquire information on which to base a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 It is irrelevant whether a particular record is itself a report. The\n\nattached records do not \u201cbecom[e]\u201d reports, 601 F. 3d, at 109, but\nsimply are part of a report.\n10     SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                      EX REL.

See United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943).         In response, Congress\namended the statute to preclude such \u201cparasitic\u201d qui tam\nactions based on \u201cevidence or information in the posses\nsion of the United States . . . at the time such suit was\nbrought.\u201d 559 U.

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that it would be incon\nsistent with this drafting history to hold that written\nFOIA responses are reports. The court reasoned that\ndoing so would \u201cessentially resurrect, in a significant\nsubset of cases, the government possession standard . . .\nrepudiated in 1986.\u201d 601 F. 3d, at 109.\n  We disagree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion. As a\nthreshold matter, \u201cthe drafting history of the public disclo\nsure bar raises more questions than it answers.\u201d Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).

Although Kirk alleges that he\nbecame suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran\nworking at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same\nFOIA requests and then filed the same suit. Similarly,\nanyone could identify a few regulatory filing and certifica\ntion requirements, submit FOIA requests until he discov\ners a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and\npotentially reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the\nFCA.

Kirk\nargues that it would be strange that two relators could\nobtain copies of the same document but that only the\nrelator who got the document in response to a FOIA re\nquest would find his case barred.\n  This argument assumes that records released under\nFOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not\nfall within the public disclosure bar. We do not decide\nthat question.

UNITED STATES \n\n                       EX REL. KIRK \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nare not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain\nterms, the public disclosure bar applies to some meth-\nods of public disclosure and not to others. See Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he FCA\u2019s public\ndisclosure bar . . . deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui\ntam suits when the relevant information has already\nentered the public domain through certain channels\u201d\n(emphasis added)). It would not be anomalous if some\nmethods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the\npublic disclosure bar and some did not.\n  We also are not concerned that potential defendants will\nnow insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\nrequest for incriminating documents. This argument\nassumes that the public disclosure of information in a\nwritten FOIA response forever taints that information for\npurposes of the public disclosure bar. But it may be that a\nrelator who comes by that information from a different\nsource has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not\n\u201cbased upon\u201d the initial public disclosure. 31 U. S. C.\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(A). That question has divided the Courts of\nAppeals, and we do not resolve it here. See Glaser v.\nWound Care Consultants, Inc., 570 F. 3d 907, 915 (CA7\n2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also\nbe that such a relator qualifies for the \u201coriginal source\u201d\nexception.8\n  In any event, the notion that potential defendants will\nmake FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 An \u201coriginal source\u201d is \u201can individual who has direct and independ\n\nent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based\nand has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before\nfiling an action under this section which is based on the information.\u201d\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(B). Some Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed the\nexception to limit \u201coriginal sources\u201d to those who were the cause of the\npublic disclosure, while others have been more generous. See United\nStates ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L.

S., at ___\n(slip op., at 19) (rejecting as \u201cstrained speculation\u201d an\nargument that local governments will manipulate the\npublic disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no\nsuggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that\nhave long held that FOIA responses are \u201creports\u201d within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar.\n                              B\n    Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk\nand his amici have provided no principled way to define\n\u201creport\u201d to exclude FOIA responses without excluding\nother documents that are indisputably reports. The Gov\nernment, for example, struggled to settle on a single defi\nnition. Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19 (\u201creport\u201d must be read to \u201creflect a focus on situations\nin which the government is conducting, or has completed,\nsome focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant\nfacts\u201d) with id., at 21 (\u201cA FOIA response is not a \u2018report\u2019\n. . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncov\nering the truth of any matter\u201d), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\n(\u201c[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency\n. . . is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a sub\nstantive analysis of information\u201d).

Leaving aside the term \u201creport,\u201d the court\nexplained:\n    \u201cAll of the other terms in [\u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s] list of\n    enumerated sources connote the synthesis of informa\n    tion in an investigatory context. \u2018[C]riminal, civil,\n    [and] administrative hearings,\u2019 for instance, all entail\n    a government inquiry into a given subject, here into\n    an alleged case of fraud. Similarly, government \u2018hear\n    ing[s and] audit[s]\u2019 are processes by which information\n    is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a\n    government entity\u2019s knowledge of a given subject or,\n    often, determining whether a party is in compliance\n    with applicable law. . . .\n       \u201cIn this context, the term \u2018report\u2019 most readily bears\n    a narrower meaning than simply \u2018something that\n    gives information.\u2019 Rather, it connotes the compila\n    tion or analysis of information with the aim of synthe\n    sizing that information in order to serve some end of\n    the government, as in a \u2018hearing\u2019 or \u2018audit.\u2019 It does\n    not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic produc\n    tion of documents in response to a FOIA request made\n    by a member of the public.\u201d 601 F. 3d 94, 107 (2010)\n    (citations omitted).\nFocusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of\nAppeals observed that DOL\u2019s responses did not \u201csynthe\nsize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

UNITED STATES EX\n                REL. KIRK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013188.      Argued March 1, 2011\u2014Decided May 16, 2011\nThe public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act (FCA) generally fore\n  closes private parties from bringing qui tam suits to recover falsely or\n  fraudulently obtained federal payments where those suits are \u201cbased\n  upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,\n  civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or\n  Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investiga\n  tion, or from the news media.\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Respon\n  dent Kirk brought such a suit, alleging that his former employer, pe\n  titioner Schindler Elevator Corp., had submitted hundreds of false\n  claims for payment under its federal contracts. To support his alle\n  gations, Kirk pointed to information his wife received from the Labor\n  Department (DOL) in response to three requests for records she filed\n  under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552.\n  Granting Schindler\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded,\n  inter alia, that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdic\n  tion over Kirk\u2019s allegations that were based on information disclosed\n  in a Government \u201creport\u201d or \u201cinvestigation.\u201d The Second Circuit va\n  cated and remanded, holding, in effect, that an agency\u2019s response to a\n  FOIA request is neither a \u201creport\u201d nor an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\nHeld: A federal agency\u2019s written response to a FOIA request for records\n constitutes a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of the FCA\u2019s public disclo\n sure bar. Pp. 4\u201314.\n    (a) \u201c[R]eport\u201d in this context carries its ordinary meaning. Pp. 4\u20138.\n      (1) Because the FCA does not define \u201creport,\u201d the Court looks\n first to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. See, e.g., Gross v. FBL Finan\n cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. ___, ___. Dictionaries define \u201creport\u201d as,\n for example, something that gives information. This ordinary mean\n2         SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

KIRK \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    ing is consistent with the public disclosure bar\u2019s generally broad\n    scope, see, e.g., Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. v.\n    United States ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___, ___, as is evidenced by the\n    other sources of public disclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A), especially \u201cnews\n    media.\u201d Pp. 4\u20136.\n          (2) Nor is there any textual basis for adopting a narrower defini\n    tion of \u201creport.\u201d The Second Circuit committed the very error this\n    Court reversed in Graham County. In applying the noscitur a sociis\n    canon to conclude that a narrower meaning for \u201creport\u201d was man\n    dated, the court failed to consider all of the sources of public disclo\n    sure listed in the statute\u2014in particular, the reference to \u201cnews me\n    dia.\u201d See 559 U. S., at ___. Applying the ordinary meaning of\n    \u201creport\u201d also does not render superfluous the other sources of public\n    disclosure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses in this case, along\n    with the accompanying records produced to Mrs. Kirk, are \u201creports\u201d\n    within the public disclosure bar\u2019s ordinary meaning. FOIA requires\n    each agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person making such re\n    quest of [its] determination and the reasons therefor.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7552(a)(6)(A)(i). Like other federal agencies, the DOL has adopted\n    FOIA regulations mandating a written response. Such agency re\n    sponses plainly fall within the broad, ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d\n    as, e.g., something that gives information. Moreover, any records\n    produced along with such responses are part of the responses, just as\n    if they had been produced as an appendix to a printed report. Pp. 8\u2013\n    9.\n       (c) This Court is not persuaded by assertions that it would be\n    anomalous to read the public disclosure bar to encompass written\n    FOIA responses. Pp. 9\u201314.\n          (1) The Court\u2019s holding is not inconsistent with the public disclo\n    sure bar\u2019s drafting history. If anything, the drafting history supports\n    this Court\u2019s holding. Kirk\u2019s case seems a classic example of the \u201cop\n    portunistic\u201d litigation that the public disclosure bar is designed to\n    discourage. Id., at ___. Anyone could identify a few regulatory filing\n    and certification requirements, submit FOIA requests until he dis\n    covers a federal contractor who is out of compliance, and potentially\n    reap a windfall in a qui tam action under the FCA. Pp. 9\u201311.\n          (2) Nor will extending the public disclosure bar to written FOIA\n    responses necessarily lead to unusual consequences. Kirk argues\n    that the Court\u2019s ruling would allow a suit by a qui tam relator pos\n    sessing records whose release was required by FOIA even absent a\n    request, but bar an action by a relator who got the same documents\n    by way of a FOIA request. Even assuming, as Kirk does, that unre\n    quested records are not covered by the public disclosure bar, the\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Court is not troubled by the different treatment. By its plain terms,\n  the bar applies to some methods of public disclosure and not to oth\n  ers. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___. It would not be anoma\n  lous if some methods of FOIA disclosure fell within the bar\u2019s scope\n  and some did not. Moreover, Kirk\u2019s assertion that potential defen\n  dants will now insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\n  request for incriminating documents is pure speculation. Cf. id., at\n  ___. There is no suggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits\n  that have long held that FOIA responses are \u201creports\u201d within the\n  public disclosure bar\u2019s meaning. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (3) Even if the foregoing extratextual arguments were accepted,\n  Kirk and his amici have provided no principled way to define \u201creport\u201d\n  to exclude FOIA responses without excluding other documents\u2014e.g.,\n  the Justice Department\u2019s annual report of FOIA statistics\u2014that are\n  indisputably reports. Pp. 13\u201314.\n     (d) Whether Kirk\u2019s suit is \u201cbased upon . . . allegations or transac\n  tions\u201d disclosed in the reports at issue is a question to be resolved on\n  remand.

That Act requires contractors like\nSchindler to report certain information to the Secretary of\nLabor, including how many of its employees are \u201cqualified\ncovered veterans\u201d under the statute.            38 U. S. C.\n\u00a74212(d)(1). VEVRAA regulations required Schindler to\nagree in each of its contracts that it would \u201csubmit VETS\u2013\n100 Reports no later than September 30 of each year.\u201d 48\nCFR \u00a752.222\u201337(c) (2008); see also \u00a722.1310(b).\n  Respondent Daniel Kirk, a United States Army veteran\nwho served in Vietnam, was employed by Millar and\nSchindler from 1978 until 2003. In August 2003, Kirk\nresigned from Schindler in response to what he saw as\nSchindler\u2019s efforts to force him out.3\n  In March 2005, Kirk filed this action against Schindler\nunder the False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties\nand treble damages on persons who submit false or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thefacts in this Part, which we must accept as true, are taken\nfrom the amended complaint and the filings submitted in opposition to\nSchindler\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n  3 Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Fed\n\neral Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), claiming that he had\nbeen \u201cimproperly demoted and constructively terminated by Schindler\ndespite his status as a Vietnam era veteran.\u201d App. 23a. The OFCCP\ninvestigated Schindler\u2019s compliance with VEVRAA and found insuffi\ncient evidence to support Kirk\u2019s claim. In November 2009, the Depart\nment of Labor affirmed the OFCCP\u2019s finding. 601 F. 3d 94, 99 (CA2\n2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

The FCA authorizes both civil actions\nby the Attorney General and private qui tam actions to\nenforce its provisions. \u00a73730. When, as here, the Gov\nernment chooses not to intervene in a qui tam action, the\nprivate relator stands to receive between 25% and 30% of\nthe proceeds of the action. \u00a73730(d)(2).\n   In an amended complaint filed in June 2007, Kirk al\nleged that Schindler had submitted hundreds of false\nclaims for payment under its Government contracts.\nAccording to Kirk, Schindler had violated VEVRAA\u2019s\nreporting requirements by failing to file certain required\nVETS\u2013100 reports and including false information in\nthose it did file. The company\u2019s claims for payment were\nfalse, Kirk alleged, because Schindler had falsely certified\nits compliance with VEVRAA. Kirk did not specify the\namount of damages he sought on behalf of the United\nStates, but he asserted that the value of Schindler\u2019s\nVEVRAA-covered contracts exceeded $100 million.\n   To support his allegations, Kirk pointed to information\nhis wife, Linda Kirk, received from the Department of\nLabor (DOL) in response to three FOIA requests. Mrs.\nKirk had sought all VETS\u2013100 reports filed by Schindler\nfor the years 1998 through 2006. The DOL responded by\nletter or e-mail to each request with information about the\nrecords found for each year, including years for which no\nresponsive records were located. The DOL informed Mrs.\nKirk that it found no VETS\u2013100 reports filed by Schindler\nin 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, or 2003. For the other years,\nthe DOL provided Mrs. Kirk with copies of the reports\nfiled by Schindler, 99 in all.\n   Schindler moved to dismiss on a number of grounds,\nincluding that the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar deprived\nthe District Court of jurisdiction. See \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion, concluding that most of\nKirk\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim and that the\n4        SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

A \u201creport\u201d is \u201csome\nthing that gives information\u201d or a \u201cnotification,\u201d Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 1925 (1986), or \u201c[a]n\nofficial or formal statement of facts or proceedings,\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (6th ed. 1990).

The statute also mentions \u201cadministrative\nhearings\u201d twice, reflecting intent to avoid underinclusive\nness even at the risk of redundancy.\n   The phrase \u201callegations or transactions\u201d in \u00a73730(e)\n(4)(A) additionally suggests a wide-reaching public disclo\nsure bar. Congress covered not only the disclosure of\n\u201callegations\u201d but also \u201ctransactions,\u201d a term that courts\nhave recognized as having a broad meaning. See, e.g.,\nMoore v.

When all of the sources are considered, the reference\nto \u201cnews media\u201d\u2014which the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider\u2014suggests a much broader scope. Ibid.\n  The Government similarly errs by focusing only on\nthe adjectives \u201ccongressional, administrative, or [GAO],\u201d5\nwhich precede \u201creport.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18. It contends that these adjectives suggest that\nthe public disclosure bar applies only to agency reports\n\u201canalogous to those that Congress and the GAO would\nissue or conduct.\u201d Ibid. As we explained in Graham\nCounty, however, those three adjectives tell us nothing\nmore than that a \u201creport\u201d must be governmental. See 559\nU. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 7, n. 7). The governmental\nnature of the FOIA responses at issue is not disputed.\n  Finally, applying the ordinary meaning of \u201creport\u201d does\nnot render superfluous the other sources of public disclo\nsure in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A). Kirk argues that reading \u201creport\u201d\nto mean \u201csomething that gives information\u201d would sub\nsume the other words in the phrase \u201creport, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. But\nKirk admits that hearings, audits, and investigations are\nprocesses \u201cto obtain information.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThose processes are thus clearly different from \u201csomething\nthat gives information.\u201d Moreover, the statute contem\nplates some redundancy: An \u201caudit,\u201d for example, will\noften be a type of \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\n  We are not persuaded that we should adopt a \u201cdifferent,\nsomewhat special meaning\u201d of \u201creport\u201d over the word\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although the statute refers to the \u201cGovernment Accounting Office,\u201d\nit is undisputed that Congress meant the General Accounting Office,\nalso known as GAO and now renamed the Government Accountability\nOffice. See Graham County, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 6 (slip op., at 6, n. 6).\n8      SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v. UNITED STATES \n\n                      EX REL.

Indeed, we have cautioned recently\nagainst interpreting the public disclosure bar in a way\ninconsistent with a plain reading of its text. In Graham\nCounty, we rejected several arguments for construing the\nstatute narrowly, twice emphasizing that the sole \u201ctouch\nstone\u201d in the statutory text is \u201cpublic disclosure.\u201d 559\nU.

We chose in that case\nsimply to give the text its \u201cmost natura[l] read[ing],\u201d id., at\n___ (slip op., at 5), and we do so again here.\n                              B\n   A written agency response to a FOIA request falls\nwithin the ordinary meaning of \u201creport.\u201d FOIA requires\neach agency receiving a request to \u201cnotify the person\nmaking such request of [its] determination and the\nreasons therefor.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552(a)(6)(A)(i). When an\nagency denies a request in whole or in part, it must addi\ntionally \u201cset forth the names and titles or positions of each\nperson responsible for the denial,\u201d \u201cmake a reasonable\neffort to estimate the volume of any [denied] matter,\u201d and\n\u201cprovide any such estimate to the person making the\nrequest.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7552(a)(6)(C)(i), (F). The DOL has adopted\nmore detailed regulations implementing FOIA and man\ndating a response in writing. See 29 CFR \u00a770.21(a) (2009)\n(requiring written notice of the grant of a FOIA request\nand a description of the manner in which records will be\ndisclosed); \u00a7\u00a770.21(b)\u2013(c) (requiring a \u201cbrief statement of\nthe reason or reasons for [a] denial,\u201d as well as written\nnotification if a record \u201ccannot be located or has been\ndestroyed\u201d (italics deleted)). So, too, have other federal\nagencies. See, e.g., 28 CFR \u00a716.6 (2010) (Dept. of Justice);\n43 CFR \u00a72.21 (2009) (Dept. of Interior); 7 CFR \u00a71.7 (2010)\n(Dept. of Agriculture). Such an agency response plainly is\n\u201csomething that gives information,\u201d a \u201cnotification,\u201d and\nan \u201cofficial or formal statement of facts.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Nothing in the public\ndisclosure bar suggests that a document and its attach\nments must be disaggregated and evaluated individually.\nIf an allegation or transaction is disclosed in a record\nattached to a FOIA response, it is disclosed \u201cin\u201d that FOIA\nresponse and, therefore, disclosed \u201cin\u201d a report for the\npurposes of the public disclosure bar.6\n   The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses to Mrs. Kirk,\nalong with their attached records, are thus reports within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar. Each response\nwas an \u201cofficial or formal statement\u201d that \u201c[gave] informa\ntion\u201d and \u201cnotif[ied]\u201d Mrs. Kirk of the agency\u2019s resolution\nof her FOIA request.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   In interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur inquiry must cease if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous,\u201d as we have\nfound, and \u201c \u2018the statutory scheme is coherent and consis\ntent.\u2019 \u201d Robinson v.

See United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943).

Although Kirk alleges that he\nbecame suspicious from his own experiences as a veteran\nworking at Schindler, anyone could have filed the same\nFOIA requests and then filed the same suit.

Kirk\nargues that it would be strange that two relators could\nobtain copies of the same document but that only the\nrelator who got the document in response to a FOIA re\nquest would find his case barred.\n  This argument assumes that records released under\nFOIA, but not attached to a written FOIA response, do not\nfall within the public disclosure bar.

By its plain\nterms, the public disclosure bar applies to some meth-\nods of public disclosure and not to others. See Graham\nCounty, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (\u201c[T]he FCA\u2019s public\ndisclosure bar . . . deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui\ntam suits when the relevant information has already\nentered the public domain through certain channels\u201d\n(emphasis added)). It would not be anomalous if some\nmethods of FOIA disclosure fell within the scope of the\npublic disclosure bar and some did not.\n  We also are not concerned that potential defendants will\nnow insulate themselves from liability by making a FOIA\nrequest for incriminating documents. This argument\nassumes that the public disclosure of information in a\nwritten FOIA response forever taints that information for\npurposes of the public disclosure bar. But it may be that a\nrelator who comes by that information from a different\nsource has a legitimate argument that his lawsuit is not\n\u201cbased upon\u201d the initial public disclosure. 31 U. S.

See Glaser v.\nWound Care Consultants, Inc., 570 F. 3d 907, 915 (CA7\n2009) (describing the split in authority). It may also\nbe that such a relator qualifies for the \u201coriginal source\u201d\nexception.8\n  In any event, the notion that potential defendants will\nmake FOIA requests to insulate themselves from liability\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 An \u201coriginal source\u201d is \u201can individual who has direct and independ\n\nent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based\nand has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before\nfiling an action under this section which is based on the information.\u201d\n\u00a73730(e)(4)(B). Some Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed the\nexception to limit \u201coriginal sources\u201d to those who were the cause of the\npublic disclosure, while others have been more generous. See United\nStates ex rel. Duxbury v. Ortho Biotech Prods., L.

S., at ___\n(slip op., at 19) (rejecting as \u201cstrained speculation\u201d an\nargument that local governments will manipulate the\npublic disclosure bar to escape liability). There is no\nsuggestion that this has occurred in those Circuits that\nhave long held that FOIA responses are \u201creports\u201d within\nthe meaning of the public disclosure bar.\n                              B\n    Even if we accepted these extratextual arguments, Kirk\nand his amici have provided no principled way to define\n\u201creport\u201d to exclude FOIA responses without excluding\nother documents that are indisputably reports. The Gov\nernment, for example, struggled to settle on a single defi\nnition. Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n19 (\u201creport\u201d must be read to \u201creflect a focus on situations\nin which the government is conducting, or has completed,\nsome focused inquiry or analysis concerning the relevant\nfacts\u201d) with id., at 21 (\u201cA FOIA response is not a \u2018report\u2019\n. . . because the federal agency is not charged with uncov\nering the truth of any matter\u201d), and Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\n(\u201c[T]he way to think about it is whether or not the agency\n. . . is engaging in a substantive inquiry into and a sub\nstantive analysis of information\u201d).

Compare Brief for Respondent\n27 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\u201318 with Brief for Respondent\n34\u201339 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. Kirk\u2019s first suggestion\nwould exclude \u201ca lot of things that are labeled . . . report,\u201d\nid., at 22, and the second\u2014the definition advanced by the\nCourt of Appeals\u2014would seem to include written FOIA\nresponses, id., at 28\u201329. In the end, it appears that the\n\u201conly argument is that FOIA is a different kind of mis\nsion\u201d\u2014\u201ca special case.\u201d Id., at 31. We see no basis for that\ndistinction and adhere to the principle that undefined\nstatutory terms carry their ordinary meaning.\n                        *    *     *\n  The DOL\u2019s three written FOIA responses in this case,\nalong with the accompanying records produced to Mrs.\nKirk, are reports within the meaning of the public dis\nclosure bar. Whether Kirk\u2019s suit is \u201cbased upon . . .\nallegations or transactions\u201d disclosed in those reports is a\nquestion for the Court of Appeals to resolve on remand.\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.\n\u00a74212(d); 48 CFR \u00a7\u00a722.1310(b) and 52.222\u201337(c) (2008).\nRespondent Daniel A. Kirk, a Vietnam War veteran and a\nformer employee of petitioner Schindler Elevator Corpora\ntion (Schindler), had cause to believe, based on his own\nexperience and observations, that Schindler failed to meet\nVEVRAA\u2019s annual information-reporting requirements.\nTo confirm and support his on-the-job observations, Kirk\nobtained, through several Freedom of Information Act\n(FOIA) requests to the Department of Labor (DOL), copies\nof Schindler\u2019s VEVRAA filings. The DOL responses re\nvealed that, in some years, Schindler filed no information,\nwhile in some other years, the corporation filed false in\nformation. Armed with the DOL\u2019s confirmation of his own\nimpressions, Kirk commenced suit against Schindler\nunder the federal False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S. C.\n\u00a73729 et seq.\n   In a carefully developed, highly persuasive opinion, the\nSecond Circuit explained why a federal agency\u2019s response\n2     SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

KIRK \n\n                 GINSBURG, J., dissenting \n\n\nto a FOIA request should not automatically qualify as\na \u201creport, hearing, audit, or investigation\u201d preclusive of a\nwhistleblower\u2019s lawsuit under the public disclosure bar of\nthe FCA, \u00a73730(e)(4). I would affirm the Second Circuit\u2019s\njudgment as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and\nhistory of the FCA\u2019s public disclosure bar.\n  The Court finds no \u201ctextual basis\u201d for the Second Cir\ncuit\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language. Ante, at 6.\nBut the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion considered text as well\nas context. Leaving aside the term \u201creport,\u201d the court\nexplained:\n    \u201cAll of the other terms in [\u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s] list of\n    enumerated sources connote the synthesis of informa\n    tion in an investigatory context. \u2018[C]riminal, civil,\n    [and] administrative hearings,\u2019 for instance, all entail\n    a government inquiry into a given subject, here into\n    an alleged case of fraud. Similarly, government \u2018hear\n    ing[s and] audit[s]\u2019 are processes by which information\n    is compiled with the concerted aim of deepening a\n    government entity\u2019s knowledge of a given subject or,\n    often, determining whether a party is in compliance\n    with applicable law. . . .\n       \u201cIn this context, the term \u2018report\u2019 most readily bears\n    a narrower meaning than simply \u2018something that\n    gives information.\u2019 Rather, it connotes the compila\n    tion or analysis of information with the aim of synthe\n    sizing that information in order to serve some end of\n    the government, as in a \u2018hearing\u2019 or \u2018audit.\u2019 It does\n    not naturally extend to cover the mechanistic produc\n    tion of documents in response to a FOIA request made\n    by a member of the public.\u201d 601 F. 3d 94, 107 (2010)\n    (citations omitted).\nFocusing on the FOIA requests in this case, the Court of\nAppeals observed that DOL\u2019s responses did not \u201csynthe\nsize the documents or their contents with the aim of itself\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

United\nStates ex rel. Wilson, 559 U. S. ___ (2010)],\u201d ante, at 6; the\nCourt of Appeals used the noscitur a sociis canon only \u201cas\na guide in sifting through the common understandings of\n\u2018report\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 to discover their intended\nmeaning within the FCA.\u201d 601 F. 3d, at 108, n. 6. The\ncourt explained:\n    \u201cWe . . . have not used the canon to impose commonal\n    ity on terms that \u2018do not share any . . . core of mean\n    ing,\u2019 Graham County, [559 U. S., at ___, n. 7 (slip op.,\n    at 7, n. 7)]. To the contrary, the terms \u2018hearing,\u2019 \u2018re\n    port,\u2019 \u2018audit,\u2019 and \u2018investigation\u2019 all refer to processes\n    of uncovering and analyzing information or to the\n    products of those processes. Our interpretation fo\n    cuses on their shared \u2018core of meaning.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   The Court faults the Court of Appeals for not consider\ning \u00a73730(e)(4)(A)\u2019s \u201creference to \u2018news media,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 7,\nsuggesting that this omission overlooked Graham County\u2019s\nobservation that \u201call of the sources [of public disclosure]\nlisted in \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance.\u201d\n559 U.

Disclosures \u201cof allegations or transac\ntions . . . from the news media,\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (emphasis\nadded), share a common core of meaning with disclosures\nin other sources that involve \u201cprocesses of uncovering and\nanalyzing information or . . . the products of those proc\n4     SCHINDLER ELEVATOR CORP. v.

The facts also\n    illustrate how an overbroad reading of the jurisdic\n    tional bar would prevent an individual with inde\n    pendent but partial knowledge of a possible fraud\n    would be barred from bringing a lawsuit that is nei\n    ther parasitic nor frivolous.\u201d 601 F. 3d, at 110 (cita\n    tion omitted).\n   By ranking DOL\u2019s ministerial response an \u201cadministra\ntive . . . report,\u201d akin to a \u201cGovernment Accounting Office\nreport,\u201d \u00a73730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted), the Court weak\nens the force of the FCA as a weapon against fraud on\nthe part of Government contractors. Why should a whis\ntleblower attentive to the heightened pleading standards\nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) be barred from\ncourt if he seeks corroboration for his allegations, as Kirk\ndid, through a FOIA request simply for copies of a contrac\ntor\u2019s filings? After today\u2019s decision, which severely limits\nwhistleblowers\u2019 ability to substantiate their allegations\nbefore commencing suit, that question is worthy of Con\ngress\u2019 attention.\n</pre>",
