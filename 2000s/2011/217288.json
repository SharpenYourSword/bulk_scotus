UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–1298. Argued January 18, 2011—Decided May 23, 2011*\nAfter petitioners fell behind schedule in developing a stealth aircraft\n  (A–12) for the Navy, the contracting officer terminated their $4.8 bil\n  lion fixed-price contract for default and ordered petitioners to repay\n  approximately $1.35 billion in progress payments for work the Gov\n  ernment never accepted. Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal\n  Claims (CFC), challenging the termination decision under the Con\n  tract Disputes Act of 1978. They argued that Federal Circuit prece\n  dent permitted their default to be excused because the Government\n  had failed to share its “superior knowledge” about how to design and\n  manufacture stealth aircraft. Uncovering the extent of such knowl\n  edge proved difficult because the design, materials, and manufactur\n  ing process for prior stealth aircraft, operated by the Air Force, are\n  closely guarded military secrets. After military secrets were dis\n  closed during discovery, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force warned\n  the CFC that further discovery into the extent of the Government’s\n  superior knowledge would risk disclosing classified information. The\n  CFC terminated such discovery and found the superior-knowledge\n  question nonjusticiable. The CFC subsequently converted the termi\n  nation into a less-Government-friendly termination for convenience\n  and awarded petitioners $1.2 billion. The Federal Circuit reversed.\n  On remand, the CFC sustained the default termination and reaf\n  firmed that petitioners’ superior-knowledge affirmative defense could\n  not be litigated. The Federal Circuit again reversed, but it found\n  that the state-secrets privilege prevented adjudicating petitioners’\n  superior-knowledge defense. On remand, the CFC again found peti\n——————\n * Together with No. 09–1302, Boeing Co., Successor to McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tioners had defaulted, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: When, to protect state secrets, a court dismisses a Government\n contractor’s prima facie valid affirmative defense to the Govern\n ment’s allegations of contractual breach, the proper remedy is to\n leave the parties where they were on the day they filed suit. Pp. 5–\n 14.\n    (a) The CFC held that, since invocation of the state-secrets privi\n lege obscured too many of the facts relevant to the superior\n knowledge defense, the issue of that defense was nonjusticiable, even\n though petitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged evi\n dence for a prima facie showing. In this situation, the Court must\n exercise its common-law authority to fashion contractual remedies in\n Government-contracting disputes. The relevant state-secrets juris\n prudence comes not from United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1,\n which deals with the Government’s evidentiary privilege against\n court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets, but from Totten\n v. United States, 92 U. S. 105, and Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, two\n cases dealing with alleged contracts to spy.\n    Where liability depends on the validity of a plausible superior\n knowledge defense, and when full litigation of that defense “would\n inevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten, supra, at\n 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. It seems unrealistic to\n separate the claim from the defense, allowing the former to proceed\n while barring the latter. Claims and defenses together establish the\n justification, or lack of justification, for judicial relief; and when pub\n lic policy precludes judicial intervention for the one it should also\n preclude judicial intervention for the other. Suit on the contract, or\n for performance rendered or funds paid under the contract, will not\n lie, and courts should leave the parties to the agreement where they\n stood on the day they filed suit. The Government suggests that at\n the time of suit, petitioners had been held in default by the contract\n ing officer and were liable for the ensuing consequences. But that\n was merely one step in the parties’ contractual regime. The “position\n of the parties” at the time of suit is not their position with regard to\n legal burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related deter\n minations, but their position with regard to possession of funds and\n property. Pp. 5–10.\n    (b) Neither side will be entirely happy with this resolution. Gen\n eral Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants to turn the termination into\n one for convenience and reinstate the CFC’s $1.2 billion award, but\n that is not an option under the A–12 agreement. Moreover, state se\n crets would make it impossible to calculate petitioners’ damages.\n The Government wants a return of the $1.35 billion it paid petition\n ers for work never accepted, but the validity of that claim depends on\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 106, the Court’s refusal to enforce this contract\n  captures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or rea\n  sonably ought to have been. They must have assumed the risk that\n  state secrets would prevent the adjudication of inadequate perform\n  ance claims. Moreover, this ruling’s impact here is likely much more\n  significant than its impact in future cases, except to the extent that it\n  renders the law more predictable and hence more subject to accom\n  modation by contracting parties. Whether the Government had an\n  obligation to share its superior knowledge about stealth technology is\n  left for the Federal Circuit to address on remand.

The A–12 proved\nunexpectedly difficult to design and manufacture, and by\nDecember 1990, petitioners were almost two years behind\nschedule and spending $120 to $150 million each month to\ndevelop the A–12.\n2       GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Petitioners informed the Government that the cost of\ncompleting the contract would exceed the contract price by\nan “ ‘unacceptable’ ” amount. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nUnited States, 567 F. 3d 1340, 1343 (CA Fed. 2009); see\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 182 F. 3d 1319,\n1323 (CA Fed. 1999). They proposed restructuring the\ncontract as a cost-reimbursement agreement and offered\nto absorb a $1.5 billion loss. The Department of Defense\nhad lost faith in the project, however, and Rear Admiral\nWilliam Morris, the Navy’s contracting officer for the A–12\nagreement, terminated the contract for default on Jan­\nuary 7, 1991.\n  By that point, petitioners had spent $3.88 billion at­\ntempting to develop the A–12, and the Government had\nprovided $2.68 billion in progress payments. A few weeks\nafter terminating the contract, the Navy sent petitioners a\nletter demanding the return of approximately $1.35 billion\nin progress payments for work never accepted by the\nGovernment. The parties later entered into a deferred\npayment agreement covering this amount.\n  Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC) to challenge Admiral Morris’s termination decision\nunder the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2388, as\namended, 41 U. S. C. §609(a)(1). The Federal Circuit has\nrecognized a governmental obligation not to mislead con­\ntractors about, or silently withhold, its “superior knowl­\nedge” of difficult-to-discover information “vital” to contrac­\ntual performance. GAF Corp. v. United States, 932 F. 2d\n947, 949 (1991). Petitioners asserted that the Govern­\nment’s failure to share its “superior knowledge” about how\nto design and manufacture stealth aircraft excused their\ndefault (and also asserted other claims not relevant here).\n  Uncovering the extent of the Government’s prior experi­\nence with stealth technology proved difficult. The design,\nmaterials, and manufacturing process for two prior stealth\naircraft operated by the Air Force—the B–2 and the F–\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The Government\nnevertheless granted 10 members of petitioners’ litigation\nteam “access to the Secret/Special Access level of the B–2\nand F–117A programs.” Id., at 385. Four of those ten\nindividuals received access to even the most sensitive\naspects of the programs. See ibid.\n   That neither satisfied petitioners’ thirst for discovery\nnor prevented the unauthorized disclosure of military\nsecrets. In March 1993, Acting Secretary of the Air Force\nMichael Donley asserted the state-secrets privilege to bar\ndiscovery into certain aspects of stealth technology beyond\npetitioners’ “need-to-know” authorizations. At a deposi­\ntion that month, a former Navy official’s responses to\nquestions by petitioners and the Government revealed\nmilitary secrets neither side’s litigation team was author­\nized to know. Copies of the unclassified deposition were\nwidely distributed and quoted in unsealed court filings\nuntil Government security officials discovered the breach\na month later. A July 1993 deposition caused further\nunauthorized disclosures of military secrets.\n   These disclosures led Acting Secretary of the Air Force\nMerrill McPeak to file a declaration with the CFC. He\nwarned that further discovery into the extent of the Gov­\nernment’s superior knowledge “would present a continuing\nthreat of disclosure of . . . military and state secrets” sur­\nrounding the “weight, profile or signature, and materials\ninvolved in the design and construction of ‘stealt[h]’ . . .\naircraft and weapons systems.” Id., at 633, 635. Even\nrelatively straightforward and innocuous questions, in his\nopinion, “would pose unacceptable risks of disclosure of\nclassified, special access information,” id., at 636, includ­\ning the potential disclosure of covert Government pro­\n4      GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngrams, id., at 637.\n   The CFC took Secretary McPeak’s concerns seriously\nand terminated discovery relating to superior knowledge.\nIt later decided that the extent of the Government’s supe­\nrior knowledge was a nonjusticiable question. Both sides\nhad enough evidence to “present a persuasive case” on\nthe superior-knowledge issue, but the CFC worried that,\n“wit[h] numerous layers of potentially dispositive facts”\nhidden by the privilege, its superior-knowledge rulings\n“would be a sham,” McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 35 Fed.\nCl. 358. The Federal Circuit reversed, 182 F. 3d, at 1332,\nand left it for the CFC to reconsider on remand whether\nthe need to protect military secrets precluded discovery\ninto the superior-knowledge issue, id., at 1329–1330.\n   After a 6-week trial, the CFC sustained the default\ntermination, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

The Court of Appeals reversed the default termina­\ntion, but agreed that the state-secrets privilege prevented\nadjudicating whether the Government’s superior knowl­\nedge excused the default. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nUnited States, 323 F. 3d 1006, 1024 (CA Fed. 2003). It\nrejected petitioners’ assertion that the Government could\nnot pursue a claim against a party and then use the state­\nsecrets privilege to completely preempt defenses to that\nclaim; the Court of Appeals believed United States v.\nReynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 12 (1953), had already “rejected”\nthis “very argument.” 323 F. 3d, at 1023. Litigants can­\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

But\nprotecting our national security sometimes requires keep­\ning information about our military, intelligence, and dip­\nlomatic efforts secret. See Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 307\n(1981); Martin v.

We\nhave recognized the sometimes-compelling necessity of\ngovernmental secrecy by acknowledging a Government\nprivilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and\nmilitary secrets.\n   In Reynolds, three civilian contractors died during a test\nflight of a B–29 bomber. Their widows filed wrongful­\ndeath suits against the Government and sought discovery\nof the Air Force’s accident-investigation report. Federal\ndiscovery rules, then as now, did not require production of\ndocuments protected by an evidentiary privilege. See 345\nU. S., at 6; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1). We held that\ndocuments that would disclose state secrets enjoyed such a\nprivilege; the state-secrets privilege, we said, had a “well\nestablished” pedigree “in the law of evidence.” 345 U. S.,\nat 6–7.\n   The penultimate paragraph of Reynolds rejected the\nwidows’ assertion that if the Government invoked the\n6      GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate-secrets privilege it had to abandon the claim to\nwhich the thereby privileged evidence was relevant. That\nwas, the widows observed, the price paid in criminal cases.\nIf the Government refuses to provide state-secret informa­\ntion that the accused reasonably asserts is necessary to\nhis defense, the prosecution must be dismissed. See id., at\n12; Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 672 (1957). The\npenultimate paragraph of Reynolds said that this was a\nfalse analogy. A like abandonment of the Government’s\nclaim is not the consequence “in a civil forum where the\nGovernment is not the moving party, but is a defendant\nonly on terms to which it has consented.” 345 U. S., at 12.\nBoth petitioners and the Court of Appeals rely upon this\nstatement to support their differing positions.\n   We think that Reynolds has less to do with these cases\nthan the parties believe—and its dictum (of course), less\nstill. Reynolds was about the admission of evidence. It\ndecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying eviden­\ntiary rules: The privileged information is excluded and the\ntrial goes on without it. That was to the detriment, of\ncourse, of the widows, whom the evidence would have\nfavored. But the Court did not order judgment in favor\nof the Government. Here, by contrast, the CFC decreed\nthe substantive result that since invocation of the state­\nsecrets privilege obscured too many of the facts relevant to\nthe superior-knowledge defense, the issue of that defense\nwas nonjusticiable, and the defense thus not available.\nSee 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. And that was so even though\npetitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged\nevidence to “make a prima facie showing.” Id., at 280.\n   While we disagree, for reasons set forth below, with the\nCFC’s disposition of the remainder of the case, its percep­\ntion that in the present context the state-secrets issue\nraises something quite different from a mere evidentiary\npoint seems to us sound. What we are called upon to\nexercise is not our power to determine the procedural\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules of evidence, but our common-law authority to fashion\ncontractual remedies in Government-contracting disputes.\nSee Priebe & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 332 U. S. 407,\n411 (1947). And our state-secrets jurisprudence bearing\nupon that authority is not Reynolds, but two cases dealing\nwith alleged contracts to spy.\n   In Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105 (1876), the\nadministrator of a self-styled Civil War spy’s estate\nbrought a breach-of-contract suit against the United\nStates. He alleged that his testator had entered into a\ncontract with President Lincoln to spy on the Confederacy\nin exchange for $200 a month. After the war ended, the\nUnited States reimbursed expenses but did not pay the\nmonthly salary. We recognized that the estate had a\npotentially valid breach-of-contract claim but dismissed\nthe suit. The contract was for “a secret service,” and\nlitigating the details of that service would risk exposing\nsecret operations and other clandestine operatives “to the\nserious detriment of the public.” Id., at 106–107. “[P]ublic\npolicy,” we held, “forbids the maintenance of any suit . . .\nthe trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of\nmatters which the law itself regards as confidential, and\nrespecting which it will not allow the confidence to be\nviolated.” Id., at 107.\n   Six years ago, we reaffirmed that “public policy for­\nb[ids]” suits “based on covert espionage agreements.”\nTenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 3 (2005). Such suits threaten to\nundermine ongoing intelligence-gathering and covert\noperations—two vital aspects of national security—\nthrough inadvertent exposure of espionage relationships.\nId., at 11. Rather than tempt fate, we leave the parties to\nan espionage agreement where we found them the day\nthey filed suit.\n   We think a similar situation obtains here, and that the\nsame consequence should follow. Where liability depends\nupon the validity of a plausible superior-knowledge de­\n8         GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfense, and when full litigation of that defense “would\ninevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten,\nsupra, at 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. As\nthe CFC concluded, that is the situation here. Disclosure\nof state secrets occurred twice before the CFC terminated\ndiscovery. See 37 Fed. Cl., at 277–278. Every document\nrequest or question to a witness would risk further disclo­\nsure, since both sides have an incentive to probe up to\nthe boundaries of state secrets. State secrets can also be\nindirectly disclosed. Each assertion of the privilege can\nprovide another clue about the Government’s covert pro­\ngrams or capabilities. See Fitzgerald v. Penthouse Inter\nnational, Ltd., 776 F. 2d 1236, 1243, and n. 10 (CA4 1985).\nFor instance, the fact that the Government had to con­\ntinue asserting the privilege after granting petitioners\naccess to B–2 and F–117A program information suggests\nit had other, possibly covert stealth programs in the 1980’s\nand early 1990’s.\n   It seems to us unrealistic to separate, as the CFC did,\nthe claim from the defense, and to allow the former to\nproceed while the latter is barred. It is claims and de­\nfenses together that establish the justification, or lack of\njustification, for judicial relief; and when public policy\nprecludes judicial intervention for the one it should pre­\nclude judicial intervention for the other as well.* If, in\nTotten, it had been the Government seeking return of\nfunds that the estate claimed had been received in pay­\nment for espionage activities, it would have been the\nheight of injustice to deny the defense because of the\nGovernment’s invocation of state-secret protection, but to\n——————\n  *Of course, this does not mean the nonjusticiability of one aspect\nof a case will necessarily end the entire litigation. If, for example, the\nGovernment asserts two justifications for its default termination, and if\nstate secrets deprive the contractor of a prima facie valid defense to\nonly one of those claims, the court can still adjudicate the validity of the\nother.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Judicial refusal to enforce promises\ncontrary to public policy (here, the Government’s alleged\npromise to provide superior knowledge, which we could\nnot determine was breached without penetrating several\nlayers of state secrets) is not unknown to the common law,\nand the traditional course is to leave the parties where\nthey stood when they knocked on the courthouse door.\n   “In general, if a court will not, on grounds of public\npolicy, aid a promisee by enforcing the promise, it will not\naid him by granting him restitution for performance that\nhe has rendered in return for the unenforceable promise.\nNeither will it aid the promisor by allowing a claim in\nrestitution for performance that he has rendered under\nthe unenforceable promise. It will simply leave both\nparties as it finds them, even though this may result in\none of them retaining a benefit that he has received as\na result of the transaction.” 2 Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §197, Comment a, p. 71 (1979); see, e.g., Worlton\nv. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198035\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198035/worlton-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222–223, 249 P. 2d 810, 814 (1952).\n   These cases differ from the common-law cases that we\nknow, in that the unenforceability did not exist at the time\nthe contract was formed, See 2 Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §179, Comment d, at 18, but arose because\nof the Government’s assertion of the state-secrets privilege\nthat rendered the promise of superior knowledge unadju­\ndicable. We do not see why that should affect the remedy.\nSuit on the contract, or for performance rendered or funds\npaid under the contract, will not lie, and the parties will\nbe left where they are.\n   The law of contracts contains another doctrine that\nrelates to the CFC’s concern about the reliability of its\njudgment “without numerous layers of potentially disposi­\ntive facts,” 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. The Statute of Frauds,\nwhich has been with us since the 17th century, reflects\nconcerns about the reliability of oral evidence. See Valdez\n10     GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFisheries Development Assn., Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv.\nCo., 45 P. 3d 657, 669 (Alaska 2002); 9 R. Lord, Williston\non Contracts §21:1, pp. 170–172 (4th ed. 1999 and 2010\nSupp.). It assumes a valid, enforceable agreement be­\ntween the parties but nevertheless leaves them without a\nremedy absent reliable evidence—a writing. See 1 id.,\n§1:21, at 82 (4th ed. 2007 and 2010 Supp.); 9 id., §21:5, at\n192. So also here, it is preferable to leave the parties\nwithout a remedy rather than risk the “potential injus­\ntice,” Valdez Fisheries, supra, at 669, of misjudging the\nsuperior-knowledge issue based on a distorted evidentiary\nrecord.\n   The Government suggested at oral argument that where\nthe parties stood at the time of suit was that petitioners\nhad been held in default, liable for the ensuing conse­\nquences. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49; see also Brief for\nUnited States 32, n. 9, 34–35. That had been the declara­\ntion of the contracting officer, pursuant to Chapter 9\n(entitled “Contract Disputes”) of Title 41 (entitled “Public\nContracts”). See 41 U. S. C. §605. It was “final and con­\nclusive . . . unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced.”\n§605(b). We regard that, however, as merely one step in\nthe contractual regime to which the parties had agreed. It\nhas no more bearing upon the question we are discussing\nthan would a provision in a private contract that declara­\ntion of default by one of the parties is final unless con­\ntested in court. The “position of the parties” in which we\nwill leave them is not their position with regard to legal\nburdens and the legal consequences of contract-related\ndeterminations, but with regard to possession of funds and\nproperty.\n                            III\n  Neither side will be entirely happy with the resolution\nwe reach today.

The language of\nthe A–12 agreement does not give us that option. It au­\nthorizes a court to convert a default termination into a\ntermination for convenience only if it “determine[s] that\nthe Contractor was not in default, or that the default\nwas excusable.” 48 CFR §52.249–9(g) (2010). Our opinion\ndoes not express a view on those issues. It holds them\nnonjusticiable.\n  Moreover, state secrets would make it impossible to\ncalculate petitioners’ damages. A termination for conven­\nience ordinarily entitles a contractor to recover its in­\ncurred costs of performance, reasonable termination ex­\npenses, and a reasonable profit on the work performed (or\nan offset to account for the contractor’s expected losses\nhad the contract been performed to completion). See\n§52.249–2(g). The CFC’s $1.2 billion award to petitioners\nin 1996 simply reflected their actual costs incurred minus\nprogress payments received. The CFC decided it could not\ncalculate petitioners’ expected losses (or profits) without\ndeciding the extent to which the Government’s alleged\nfailure to share its superior knowledge contributed to\npetitioners’ cost overruns—a nonjusticiable question. See\n37 Fed. Cl., at 285. Absent proof of the Government’s\nsuperior knowledge, and of how the sharing of that would\nhave made this a profitable contract, the $1.2 billion\naward might represent an undeserved windfall.\n  The Government, for its part, wants a return of the\n$1.35 billion it paid petitioners in progress payments for\nwork which it says it never approved. But the validity of\nthat claim depends upon whether petitioners are in de­\nfault on their contract. If they are not, termination for\nconvenience of the Government would entitle them to\nretain those progress payments (unless, of course, they\nwould have incurred a loss on the entire contract). Nei­\nther the question whether they are in default nor the\n12      GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion whether performance of the entire contract would\nhave left them with a loss can be judicially determined\nbecause of the valid assertion of the state-secret privilege.\n   We leave the parties where they are. As in Totten, see\n92 U. S., at 106, our refusal to enforce this contract cap­\ntures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or\nreasonably ought to have been. Both parties “must have\nunderstood,” ibid., that state secrets would prevent courts\nfrom resolving many possible disputes under the A–12\nagreement. The Government asked petitioners to develop\nan aircraft the design, materials, and manufacturing\nprocess for which would be closely guarded military se­\ncrets. See Contract Schedule H–1, App. 73–75; Contract\nSecurity Classified Specification, id., at 129–135. The\ncontract itself was a classified document at one point. See\nContract Schedule H–1, ¶8, id., at 75. Both parties—the\nGovernment no less than petitioners—must have assumed\nthe risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication\nof claims of inadequate performance.\n   We believe, moreover, that the impact of our ruling on\nthese particular cases (which we think produces rough,\nvery rough, equity) is probably much more significant than\nits impact in future cases, except to the extent that it\nrenders the law more predictable and hence more subject\nto accommodation by contracting parties. They can ne­\ngotiate, for example, the timing and amount of progress\npayments to account for the possibility that state secrets\nmay ultimately render the contract unenforceable. The\nGovernment’s concern that contractors will raise frivolous\nsuperior-knowledge defenses designed to goad the Gov­\nernment into asserting the state-secrets privilege is mis­\nplaced. To begin with, the rule we announce today applies\nonly when the superior-knowledge defense is supported by\nenough evidence to make out a prima facie case. More­\nover, Government contractors—especially cutting-edge\ndefense contractors of the sort likely to operate in the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate-secrets field—are repeat players. Even apart from\nthe judicial sanctions available to punish bad conduct,\nsee Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11, 26(g), they have strong incen­\ntive to behave rather than risk missing out on the next\nmultibillion-dollar defense contract. And finally, while we\nanticipate that the rule we set forth will ordinarily control\nGovernment-contract disputes that become nonjusticiable\nbecause of state secrets, what we promulgate today is not\na statute but a common-law opinion, which, after the\nfashion of the common law, is subject to further refine­\nment where relevant factors significantly different from\nthose before us here counsel a different outcome.\n   The foregoing analysis assumes that the Government\ngenerally has an obligation to share its superior knowl­\nedge, see GAF Corp., 932 F. 2d, at 949; the parties have\nnot challenged that assumption. The Government argued\nbelow, however, that it does not have that obligation with\nrespect to “highly classified information,” and does not\nhave it when (as was the case here) the agreement specifi­\ncally identifies information that must be shared. Brief for\nUnited States 52. The Court of Appeals did not address\nthose questions (it had no reason to, given its disposition\nof petitioners’ appeal), and we did not grant certiorari to\ndecide them. Those issues (and whether they can safely be\nlitigated without endangering state secrets) therefore\nremain for the Court of Appeals to address on remand.\n                         *     *     *\n   In Reynolds, we warned that the state-secrets eviden­\ntiary privilege “is not to be lightly invoked.” 345 U.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–1298. Argued January 18, 2011—Decided May 23, 2011*\nAfter petitioners fell behind schedule in developing a stealth aircraft\n  (A–12) for the Navy, the contracting officer terminated their $4.8 bil\n  lion fixed-price contract for default and ordered petitioners to repay\n  approximately $1.35 billion in progress payments for work the Gov\n  ernment never accepted. Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal\n  Claims (CFC), challenging the termination decision under the Con\n  tract Disputes Act of 1978. They argued that Federal Circuit prece\n  dent permitted their default to be excused because the Government\n  had failed to share its “superior knowledge” about how to design and\n  manufacture stealth aircraft. Uncovering the extent of such knowl\n  edge proved difficult because the design, materials, and manufactur\n  ing process for prior stealth aircraft, operated by the Air Force, are\n  closely guarded military secrets. After military secrets were dis\n  closed during discovery, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force warned\n  the CFC that further discovery into the extent of the Government’s\n  superior knowledge would risk disclosing classified information. The\n  CFC terminated such discovery and found the superior-knowledge\n  question nonjusticiable. The CFC subsequently converted the termi\n  nation into a less-Government-friendly termination for convenience\n  and awarded petitioners $1.2 billion. The Federal Circuit reversed.\n  On remand, the CFC sustained the default termination and reaf\n  firmed that petitioners’ superior-knowledge affirmative defense could\n  not be litigated. The Federal Circuit again reversed, but it found\n  that the state-secrets privilege prevented adjudicating petitioners’\n  superior-knowledge defense. On remand, the CFC again found peti\n——————\n * Together with No. 09–1302, Boeing Co., Successor to McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tioners had defaulted, and the Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: When, to protect state secrets, a court dismisses a Government\n contractor’s prima facie valid affirmative defense to the Govern\n ment’s allegations of contractual breach, the proper remedy is to\n leave the parties where they were on the day they filed suit. Pp. 5–\n 14.\n    (a) The CFC held that, since invocation of the state-secrets privi\n lege obscured too many of the facts relevant to the superior\n knowledge defense, the issue of that defense was nonjusticiable, even\n though petitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged evi\n dence for a prima facie showing. In this situation, the Court must\n exercise its common-law authority to fashion contractual remedies in\n Government-contracting disputes. The relevant state-secrets juris\n prudence comes not from United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1,\n which deals with the Government’s evidentiary privilege against\n court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets, but from Totten\n v. United States, 92 U. S. 105, and Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, two\n cases dealing with alleged contracts to spy.\n    Where liability depends on the validity of a plausible superior\n knowledge defense, and when full litigation of that defense “would\n inevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten, supra, at\n 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. It seems unrealistic to\n separate the claim from the defense, allowing the former to proceed\n while barring the latter. Claims and defenses together establish the\n justification, or lack of justification, for judicial relief; and when pub\n lic policy precludes judicial intervention for the one it should also\n preclude judicial intervention for the other. Suit on the contract, or\n for performance rendered or funds paid under the contract, will not\n lie, and courts should leave the parties to the agreement where they\n stood on the day they filed suit. The Government suggests that at\n the time of suit, petitioners had been held in default by the contract\n ing officer and were liable for the ensuing consequences. But that\n was merely one step in the parties’ contractual regime. The “position\n of the parties” at the time of suit is not their position with regard to\n legal burdens and the legal consequences of contract-related deter\n minations, but their position with regard to possession of funds and\n property. Pp. 5–10.\n    (b) Neither side will be entirely happy with this resolution. Gen\n eral Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants to turn the termination into\n one for convenience and reinstate the CFC’s $1.2 billion award, but\n that is not an option under the A–12 agreement. Moreover, state se\n crets would make it impossible to calculate petitioners’ damages.\n The Government wants a return of the $1.35 billion it paid petition\n ers for work never accepted, but the validity of that claim depends on\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Moreover, this ruling’s impact here is likely much more\n  significant than its impact in future cases, except to the extent that it\n  renders the law more predictable and hence more subject to accom\n  modation by contracting parties.

The A–12 proved\nunexpectedly difficult to design and manufacture, and by\nDecember 1990, petitioners were almost two years behind\nschedule and spending $120 to $150 million each month to\ndevelop the A–12.\n2       GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Petitioners informed the Government that the cost of\ncompleting the contract would exceed the contract price by\nan “ ‘unacceptable’ ” amount. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nUnited States, 567 F. 3d 1340, 1343 (CA Fed. 2009); see\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 182 F. 3d 1319,\n1323 (CA Fed. 1999). They proposed restructuring the\ncontract as a cost-reimbursement agreement and offered\nto absorb a $1.5 billion loss. The Department of Defense\nhad lost faith in the project, however, and Rear Admiral\nWilliam Morris, the Navy’s contracting officer for the A–12\nagreement, terminated the contract for default on Jan­\nuary 7, 1991.\n  By that point, petitioners had spent $3.88 billion at­\ntempting to develop the A–12, and the Government had\nprovided $2.68 billion in progress payments. A few weeks\nafter terminating the contract, the Navy sent petitioners a\nletter demanding the return of approximately $1.35 billion\nin progress payments for work never accepted by the\nGovernment. The parties later entered into a deferred\npayment agreement covering this amount.\n  Petitioners filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC) to challenge Admiral Morris’s termination decision\nunder the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2388, as\namended, 41 U. S. C. §609(a)(1). The Federal Circuit has\nrecognized a governmental obligation not to mislead con­\ntractors about, or silently withhold, its “superior knowl­\nedge” of difficult-to-discover information “vital” to contrac­\ntual performance. GAF Corp. v. United States, 932 F. 2d\n947, 949 (1991). Petitioners asserted that the Govern­\nment’s failure to share its “superior knowledge” about how\nto design and manufacture stealth aircraft excused their\ndefault (and also asserted other claims not relevant here).\n  Uncovering the extent of the Government’s prior experi­\nence with stealth technology proved difficult. The design,\nmaterials, and manufacturing process for two prior stealth\naircraft operated by the Air Force—the B–2 and the F–\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The Government\nnevertheless granted 10 members of petitioners’ litigation\nteam “access to the Secret/Special Access level of the B–2\nand F–117A programs.” Id., at 385. Four of those ten\nindividuals received access to even the most sensitive\naspects of the programs. See ibid.\n   That neither satisfied petitioners’ thirst for discovery\nnor prevented the unauthorized disclosure of military\nsecrets. In March 1993, Acting Secretary of the Air Force\nMichael Donley asserted the state-secrets privilege to bar\ndiscovery into certain aspects of stealth technology beyond\npetitioners’ “need-to-know” authorizations. At a deposi­\ntion that month, a former Navy official’s responses to\nquestions by petitioners and the Government revealed\nmilitary secrets neither side’s litigation team was author­\nized to know. Copies of the unclassified deposition were\nwidely distributed and quoted in unsealed court filings\nuntil Government security officials discovered the breach\na month later. A July 1993 deposition caused further\nunauthorized disclosures of military secrets.\n   These disclosures led Acting Secretary of the Air Force\nMerrill McPeak to file a declaration with the CFC. He\nwarned that further discovery into the extent of the Gov­\nernment’s superior knowledge “would present a continuing\nthreat of disclosure of . . . military and state secrets” sur­\nrounding the “weight, profile or signature, and materials\ninvolved in the design and construction of ‘stealt[h]’ . . .\naircraft and weapons systems.” Id., at 633, 635.

Both sides\nhad enough evidence to “present a persuasive case” on\nthe superior-knowledge issue, but the CFC worried that,\n“wit[h] numerous layers of potentially dispositive facts”\nhidden by the privilege, its superior-knowledge rulings\n“would be a sham,” McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United\nStates, 37 Fed. Cl. 270, 280, 284–285 (1996), and one that\nwould threaten national security, see id., at 281–282.\n   In 1996, for reasons not relevant here, the CFC con­\nverted the termination into a less-Government-friendly\ntermination for convenience and awarded petitioners $1.2\nbillion. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 35 Fed.\nCl. 358. The Federal Circuit reversed, 182 F. 3d, at 1332,\nand left it for the CFC to reconsider on remand whether\nthe need to protect military secrets precluded discovery\ninto the superior-knowledge issue, id., at 1329–1330.\n   After a 6-week trial, the CFC sustained the default\ntermination, McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States,\n50 Fed. Cl. 311, 326 (2001), and reaffirmed that the par­\nties could not safely litigate whether the Government’s\nsuperior knowledge excused petitioners’ default, id., at\n325. The Court of Appeals reversed the default termina­\ntion, but agreed that the state-secrets privilege prevented\nadjudicating whether the Government’s superior knowl­\nedge excused the default. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nUnited States, 323 F. 3d 1006, 1024 (CA Fed. 2003). It\nrejected petitioners’ assertion that the Government could\nnot pursue a claim against a party and then use the state­\nsecrets privilege to completely preempt defenses to that\nclaim; the Court of Appeals believed United States v.\nReynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 12 (1953), had already “rejected”\nthis “very argument.” 323 F. 3d, at 1023. Litigants can­\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n   Many of the Government’s efforts to protect our national\nsecurity are well known. It publicly acknowledges the size\nof our military, the location of our military bases, and the\nnames of our ambassadors to Moscow and Peking. But\nprotecting our national security sometimes requires keep­\ning information about our military, intelligence, and dip­\nlomatic efforts secret. See Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 307\n(1981); Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30–31 (1827). We\nhave recognized the sometimes-compelling necessity of\ngovernmental secrecy by acknowledging a Government\nprivilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and\nmilitary secrets.\n   In Reynolds, three civilian contractors died during a test\nflight of a B–29 bomber. Their widows filed wrongful­\ndeath suits against the Government and sought discovery\nof the Air Force’s accident-investigation report. Federal\ndiscovery rules, then as now, did not require production of\ndocuments protected by an evidentiary privilege. See 345\nU. S., at 6; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1). We held that\ndocuments that would disclose state secrets enjoyed such a\nprivilege; the state-secrets privilege, we said, had a “well\nestablished” pedigree “in the law of evidence.” 345 U. S.,\nat 6–7.\n   The penultimate paragraph of Reynolds rejected the\nwidows’ assertion that if the Government invoked the\n6      GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate-secrets privilege it had to abandon the claim to\nwhich the thereby privileged evidence was relevant. That\nwas, the widows observed, the price paid in criminal cases.\nIf the Government refuses to provide state-secret informa­\ntion that the accused reasonably asserts is necessary to\nhis defense, the prosecution must be dismissed. See id., at\n12; Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 672 (1957). The\npenultimate paragraph of Reynolds said that this was a\nfalse analogy. A like abandonment of the Government’s\nclaim is not the consequence “in a civil forum where the\nGovernment is not the moving party, but is a defendant\nonly on terms to which it has consented.” 345 U. S., at 12.\nBoth petitioners and the Court of Appeals rely upon this\nstatement to support their differing positions.\n   We think that Reynolds has less to do with these cases\nthan the parties believe—and its dictum (of course), less\nstill. Reynolds was about the admission of evidence. It\ndecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying eviden­\ntiary rules: The privileged information is excluded and the\ntrial goes on without it. That was to the detriment, of\ncourse, of the widows, whom the evidence would have\nfavored. But the Court did not order judgment in favor\nof the Government. Here, by contrast, the CFC decreed\nthe substantive result that since invocation of the state­\nsecrets privilege obscured too many of the facts relevant to\nthe superior-knowledge defense, the issue of that defense\nwas nonjusticiable, and the defense thus not available.\nSee 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. And that was so even though\npetitioners had brought forward enough unprivileged\nevidence to “make a prima facie showing.” Id., at 280.\n   While we disagree, for reasons set forth below, with the\nCFC’s disposition of the remainder of the case, its percep­\ntion that in the present context the state-secrets issue\nraises something quite different from a mere evidentiary\npoint seems to us sound. What we are called upon to\nexercise is not our power to determine the procedural\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrules of evidence, but our common-law authority to fashion\ncontractual remedies in Government-contracting disputes.\nSee Priebe & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 332 U. S. 407,\n411 (1947). And our state-secrets jurisprudence bearing\nupon that authority is not Reynolds, but two cases dealing\nwith alleged contracts to spy.\n   In Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105 (1876), the\nadministrator of a self-styled Civil War spy’s estate\nbrought a breach-of-contract suit against the United\nStates. He alleged that his testator had entered into a\ncontract with President Lincoln to spy on the Confederacy\nin exchange for $200 a month. After the war ended, the\nUnited States reimbursed expenses but did not pay the\nmonthly salary. We recognized that the estate had a\npotentially valid breach-of-contract claim but dismissed\nthe suit. The contract was for “a secret service,” and\nlitigating the details of that service would risk exposing\nsecret operations and other clandestine operatives “to the\nserious detriment of the public.” Id., at 106–107. “[P]ublic\npolicy,” we held, “forbids the maintenance of any suit . . .\nthe trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of\nmatters which the law itself regards as confidential, and\nrespecting which it will not allow the confidence to be\nviolated.” Id., at 107.\n   Six years ago, we reaffirmed that “public policy for­\nb[ids]” suits “based on covert espionage agreements.”\nTenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 3 (2005). Such suits threaten to\nundermine ongoing intelligence-gathering and covert\noperations—two vital aspects of national security—\nthrough inadvertent exposure of espionage relationships.\nId., at 11. Rather than tempt fate, we leave the parties to\nan espionage agreement where we found them the day\nthey filed suit.\n   We think a similar situation obtains here, and that the\nsame consequence should follow. Where liability depends\nupon the validity of a plausible superior-knowledge de­\n8         GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfense, and when full litigation of that defense “would\ninevitably lead to the disclosure of” state secrets, Totten,\nsupra, at 107, neither party can obtain judicial relief. As\nthe CFC concluded, that is the situation here. Disclosure\nof state secrets occurred twice before the CFC terminated\ndiscovery. See 37 Fed. Cl., at 277–278. Every document\nrequest or question to a witness would risk further disclo­\nsure, since both sides have an incentive to probe up to\nthe boundaries of state secrets. State secrets can also be\nindirectly disclosed. Each assertion of the privilege can\nprovide another clue about the Government’s covert pro­\ngrams or capabilities. See Fitzgerald v. Penthouse Inter\nnational, Ltd., 776 F. 2d 1236, 1243, and n. 10 (CA4 1985).\nFor instance, the fact that the Government had to con­\ntinue asserting the privilege after granting petitioners\naccess to B–2 and F–117A program information suggests\nit had other, possibly covert stealth programs in the 1980’s\nand early 1990’s.\n   It seems to us unrealistic to separate, as the CFC did,\nthe claim from the defense, and to allow the former to\nproceed while the latter is barred. It is claims and de­\nfenses together that establish the justification, or lack of\njustification, for judicial relief; and when public policy\nprecludes judicial intervention for the one it should pre­\nclude judicial intervention for the other as well.* If, in\nTotten, it had been the Government seeking return of\nfunds that the estate claimed had been received in pay­\nment for espionage activities, it would have been the\nheight of injustice to deny the defense because of the\nGovernment’s invocation of state-secret protection, but to\n——————\n  *Of course, this does not mean the nonjusticiability of one aspect\nof a case will necessarily end the entire litigation. If, for example, the\nGovernment asserts two justifications for its default termination, and if\nstate secrets deprive the contractor of a prima facie valid defense to\nonly one of those claims, the court can still adjudicate the validity of the\nother.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Judicial refusal to enforce promises\ncontrary to public policy (here, the Government’s alleged\npromise to provide superior knowledge, which we could\nnot determine was breached without penetrating several\nlayers of state secrets) is not unknown to the common law,\nand the traditional course is to leave the parties where\nthey stood when they knocked on the courthouse door.\n   “In general, if a court will not, on grounds of public\npolicy, aid a promisee by enforcing the promise, it will not\naid him by granting him restitution for performance that\nhe has rendered in return for the unenforceable promise.\nNeither will it aid the promisor by allowing a claim in\nrestitution for performance that he has rendered under\nthe unenforceable promise. It will simply leave both\nparties as it finds them, even though this may result in\none of them retaining a benefit that he has received as\na result of the transaction.” 2 Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §197, Comment a, p. 71 (1979); see, e.g., Worlton\nv. Davis, 73 Idaho 217, 222–223, 249 P. 2d 810, 814 (1952).\n   These cases differ from the common-law cases that we\nknow, in that the unenforceability did not exist at the time\nthe contract was formed, See 2 Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §179, Comment d, at 18, but arose because\nof the Government’s assertion of the state-secrets privilege\nthat rendered the promise of superior knowledge unadju­\ndicable. We do not see why that should affect the remedy.\nSuit on the contract, or for performance rendered or funds\npaid under the contract, will not lie, and the parties will\nbe left where they are.\n   The law of contracts contains another doctrine that\nrelates to the CFC’s concern about the reliability of its\njudgment “without numerous layers of potentially disposi­\ntive facts,” 37 Fed. Cl., at 284–285. The Statute of Frauds,\nwhich has been with us since the 17th century, reflects\nconcerns about the reliability of oral evidence. See Valdez\n10     GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFisheries Development Assn., Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv.\nCo., 45 P. 3d 657, 669 (Alaska 2002); 9 R. Lord, Williston\non Contracts §21:1, pp. 170–172 (4th ed. 1999 and 2010\nSupp.). It assumes a valid, enforceable agreement be­\ntween the parties but nevertheless leaves them without a\nremedy absent reliable evidence—a writing. See 1 id.,\n§1:21, at 82 (4th ed. 2007 and 2010 Supp.); 9 id., §21:5, at\n192. So also here, it is preferable to leave the parties\nwithout a remedy rather than risk the “potential injus­\ntice,” Valdez Fisheries, supra, at 669, of misjudging the\nsuperior-knowledge issue based on a distorted evidentiary\nrecord.\n   The Government suggested at oral argument that where\nthe parties stood at the time of suit was that petitioners\nhad been held in default, liable for the ensuing conse­\nquences. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49; see also Brief for\nUnited States 32, n. 9, 34–35. That had been the declara­\ntion of the contracting officer, pursuant to Chapter 9\n(entitled “Contract Disputes”) of Title 41 (entitled “Public\nContracts”). See 41 U. S. C. §605. It was “final and con­\nclusive . . . unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced.”\n§605(b). We regard that, however, as merely one step in\nthe contractual regime to which the parties had agreed. It\nhas no more bearing upon the question we are discussing\nthan would a provision in a private contract that declara­\ntion of default by one of the parties is final unless con­\ntested in court. The “position of the parties” in which we\nwill leave them is not their position with regard to legal\nburdens and the legal consequences of contract-related\ndeterminations, but with regard to possession of funds and\nproperty.\n                            III\n  Neither side will be entirely happy with the resolution\nwe reach today. General Dynamics (but not Boeing) wants\nus to convert the termination into one for convenience and\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreinstate the CFC’s $1.2 billion damages award. See Brief\nfor Petitioner in No. 09–1298, pp. 58–61. The language of\nthe A–12 agreement does not give us that option. It au­\nthorizes a court to convert a default termination into a\ntermination for convenience only if it “determine[s] that\nthe Contractor was not in default, or that the default\nwas excusable.” 48 CFR §52.249–9(g) (2010). Our opinion\ndoes not express a view on those issues. It holds them\nnonjusticiable.\n  Moreover, state secrets would make it impossible to\ncalculate petitioners’ damages. A termination for conven­\nience ordinarily entitles a contractor to recover its in­\ncurred costs of performance, reasonable termination ex­\npenses, and a reasonable profit on the work performed (or\nan offset to account for the contractor’s expected losses\nhad the contract been performed to completion). See\n§52.249–2(g). The CFC’s $1.2 billion award to petitioners\nin 1996 simply reflected their actual costs incurred minus\nprogress payments received. The CFC decided it could not\ncalculate petitioners’ expected losses (or profits) without\ndeciding the extent to which the Government’s alleged\nfailure to share its superior knowledge contributed to\npetitioners’ cost overruns—a nonjusticiable question. See\n37 Fed. Cl., at 285. Absent proof of the Government’s\nsuperior knowledge, and of how the sharing of that would\nhave made this a profitable contract, the $1.2 billion\naward might represent an undeserved windfall.\n  The Government, for its part, wants a return of the\n$1.35 billion it paid petitioners in progress payments for\nwork which it says it never approved. But the validity of\nthat claim depends upon whether petitioners are in de­\nfault on their contract. If they are not, termination for\nconvenience of the Government would entitle them to\nretain those progress payments (unless, of course, they\nwould have incurred a loss on the entire contract). Nei­\nther the question whether they are in default nor the\n12      GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion whether performance of the entire contract would\nhave left them with a loss can be judicially determined\nbecause of the valid assertion of the state-secret privilege.\n   We leave the parties where they are. As in Totten, see\n92 U. S., at 106, our refusal to enforce this contract cap­\ntures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or\nreasonably ought to have been. Both parties “must have\nunderstood,” ibid., that state secrets would prevent courts\nfrom resolving many possible disputes under the A–12\nagreement. The Government asked petitioners to develop\nan aircraft the design, materials, and manufacturing\nprocess for which would be closely guarded military se­\ncrets. See Contract Schedule H–1, App. 73–75; Contract\nSecurity Classified Specification, id., at 129–135. The\ncontract itself was a classified document at one point. See\nContract Schedule H–1, ¶8, id., at 75. Both parties—the\nGovernment no less than petitioners—must have assumed\nthe risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication\nof claims of inadequate performance.\n   We believe, moreover, that the impact of our ruling on\nthese particular cases (which we think produces rough,\nvery rough, equity) is probably much more significant than\nits impact in future cases, except to the extent that it\nrenders the law more predictable and hence more subject\nto accommodation by contracting parties. They can ne­\ngotiate, for example, the timing and amount of progress\npayments to account for the possibility that state secrets\nmay ultimately render the contract unenforceable. The\nGovernment’s concern that contractors will raise frivolous\nsuperior-knowledge defenses designed to goad the Gov­\nernment into asserting the state-secrets privilege is mis­\nplaced. To begin with, the rule we announce today applies\nonly when the superior-knowledge defense is supported by\nenough evidence to make out a prima facie case. More­\nover, Government contractors—especially cutting-edge\ndefense contractors of the sort likely to operate in the\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate-secrets field—are repeat players. Even apart from\nthe judicial sanctions available to punish bad conduct,\nsee Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11, 26(g), they have strong incen­\ntive to behave rather than risk missing out on the next\nmultibillion-dollar defense contract. And finally, while we\nanticipate that the rule we set forth will ordinarily control\nGovernment-contract disputes that become nonjusticiable\nbecause of state secrets, what we promulgate today is not\na statute but a common-law opinion, which, after the\nfashion of the common law, is subject to further refine­\nment where relevant factors significantly different from\nthose before us here counsel a different outcome.\n   The foregoing analysis assumes that the Government\ngenerally has an obligation to share its superior knowl­\nedge, see GAF Corp., 932 F. 2d, at 949; the parties have\nnot challenged that assumption. The Government argued\nbelow, however, that it does not have that obligation with\nrespect to “highly classified information,” and does not\nhave it when (as was the case here) the agreement specifi­\ncally identifies information that must be shared. Brief for\nUnited States 52. The Court of Appeals did not address\nthose questions (it had no reason to, given its disposition\nof petitioners’ appeal), and we did not grant certiorari to\ndecide them. Those issues (and whether they can safely be\nlitigated without endangering state secrets) therefore\nremain for the Court of Appeals to address on remand.\n                         *     *     *\n   In Reynolds, we warned that the state-secrets eviden­\ntiary privilege “is not to be lightly invoked.” 345 U. S., at\n7. Courts should be even more hesitant to declare a Gov­\nernment contract unenforceable because of state secrets.\nIt is the option of last resort, available in a very narrow\nset of circumstances.
