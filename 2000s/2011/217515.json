WHITING ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 09–115.      Argued December 8, 2010—Decided May 26, 2011\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) makes it “unlawful\n  for a person or other entity . . . to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee,\n  for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an\n  unauthorized alien.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). Employers that vio\n  late that prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal\n  sanctions. IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em\n  ployment of unauthorized workers; the Act expressly preempts “any\n  State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than\n  through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or re\n  cruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”\n  §1324a(h)(2).\n     IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employee’s\n  eligibility for employment. In an attempt to improve that verification\n  process in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi\n  bility Act (IIRIRA), Congress created E-Verify—an internet-based\n  system employers can use to check the work authorization status of\n  employees.\n     Against this statutory background, several States have recently\n  enacted laws attempting to impose sanctions for the employment of\n  unauthorized aliens through, among other things, “licensing and\n  similar laws.” Arizona is one of them. The Legal Arizona Workers\n  Act provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or\n  intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain cir\n  cumstances must be, suspended or revoked. That law also requires\n  that all Arizona employers use E-Verify.\n     The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various busi\n  ness and civil rights organizations (collectively Chamber) filed this\n2        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                    AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                         Syllabus \n\n\n    federal preenforcement suit against those charged with administer\n    ing the Arizona law, arguing that the state law’s license suspension\n    and revocation provisions were both expressly and impliedly pre\n    empted by federal immigration law, and that the mandatory use of E-\n    Verify was impliedly preempted. The District Court found that the\n    plain language of IRCA’s preemption clause did not invalidate the\n    Arizona law because the law did no more than impose licensing con\n    ditions on businesses operating within the State. Nor was the state\n    law preempted with respect to E-Verify, the court concluded, because\n    although Congress had made the program voluntary at the national\n    level, it had expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating\n    participation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n558 F. 3d 856, affirmed.\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to Parts I and II–A, concluding that Arizona’s licensing law is not ex\n  pressly preempted.\n     Arizona’s licensing law falls well within the confines of the author\n  ity Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not ex\n  pressly preempted. While IRCA prohibits States from imposing “civil\n  or criminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it\n  preserves state authority to impose sanctions “through licensing and\n  similar laws.” §1324a(h)(2). That is what the Arizona law does—it\n  instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state\n  employers that employ unauthorized aliens. The definition of “li\n  cense” contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition\n  of “license” that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure\n  Act (APA).\n     The state statute also includes within its definition of “license”\n  documents such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partner\n  ship, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact busi\n  ness in the State, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9), each of which has\n  clear counterparts in APA and dictionary definitions of the word “li\n  cense.” And even if a law regulating articles of incorporation and the\n  like is not itself a “licensing law,” it is at the very least “similar” to\n  one, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause. The\n  Chamber’s argument that the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law be\n  cause it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to\n  grant them is without basis in law, fact, or logic.\n     The Chamber contends that the savings clause should apply only to\n  certain types of licenses or only to license revocation following an\n  IRCA adjudication because Congress, when enacting IRCA, elimi\n  nated unauthorized worker prohibitions and associated adjudication\n  procedures in another federal statute. But no such limits are even\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nremotely discernible in the statutory text.\n   The Chamber’s reliance on IRCA’s legislative history to bolster its\ntextual and structural arguments is unavailing given the Court’s\nconclusion that Arizona’s law falls within the plain text of the savings\nclause. Pp. 9–15.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\nand JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part II–B:\n   The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal\nlaw. At its broadest, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress in\ntended the federal system to be exclusive. But Arizona’s procedures\nsimply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the\nStates to pursue through licensing laws. Given that Congress spe\ncifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason\nthat Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appro\npriate tools to exercise that authority.\n   And here Arizona’s law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all ma\nterial respects. For example, it adopts the federal definition of who\nqualifies as an “unauthorized alien,” compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3)\nwith Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11); provides that state investiga\ntors must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized\nalien with the Federal Government, making no independent deter\nmination of the matter, §23–212(B); and requires a state court to\n“consider only the federal government’s determination,” §23–212(H).\n   The Chamber’s more general contention that the Arizona law is\npreempted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to\nstrike in IRCA also fails. The cases on which the Chamber relies in\nmaking this argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest,\nsee, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341.\nRegulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not such an\narea. And those cases all concern state actions that directly inter\nfered with the operation of a federal program, see, e.g., id., at 351.\nThere is no similar interference here.\n   The Chamber asserts that employers will err on the side of dis\ncrimination rather than risk the “ ‘business death penalty’ ” by “hir\ning unauthorized workers.” That is not the choice. License termina\ntion is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized\nworkers, but is triggered only by far more egregious violations. And\nbecause the Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional viola\ntions, an employer acting in good faith need not fear the law’s sanc\ntions. Moreover, federal and state antidiscrimination laws protect\nagainst employment discrimination and provide employers with a\nstrong incentive not to discriminate. Employers also enjoy safe har\nbors from liability when using E-Verify as required by the Arizona\nlaw. The most rational path for employers is to obey both the law\n4        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                    AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                         Syllabus \n\n\n    barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibit\n    ing discrimination. There is no reason to suppose that Arizona em\n    ployers will choose not to do so. Pp. 15–22.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n    to Part III–A, concluding that Arizona’s E-Verify mandate is not im\n    pliedly preempted.\n       Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify is not impliedly\n    preempted. The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no\n    language circumscribing state action. It does, however, constrain\n    federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, “the Secretary\n    of Homeland Security may not require any person or . . . entity” out\n    side the Federal Government “to participate in” E-Verify. IIRIRA,\n    §402(a), (e). The fact that the Federal Government may require the\n    use of E-Verify in only limited circumstances says nothing about\n    what the States may do. The Government recently argued just that\n    in another case and approvingly referenced Arizona’s law as an ex\n    ample of a permissible use of E-Verify when doing so.\n       Moreover, Arizona’s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the fed\n    eral scheme. The state law requires no more than that an employer,\n    after hiring an employee, “verify the employment eligibility of the\n    employee” through E-Verify. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214(A). And\n    the consequences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state\n    and federal law—an employer forfeits an otherwise available rebut\n    table presumption of compliance with the law. Pp. 23–24.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n    and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part III–B:\n       Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify in no way ob\n    structs achieving the aims of the federal program. In fact, the Gov\n    ernment has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of E-\n    Verify, and Congress has directed that E-Verify be made available in\n    all 50 States. And the Government has expressly rejected the Cham\n    ber’s claim that the Arizona law, and those like it, will overload the\n    federal system. Pp. 24–25.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

C. §1324a(h)(2).\nA recently enacted Arizona statute—the Legal Arizona\nWorkers Act—provides that the licenses of state employ\ners that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized\naliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, sus\npended or revoked.       The law also requires that all\nArizona employers use a federal electronic verification\nsystem to confirm that the workers they employ are\nlegally authorized workers. The question presented is\nwhether federal immigration law preempts those provi\nsions of Arizona law.

WHITING \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnot otherwise conflict with federal law, we hold that the\nArizona law is not preempted.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   In 1952, Congress enacted the Immigration and Nation\nality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1101\net seq. That statute established a “comprehensive federal\nstatutory scheme for regulation of immigration and natu\nralization” and set “the terms and conditions of admission\nto the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens\nlawfully in the country.” De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351,\n353, 359 (1976).\n   In the years following the enactment of the INA, several\nStates took action to prohibit the employment of indi\nviduals living within state borders who were not lawful\nresidents of the United States. For example, in 1971 Cali\nfornia passed a law providing that “[n]o employer shall\nknowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful\nresidence in the United States if such employment would\nhave an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.” 1971\nCal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1(a). The California law imposed\nfines ranging from $200 to $500 for each violation of this\nprohibition. §1(b). At least 11 other States enacted provi\nsions during that same time period proscribing the em\nployment of unauthorized aliens.1\n   We first addressed the interaction of federal immigra\ntion law and state laws dealing with the employment of\nunauthorized aliens in De Canas, 424 U.

S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). IRCA defines an\n“unauthorized alien” as an alien who is not “lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence” or not otherwise au\nthorized by the Attorney General to be employed in the\nUnited States. §1324a(h)(3).\n  To facilitate compliance with this prohibition, IRCA\nrequires that employers review documents establishing\nan employee’s eligibility for employment. §1324a(b). An\nemployer can confirm an employee’s authorization to work\nby reviewing the employee’s United States passport, resi\ndent alien card, alien registration card, or other document\napproved by the Attorney General; or by reviewing a\ncombination of other documents such as a driver’s license\nand social security card. §1324a(b)(1)(B)–(D). The em\nployer must attest under penalty of perjury on Depart\nment of Homeland Security Form I–9 that he “has verified\n4     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat the individual is not an unauthorized alien” by re\nviewing these documents. §1324a(b)(1)(A). The form I–9\nitself “and any information contained in or appended to [it]\n. . . may not be used for purposes other than for enforce\nment of” IRCA and other specified provisions of federal\nlaw. §1324a(b)(5).\n    Employers that violate IRCA’s strictures may be sub\njected to both civil and criminal sanctions. Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, an entity within the Depart\nment of Homeland Security, is authorized to bring charges\nagainst a noncompliant employer under §1324a(e). De\npending on the circumstances of the violation, a civil fine\nranging from $250 to $16,000 per unauthorized worker\nmay be imposed. See §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136\n(2008). Employers that engage in a pattern or practice\nof violating IRCA’s requirements can be criminally prose\ncuted, fined, and imprisoned for up to six months.\n§1324a(f)(1). The Act also imposes fines for engaging in\n“unfair immigration-related employment practice[s]” such\nas discriminating on the basis of citizenship or national\norigin. §1324b(a)(1); see §1324b(g)(2)(B). Good-faith com\npliance with IRCA’s I–9 document review requirements\nprovides an employer with an affirmative defense if\ncharged with a §1324a violation. §1324a(a)(3).\n    IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em\nployment of unauthorized workers. The Act expressly\npreempts “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal\nsanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws)\nupon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for\nemployment, unauthorized aliens.” §1324a(h)(2). Under\nthat provision, state laws imposing civil fines for the\nemployment of unauthorized workers like the one we\nupheld in De Canas are now expressly preempted.\n    In 1996, in an attempt to improve IRCA’s employment\nverification system, Congress created three experimental\ncomplements to the I–9 process as part of the Illegal Im\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Originally known as the\n“Basic Pilot Program,” E-Verify “is an internet-based\nsystem that allows an employer to verify an employee’s\nwork-authorization status.” Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc.\nv. Napolitano, 558 F. 3d 856, 862 (CA9 2009). An em\nployer submits a request to the E-Verify system based on\ninformation that the employee provides similar to that\nused in the I–9 process. In response to that request,\nthe employer receives either a confirmation or a tentative\nnonconfirmation of the employee’s authorization to work.\nAn employee may challenge a nonconfirmation report. If\nthe employee does not do so, or if his challenge is unsuc\ncessful, his employment must be terminated or the Fed\neral Government must be informed. See ibid.\n    In the absence of a prior violation of certain federal\nlaws, IIRIRA prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Secu\nrity from “requir[ing] any person or . . . entity” outside the\nFederal Government “to participate in” the E-Verify pro\ngram, §402(a), (e), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–658. To\npromote use of the program, however, the statute provides\nthat any employer that utilizes E-Verify “and obtains\nconfirmation of identity and employment eligibility in\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the program\n. . . has established a rebuttable presumption” that it has\nnot violated IRCA’s unauthorized alien employment pro\nhibition, §402(b)(1), id., at 3009–656 to 3009–657.\n                             B\n  Acting against this statutory and historical background,\nseveral States have recently enacted laws attempting to\nimpose sanctions for the employment of unauthorized\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§23–211, 212, 212.01 (West Supp. 2010) (citing 8\nU. S. C. §1324a).\n   Under the Arizona law, if an individual files a complaint\nalleging that an employer has hired an unauthorized\nalien, the attorney general or the county attorney first\nverifies the employee’s work authorization with the Fed\neral Government pursuant to 8 U.

Section 1373(c) provides that\nthe Federal Government “shall respond to an inquiry by a”\nState “seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or\nimmigration status of any individual . . . by providing the\nrequested verification or status information.” The Arizona\nlaw expressly prohibits state, county, or local officials from\nattempting “to independently make a final determination\non whether an alien is authorized to work in the United\nStates.” Ariz.

S. 658, 664 (1993).\n  IRCA expressly preempts States from imposing “civil or\ncriminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized\naliens, “other than through licensing and similar laws.” 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The Arizona law, on its face, pur\nports to impose sanctions through licensing laws. The\nstate law authorizes state courts to suspend or revoke an\nemployer’s business licenses if that employer knowingly or\nintentionally employs an unauthorized alien. Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §23–212(A) and (F); §23–212.01(A) and (F).\nThe Arizona law defines “license” as “any agency permit,\n10     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

That definition largely parrots\nthe definition of “license” that Congress codified in the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)\n(“ ‘license’ includes the whole or a part of an agency per\nmit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, member\nship, statutory exemption or other form of permission”).\n    Apart from that general definition, the Arizona law\nspecifically includes within its definition of “license” docu\nments such as articles of incorporation, certificates of\npartnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies\nto transact business in the State. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§23–211(9). These examples have clear counterparts in\nthe APA definition just quoted. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)\n(defining “license” as including a “registration” or “charter”).\n    A license is “a right or permission granted in accordance\nwith law . . . to engage in some business or occupation, to\ndo some act, or to engage in some transaction which but\nfor such license would be unlawful.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1304 (2002). Articles of incorpo\nration and certificates of partnership allow the formation\nof legal entities and permit them as such to engage in\nbusiness and transactions “which but for such” authoriza\ntion “would be unlawful.” Ibid.; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§§10–302, 302(11) (West 2004) (articles of incorporation\nallow a corporation “to carry out its business and affairs”\nand to “[c]onduct its business”); see also §10–202(A)(3)\n(West Supp. 2010). As for state-issued authorizations for\nforeign businesses to operate within a State, we have re\npeatedly referred to those as “licenses.” See, e.g., Heli\ncopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n408, 417 (1984); G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404,\n413, n. 8 (1982); Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown\nCo., 260 U. S. 516, 518 (1923).

S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2).5\n   The Chamber and the United States as amicus argue\nthat the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law because it\noperates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than\nto grant them. Again, this construction of the term runs\ncontrary to the definition that Congress itself has codified.\nSee 5 U. S. C. §551(9) (“ ‘licensing’ includes agency process\nrespecting the grant, renewal, denial, revocation, sus\npension, annulment, withdrawal, limitation, amendment,\nmodification, or conditioning of a license” (emphasis\nadded)). It is also contrary to common sense. There is no\nbasis in law, fact, or logic for deeming a law that grants\nlicenses a licensing law, but a law that suspends or re\nvokes those very licenses something else altogether.\n\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE BREYER recognizes that Arizona’s definition of the word\n\n“license” comports with dictionaries’ treatment of the term, but argues\nthat “license” must be read in a more restricted way so as not to include\nthings such as “marriage licenses” and “dog licens[es].” Post, at 2, 12\n(dissenting opinion). Luckily, we need not address such fanciful hy\npotheticals; Arizona limits its definition of “license” to those state per\nmissions issued “for the purposes of operating a business” in the\nState. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9)(a) (West Supp. 2010).\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s primary concern appears to be that state permis\nsions such as articles of incorporation and partnership certificates are\ntreated as “licensing and similar laws.” Because myriad other licenses\nare required to operate a business, that concern is largely academic.\nSee §42–5005(A) (West 2006) (Corporations that receive “gross proceeds\nof sales or gross income upon which a privilege tax is imposed . . . shall\nmake application to the department for a privilege license.” Such a\ncorporation “shall not engage or continue in business until the [corpora\ntion] has obtained a privilege license.”). Suspending or revoking an\nemployer’s articles of incorporation will often be entirely redundant.\nSee §§42–5010, 5061–5076 (West 2006 and West Supp. 2010) (describ\ning when transaction privilege tax licenses are required).\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The Chamber also submits that the manner in which\nCongress amended a related statute when enacting IRCA\nsupports a narrow interpretation of the savings clause.\nThe Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection\nAct (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. §1801 et seq., requires employers\nto secure a registration certificate from the Department\nof Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting\nactivity.” §1811(a). Prior to IRCA, AWPA had contained\nits own prohibition on hiring unauthorized workers, with\naccompanying adjudication procedures. See §1813(a);\n§1816(a) (1982 ed.) (repealed by IRCA, 100 Stat. 3372);\n§1851(a)–(b) (1982 ed.) (amended by IRCA, 100 Stat.\n3372). When Congress enacted IRCA, it repealed AWPA’s\nseparate unauthorized worker prohibition and eliminated\nthe associated adjudication process. Under the current\nstate of the law, an AWPA certification may be denied\nbased on a prior IRCA violation. §1813(a)(6) (2006 ed.).\nAnd once obtained, that certification can be revoked be\ncause of the employment of an unauthorized alien only\nfollowing a finding of an IRCA violation. Ibid.\n   The Chamber asserts that IRCA’s amendment of AWPA\nshows that Congress meant to allow state licensing sanc\ntions only after a federal IRCA adjudication, just as ad\nverse action under AWPA can now be taken only through\nIRCA’s procedures. But the text of IRCA’s savings clause\nsays nothing about state licensing sanctions being contin\ngent on prior federal adjudication, or indeed about state\nlicensing processes at all. The simple fact that federal law\ncreates procedures for federal investigations and adjudica\ntions culminating in federal civil or criminal sanctions\ndoes not indicate that Congress intended to prevent States\nfrom establishing their own procedures for imposing\ntheir own sanctions through licensing. Were AWPA not\namended to conform with IRCA, two different federal\nagencies would be responsible for administering two dif\nferent unauthorized alien employment laws. The conform\n                Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)         13\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ning amendments eliminated that potential redundancy\nand centralized federal adjudicatory authority. That\nhardly supports a conclusion that any state licensing\nprograms must also be contingent on the central federal\nsystem.\n   In much the same vein, the Chamber argues that Con\ngress’s repeal of “AWPA’s separate prohibition concerning\nunauthorized workers belies any suggestion that IRCA\nmeant to authorize each of the 50 States . . . to impose\nits own separate prohibition,” and that Congress instead\nwanted uniformity in immigration law enforcement. Brief\nfor Petitioners 36. JUSTICE BREYER also objects to the\ndeparture from “one centralized enforcement scheme”\nunder federal law. Post, at 7 (dissenting opinion). But\nCongress expressly preserved the ability of the States to\nimpose their own sanctions through licensing; that—like\nour federal system in general—necessarily entails the\nprospect of some departure from homogeneity. And as for\n“separate prohibition[s],” it is worth recalling that the\nArizona licensing law is based exclusively on the federal\nprohibition—a court reviewing a complaint under the\nArizona law may “consider only the federal government’s\ndetermination” with respect to “whether an employee is an\nunauthorized alien.” §23–212(H).\n   Even more boldly, the Chamber contends that IRCA’s\nsavings clause was intended to allow States to impose\nlicensing sanctions solely on AWPA-related farm contract\ning licensees. AWPA specifically recognized that federal\nregulation of farm contracting licensing was only “in\ntended to supplement State law,” 29 U. S. C. §1871, and\nthe Chamber argues that the purpose of IRCA’s savings\nclause was limited to preserving existing state farm con\ntractor licensing programs. But here again no such limit\nis remotely discernible in the statutory text. Absent any\ntextual basis, we are not inclined to limit so markedly\nthe otherwise broad phrasing of the savings clause. See\n14      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                   AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nUnited States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287\nU. S. 77, 83 (1932) (“extrinsic aids to construction” may be\nused “to solve, but not to create, an ambiguity” (emphasis\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Chamber argues that its textual and structural\narguments are bolstered by IRCA’s legislative history. We\nhave already concluded that Arizona’s law falls within the\nplain text of IRCA’s savings clause. And, as we have said\nbefore, Congress’s “authoritative statement is the statu\ntory text, not the legislative history.” Exxon Mobil Corp.\nv. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see\nalso Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S.\n137, 149–150, n. 4 (2002). Whatever the usefulness of\nrelying on legislative history materials in general, the\narguments against doing so are particularly compelling\nhere. Beyond verbatim recitation of the statutory text, all\nof the legislative history documents related to IRCA save\none fail to discuss the savings clause at all. The Senate\nJudiciary Committee Report on the Senate version of\nthe law does not comment on it. See S. Rep. No. 99–132\n(1985). Only one of the four House Reports on the law\ntouches on the licensing exception, see H. R. Rep. No. 99–\n682, pt. 1, p. 58 (1986), and we have previously dismissed\nthat very report as “a rather slender reed” from “one\nHouse of a politically divided Congress.” Hoffman, supra,\nat 149–150, n. 4. And the Conference Committee Report\ndoes not discuss the scope of IRCA’s preemption provision\nin any way. See H. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000 (1986).6\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE   BREYER poses several rhetorical questions challenging our\nreading of IRCA and then goes on to propose two seemingly alternative\nviews of the phrase “licensing and similar laws”—that it was meant to\nrefer to “employment-related licensing systems,” post, at 11 (dissenting\nopinion) (emphasis deleted), or, even more narrowly, to “the licensing of\nfirms in the business of recruiting or referring workers for employment,\nsuch as . . . state agricultural labor contractor licensing schemes,” post,\nat 13.

J.\n                         Opinion R the Court\n\n  IRCA expressly preempts some state powers dealing\nwith the employment of unauthorized aliens and it ex\npressly preserves others. We hold that Arizona’s licensing\nlaw falls well within the confines of the authority Con\ngress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not\nexpressly preempted.\n                             B\n  As an alternative to its express preemption argument,\nthe Chamber contends that Arizona’s law is impliedly\npreempted because it conflicts with federal law. At its\nbroadest level, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress\n“intended the federal system to be exclusive,” and that any\nstate system therefore necessarily conflicts with federal\nlaw. Brief for Petitioners 39. But Arizona’s procedures\nsimply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly\nallowed Arizona to pursue through licensing laws. Given\nthat Congress specifically preserved such authority for the\nStates, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to\nprevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise\n\n——————\nCongress had intended such limited exceptions to its prohibition on\nstate sanctions, it did not simply say so, instead of excepting “licensing\nand similar laws” generally?\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR takes a different tack. Invoking arguments that\nresemble those found in our implied preemption cases, she concludes\nthat the Arizona law “falls outside” the savings clause and is expressly\npreempted because it allows “state courts to determine whether a\nperson has employed an unauthorized alien.” Post, at 2 (dissenting\nopinion). While JUSTICE BREYER would add language to the statute\nnarrowly limiting the phrase “licensing and similar laws” to specific\ntypes of licenses, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR creates an entirely new statutory\nrequirement: She would allow States to impose sanctions through\n“licensing and similar laws” only after a federal adjudication. Such a\nrequirement is found nowhere in the text, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR does\nnot even attempt to link it to a specific textual provision.\n   It should not be surprising that the two dissents have sharply differ\nent views on how to read the statute. That is the sort of thing that can\nhappen when statutory analysis is so untethered from the text.\n16      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                   AMERICA v.

J.\n                    Opinion R the Court\n\nthat authority.\n   And here Arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that\nits law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all material\nrespects. The Arizona law begins by adopting the federal\ndefinition of who qualifies as an “unauthorized alien.”\nCompare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3) (an “unauthorized alien”\nis an alien not “lawfully admitted for permanent resi\ndence” or not otherwise authorized by federal law to be\nemployed) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11) (adopt\ning the federal definition of “unauthorized alien”); see De\nCanas, 424 U. S., at 363 (finding no preemption of state\nlaw that operates “only with respect to individuals whom\nthe Federal Government has already declared cannot work\nin this country”).\n   Not only that, the Arizona law expressly provides that\nstate investigators must verify the work authorization of\nan allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Govern\nment, and “shall not attempt to independently make a\nfinal determination on whether an alien is authorized to\nwork in the United States.” §23–212(B). What is more, a\nstate court “shall consider only the federal government’s\ndetermination” when deciding “whether an employee is an\nunauthorized alien.” §23–212(H) (emphasis added). As a\nresult, there can by definition be no conflict between state\nand federal law as to worker authorization, either at the\ninvestigatory or adjudicatory stage.7\n——————\n  7 After specifying that a state court may consider “only” the federal\ndetermination, the Arizona law goes on to provide that the federal\ndetermination is “a rebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful\nstatus,” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (West Supp. 2010). Arizona\nexplains that this provision does not permit the State to establish\nunlawful status apart from the federal determination—the provision\ncould hardly do that, given the foregoing. It instead operates to “en\nsur[e] that the employer has an opportunity to rebut the evidence\npresented to establish a worker’s unlawful status.” Brief for Respon\ndents 49 (emphasis added). Only in that sense is the federal determi\nnation a “rebuttable presumption.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47. Giving\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

J.\n                        Opinion R the Court\n\n   The federal determination on which the State must rely\nis provided under 8 U. S. C. §1373(c). See supra, at 6–7.\nThat provision requires the Federal Government to “verify\nor ascertain” an individual’s “citizenship or immigration\nstatus” in response to a state request. JUSTICE BREYER is\nconcerned that this information “says nothing about work\nauthorization.” Post, at 9 (dissenting opinion). JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR shares that concern. Post, at 10 (dissenting\nopinion). But if a §1373(c) inquiry reveals that someone is\na United States citizen, that certainly answers the ques\ntion whether that individual is authorized to work. The\nsame would be true if the response to a §1373(c) query\ndisclosed that the individual was a lawful permanent\nresident alien or, on the other hand, had been ordered\nremoved. In any event, if the information provided under\n§1373(c) does not confirm that an employee is an unau\nthorized alien, then the State cannot prove its case. See\nBrief for Respondents 50, n. 10 (“if the information from\nthe federal authorities does not establish that a person is\nan unauthorized alien, it means that the county attorney\ncannot satisfy his burden of proof in an enforcement\naction”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 47.\n   From this basic starting point, the Arizona law contin\nues to trace the federal law. Both the state and federal\nlaw prohibit “knowingly” employing an unauthorized\nalien. Compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A) with Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §23–212(A).8 But the state law does not stop\nthere in guarding against any conflict with the federal\nlaw. The Arizona law provides that “ ‘[k]nowingly employ\nan unauthorized alien’ means the actions described in 8\n——————\nan employer a chance to show that it did not break the state law\ncertainly does not place the Arizona regime in conflict with federal law.\n  8 State law also prohibits “intentionally” employing an unauthorized\n\nalien, §23–212.01(A), a more severe violation of the law. The Chamber\ndoes not suggest that this prohibition is any more problematic than the\nprohibition on “knowingly” employing an unauthorized alien.\n18        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                     AMERICA v.

In the Chamber’s view, IRCA\n——————\n  9 The  Chamber contends that the Arizona law conflicts with federal\nlaw because IRCA prohibits the use of the I–9 form and “any informa\ntion contained in or appended to [it]” from being “used for purposes\nother than for enforcement of” IRCA and other specified federal laws. 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(b)(5). That argument mistakenly assumes that an\nemployer would need to use the I–9 form or its supporting documents\nthemselves to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense in Arizona\ncourt. In fact, “[a]n employer [could] establish good faith compliance\nwith [the] I–9 process[] . . . through testimony of employees and de\nscriptions of office policy.” Brief for Respondents 52; see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 33.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. 341, 353 (2001)); see Brief for\nPetitioners 42–45; Reply Brief for Petitioners 20.\n    As an initial matter, the cases on which the Chamber\nrelies in advancing this argument all involve uniquely\nfederal areas of regulation. See American Ins. Assn. v.\nGaramendi, 539 U. S. 396, 401, 405–406 (2003) (presiden\ntial conduct of foreign policy); Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U.

Regulating in-state businesses through licensing\nlaws has never been considered such an area of dominant\nfederal concern.\n    Furthermore, those cases all concern state actions that\ndirectly interfered with the operation of the federal pro\ngram. In Buckman, for example, the Court determined\nthat allowing a state tort action would cause applicants\nbefore a federal agency “to submit a deluge of information\nthat the [agency] neither wants nor needs, resulting in\nadditional burdens on the [agency’s] evaluation of an\napplication,” and harmful delays in the agency process.\n531 U.

S., at\n377. The state law in Bonito Boats extended patent-like\nprotection “for subject matter for which patent protection\nhas been denied or has expired,” “thus eroding the general\nrule of free competition upon which the attractiveness of\nthe federal patent bargain depends.” 489 U. S., at 159,\n161. And the portions of Locke on which the Chamber\nrelies involved state efforts “to impose additional unique\nsubstantive regulation on the at-sea conduct of vessels”—\n“an area where the federal interest has been manifest\nsince the beginning of our Republic.” 529 U. S., at 106, 99.\nThere is no similar interference with the federal program\nin this case; that program operates unimpeded by the\nstate law.\n   License suspension and revocation are significant sanc\ntions. But they are typical attributes of a licensing re\ngime. Numerous Arizona laws provide for the suspension\nor revocation of licenses for failing to comply with specified\nstate laws. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§5–108.05(D),\n32–852.01(L), 32–1154(B), 32–1451(M), 41–2186 (West\n2002). Federal law recognizes that the authority to license\nincludes the authority to suspend, revoke, annul, or with\ndraw a license. See 5 U. S. C. §551(9). Indeed, AWPA\nitself—on which the Chamber so heavily relies—provides\nthat AWPA “certificates of registration” can be suspended\nor revoked for employing an unauthorized alien. 29\nU. S. C. §1813(a)(6). It makes little sense to preserve state\nauthority to impose sanctions through licensing, but not\nallow States to revoke licenses when appropriate as one of\nthose sanctions.\n   The Chamber and JUSTICE BREYER assert that employ\ners will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

That is not the choice. License termina\ntion is not an available sanction simply for “hiring unau\nthorized workers.” Only far more egregious violations of\nthe law trigger that consequence. The Arizona law covers\nonly knowing or intentional violations. The law’s perma\nnent licensing sanctions do not come into play until a\nsecond knowing or intentional violation at the same busi\nness location, and only if the second violation occurs while\nthe employer is still on probation for the first. These\nlimits ensure that licensing sanctions are imposed only\nwhen an employer’s conduct fully justifies them. An\nemployer acting in good faith need have no fear of the\nsanctions.\n   As the Chamber points out, IRCA has its own anti\ndiscrimination provisions, see 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a)(1),\n(g)(1)(B) (imposing sanctions for discrimination “against\nany individual . . . with respect to the hiring . . . or the\ndischarging of the individual from employment”); Arizona\nlaw certainly does nothing to displace those. Other federal\nlaws, and Arizona anti-discrimination laws, provide fur\nther protection against employment discrimination—and\nstrong incentive for employers not to discriminate. See,\ne.g., 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a) (prohibiting discrimination\nbased on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”);\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §41–1463(B)(1) (West Supp. 2010)\n(prohibiting employment discrimination based on “race,\ncolor, religion, sex, age, or national origin”).\n   All that is required to avoid sanctions under the Legal\nArizona Workers Act is to refrain from knowingly or inten\ntionally violating the employment law. Employers enjoy\nsafe harbors from liability when they use the I–9 system\nand E-Verify—as Arizona law requires them to do. The\nmost rational path for employers is to obey the law—both\nthe law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens\n22    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                 AMERICA v.

J.\n                  Opinion R the Court\n\nand the law prohibiting discrimination—and there is no\nreason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not\nto do so.\n   As with any piece of legislation, Congress did indeed\nseek to strike a balance among a variety of interests when\nit enacted IRCA. Part of that balance, however, involved\nallocating authority between the Federal Government and\nthe States. The principle that Congress adopted in doing\nso was not that the Federal Government can impose large\nsanctions, and the States only small ones. IRCA instead\npreserved state authority over a particular category of\nsanctions—those imposed “through licensing and similar\nlaws.”\n   Of course Arizona hopes that its law will result in more\neffective enforcement of the prohibition on employing\nunauthorized aliens. But in preserving to the States the\nauthority to impose sanctions through licensing laws,\nCongress did not intend to preserve only those state laws\nthat would have no effect. The balancing process that\nculminated in IRCA resulted in a ban on hiring unauthor\nized aliens, and the state law here simply seeks to enforce\nthat ban.\n   Implied preemption analysis does not justify a “free\nwheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in\ntension with federal objectives”; such an endeavor “would\nundercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the\ncourts that preempts state law.” Gade v. National Solid\nWastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 111 (1992)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment); see Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238,\n256 (1984).

In the Chamber’s view, “Congress\nwanted to develop a reliable and non-burdensome system\nof work-authorization verification” that could serve as an\nalternative to the I–9 procedures, and the “mandatory use\nof E-Verify impedes that purpose.” 558 F. 3d, at 866.\n                             A\n  We begin again with the relevant text. The provision of\nIIRIRA setting up the program that includes E-Verify\ncontains no language circumscribing state action. It does,\nhowever, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation\nof federal law, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may\nnot require any person or other entity [outside of the\nFederal Government] to participate in a pilot program”\nsuch as E-Verify. IIRIRA §402(a), 110 Stat. 3009–656.\nThat provision limits what the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity may do—nothing more.\n  The Federal Government recently argued just that, and\napprovingly referenced Arizona’s E-Verify law when doing\nso. In 2008, an Executive Order mandated that executive\nagencies require federal contractors to use E-Verify as a\ncondition of receiving a federal contract. See Exec. Order\nNo. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008). When that Order\nand its implementing regulation were challenged, the\nGovernment pointed to Arizona’s E-Verify mandate as an\nexample of a permissible use of that system: “[T]he State\nof Arizona has required all public and private employers\nin that State to use E-Verify . . . . This is permissible\nbecause the State of Arizona is not the Secretary of Home\nland Security.” Defendants’ Reply Memorandum in Sup\nport of Their Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 8:08–\ncv–03444 (D Md.), p. 7 (emphasis added), appeal dism’d,\n24     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                  AMERICA v.

Ann. §23–214(A) (West Supp. 2010). That\nrequirement is entirely consistent with the federal law.\nAnd the consequences of not using E-Verify under the\nArizona law are the same as the consequences of not using\nthe system under federal law. In both instances, the only\nresult is that the employer forfeits the otherwise available\nrebuttable presumption that it complied with the law.\nCompare IIRIRA §402(b)(1) with Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Arizona’s requirement that employers oper\nating within its borders use E-Verify in no way obstructs\nachieving those aims.\n  In fact, the Federal Government has consistently ex\npanded and encouraged the use of E-Verify. When E-\nVerify was created in 1996, it was meant to last just four\nyears and it was made available in only six States.\nIIRIRA §401(b) and (c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009–655 to 3009–\n656.

See post, at 8, 19. Statistics from Fiscal Year 2010, however,\nindicate that of the 15,640,167 E-Verify cases submitted, 98.3% were\nautomatically confirmed as work authorized, 0.3% were confirmed as\nwork authorized after contesting and resolving an initial nonconfir\nmation—an avenue available to all workers—and 1.43% were not\nfound work authorized.

S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The state law before us,\nthe Legal Arizona Workers Act, imposes civil sanctions\nupon those who employ unauthorized aliens. See Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §23–211 et seq. (West Supp. 2010). Thus\nthe state law falls within the federal Act’s general pre\nemption rule and is pre-empted—unless it also falls within\nthat rule’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.”\nUnlike the Court, I do not believe the state law falls\nwithin this exception, and I consequently would hold it\npre-empted.\n   Arizona calls its state statute a “licensing law,” and the\nstatute uses the word “licensing.” But the statute strays\nbeyond the bounds of the federal licensing exception, for\nit defines “license” to include articles of incorporation and\npartnership certificates, indeed virtually every state-law\nauthorization for any firm, corporation, or partnership to\ndo business in the State. §23–211(9)(a); cf. §23–211(9)(c)\n2     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n(excepting professional licenses, and water and environ\nmental permits). Congress did not intend its “licensing”\nlanguage to create so broad an exemption, for doing so\nwould permit States to eviscerate the federal Act’s pre\nemption provision, indeed to subvert the Act itself, by\nundermining Congress’ efforts (1) to protect lawful work\ners from national-origin-based discrimination and (2) to\nprotect lawful employers against erroneous prosecution or\npunishment.\n   Dictionary definitions of the word “licensing” are, as the\nmajority points out, broad enough to include virtually any\npermission that the State chooses to call a “license.” See\nante, at 10 (relying on a dictionary and the federal Admin\nistrative Procedure Act). But neither dictionary defini\ntions nor the use of the word “license” in an unrelated\nstatute can demonstrate what scope Congress intended\nthe word “licensing” to have as it used that word in this\nfederal statute. Instead, statutory context must ultimately\ndetermine the word’s coverage. Context tells a driver that\nhe cannot produce a partnership certificate when a po\nliceman stops the car and asks for a license. Context tells\nall of us that “licensing” as used in the Act does not in\nclude marriage licenses or the licensing of domestic ani\nmals. And context, which includes statutory purposes,\nlanguage, and history, tells us that the federal statute’s\n“licensing” language does not embrace Arizona’s overly\nbroad definition of that term. That is to say, ordinary\ncorporate charters, certificates of partnership, and the like\ndo not fall within the scope of the word “licensing” as used\nin this federal exception. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU.

No.\n99–682, pt. 1, p. 56 (1986).\n  Second, Congress wished to avoid “placing an undue\nburden on employers,” id., at 90, and the Act seeks to\nprevent the “harassment” of “innocent employers,” S. Rep.\nNo. 99–132, p. 35 (1985).\n  Third, the Act seeks to prevent employers from disfavor\ning job applicants who appear foreign. Reiterating long\nstanding antidiscrimination concerns, the House Commit\ntee Report explained:\n    “Numerous witnesses . . . have expressed their deep\n    concern that the imposition of employer sanctions will\n    cause extensive employment discrimination against\n    Hispanic-Americans and other minority group mem\n4     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n    bers. These witnesses are genuinely concerned that\n    employers, faced with the possibility of civil and\n    criminal penalties, will be extremely reluctant to hire\n    persons because of their linguistic or physical charac\n    teristics.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 68.\nSee also 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) (making it an “unlaw\nful employment practice” for an employer to discriminate\nagainst an individual “because of such individual’s race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin”); U. S. Commission\non Civil Rights, The Tarnished Golden Door: Civil Rights\nIssues in Immigration 74 (1980) (finding that “increased\nemployment discrimination against United States citizens\nand legal residents who are racially and culturally iden\ntifiable with major immigrant groups could be the un\nintended result of an employer sanctions law”). The\nCommittee concluded that “every effort must be taken to\nminimize the potentiality of discrimination.” H. R. Rep.\nNo. 99–682, at 68.\n                             B\n  The Act reconciles these competing objectives in several\nways:\n  First, the Act prohibits employers from hiring an alien\nknowing that the alien is unauthorized to work in the\nUnited States. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A).\n  Second, the Act provides an easy-to-use mechanism that\nwill allow employers to determine legality: the I–9 form.\nIn completing an I–9 form, the employer certifies that he\nor she has examined one or two documents (e.g., a pass\nport, or a driver’s license along with a Social Security\ncard) that tend to confirm the worker’s identity and em\nployability. §1324a(b)(1). Completion of the form in good\nfaith immunizes the employer from liability, even if the\nworker turns out to be unauthorized. §§1324a(a)(3),\n1324a(b)(6).\n  A later amendment to the law also allows an employer\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto verify an employee’s work eligibility through an\nInternet-based federal system called E-Verify. If the em\nployer does so, he or she will receive the benefit of a rebut\ntable presumption of compliance. Illegal Immigration Re\nform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA),\n§402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657, note following 8\nU. S. C. §1324a, p. 331 (Pilot Programs for Employment\nEligibility Confirmation).\n  Third, the Act creates a central enforcement mecha\nnism. The Act directs the Attorney General to establish a\nsingle set of procedures for receiving complaints, investi\ngating those complaints that “have a substantial proba\nbility of validity,” and prosecuting violations. 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(e)(1).     The relevant immigration officials and\nadministrative law judges have the power to access neces\nsary evidence and witnesses, §1324a(e)(2), and the em\nployer has the right to seek discovery from the Federal\nGovernment, 28 CFR §68.18 (2010). The employer also\nhas the right to administrative and judicial review of the\nadministrative law judge’s decision. §§68.54, 68.56.\n  Fourth, the Act makes it “an unfair immigration-related\nemployment practice . . . to discriminate against any\nindividual” in respect to employment “because of such\nindividual’s national origin.” 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a).\n  Fifth, the Act sets forth a carefully calibrated sanction\nsystem. The penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens are\ngraduated to prevent the Act from unduly burdening\nemployers who are not serious offenders. As adjusted for\ninflation, civil penalties for a first violation of the employ\nment restrictions range from $375–$3,200 per worker,\nand rise to $3,200–$16,000 per worker for repeat offend\ners. §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133 (2008); see also\n§1324a(f) (imposing criminal fines of not more than $3,000\nper worker and imprisonment for up to six months for\n“pattern or practice” violators of employment restrictions).\n  As importantly, the Act limits or removes any incentive\n6     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nto discriminate on the basis of national origin by setting\nantidiscrimination fines at equivalent levels: $375–$3,200\nper worker for first-time offenders, and $3,200–$16,000\nper worker for repeat offenders. §1324b(g)(2)(B)(iv); 73\nFed. Reg. 10134. The Act then ties its unlawful employ\nment and antidiscrimination provisions together by pro\nviding that, should the antihiring provisions terminate,\nthe antidiscrimination provisions will also terminate,\n§1324b(k), “the justification for them having been re\nmoved,” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000, p. 87 (1986).\n                              C\n   Now, compare and contrast Arizona’s statute. As I have\nsaid, that statute applies to virtually all business-related\nlicenses, other than professional licenses. Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §23–211(9). Like the federal Act, the state law for\nbids the employment of unauthorized aliens. §§23–212(A),\n23–212.01(A). It also provides employers with somewhat\nsimilar defenses. §§23–212(I)–(J), 23–212.01(I)–(J). But\nthereafter the state and federal laws part company.\n   First, the state statute seriously threatens the federal\nAct’s antidiscriminatory objectives by radically skewing\nthe relevant penalties. For example, in the absence of the\nArizona statute, an Arizona employer who intentionally\nhires an unauthorized alien for the second time would risk\na maximum penalty of $6,500. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(e)(4)\n(A)(ii); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133. But the Arizona statute sub\njects that same employer (in respect to the same two\nincidents) to mandatory, permanent loss of the right to do\nbusiness in Arizona–a penalty that Arizona’s Governor\nhas called the “business death penalty.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §23–212.01(F)(2); News Release, Governor Signs\nEmployer Sanctions Bill (2007), App. 399. At the same\ntime, the state law leaves the other side of the punishment\nbalance—the antidiscrimination side—unchanged.\n   This is no idle concern. Despite the federal Act’s efforts\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto prevent discriminatory practices, there is evidence that\nfour years after it had become law, discrimination was a\nserious problem. In 1990, the General Accounting Office\nidentified “widespread discrimination . . . as a result of”\nthe Act. Report to the Congress, Immigration Reform:\nEmployer Sanctions and the Question of Discrimination 3,\n37, 80. Sixteen percent of employers in Los Angeles ad\nmitted that they applied the I–9 requirement “only to\nforeign-looking or foreign-sounding persons,” and 22 per\ncent of Texas employers reported that they “began a prac\ntice to (1) hire only persons born in the United States or\n(2) not hire persons with temporary work eligibility docu\nments” because of the Act. Id., at 41–43. If even the\nfederal Act (with its carefully balanced penalties) can\nresult in some employers discriminating, how will employ\ners behave when erring on the side of discrimination leads\nonly to relatively small fines, while erring on the side of\nhiring unauthorized workers leads to the “business death\npenalty”?\n   Second, Arizona’s law subjects lawful employers to in\ncreased burdens and risks of erroneous prosecution. In\naddition to the Arizona law’s severely burdensome sanc\ntions, the law’s procedures create enforcement risks not\npresent in the federal system. The federal Act creates one\ncentralized enforcement scheme, run by officials versed in\nimmigration law and with access to the relevant federal\ndocuments. The upshot is an increased likelihood that\nfederal officials (or the employer) will discover whether\nadverse information flows from an error-prone source and\nthat they will proceed accordingly, thereby diminishing\nthe likelihood that burdensome proceedings and liability\nreflect documentary mistakes.\n   Contrast the enforcement system that Arizona’s statute\ncreates. Any citizen of the State can complain (anony\nmously or otherwise) to the state attorney general (or any\ncounty attorney), who then “shall investigate,” Ariz. Rev.\n8     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nStat. Ann. §23–212(B) (emphasis added), and, upon a\ndetermination that that the “complaint is not false and\nfrivolous . . . shall notify the appropriate county attorney\nto bring an action,” §23–212(C)(3). This mandatory lan\nguage, the lower standard (“not frivolous” instead of\n“substantial”), and the removal of immigration officials\nfrom the state screening process (substituting numerous,\nelected county attorneys) increase the likelihood that\nsuspicious circumstances will lead to prosecutions and\nliability of employers—even where more careful investiga\ntion would have revealed that there was no violation.\n   Again, this matter is far from trivial. Studies of one\nimportant source of Government information—the E-\nVerify system—describe how the federal administrative\nprocess corrected that system’s tentative “unemployable”\nindications 18% of the time. This substantial error rate is\nnot a function of a small sample size. See ante, at 26, n.\n12. Rather, data from one fiscal year showed 46,921\nworkers initially rejected but later “confirmed as work\nauthorized”—all while E-Verify was used by only a frac\ntion of the Nation’s employers. U. S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services, Statistics and Reports, http://\nwww.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9a\nc89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=7c579589cdb76210V\ngnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD (Feb. 4, 2011) (as visited\nMay 18, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nThat is to say nearly one-in-five times that the E-Verify\nsystem suggested that an individual was not lawfully\nemployable (i.e., returned a tentative nonconfirmation of\nwork authorization), the system was wrong; and subse\nquent review in the federal administrative process deter\nmined as much. (And those wrongly identified were likely\nto be persons of foreign, rather than domestic, origin, by a\nratio of approximately 20 to 1.) See Westat, Findings of\nthe E-Verify Program Evaluation xxxi, 210, 246 (Dec.\n2009) (assessing data from April to June 2008). E-Verify’s\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\naccuracy rate is even worse “in states that require the use\nof E-Verify for all or some of their employees.” Id., at 122.\n   A related provision of the state law aggravates the risk\nof erroneous prosecutions. The state statute says that\nin “determining whether an employee is an unauthorized\nalien, the court shall consider only the federal govern\nment’s determination pursuant to 8 [U. S. C.] §1373(c).”\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H). But the federal provi\nsion to which the state law refers, 8 U. S. C. §1373(c), says\nonly that the Federal Government, upon a State’s request,\nshall verify a person’s “citizenship or immigration status.”\nIt says nothing about work authorization. See post, at 7–\n10 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). It says nothing about the\nsource of the Federal Government’s information. It im\nposes no duty upon the Federal Government or anyone\nelse to investigate the validity of that information, which\nmay falsely implicate an employer 18% of the time.\n   So what is the employer to do? What statute gives an\nemployer whom the State proceeds against in state court\nthe right to conduct discovery against the Federal Gov\nernment? The Arizona statute, like the federal statute,\nsays that the employer’s use of an I–9 form provides a\ndefense. But there is a hitch. The federal Act says that\nneither the I–9 form, nor “any information contained\nin or appended to” the form, “may . . . be used for pur\nposes other than for enforcement of this” federal Act.\n§1324a(b)(5). So how can the employer present a defense,\nsay, that the Government’s information base is flawed?\nThe majority takes the view that the forms are not neces­\nsary to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense. Ante,\nat 18, n. 9. But the I–9 form would surely be the em\nployer’s most effective evidence. See also post, at 11\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the unavail\nability of I–9 forms to defend against state-court charges\nmeans that Congress “intended no such” proceedings).\n   Nor does the Arizona statute facilitate the presentation\n10    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nof a defense when it immediately follows (1) its statement\nthat “the court shall consider only the federal govern\nment’s determination” when it considers “whether an\nemployee is an unauthorized alien” with (2) its statement\nthat “[t]he federal government’s determination creates a\nrebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful status.”\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (emphasis added). The\ntwo statements sound as if they mean that a Federal\nGovernment determination that the worker is unlawful\nis conclusive against the employer, but its determination\nthat the worker’s employment is lawful is subject to rebut\ntal by the State. Arizona tells us that the statute means\nthe opposite. See ante, at 16, n. 7. But the legal briefs of\nArizona’s attorney general do not bind the state courts.\nAnd until the matter is cleared up, employers, despite I–9\nchecks, despite efforts to use E-Verify, will hesitate to hire\nthose they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in\nthe United States.\n   And that is my basic point. Either directly or through\nthe uncertainty that it creates, the Arizona statute will\nimpose additional burdens upon lawful employers and\nconsequently lead those employers to erect ever stronger\nsafeguards against the hiring of unauthorized aliens—\nwithout counterbalancing protection against unlawful\ndiscrimination. And by defining “licensing” so broadly, by\nbringing nearly all businesses within its scope, Arizona’s\nstatute creates these effects statewide.\n   Why would Congress, after deliberately limiting ordi\nnary penalties to the range of a few thousand dollars per\nillegal worker, want to permit far more drastic state pen\nalties that would directly and mandatorily destroy entire\nbusinesses? Why would Congress, after carefully balanc\ning sanctions to avoid encouraging discrimination, want to\nallow States to destroy that balance? Why would Con\ngress, after creating detailed procedural protections for\nemployers, want to allow States to undermine them? Why\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould Congress want to write into an express pre-emption\nprovision—a provision designed to prevent States from\nundercutting federal statutory objectives—an exception\nthat could so easily destabilize its efforts? The answer to\nthese questions is that Congress would not have wanted to\ndo any of these things. And that fact indicates that the\nmajority’s reading of the licensing exception—a reading\nthat would allow what Congress sought to forbid—is\nwrong.\n                               II\n   The federal licensing exception cannot apply to a state\nstatute that, like Arizona’s statute, seeks to bring virtually\nall articles of incorporation and partnership certificates\nwithin its scope. I would find the scope of the exception\nto federal pre-emption to be far more limited. Context,\npurpose, and history make clear that the “licensing and\nsimilar laws” at issue involve employment-related licensing\nsystems.\n   The issuance of articles of incorporation and partnership\ncertificates and the like have long had little or nothing to\ndo with hiring or “employment.” Indeed, Arizona provides\nno evidence that any State, at the time the federal Act was\nenacted, had refused to grant or had revoked, say, part\nnership certificates, in light of the partners’ hiring prac\ntices of any kind, much less the hiring of unauthorized\naliens. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §29–308 (limited part\nnership formed upon the filing of a certificate of partner\nship providing names and addresses); §29–345 (providing\nfor dissolution of a limited partnership “[o]n application by\nor for a partner or assignee . . . whenever it is not rea\nsonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity\nwith the partnership agreement”).\n   To read the exception as covering laws governing corpo\nrate charters and partnership certificates (which are not\nusually called “licensing” laws) is to permit States to turn\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nvirtually every permission-related state law into an\nemployment-related “licensing” law. The State need only\ncall the permission a “license” and revoke the license should\nits holder hire an unauthorized alien. If what was not\npreviously an employment-related licensing law can be\ncome one simply by using it as a sanction for hiring unau\nthorized aliens or simply by state definition, indeed, if the\nState can call a corporate charter an employment-related\nlicensing law, then why not an auto licensing law\n(amended to revoke the driver’s licenses of those who hire\nunauthorized aliens)? Why not a dog licensing law? Or\nwhy not “impute” a newly required license to conduct any\nbusiness to every human being in the State, withdrawing\nthat license should that individual hire an unauthorized\nalien? See S. C. Code Ann. §41–8–20 (Supp. 2010) (provid\ning that “[a]ll private employers in South Carolina . . .\nshall be imputed a South Carolina employment license,\nwhich permits a private employer to employ a person in\nthis State,” but conditioning the license on the company’s\nnot hiring unauthorized aliens).\n   Such laws might prove more effective in stopping the\nhiring of unauthorized aliens. But they are unlikely to do\nso consistent with Congress’ other critically important\ngoals, in particular, Congress’ efforts to protect from dis\ncrimination legal workers who look or sound foreign. That\nis why we should read the federal exemption’s “licensing”\nlaws as limited to those that involve the kind of licensing\nthat, in the absence of this general state statute, would\nnonetheless have some significant relation to employment\nor hiring practices. Otherwise we read the federal “licens\ning” exception as authorizing a State to undermine, if not\nto swallow up, the federal pre-emption rule.\n                            III\n  I would therefore read the words “licensing and similar\nlaws” as covering state licensing systems applicable pri\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

This reading is\nconsistent with the provision’s history and language, and\nit minimizes the risk of harm of the kind just described.\n   The Act’s history supports this interpretation. Ever\nsince 1964, the Federal Government has administered\nstatutes that create a federal licensing scheme for agricul\ntural labor contractors, firms that specialize in recruiting\nagricultural workers and referring them to farmers for a\nfee. Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963\n(FLCRA), 78 Stat. 920; Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural\nWorker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. The stat\nutes require agricultural labor contractors to register with\nthe federal Secretary of Labor, to obtain a registration\ncertificate (in effect a license), and to require the contrac\ntor’s employees to carry that certificate with them when\nengaging in agricultural labor contracting activities.\nAWPA §101; FLCRA §4. The statutes list a host of forbid\nden activities, one of which (prior to 1986) was hiring\nunauthorized aliens. See AWPA §§103, 106; FLCRA §5(b).\nPrior to 1986, if the federal Labor Department believed\na firm had violated these substantive provisions, it could\ninstitute administrative proceedings within the Labor\nDepartment. And if the Secretary found the labor con\ntracting firm had violated the provisions, the Secretary\ncould impose monetary penalties or withdraw the firm’s\nregistration. AWPA §§103, 503; FLCRA §§5(b), 9.\n   Most important, and unlike the 1986 Act before us, the\nearlier agricultural labor contracting statutes did not pre­\nempt similar state laws. To the contrary, the earlier Acts\nwere “intended to supplement State law” and did not\n“excuse any person from compliance with appropriate\nState law and regulation.” AWPA §521; see FLCRA §12.\nBy 1986, nearly a dozen States had developed state licens\n14    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ning systems for agricultural labor contractors, i.e., firms\nthat recruited and referred farm (and sometimes forestry)\nworkers for a fee; some of these laws provided that state\nlicenses could be revoked if the contractors hired unau\nthorized aliens. See, e.g., Cal. Lab. Code §1690(f) (Deering\nSupp. 1991); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§1301.503(4), 1301.505(3)\n(1965–1983 Supp. Pamphlet); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§658.405(1),\n658.440(2)(d) (1987) (covering forestry workers).\n   In 1986, Congress (when enacting the Act now before\nus) focused directly upon the earlier federal agricultural\nlabor contractor licensing system. And it changed that\nearlier system by including a series of conforming\namendments in the Act. One amendment removes from\nthe earlier statutes the specific prohibition against hiring\nunauthorized aliens. It thereby makes agricultural labor\ncontractors subject to the Act’s similar general prohibition\nagainst such hiring. IRCA §101(b)(1)(C) (repealing AWPA\n§106). Another amendment takes from the Secretary of\nLabor most of the Secretary’s enforcement powers in\nrespect to the hiring of unauthorized aliens. It thereby\nleaves agricultural labor contractors subject to the same\nsingle unified enforcement system that the immigration\nAct applies to all employers. See 29 U. S. C. §1853. A\nthird amendment, however, leaves with the Secretary of\nLabor the power to withdraw the federal registration\ncertificate from an agricultural labor contractor that hired\nunauthorized aliens. IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 29 U. S. C.\n§1813(a)(6). Thus, the Act leaves this subset of employers\n(i.e., agricultural labor contractors but not other employ\ners) subject to a federal licensing scheme.\n   So far, the conforming amendments make sense. But\nhave they not omitted an important matter? Prior to\n1986, States as well as the Federal Government could\nlicense agricultural labor contractors. Should the 1986\nstatute not say whether Congress intended that dual\nsystem to continue? The answer is that the 1986 Act does\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnot omit this matter. It answers the coexistence question\ndirectly with the parenthetical phrase we are now consid\nering, namely, the phrase, “other than through licensing\nand similar laws,” placed in the middle of the Act’s pre\nemption provision. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). That phrase\nrefers to agricultural labor contractors, and it says that,\nin respect to those licensing schemes, dual state/federal\nlicensing can continue.\n   As of 1986, there were strong reasons for permitting\nthat dual system to continue in this specialized area. Dual\nenforcement had proved helpful in preventing particularly\nserious employment abuses. See, e.g., 128 Cong. Rec.\n24090 (1982) (reflecting concerns that agricultural work\ners were “housed in hovels; . . . subjected to physical abuse\nand kept in virtual slavery”). And because the contractors’\nbusiness consists of providing labor forces, their hiring of\nauthorized workers is closely related to their general\nfitness to do business. See S. Rep. No. 202, 88th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 1 (1963) (explaining that farm labor contractor\nregistration laws are needed to prevent “irresponsible\ncrew leaders” from “exploit[ing] . . . farmers”); Martin,\nGood Intentions Gone Awry: IRCA and U. S. Agriculture,\n534 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 44, 49 (1994) (de\nscribing how farmers who relied on contractors risked\nlosing their labor forces to immigration raids). Dual en\nforcement would not create a federal/state penalty dispar\nity, for federal systems as well as state systems provide for\nlicense revocation. Experience had shown that dual en\nforcement had not created any serious conflict or other\ndifficulty. And in light of the specialized nature and com\nparatively small set of businesses subject to dual enforce\nment, to permit licensing of that set of businesses would\nnot seriously undermine the objectives of the Act or its\npre-emption provision.\n   Thus, it is not surprising that the legislative history of\nthe 1986 Act’s pre-emption provision says that the licens\n16    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ning exception is about the licensing of agricultural labor\ncontractors. The House Report on the Act, referring to the\nlicensing exception, states that the Committee did “not\nintend to preempt licensing or ‘fitness to do business laws,’\nsuch as state farm labor contractor laws or forestry laws,\nwhich specifically require such licensee or contractor to\nrefrain from hiring, recruiting or referring undocumented\naliens.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis added).\n   The Act’s language, while not requiring this interpreta\ntion, is nonetheless consistent with limiting the scope of\nthe phrase in this way. Context can limit the application\nof the term “licensing” to particular types of licensing. The\nAct’s subject matter itself limits the term to employment\nrelated licensing. And the Act’s specific reference to those\nwho “recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthor\nized aliens,” is consistent with employment-related li\ncensing that focuses primarily upon labor contracting\nbusinesses.\n   Thus, reading the phrase as limited in scope to laws\nlicensing businesses that recruit or refer workers for\nemployment is consistent with the statute’s language,\nwith the relevant history, and with other statutory provi\nsions in the Act. That reading prevents state law from\nundermining the Act and from turning the pre-emption\nclause on its head. That is why I consider it the better\nreading of the statute.\n                             IV\n  Another section of the Arizona statute requires “every\nemployer, after hiring an employee,” to “verify the em\nployment eligibility of the employee” through the Federal\nGovernment’s E-Verify program. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§23–214. This state provision makes participation in the\nfederal E-Verify system mandatory for virtually all Ari\nzona employers. The federal law governing the E-Verify\nprogram, however, creates a program that is voluntary.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S.,\nat 373 (quoting Hines, 312 U. S., at 67). And it is conse\nquently pre-empted.\n    The federal statute itself makes clear that participation\nin the E-Verify program is voluntary. The statute’s rele\nvant section bears the title “Voluntary Election to Partici\npate in a Pilot Program.” IIRIRA §402, note following 8\nU. S. C. §1324a, p. 331. A subsection bears the further\ntitle, “Voluntary Election.” §402(a). And within that\nsubsection, the statute says that employers “may elect to\nparticipate.” (Emphasis added.) The statute elsewhere\nrequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to “widely\npublicize . . . the voluntary nature” of the program.\n§402(d)(2); see also §402(d)(3)(A) (requiring the designa\ntion of local officials to advertise the “voluntary nature” of\nthe program). It adds that employers may “terminate”\ntheir “election” to participate by following certain proce\ndures. §402(c)(3). And it tells the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity (as an earlier version told the Attorney General)\nthat she “may not require any person or other entity to\nparticipate.” §402(a); see also §402(e) (creating exceptions,\nnone of which is applicable here, that require federal\nemployers and certain others to participate in E-Verify or\nanother pilot program).\n    Congress had strong reasons for insisting on the volun\ntary nature of the program. E-Verify was conceived as,\nand remains, a pilot program. Its database consists of\ntens of millions of Social Security and immigration records\nkept by the Federal Government. These records are prone\nto error.

Stana (Dec. 8, 2010) (discussing aspects of\nE-Verify that have yet to be implemented). The effects of\nthe program’s efforts to take account of, and correct for,\npotential errors remain uncertain. Congress could decide\nthat, based on the results of the pilot, E-Verify should\nbecome a mandatory program. But it has not yet made\nthat determination. And in making that decision, it will\nhave to face a number of questions: Will workers receiving\ntentative negative verdicts understand the possibility of\nadministrative challenge? Will they make the effort to\ninvoke that process, say traveling from a farm to an urban\nSocial Security office? Will employers prove willing to\nundergo the financial burden of supporting a worker who\nmight lose the challenge? Will employers hesitate to train\nthose workers during the time they bring their challenges?\nWill employers simply hesitate to hire workers who might\nreceive an initial negative verdict—more likely those who\nlook or sound foreign? Or will they find ways to dismiss\nthose workers? These and other unanswered questions\nconvinced Congress to make E-Verify a pilot program, to\ncommission continuous study and evaluation, and to insist\nthat participation be voluntary.\n  In co-opting a federal program and changing the key\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Crosby, supra, at 373 (quoting\nHines, supra, at 67).\n    The majority reaches a contrary conclusion by pointing\nout (1) that Congress has renewed the E-Verify program\nseveral times, each time expanding its coverage, to the\npoint where it now encompasses all 50 States; (2) that the\nE-Verify database has become more accurate; (3) that\nthe Executive Branch has itself mandated participation\nfor federal contractors; and (4) that the statute’s language\ntells the Secretary of Homeland Security, not the States, to\nmaintain the program as voluntary.\n    The short, and, I believe, conclusive answers to these\nobjections are: (1) Congress has kept the language of the\nstatute—and the voluntary nature of the program—the\nsame throughout its program renewals. See 115 Stat.\n2407; 117 Stat. 1944; §547, 123 Stat. 2177. And it is up to\nCongress, not to Arizona or this Court, to decide when\nparticipation in the program should cease to be voluntary.\n    (2) The studies and reports have repeatedly found both\n(a) that the E-Verify program had achieved greater accu\nracy, but (b) that problems remain. See, e.g., Social Secu\nrity Report 11 (estimating that Social Security records\ncontain 4.8 million “discrepancies that could require the\nnumberholder to visit [the Social Security Administration]\n. . . before employment eligibility would be confirmed”);\nGAO Report 19 (estimating that, if E-Verify were made\nmandatory nationwide, 164,000 newly hired workers each\nyear would erroneously be adjudged ineligible to work\nbecause of name mismatches, as when the worker’s “first\nor last name is incorrectly spelled in government data\nbases or on identification documents”).

For the\nFederal Government to mandate that a special group\nparticipate in the E-Verify program tells us little or noth\ning about the effects of a State’s mandating that nearly\nevery employer within the State participate—as Arizona\nhas done. And insofar as we have not determined whether\nthe Executive was authorized by Congress to mandate E-\nVerify for federal contractors, it says nothing about Con\ngress’ intent.\n   (4) There is no reason to imply negatively from language\ntelling the Secretary not to make the program mandatory,\npermission for the States to do so. There is no presump\ntion that a State may modify the operation of a uniquely\nfederal program like E-Verify. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plain­\ntiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U.

The\nremaining federal statutory language makes clear the\nvoluntary nature of the E-Verify program.

NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147 (2002). The Court reads\nIRCA’s saving clause—which preserves from pre-emption\nstate “licensing and similar laws,” 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2)—to permit States to determine for them­\nselves whether someone has employed an unauthorized\nalien so long as they do so in conjunction with licensing\nsanctions. This reading of the saving clause cannot be\nreconciled with the rest of IRCA’s comprehensive scheme.\nHaving constructed a federal mechanism for determining\nwhether someone has knowingly employed an unauthor­\nized alien, and having withheld from the States the infor­\nmation necessary to make that determination, Congress\ncould not plausibly have intended for the saving clause to\noperate in the way the majority reads it to do. When\nviewed in context, the saving clause can only be under­\nstood to preserve States’ authority to impose licensing\nsanctions after a final federal determination that a person\nhas violated IRCA by knowingly employing an unauthor­\nized alien. Because the Legal Arizona Workers Act in­\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                   AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nstead creates a separate state mechanism for Arizona\nstate courts to determine whether a person has employed\nan unauthorized alien, I would hold that it falls outside\nthe saving clause and is pre-empted.\n  I would also hold that federal law pre-empts the provi­\nsion of the Arizona Act making mandatory the use of\nE-Verify, the federal electronic verification system. By\nrequiring Arizona employers to use E-Verify, Arizona has\neffectively made a decision for Congress regarding use of a\nfederal resource, in contravention of the significant policy\nobjectives motivating Congress’ decision to make partici­\npation in the E-Verify program voluntary.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   I begin with the plain text of IRCA’s pre-emption clause.\nIRCA expressly pre-empts States from “imposing civil or\ncriminal sanctions (other than through licensing and\nsimilar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer\nfor a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”1 Ibid. The\nArizona Act, all agree, imposes civil sanctions upon those\nwho employ unauthorized aliens. The Act thus escapes\nexpress pre-emption only if it falls within IRCA’s paren­\nthetical saving clause for “licensing and similar laws.”\nIbid.\n   The saving clause is hardly a paragon of textual clarity.\nIRCA does not define “licensing,” nor does it use the word\n“licensing” in any other provision. Laws that impose\nsanctions by means of licensing exist in many forms.\nSome permit authorities to take action with respect to\nlicenses upon finding that a licensee has engaged in pro­\n——————\n  1 IRCA defines the term “unauthorized alien” to mean, “with respect\n\nto the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the alien is not\nat that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\nresidence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the\nAttorney General.” 8 U.

Ann. §4–\n210(A)(1) (West 2011) (liquor licenses may be suspended\nor revoked if the licensing authority determines after\nnotice and a hearing that repeated acts of violence have\noccurred on the licensed premises). Others, more nar­\nrowly, permit authorities to take such action following a\npre-existing determination by another authorized body\nthat the licensee has violated another provision of law.\nSee, e.g., §4–202(D) (liquor licenses may not be renewed to\npersons who have been convicted of felonies within the\npast five years). That both types of laws might be defined\nin some contexts as licensing laws does not necessarily\nmean that Congress intended the saving clause to encom­\npass both types. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n481, 486 (2006) (“A word in a statute may or may not\nextend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities”);\nsee also FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U.

In isolation, the text of\nIRCA’s saving clause provides no hint as to which type or\ntypes of licensing laws Congress had in mind.\n                             B\n  Because the plain text of the saving clause does not\nresolve the question, it is necessary to look to the text\nof IRCA as a whole to illuminate Congress’ intent. See\nDolan, 546 U. S., at 486 (“Interpretation of a word or\nphrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,\nconsidering the purpose and context of the statute”); Ali v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.

It is a fundamental canon of statutory con­\nstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statu­\ntory scheme”).2\n   Before Congress enacted IRCA in 1986, a number of\nStates had enacted legislation prohibiting employment of\nunauthorized aliens. See ante, at 2, and n. 1 (citing 12\nsuch laws). California, for example, prohibited the know­\ning employment of an alien “who is not entitled to lawful\nresidence in the United States” when “such employment\nwould have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers,”\nand made violations punishable by fines of $200 to $500.\n1971 Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1; see also De Canas v. Bica,\n424 U. S. 351, 352, n. 1 (1976). Kansas went even further,\nmaking it a misdemeanor, punishable by a term of con­\nfinement not to exceed one month, to employ a person\nwithin Kansas knowing “such person to be illegally within\nthe territory of the United States.” Kan. Stat. Ann. §§21–\n4409, 21–4502 (1981).3\n   Congress enacted IRCA amidst this patchwork of state\nlaws. IRCA “ ‘forcefully’ made combating the employment\nof illegal aliens central to ‘the policy of immigration law.’ ”\nHoffman, 535 U. S., at 147 (quoting INS v. National Cen\nter for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194, and n.\n8 (1991); brackets omitted); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–\n682, pt. 1, p. 46 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.

To the contrary, the majority’s reading of the saving clause—with\nits singular focus on the undefined word “licensing” to the exclusion of\nall contextual considerations—is “untethered” from the statute as a\nwhole.\n   3 None of the pre-IRCA state laws cited by the majority provided for\n\nlicensing-related sanctions. The parties have not identified any pre-\nIRCA state laws related to licensing that purported to regulate the\nemployment of unauthorized aliens other than those governing agricul­\ntural labor contractors. See ante, at 13–14 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

As the major­\nity explains, IRCA makes it “unlawful for a person or\nother entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for\nemployment in the United States an alien knowing the\nalien is an unauthorized alien.” §1324a(a)(1)(A); ante, at\n3. IRCA also requires employers to verify that they have\nreviewed documents establishing an employee’s eligibility\nfor employment. See §1324a(b); ante, at 3–4. These two\nprovisions are the foundation of IRCA’s “comprehensive\nscheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the\nUnited States.” Hoffman, 535 U. S., at 147.\n   Congress made explicit its intent that IRCA be enforced\nuniformly. IRCA declares that “[i]t is the sense of the\nCongress that . . . the immigration laws of the United\nStates should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.”\n§115, 100 Stat. 3384 (emphasis added). Congress struc­\ntured IRCA’s provisions in a number of ways to accom­\nplish this goal of uniform enforcement.\n   First, and most obviously, Congress expressly displaced\nthe myriad state laws that imposed civil and criminal\nsanctions on employers who hired unauthorized aliens.\nSee §1324a(h)(2); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58\n(“The penalties contained in this legislation are intended\nto specifically preempt any state or local laws providing\ncivil fines and/or criminal sanctions on the hiring, re­\ncruitment or referral of undocumented aliens”). Congress\ncould not have made its intent to pre-empt state and local\nlaws imposing civil or criminal sanctions any more “ ‘clear\n[or] manifest.’ ” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485\n(1996) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.\n218, 230 (1947)).\n   Second, Congress centralized in the Federal Govern­\nment enforcement of IRCA’s prohibition on the knowing\nemployment of unauthorized aliens. IRCA instructs the\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nAttorney General to designate a specialized federal agency\nunit whose “primary duty” will be to prosecute violations\nof IRCA. §1324a(e)(1)(D). IRCA also instructs the Attor­\nney General to establish procedures for receiving com­\nplaints, investigating complaints having “a substantial\nprobability of validity,” and investigating other violations.\n§1324a(e)(1); see also 8 CFR §274a.9 (2010). Upon con­\ncluding that a person has violated IRCA, the Attorney\nGeneral must provide the person with notice and an op­\nportunity for a hearing before a federal administrative law\njudge (ALJ). 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(e)(3)(A), (B). If the person\ndoes not request a hearing, the Attorney General may\nimpose a final, nonappealable order requiring payment of\nsanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(B). If the person requests a hear­\ning, the ALJ is required to hold a hearing and, upon find­\ning that the person has violated IRCA, must order the\npayment of sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(C). The ALJ’s order is\nthe final agency order, unless the affected person requests\nand obtains further administrative appellate review.\n§1324a(e)(7); see also 28 CFR §68.54 (2010). IRCA grants\nimmigration officers and ALJs “reasonable access to\nexamine evidence of any person or entity being investi­\ngated” and provides them with extensive subpoena powers.\n§1324a(e)(2). And the immigration officers investigating\nsuspected violations obviously have access to the relevant\nfederal information concerning the work authorization\nstatus of the employee in question.4\n  Third, Congress provided persons “adversely affected”\nby an agency order with a right of review in the federal\ncourts of appeals. §1324a(e)(8); see also §1324a(e)(9)\n(directing the Attorney General in cases of noncompliance\nto file suit in federal district court to enforce a final order\n——————\n  4 By regulation, the Attorney General has conferred on parties\n\ncharged with violating IRCA the right to obtain discovery from the\nFederal Government in a hearing before an ALJ.

In this way, Congress ensured\nthat administrative orders finding violations of IRCA\nwould be reviewed by federal judges with experience\nadjudicating immigration-related matters.\n   Fourth, Congress created a uniquely federal system by\nwhich employers must verify the work authorization\nstatus of new hires. Under this system, an employer must\nattest under penalty of perjury on a form designated by\nthe Attorney General (the I–9 form) that it has examined\nenumerated identification documents to verify that a new\nhire is not an unauthorized alien. §1324a(b)(1)(A); see\nalso 8 CFR §274a.2; ante, at 3–4. Good-faith compliance\nwith this verification requirement entitles an employer to\nan affirmative defense if charged with violating IRCA.\n§1324a(a)(3); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 57. Nota­\nbly, however, IRCA prohibits use of the I–9 form for any\npurpose other than enforcement of IRCA and various\nprovisions of federal criminal law. §1324a(b)(5); 8 CFR\n§274a.2(b)(4). Use of the I–9 form is thus limited to fed\neral proceedings, as the majority acknowledges. See ante,\nat 18, n. 9.\n   Finally, Congress created no mechanism for States to\naccess information regarding an alien’s work authoriza­\ntion status for purposes of enforcing state prohibitions on\nthe employment of unauthorized aliens. The relevant\nsections of IRCA make no provision for the sharing of\nwork authorization information between federal and state\nauthorities even though access to that information would\nbe critical to a State’s ability to determine whether an\nemployer has employed an unauthorized alien. In stark\ncontrast, a separate provision in the same title of IRCA\ncreates a verification system by which States can ascer­\ntain the immigration status of aliens applying for benefits\nunder programs such as Medicaid and the food stamp\n8      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

The existence of a verification system in one\nprovision of IRCA, coupled with its absence in the provi­\nsion governing employment of unauthorized aliens, sug­\ngests strongly that Congress did not contemplate any role\nfor the States in adjudicating questions regarding em­\nployment of unauthorized aliens. Cf. Bates v. United\nStates, 522 U. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (“Where Congress in­\ncludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion” (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted)).\n   In an attempt to show that Congress intended for the\nFederal Government to share immigration-related in­\nformation with the States, Arizona points to a federal\nstatute, 8 U. S. C. §1373(c), requiring the Government to\nrespond to certain inquiries from state agencies. Section\n1373(c), however, merely requires the Government to\nrespond to inquiries from state agencies “seeking to verify\nor ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any\nindividual within the jurisdiction of the agency.” It does\nnot require the provision of information regarding an\nalien’s work authorization status, which is not necessar-\nily synonymous with immigration status. See 8 CFR\n§274a.12(c) (identifying categories of legal aliens “who\nmust apply for employment authorization”).5 Arizona has\nnot identified any federal statute or regulation requiring\nthe Federal Government to provide information regarding\nan alien’s work authorization status to a State.6 More\n——————\n   5 For example, spouses and minor children of persons working in the\n\nUnited States as exchange visitors must apply for employment authori­\nzation even though they have lawful immigration status as dependents\nof the exchange visitor.

S. 227, 238\n(1999).\n  Collectively, these provisions demonstrate Congress’\nintent to build a centralized, exclusively federal scheme\nfor determining whether a person has “employ[ed], or\nrecruit[ed] or refer[red] for a fee for employment, unau­\nthorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2).\n                              C\n   IRCA’s saving clause must be construed against this\nbackdrop. Focusing primarily on the text of the saving\nclause, Arizona and the majority read the clause to permit\nStates to determine themselves whether a person has\nemployed an unauthorized alien, so long as they do so in\nconnection with licensing sanctions. See ante, at 12–13.\nThis interpretation overlooks the broader statutory con­\ntext and renders the statutory scheme “[in]coherent and\n[in]consistent.” Ali, 552 U. S., at 222.\n   Under the majority’s reading of the saving clause, state\nprosecutors decide whether to commence licensing-related\nproceedings against a person suspected of employing an\nunauthorized alien. The majority’s holding also permits\nstate courts and other tribunals to adjudicate the question\nwhether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.\nThe Arizona Act illustrates the problems with reading the\nsaving clause to permit such state action. The Act directs\nprosecutors to verify an employee’s work authorization\nwith the Federal Government pursuant to §1373(c), e.g.,\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(B) (West Supp. 2010), and\nthe state court “shall consider only the federal govern­\nment’s determination pursuant to [§]1373(c)” in “determin­\n——————\nthrough use of E-Verify.\n10     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

See supra, at 9. Arizona has not identified any\navenue by which States could have accessed work authori­\nzation information in the first decade of IRCA’s existence.\nThe absence of any such avenue at the time of IRCA’s\nenactment speaks volumes as to how Congress would have\nunderstood the saving clause to operate: If States had no\naccess to information regarding the work authorization\nstatus of aliens, how could state courts have accurately\nadjudicated the question whether an employer had em­\nployed an unauthorized alien?\n   The Arizona Act’s reliance on §1373(c) highlights the\nanomalies inherent in state schemes that purport to adju­\ndicate whether an employee is an authorized alien. Even\nwhen Arizona prosecutors obtain information regarding\nan alien’s immigration status pursuant to §1373(c), the\nprosecutors and state court will have to determine the\nsignificance of that information to an alien’s work authori\nzation status, which will often require deciding techni-\ncal questions of immigration law. See, e.g., 8 CFR\n§§274a.12(a)–(c) (dividing 62 different classes of aliens\ninto those authorized for employment incident to immigra­\ntion status, those authorized for employment with a spe­\ncific employer incident to immigration status, and those\nwho must apply for work authorization). And, as dis­\ncussed above, that information may not shed light at all on\nan alien’s work authorization status, which is oftentimes\ndistinct from immigration status. See supra, at 8, and\nn. 5. As a result, in many cases state decisions—made by\n——————\n  7 However, the “federal government’s determination creates [only] a\n\nrebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful status.” E.g., §23–\n212(H).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nprosecutors and courts with no or little experience in\nfederal immigration law—will rest on less-than-complete\nor inaccurate information, “creat[ing] enforcement risks\nnot present in the federal system.” Ante, at 7 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting). I can discern no reason why Congress would\nhave intended for state courts inexperienced in immigra­\ntion matters to adjudicate, in the context of licensing\nsanctions, the very same question that IRCA commits to\nfederal officers, ALJs, and the courts of appeals.\n   Equally problematic is the fact that employers charged\nunder a state enforcement scheme with hiring unauthor­\nized aliens are foreclosed from using I–9 forms in their\ndefense in the state proceedings. Like IRCA, the Arizona\nAct confers an affirmative defense on employers who\ncomply in good faith with IRCA’s verification requirement.\nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§23–212(J), 23–212.01(J). As\ndiscussed above, however, IRCA prohibits an employer\nfrom using the I–9 form to establish that affirmative\ndefense under Arizona law. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(b)(5); 8\nCFR §274a.2(b)(4). Not to worry, the majority says: The\nemployer can establish the affirmative defense through\noffice policies and testimony of employees. Ante, at 18,\nn. 9. But Congress made the I–9 verification system and\naccompanying good-faith defense central to IRCA. See,\ne.g., H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 60 (“[A]n effective verifica­\ntion procedure, combined with an affirmative defense for\nthose who in good faith follow the procedure, is essential”).\nGiven the importance of this procedure, if Congress in fact\nintended for state courts to adjudicate whether a person\nhad employed an unauthorized alien in connection with\nlicensing sanctions, why would it have prohibited that\nperson from using the I–9 form—“the employer’s most\neffective evidence,” ante, at 9 (BREYER, J., dissenting)—in\nthe state-court proceeding? The question answers itself:\nCongress intended no such thing.\n   Furthermore, given Congress’ express goal of “uni­\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

Reading the sav­\ning clause as the majority does subjects employers to a\npatchwork of enforcement schemes similar to the one that\nCongress sought to displace when it enacted IRCA. Hav­\ning carefully constructed a uniform federal scheme for\ndetermining whether a person has employed an unauthor­\nized alien, Congress could not plausibly have meant to\ncreate such a gaping hole in that scheme through the\nundefined, parenthetical phrase “licensing and similar\nlaws.” See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\n531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one\nmight say, hide elephants in mouseholes”).\n   In sum, the statutory scheme as a whole defeats Ari­\nzona’s and the majority’s reading of the saving clause.\nCongress would not sensibly have permitted States to\ndetermine for themselves whether a person has employed\nan unauthorized alien, while at the same time creating a\nspecialized federal procedure for making such a determi­\nnation, withholding from the States the information nec­\nessary to make such a determination, and precluding use\nof the I–9 forms in nonfederal proceedings. See United\nStates v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 106 (2000) (“We decline to\ngive broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would\nupset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal\nlaw”).\n   To render IRCA’s saving clause consistent with the\nstatutory scheme, I read the saving clause to permit\nStates to impose licensing sanctions following a final\nfederal determination that a person has violated\n§1324a(a)(1)(A) by knowingly hiring, recruiting, or refer­\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 106. It also\nmakes sense as a practical matter. In enacting IRCA’s\npre-emption clause, Congress vested in the Federal Gov­\nernment the authority to impose civil and criminal sanc­\ntions on persons who employ unauthorized aliens. Licens­\ning and other types of business-related permissions are\ntypically a matter of state law, however. See, e.g., Kamen\nv. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991)\n(noting that “[c]orporation law” is an area traditionally\n“governed by state-law standards”); Chicago Title & Trust\n\n——————\n  8 This reading of the saving clause finds support in IRCA’s legislative\n\nhistory. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported that IRCA\nwas “not intended to preempt or prevent lawful state or local processes\nconcerning the suspension, revocation or refusal to reissue a license to\nany person who has been found to have violated the sanctions pro­\nvisions in this legislation.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis\nadded). The Committee’s reference to “this legislation” is, of course, a\nreference to IRCA, and only federal officers, ALJs, and courts have\nauthority under IRCA to find that a person has violated the statute’s\nsanctions provisions.\n  My reading is also consistent with, though not compelled by, the\nprovisions in IRCA that amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul­\ntural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. As JUSTICE\nBREYER discusses in detail, see ante, at 13–15 (dissenting opinion),\nAWPA requires entities to secure a certificate of registration from the\nDepartment of Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting\nactivity.” AWPA §101, 96 Stat. 2587, 29 U. S. C. §1811(a). Before 1986,\nAWPA prohibited farm labor contractors from hiring unauthorized\naliens, and it permitted the Department of Labor to institute adminis­\ntrative proceedings to enforce this prohibition. See §§103(a)(3), 103(b),\n106(a), 96 Stat. 2588–2590. In IRCA, Congress repealed this pro­\nhibition, IRCA §101(b)(1)(C), but authorized the Secretary of Labor to\nwithdraw a contractor’s federal registration certificate upon a finding of\nan IRCA violation, IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 100 Stat. 3372, 29 U. S. C.\n§1813(a)(6). Thus, IRCA made AWPA’s licensing sanctions turn on a\nprior federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.\n14    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

S.\n120, 127 (1937) (“How long and upon what terms a state­\ncreated corporation may continue to exist is a matter\nexclusively of state power”). As a result, if Congress\nwanted to “ensur[e] that a full range of sanctions [was]\navailable to be used against businesses that employ unau­\nthorized aliens,” Brief for Respondent 37, Congress had to\nauthorize the States and localities to impose licensing\nsanctions following a federal adjudication of a violation of\nIRCA.\n    I do not mean to suggest that the mere existence of a\ncomprehensive federal scheme necessarily reveals a con­\ngressional intent to oust state remedies. Cf. English v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 87 (1990) (“[T]he mere\nexistence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme\n. . . does not by itself imply pre-emption of state reme­\ndies”); New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino,\n413 U. S. 405, 415 (1973) (rejecting the argument that\n“pre-emption is to be inferred merely from the comprehen­\nsive character of the federal [program]”). Here, Congress\nhas made clear its intent to oust state civil and criminal\nremedies; the sole question is the scope of the saving\nclause’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.” The\ncomprehensive scheme established by Congress necessar­\nily informs the scope of this clause. For all the reasons\nstated, the only interpretation of that clause that is consis­\ntent with the rest of the statute is that it preserves the\nStates’ authority to impose licensing sanctions after a final\nfederal determination that a person has violated IRCA’s\nprohibition on the knowing employment of unauthorized\naliens.\n    Under my construction of the saving clause, the Arizona\nAct cannot escape pre-emption. The Act authorizes Ari­\nzona county attorneys to commence actions charging an\nemployer with having employed an unauthorized alien.\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§23–212(D), 23–212.01(D).

Because the\nAct’s sanctions are not premised on a final federal deter­\nmination that an employer has violated IRCA, I would\nhold that the Act does not fall within IRCA’s saving clause\nand is therefore pre-empted.9\n                              II\n   I agree with the conclusion reached by JUSTICE BREYER\nin Part IV of his dissenting opinion that federal law impli­\nedly pre-empts the provision in the Arizona Act requiring\nall Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify program.\nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214. I also agree with much\nof his reasoning. I write separately to offer a few addi­\ntional observations.\n   As we have recently recognized, that a state law makes\nmandatory something that federal law makes voluntary\ndoes not mean, in and of itself, that the state law “stands\nas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\nfull purposes and objectives of Congress,” Crosby v. Na\ntional Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373 (2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See Williamson v.\nMazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.

Here, the Arizona Act directly\nregulates the relationship between the Federal Govern­\nment and private parties by mandating use of a federally\ncreated and administered resource. This case thus impli­\ncates the “uniquely federal interes[t]” in managing use of a\nfederal resource. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487\nU.

In addition to\nthose discussed by JUSTICE BREYER, see ante, at 17–19\n(dissenting opinion), I note that Congress considered the\ncost of a mandatory program. In 2003, when Congress\nelected to expand E-Verify to all 50 States but declined to\nrequire its use, it cited a congressionally mandated report\nconcluding that the annual cost of the pilot program was\n$6 million, the annual cost of a nationwide voluntary\nprogram would be $11 million, and the annual cost of a\nnationwide mandatory program would be $11.7 billion.\nH.

See Westat, Findings of the E-Verify® Program\nEvaluation 224 (2009) (observing that the SSA estimated\nthat it would have to hire an additional 1,500 field staff\nto handle a mandatory national program); id., at 251 (re­\ncommending that any expansion of E-Verify take place\ngradually “to allow the Federal government adequate time\nto hire and train the new staff required to run such a\nprogram”).

But “[t]he pur­\npose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every\npre-emption case.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 494 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It matters not whether the\nExecutive Branch believes that the Government is now\ncapable of handling the burdens of a mandatory system.11\nCongressional intent controls, and Congress has repeat­\nedly decided to keep the E-Verify program voluntary.\nBecause state laws requiring use of E-Verify frustrate\nthe significant policy objectives underlying this decision,\n——————\n  10 In Williamson v.

WHITING ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 09–115.      Argued December 8, 2010—Decided May 26, 2011\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) makes it “unlawful\n  for a person or other entity . . . to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee,\n  for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an\n  unauthorized alien.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). Employers that vio\n  late that prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal\n  sanctions. IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em\n  ployment of unauthorized workers; the Act expressly preempts “any\n  State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than\n  through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or re\n  cruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”\n  §1324a(h)(2).\n     IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employee’s\n  eligibility for employment. In an attempt to improve that verification\n  process in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi\n  bility Act (IIRIRA), Congress created E-Verify—an internet-based\n  system employers can use to check the work authorization status of\n  employees.\n     Against this statutory background, several States have recently\n  enacted laws attempting to impose sanctions for the employment of\n  unauthorized aliens through, among other things, “licensing and\n  similar laws.” Arizona is one of them. The Legal Arizona Workers\n  Act provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or\n  intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain cir\n  cumstances must be, suspended or revoked. That law also requires\n  that all Arizona employers use E-Verify.\n     The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various busi\n  ness and civil rights organizations (collectively Chamber) filed this\n2        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                    AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                         Syllabus \n\n\n    federal preenforcement suit against those charged with administer\n    ing the Arizona law, arguing that the state law’s license suspension\n    and revocation provisions were both expressly and impliedly pre\n    empted by federal immigration law, and that the mandatory use of E-\n    Verify was impliedly preempted. The District Court found that the\n    plain language of IRCA’s preemption clause did not invalidate the\n    Arizona law because the law did no more than impose licensing con\n    ditions on businesses operating within the State. Nor was the state\n    law preempted with respect to E-Verify, the court concluded, because\n    although Congress had made the program voluntary at the national\n    level, it had expressed no intent to prevent States from mandating\n    participation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n558 F. 3d 856, affirmed.\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to Parts I and II–A, concluding that Arizona’s licensing law is not ex\n  pressly preempted.\n     Arizona’s licensing law falls well within the confines of the author\n  ity Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not ex\n  pressly preempted. While IRCA prohibits States from imposing “civil\n  or criminal sanctions” on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it\n  preserves state authority to impose sanctions “through licensing and\n  similar laws.” §1324a(h)(2). That is what the Arizona law does—it\n  instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state\n  employers that employ unauthorized aliens. The definition of “li\n  cense” contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition\n  of “license” that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure\n  Act (APA).\n     The state statute also includes within its definition of “license”\n  documents such as articles of incorporation, certificates of partner\n  ship, and grants of authority to foreign companies to transact busi\n  ness in the State, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9), each of which has\n  clear counterparts in APA and dictionary definitions of the word “li\n  cense.” And even if a law regulating articles of incorporation and the\n  like is not itself a “licensing law,” it is at the very least “similar” to\n  one, and therefore comfortably within the savings clause. The\n  Chamber’s argument that the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law be\n  cause it operates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than to\n  grant them is without basis in law, fact, or logic.\n     The Chamber contends that the savings clause should apply only to\n  certain types of licenses or only to license revocation following an\n  IRCA adjudication because Congress, when enacting IRCA, elimi\n  nated unauthorized worker prohibitions and associated adjudication\n  procedures in another federal statute. But no such limits are even\n                   Cite as: 563 U.

Pp. 9–15.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\nand JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part II–B:\n   The Arizona licensing law is not impliedly preempted by federal\nlaw. At its broadest, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress in\ntended the federal system to be exclusive. But Arizona’s procedures\nsimply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the\nStates to pursue through licensing laws. Given that Congress spe\ncifically preserved such authority for the States, it stands to reason\nthat Congress did not intend to prevent the States from using appro\npriate tools to exercise that authority.\n   And here Arizona’s law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all ma\nterial respects. For example, it adopts the federal definition of who\nqualifies as an “unauthorized alien,” compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3)\nwith Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11); provides that state investiga\ntors must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized\nalien with the Federal Government, making no independent deter\nmination of the matter, §23–212(B); and requires a state court to\n“consider only the federal government’s determination,” §23–212(H).\n   The Chamber’s more general contention that the Arizona law is\npreempted because it upsets the balance that Congress sought to\nstrike in IRCA also fails. The cases on which the Chamber relies in\nmaking this argument all involve uniquely federal areas of interest,\nsee, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341.\nRegulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not such an\narea. And those cases all concern state actions that directly inter\nfered with the operation of a federal program, see, e.g., id., at 351.\nThere is no similar interference here.\n   The Chamber asserts that employers will err on the side of dis\ncrimination rather than risk the “ ‘business death penalty’ ” by “hir\ning unauthorized workers.” That is not the choice. License termina\ntion is not an available sanction for merely hiring unauthorized\nworkers, but is triggered only by far more egregious violations. And\nbecause the Arizona law covers only knowing or intentional viola\ntions, an employer acting in good faith need not fear the law’s sanc\ntions. Moreover, federal and state antidiscrimination laws protect\nagainst employment discrimination and provide employers with a\nstrong incentive not to discriminate. Employers also enjoy safe har\nbors from liability when using E-Verify as required by the Arizona\nlaw. The most rational path for employers is to obey both the law\n4        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                    AMERICA v.

There is no reason to suppose that Arizona em\n    ployers will choose not to do so. Pp. 15–22.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n    to Part III–A, concluding that Arizona’s E-Verify mandate is not im\n    pliedly preempted.\n       Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify is not impliedly\n    preempted. The IIRIRA provision setting up E-Verify contains no\n    language circumscribing state action. It does, however, constrain\n    federal action: absent a prior violation of federal law, “the Secretary\n    of Homeland Security may not require any person or . . . entity” out\n    side the Federal Government “to participate in” E-Verify. IIRIRA,\n    §402(a), (e). The fact that the Federal Government may require the\n    use of E-Verify in only limited circumstances says nothing about\n    what the States may do. The Government recently argued just that\n    in another case and approvingly referenced Arizona’s law as an ex\n    ample of a permissible use of E-Verify when doing so.\n       Moreover, Arizona’s use of E-Verify does not conflict with the fed\n    eral scheme. The state law requires no more than that an employer,\n    after hiring an employee, “verify the employment eligibility of the\n    employee” through E-Verify. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214(A). And\n    the consequences of not using E-Verify are the same under the state\n    and federal law—an employer forfeits an otherwise available rebut\n    table presumption of compliance with the law. Pp. 23–24.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n    and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Part III–B:\n       Arizona’s requirement that employers use E-Verify in no way ob\n    structs achieving the aims of the federal program. In fact, the Gov\n    ernment has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of E-\n    Verify, and Congress has directed that E-Verify be made available in\n    all 50 States. And the Government has expressly rejected the Cham\n    ber’s claim that the Arizona law, and those like it, will overload the\n    federal system. Pp. 24–25.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

C. §1324a(h)(2).\nA recently enacted Arizona statute—the Legal Arizona\nWorkers Act—provides that the licenses of state employ\ners that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized\naliens may be, and in certain circumstances must be, sus\npended or revoked.       The law also requires that all\nArizona employers use a federal electronic verification\nsystem to confirm that the workers they employ are\nlegally authorized workers. The question presented is\nwhether federal immigration law preempts those provi\nsions of Arizona law.

S. C. §1101\net seq. That statute established a “comprehensive federal\nstatutory scheme for regulation of immigration and natu\nralization” and set “the terms and conditions of admission\nto the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens\nlawfully in the country.” De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351,\n353, 359 (1976).\n   In the years following the enactment of the INA, several\nStates took action to prohibit the employment of indi\nviduals living within state borders who were not lawful\nresidents of the United States. For example, in 1971 Cali\nfornia passed a law providing that “[n]o employer shall\nknowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful\nresidence in the United States if such employment would\nhave an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.” 1971\nCal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1(a). The California law imposed\nfines ranging from $200 to $500 for each violation of this\nprohibition. §1(b). At least 11 other States enacted provi\nsions during that same time period proscribing the em\nployment of unauthorized aliens.1\n   We first addressed the interaction of federal immigra\ntion law and state laws dealing with the employment of\nunauthorized aliens in De Canas, 424 U.

S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A). IRCA defines an\n“unauthorized alien” as an alien who is not “lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence” or not otherwise au\nthorized by the Attorney General to be employed in the\nUnited States. §1324a(h)(3).\n  To facilitate compliance with this prohibition, IRCA\nrequires that employers review documents establishing\nan employee’s eligibility for employment. §1324a(b). An\nemployer can confirm an employee’s authorization to work\nby reviewing the employee’s United States passport, resi\ndent alien card, alien registration card, or other document\napproved by the Attorney General; or by reviewing a\ncombination of other documents such as a driver’s license\nand social security card. §1324a(b)(1)(B)–(D). The em\nployer must attest under penalty of perjury on Depart\nment of Homeland Security Form I–9 that he “has verified\n4     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat the individual is not an unauthorized alien” by re\nviewing these documents. §1324a(b)(1)(A). The form I–9\nitself “and any information contained in or appended to [it]\n. . . may not be used for purposes other than for enforce\nment of” IRCA and other specified provisions of federal\nlaw. §1324a(b)(5).\n    Employers that violate IRCA’s strictures may be sub\njected to both civil and criminal sanctions. Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, an entity within the Depart\nment of Homeland Security, is authorized to bring charges\nagainst a noncompliant employer under §1324a(e). De\npending on the circumstances of the violation, a civil fine\nranging from $250 to $16,000 per unauthorized worker\nmay be imposed. See §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10136\n(2008). Employers that engage in a pattern or practice\nof violating IRCA’s requirements can be criminally prose\ncuted, fined, and imprisoned for up to six months.\n§1324a(f)(1). The Act also imposes fines for engaging in\n“unfair immigration-related employment practice[s]” such\nas discriminating on the basis of citizenship or national\norigin. §1324b(a)(1); see §1324b(g)(2)(B). Good-faith com\npliance with IRCA’s I–9 document review requirements\nprovides an employer with an affirmative defense if\ncharged with a §1324a violation. §1324a(a)(3).\n    IRCA also restricts the ability of States to combat em\nployment of unauthorized workers. The Act expressly\npreempts “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal\nsanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws)\nupon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for\nemployment, unauthorized aliens.” §1324a(h)(2). Under\nthat provision, state laws imposing civil fines for the\nemployment of unauthorized workers like the one we\nupheld in De Canas are now expressly preempted.\n    In 1996, in an attempt to improve IRCA’s employment\nverification system, Congress created three experimental\ncomplements to the I–9 process as part of the Illegal Im\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Originally known as the\n“Basic Pilot Program,” E-Verify “is an internet-based\nsystem that allows an employer to verify an employee’s\nwork-authorization status.” Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc.\nv. Napolitano, 558 F. 3d 856, 862 (CA9 2009). An em\nployer submits a request to the E-Verify system based on\ninformation that the employee provides similar to that\nused in the I–9 process. In response to that request,\nthe employer receives either a confirmation or a tentative\nnonconfirmation of the employee’s authorization to work.\nAn employee may challenge a nonconfirmation report. If\nthe employee does not do so, or if his challenge is unsuc\ncessful, his employment must be terminated or the Fed\neral Government must be informed. See ibid.\n    In the absence of a prior violation of certain federal\nlaws, IIRIRA prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Secu\nrity from “requir[ing] any person or . . . entity” outside the\nFederal Government “to participate in” the E-Verify pro\ngram, §402(a), (e), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–658. To\npromote use of the program, however, the statute provides\nthat any employer that utilizes E-Verify “and obtains\nconfirmation of identity and employment eligibility in\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the program\n. . . has established a rebuttable presumption” that it has\nnot violated IRCA’s unauthorized alien employment pro\nhibition, §402(b)(1), id., at 3009–656 to 3009–657.\n                             B\n  Acting against this statutory and historical background,\nseveral States have recently enacted laws attempting to\nimpose sanctions for the employment of unauthorized\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§23–211, 212, 212.01 (West Supp. 2010) (citing 8\nU. S. C. §1324a).\n   Under the Arizona law, if an individual files a complaint\nalleging that an employer has hired an unauthorized\nalien, the attorney general or the county attorney first\nverifies the employee’s work authorization with the Fed\neral Government pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1373(c). Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(B). Section 1373(c) provides that\nthe Federal Government “shall respond to an inquiry by a”\nState “seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or\nimmigration status of any individual . . . by providing the\nrequested verification or status information.” The Arizona\nlaw expressly prohibits state, county, or local officials from\nattempting “to independently make a final determination\non whether an alien is authorized to work in the United\nStates.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(B). If the §1373(c)\ninquiry reveals that a worker is an unauthorized alien,\nthe attorney general or the county attorney must notify\nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement offi\ncials, notify local law enforcement, and bring an action\nagainst the employer. §23–212(C)(1)–(3), (D).\n   When a complaint is brought against an employer un\nder Arizona law, “the court shall consider only the fed\neral government’s determination pursuant to” 8 U.

Good-faith compliance with\nthe federal I–9 process provides employers prosecuted by\nthe State with an affirmative defense. §23–212(J).\n   A first instance of “knowingly employ[ing] an unauthor\nized alien” requires that the court order the employer to\nterminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens and\nfile quarterly reports on all new hires for a probationary\nperiod of three years. §23–212(A), (F)(1)(a)–(b). The court\nmay also “order the appropriate agencies to suspend all\nlicenses . . . that are held by the employer for [a period]\nnot to exceed ten business days.” §23–212(F)(1)(d). A\nsecond knowing violation requires that the adjudicating\ncourt “permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the\nemployer specific to the business location where the unau\nthorized alien performed work.” §23–212(F)(2).\n   For a first intentional violation, the court must order\nthe employer to terminate the employment of all unau\nthorized aliens and file quarterly reports on all new hires\nfor a probationary period of five years. §23–212.01(A),\n(F)(1)(a)–(b).    The court must also suspend all the\nemployer’s licenses for a minimum of 10 days. §23–\n212.01(F)(1)(c). A second intentional violation requires\nthe permanent revocation of all business licenses. §23–\n212.01(F)(2).\n   With respect to both knowing and intentional violations,\na violation qualifies as a “second violation” only if it oc\ncurs at the same business location as the first violation,\nduring the time that the employer is already on probation\nfor a violation at that location. §23–212(F)(3)(a)–(b); §23–\n212.01(F)(3)(a)–(b).\n   The Arizona law also requires that “every employer,\nafter hiring an employee, shall verify the employment\neligibility of the employee” by using E-Verify. §23–\n8      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v.

C. §551(8)\n(“ ‘license’ includes the whole or a part of an agency per\nmit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, member\nship, statutory exemption or other form of permission”).\n    Apart from that general definition, the Arizona law\nspecifically includes within its definition of “license” docu\nments such as articles of incorporation, certificates of\npartnership, and grants of authority to foreign companies\nto transact business in the State. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§23–211(9). These examples have clear counterparts in\nthe APA definition just quoted. See 5 U. S. C. §551(8)\n(defining “license” as including a “registration” or “charter”).\n    A license is “a right or permission granted in accordance\nwith law . . . to engage in some business or occupation, to\ndo some act, or to engage in some transaction which but\nfor such license would be unlawful.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1304 (2002). Articles of incorpo\nration and certificates of partnership allow the formation\nof legal entities and permit them as such to engage in\nbusiness and transactions “which but for such” authoriza\ntion “would be unlawful.” Ibid.; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§§10–302, 302(11) (West 2004) (articles of incorporation\nallow a corporation “to carry out its business and affairs”\nand to “[c]onduct its business”); see also §10–202(A)(3)\n(West Supp. 2010). As for state-issued authorizations for\nforeign businesses to operate within a State, we have re\npeatedly referred to those as “licenses.” See, e.g., Heli\ncopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n408, 417 (1984); G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404,\n413, n. 8 (1982); Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown\nCo., 260 U. S. 516, 518 (1923). Moreover, even if a law\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2).5\n   The Chamber and the United States as amicus argue\nthat the Arizona law is not a “licensing” law because it\noperates only to suspend and revoke licenses rather than\nto grant them. Again, this construction of the term runs\ncontrary to the definition that Congress itself has codified.\nSee 5 U. S. C. §551(9) (“ ‘licensing’ includes agency process\nrespecting the grant, renewal, denial, revocation, sus\npension, annulment, withdrawal, limitation, amendment,\nmodification, or conditioning of a license” (emphasis\nadded)). It is also contrary to common sense. There is no\nbasis in law, fact, or logic for deeming a law that grants\nlicenses a licensing law, but a law that suspends or re\nvokes those very licenses something else altogether.\n\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE BREYER recognizes that Arizona’s definition of the word\n\n“license” comports with dictionaries’ treatment of the term, but argues\nthat “license” must be read in a more restricted way so as not to include\nthings such as “marriage licenses” and “dog licens[es].” Post, at 2, 12\n(dissenting opinion). Luckily, we need not address such fanciful hy\npotheticals; Arizona limits its definition of “license” to those state per\nmissions issued “for the purposes of operating a business” in the\nState. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(9)(a) (West Supp. 2010).\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s primary concern appears to be that state permis\nsions such as articles of incorporation and partnership certificates are\ntreated as “licensing and similar laws.” Because myriad other licenses\nare required to operate a business, that concern is largely academic.\nSee §42–5005(A) (West 2006) (Corporations that receive “gross proceeds\nof sales or gross income upon which a privilege tax is imposed . . . shall\nmake application to the department for a privilege license.” Such a\ncorporation “shall not engage or continue in business until the [corpora\ntion] has obtained a privilege license.”). Suspending or revoking an\nemployer’s articles of incorporation will often be entirely redundant.\nSee §§42–5010, 5061–5076 (West 2006 and West Supp. 2010) (describ\ning when transaction privilege tax licenses are required).\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   The Chamber also submits that the manner in which\nCongress amended a related statute when enacting IRCA\nsupports a narrow interpretation of the savings clause.\nThe Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection\nAct (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. §1801 et seq., requires employers\nto secure a registration certificate from the Department\nof Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting\nactivity.” §1811(a). Prior to IRCA, AWPA had contained\nits own prohibition on hiring unauthorized workers, with\naccompanying adjudication procedures. See §1813(a);\n§1816(a) (1982 ed.) (repealed by IRCA, 100 Stat. 3372);\n§1851(a)–(b) (1982 ed.) (amended by IRCA, 100 Stat.\n3372). When Congress enacted IRCA, it repealed AWPA’s\nseparate unauthorized worker prohibition and eliminated\nthe associated adjudication process. Under the current\nstate of the law, an AWPA certification may be denied\nbased on a prior IRCA violation. §1813(a)(6) (2006 ed.).\nAnd once obtained, that certification can be revoked be\ncause of the employment of an unauthorized alien only\nfollowing a finding of an IRCA violation. Ibid.\n   The Chamber asserts that IRCA’s amendment of AWPA\nshows that Congress meant to allow state licensing sanc\ntions only after a federal IRCA adjudication, just as ad\nverse action under AWPA can now be taken only through\nIRCA’s procedures. But the text of IRCA’s savings clause\nsays nothing about state licensing sanctions being contin\ngent on prior federal adjudication, or indeed about state\nlicensing processes at all. The simple fact that federal law\ncreates procedures for federal investigations and adjudica\ntions culminating in federal civil or criminal sanctions\ndoes not indicate that Congress intended to prevent States\nfrom establishing their own procedures for imposing\ntheir own sanctions through licensing. Were AWPA not\namended to conform with IRCA, two different federal\nagencies would be responsible for administering two dif\nferent unauthorized alien employment laws. The conform\n                Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)         13\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ning amendments eliminated that potential redundancy\nand centralized federal adjudicatory authority. That\nhardly supports a conclusion that any state licensing\nprograms must also be contingent on the central federal\nsystem.\n   In much the same vein, the Chamber argues that Con\ngress’s repeal of “AWPA’s separate prohibition concerning\nunauthorized workers belies any suggestion that IRCA\nmeant to authorize each of the 50 States . . . to impose\nits own separate prohibition,” and that Congress instead\nwanted uniformity in immigration law enforcement. Brief\nfor Petitioners 36. JUSTICE BREYER also objects to the\ndeparture from “one centralized enforcement scheme”\nunder federal law. Post, at 7 (dissenting opinion). But\nCongress expressly preserved the ability of the States to\nimpose their own sanctions through licensing; that—like\nour federal system in general—necessarily entails the\nprospect of some departure from homogeneity. And as for\n“separate prohibition[s],” it is worth recalling that the\nArizona licensing law is based exclusively on the federal\nprohibition—a court reviewing a complaint under the\nArizona law may “consider only the federal government’s\ndetermination” with respect to “whether an employee is an\nunauthorized alien.” §23–212(H).\n   Even more boldly, the Chamber contends that IRCA’s\nsavings clause was intended to allow States to impose\nlicensing sanctions solely on AWPA-related farm contract\ning licensees. AWPA specifically recognized that federal\nregulation of farm contracting licensing was only “in\ntended to supplement State law,” 29 U. S. C. §1871, and\nthe Chamber argues that the purpose of IRCA’s savings\nclause was limited to preserving existing state farm con\ntractor licensing programs. But here again no such limit\nis remotely discernible in the statutory text. Absent any\ntextual basis, we are not inclined to limit so markedly\nthe otherwise broad phrasing of the savings clause. See\n14      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                   AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nUnited States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287\nU. S. 77, 83 (1932) (“extrinsic aids to construction” may be\nused “to solve, but not to create, an ambiguity” (emphasis\nand internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Chamber argues that its textual and structural\narguments are bolstered by IRCA’s legislative history. We\nhave already concluded that Arizona’s law falls within the\nplain text of IRCA’s savings clause. And, as we have said\nbefore, Congress’s “authoritative statement is the statu\ntory text, not the legislative history.” Exxon Mobil Corp.\nv. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see\nalso Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U. S.\n137, 149–150, n. 4 (2002). Whatever the usefulness of\nrelying on legislative history materials in general, the\narguments against doing so are particularly compelling\nhere. Beyond verbatim recitation of the statutory text, all\nof the legislative history documents related to IRCA save\none fail to discuss the savings clause at all. The Senate\nJudiciary Committee Report on the Senate version of\nthe law does not comment on it. See S. Rep. No. 99–132\n(1985). Only one of the four House Reports on the law\ntouches on the licensing exception, see H. R. Rep. No. 99–\n682, pt. 1, p. 58 (1986), and we have previously dismissed\nthat very report as “a rather slender reed” from “one\nHouse of a politically divided Congress.” Hoffman, supra,\nat 149–150, n. 4. And the Conference Committee Report\ndoes not discuss the scope of IRCA’s preemption provision\nin any way. See H. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000 (1986).6\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE   BREYER poses several rhetorical questions challenging our\nreading of IRCA and then goes on to propose two seemingly alternative\nviews of the phrase “licensing and similar laws”—that it was meant to\nrefer to “employment-related licensing systems,” post, at 11 (dissenting\nopinion) (emphasis deleted), or, even more narrowly, to “the licensing of\nfirms in the business of recruiting or referring workers for employment,\nsuch as . . . state agricultural labor contractor licensing schemes,” post,\nat 13. If we are asking questions, a more telling one may be why, if\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    15\n\n                        Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                         Opinion R the Court\n\n  IRCA expressly preempts some state powers dealing\nwith the employment of unauthorized aliens and it ex\npressly preserves others. We hold that Arizona’s licensing\nlaw falls well within the confines of the authority Con\ngress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not\nexpressly preempted.\n                             B\n  As an alternative to its express preemption argument,\nthe Chamber contends that Arizona’s law is impliedly\npreempted because it conflicts with federal law. At its\nbroadest level, the Chamber’s argument is that Congress\n“intended the federal system to be exclusive,” and that any\nstate system therefore necessarily conflicts with federal\nlaw. Brief for Petitioners 39. But Arizona’s procedures\nsimply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly\nallowed Arizona to pursue through licensing laws. Given\nthat Congress specifically preserved such authority for the\nStates, it stands to reason that Congress did not intend to\nprevent the States from using appropriate tools to exercise\n\n——————\nCongress had intended such limited exceptions to its prohibition on\nstate sanctions, it did not simply say so, instead of excepting “licensing\nand similar laws” generally?\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR takes a different tack. Invoking arguments that\nresemble those found in our implied preemption cases, she concludes\nthat the Arizona law “falls outside” the savings clause and is expressly\npreempted because it allows “state courts to determine whether a\nperson has employed an unauthorized alien.” Post, at 2 (dissenting\nopinion). While JUSTICE BREYER would add language to the statute\nnarrowly limiting the phrase “licensing and similar laws” to specific\ntypes of licenses, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR creates an entirely new statutory\nrequirement: She would allow States to impose sanctions through\n“licensing and similar laws” only after a federal adjudication. Such a\nrequirement is found nowhere in the text, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR does\nnot even attempt to link it to a specific textual provision.\n   It should not be surprising that the two dissents have sharply differ\nent views on how to read the statute. That is the sort of thing that can\nhappen when statutory analysis is so untethered from the text.\n16      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                   AMERICA v.

J.\n                    Opinion R the Court\n\nthat authority.\n   And here Arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that\nits law closely tracks IRCA’s provisions in all material\nrespects. The Arizona law begins by adopting the federal\ndefinition of who qualifies as an “unauthorized alien.”\nCompare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3) (an “unauthorized alien”\nis an alien not “lawfully admitted for permanent resi\ndence” or not otherwise authorized by federal law to be\nemployed) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–211(11) (adopt\ning the federal definition of “unauthorized alien”); see De\nCanas, 424 U. S., at 363 (finding no preemption of state\nlaw that operates “only with respect to individuals whom\nthe Federal Government has already declared cannot work\nin this country”).\n   Not only that, the Arizona law expressly provides that\nstate investigators must verify the work authorization of\nan allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Govern\nment, and “shall not attempt to independently make a\nfinal determination on whether an alien is authorized to\nwork in the United States.” §23–212(B). What is more, a\nstate court “shall consider only the federal government’s\ndetermination” when deciding “whether an employee is an\nunauthorized alien.” §23–212(H) (emphasis added). As a\nresult, there can by definition be no conflict between state\nand federal law as to worker authorization, either at the\ninvestigatory or adjudicatory stage.7\n——————\n  7 After specifying that a state court may consider “only” the federal\ndetermination, the Arizona law goes on to provide that the federal\ndetermination is “a rebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful\nstatus,” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (West Supp. 2010). Arizona\nexplains that this provision does not permit the State to establish\nunlawful status apart from the federal determination—the provision\ncould hardly do that, given the foregoing. It instead operates to “en\nsur[e] that the employer has an opportunity to rebut the evidence\npresented to establish a worker’s unlawful status.” Brief for Respon\ndents 49 (emphasis added). Only in that sense is the federal determi\nnation a “rebuttable presumption.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46–47. Giving\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

J.\n                        Opinion R the Court\n\n   The federal determination on which the State must rely\nis provided under 8 U. S. C. §1373(c). See supra, at 6–7.\nThat provision requires the Federal Government to “verify\nor ascertain” an individual’s “citizenship or immigration\nstatus” in response to a state request. JUSTICE BREYER is\nconcerned that this information “says nothing about work\nauthorization.” Post, at 9 (dissenting opinion). JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR shares that concern. Post, at 10 (dissenting\nopinion). But if a §1373(c) inquiry reveals that someone is\na United States citizen, that certainly answers the ques\ntion whether that individual is authorized to work. The\nsame would be true if the response to a §1373(c) query\ndisclosed that the individual was a lawful permanent\nresident alien or, on the other hand, had been ordered\nremoved. In any event, if the information provided under\n§1373(c) does not confirm that an employee is an unau\nthorized alien, then the State cannot prove its case. See\nBrief for Respondents 50, n. 10 (“if the information from\nthe federal authorities does not establish that a person is\nan unauthorized alien, it means that the county attorney\ncannot satisfy his burden of proof in an enforcement\naction”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 47.\n   From this basic starting point, the Arizona law contin\nues to trace the federal law. Both the state and federal\nlaw prohibit “knowingly” employing an unauthorized\nalien. Compare 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A) with Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §23–212(A).8 But the state law does not stop\nthere in guarding against any conflict with the federal\nlaw. The Arizona law provides that “ ‘[k]nowingly employ\nan unauthorized alien’ means the actions described in 8\n——————\nan employer a chance to show that it did not break the state law\ncertainly does not place the Arizona regime in conflict with federal law.\n  8 State law also prohibits “intentionally” employing an unauthorized\n\nalien, §23–212.01(A), a more severe violation of the law. The Chamber\ndoes not suggest that this prohibition is any more problematic than the\nprohibition on “knowingly” employing an unauthorized alien.\n18        CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                     AMERICA v.

Compare 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(a)(3) (“A person or entity that establishes that it\nhas complied in good faith with the [employment verifica\ntion] requirements of [§1324a(b)] with respect to hiring . . .\nan alien . . . has established an affirmative defense that\nthe person or entity has not violated” the law) with Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(J) (“an employer that establishes\nthat it has complied in good faith with the requirements\nof 8 United States Code section 1324a(b) establishes an\naffirmative defense that the employer did not knowingly\nemploy an unauthorized alien”).9 And both the federal\nand Arizona law accord employers a rebuttable presump\ntion of compliance with the law when they use E-Verify to\nvalidate a finding of employment eligibility. Compare\nIIRIRA §402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657 with\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(I).\n   Apart from the mechanics of the Arizona law, the Cham\nber argues more generally that the law is preempted\nbecause it upsets the balance that Congress sought to\nstrike when enacting IRCA. In the Chamber’s view, IRCA\n——————\n  9 The  Chamber contends that the Arizona law conflicts with federal\nlaw because IRCA prohibits the use of the I–9 form and “any informa\ntion contained in or appended to [it]” from being “used for purposes\nother than for enforcement of” IRCA and other specified federal laws. 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(b)(5). That argument mistakenly assumes that an\nemployer would need to use the I–9 form or its supporting documents\nthemselves to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense in Arizona\ncourt. In fact, “[a]n employer [could] establish good faith compliance\nwith [the] I–9 process[] . . . through testimony of employees and de\nscriptions of office policy.” Brief for Respondents 52; see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 33.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Brief\nfor Petitioners 45 (quoting Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’\nLegal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 353 (2001)); see Brief for\nPetitioners 42–45; Reply Brief for Petitioners 20.\n    As an initial matter, the cases on which the Chamber\nrelies in advancing this argument all involve uniquely\nfederal areas of regulation. See American Ins. Assn. v.\nGaramendi, 539 U. S. 396, 401, 405–406 (2003) (presiden\ntial conduct of foreign policy); Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373–374 (2000) (foreign\naffairs power); Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm.,\n531 U. S. 341, 352 (2001) (fraud on a federal agency);\nUnited States v. Locke, 529 U.

Regulating in-state businesses through licensing\nlaws has never been considered such an area of dominant\nfederal concern.\n    Furthermore, those cases all concern state actions that\ndirectly interfered with the operation of the federal pro\ngram. In Buckman, for example, the Court determined\nthat allowing a state tort action would cause applicants\nbefore a federal agency “to submit a deluge of information\nthat the [agency] neither wants nor needs, resulting in\nadditional burdens on the [agency’s] evaluation of an\napplication,” and harmful delays in the agency process.\n531 U.

Crosby\ninvolved a state law imposing sanctions on any entity do\ning business with Burma, a law that left the President\nwith “less to offer and less economic and diplomatic lever\nage” in exercising his foreign affairs powers. 530 U. S., at\n377. The state law in Bonito Boats extended patent-like\nprotection “for subject matter for which patent protection\nhas been denied or has expired,” “thus eroding the general\nrule of free competition upon which the attractiveness of\nthe federal patent bargain depends.” 489 U. S., at 159,\n161. And the portions of Locke on which the Chamber\nrelies involved state efforts “to impose additional unique\nsubstantive regulation on the at-sea conduct of vessels”—\n“an area where the federal interest has been manifest\nsince the beginning of our Republic.” 529 U. S., at 106, 99.\nThere is no similar interference with the federal program\nin this case; that program operates unimpeded by the\nstate law.\n   License suspension and revocation are significant sanc\ntions. But they are typical attributes of a licensing re\ngime. Numerous Arizona laws provide for the suspension\nor revocation of licenses for failing to comply with specified\nstate laws. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§5–108.05(D),\n32–852.01(L), 32–1154(B), 32–1451(M), 41–2186 (West\n2002). Federal law recognizes that the authority to license\nincludes the authority to suspend, revoke, annul, or with\ndraw a license. See 5 U. S. C. §551(9). Indeed, AWPA\nitself—on which the Chamber so heavily relies—provides\nthat AWPA “certificates of registration” can be suspended\nor revoked for employing an unauthorized alien. 29\nU. S. C. §1813(a)(6). It makes little sense to preserve state\nauthority to impose sanctions through licensing, but not\nallow States to revoke licenses when appropriate as one of\nthose sanctions.\n   The Chamber and JUSTICE BREYER assert that employ\ners will err on the side of discrimination rather than risk\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                   Opinion of ofOBERTS, C.

That is not the choice. License termina\ntion is not an available sanction simply for “hiring unau\nthorized workers.” Only far more egregious violations of\nthe law trigger that consequence. The Arizona law covers\nonly knowing or intentional violations. The law’s perma\nnent licensing sanctions do not come into play until a\nsecond knowing or intentional violation at the same busi\nness location, and only if the second violation occurs while\nthe employer is still on probation for the first. These\nlimits ensure that licensing sanctions are imposed only\nwhen an employer’s conduct fully justifies them. An\nemployer acting in good faith need have no fear of the\nsanctions.\n   As the Chamber points out, IRCA has its own anti\ndiscrimination provisions, see 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a)(1),\n(g)(1)(B) (imposing sanctions for discrimination “against\nany individual . . . with respect to the hiring . . . or the\ndischarging of the individual from employment”); Arizona\nlaw certainly does nothing to displace those. Other federal\nlaws, and Arizona anti-discrimination laws, provide fur\nther protection against employment discrimination—and\nstrong incentive for employers not to discriminate. See,\ne.g., 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a) (prohibiting discrimination\nbased on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”);\nAriz. Rev. Stat.

The\nmost rational path for employers is to obey the law—both\nthe law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens\n22    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                 AMERICA v.

J.\n                  Opinion R the Court\n\nand the law prohibiting discrimination—and there is no\nreason to suppose that Arizona employers will choose not\nto do so.\n   As with any piece of legislation, Congress did indeed\nseek to strike a balance among a variety of interests when\nit enacted IRCA. Part of that balance, however, involved\nallocating authority between the Federal Government and\nthe States. The principle that Congress adopted in doing\nso was not that the Federal Government can impose large\nsanctions, and the States only small ones. IRCA instead\npreserved state authority over a particular category of\nsanctions—those imposed “through licensing and similar\nlaws.”\n   Of course Arizona hopes that its law will result in more\neffective enforcement of the prohibition on employing\nunauthorized aliens. But in preserving to the States the\nauthority to impose sanctions through licensing laws,\nCongress did not intend to preserve only those state laws\nthat would have no effect. The balancing process that\nculminated in IRCA resulted in a ban on hiring unauthor\nized aliens, and the state law here simply seeks to enforce\nthat ban.\n   Implied preemption analysis does not justify a “free\nwheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in\ntension with federal objectives”; such an endeavor “would\nundercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the\ncourts that preempts state law.” Gade v.

In the Chamber’s view, “Congress\nwanted to develop a reliable and non-burdensome system\nof work-authorization verification” that could serve as an\nalternative to the I–9 procedures, and the “mandatory use\nof E-Verify impedes that purpose.” 558 F. 3d, at 866.\n                             A\n  We begin again with the relevant text. The provision of\nIIRIRA setting up the program that includes E-Verify\ncontains no language circumscribing state action. It does,\nhowever, constrain federal action: absent a prior violation\nof federal law, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may\nnot require any person or other entity [outside of the\nFederal Government] to participate in a pilot program”\nsuch as E-Verify. IIRIRA §402(a), 110 Stat. 3009–656.\nThat provision limits what the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity may do—nothing more.\n  The Federal Government recently argued just that, and\napprovingly referenced Arizona’s E-Verify law when doing\nso. In 2008, an Executive Order mandated that executive\nagencies require federal contractors to use E-Verify as a\ncondition of receiving a federal contract. See Exec. Order\nNo. 13465, 73 Fed. Reg. 33286 (2008). When that Order\nand its implementing regulation were challenged, the\nGovernment pointed to Arizona’s E-Verify mandate as an\nexample of a permissible use of that system: “[T]he State\nof Arizona has required all public and private employers\nin that State to use E-Verify . . . . This is permissible\nbecause the State of Arizona is not the Secretary of Home\nland Security.” Defendants’ Reply Memorandum in Sup\nport of Their Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 8:08–\ncv–03444 (D Md.), p. 7 (emphasis added), appeal dism’d,\n24     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF\n                  AMERICA v.

The Arizona law requires that “every\nemployer, after hiring an employee, shall verify the em\nployment eligibility of the employee” through E-Verify.\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214(A) (West Supp. 2010). That\nrequirement is entirely consistent with the federal law.\nAnd the consequences of not using E-Verify under the\nArizona law are the same as the consequences of not using\nthe system under federal law. In both instances, the only\nresult is that the employer forfeits the otherwise available\nrebuttable presumption that it complied with the law.\nCompare IIRIRA §402(b)(1) with Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§23–212(I).10\n                            B\n  Congress’s objective in authorizing the development of\nE-Verify was to ensure reliability in employment author\nization verification, combat counterfeiting of identity\ndocuments, and protect employee privacy. 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(d)(2). Arizona’s requirement that employers oper\nating within its borders use E-Verify in no way obstructs\nachieving those aims.\n  In fact, the Federal Government has consistently ex\npanded and encouraged the use of E-Verify. When E-\nVerify was created in 1996, it was meant to last just four\nyears and it was made available in only six States.\nIIRIRA §401(b) and (c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009–655 to 3009–\n656.

Whatever the legal significance of\nthat argument, the United States does not agree with the\nfactual premise. According to the Department of Home\nland Security, “the E-Verify system can accommodate the\nincreased use that the Arizona statute and existing simi\nlar laws would create.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 34.

See post, at 8, 19. Statistics from Fiscal Year 2010, however,\nindicate that of the 15,640,167 E-Verify cases submitted, 98.3% were\nautomatically confirmed as work authorized, 0.3% were confirmed as\nwork authorized after contesting and resolving an initial nonconfir\nmation—an avenue available to all workers—and 1.43% were not\nfound work authorized. E-Verify Statistics and Reports, available at\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem/statistics (as visited\nMay 23, 2011, and available in the Clerk of Court’s case file). As\nJUSTICE BREYER notes, the initial mismatches (the 0.3%) are frequently\ndue to “ ‘incorrectly spelled [names] in government databases or on\nidentification documents.’ ” Post, at 19. Such a hazard is of course not\nunique to E-Verify. Moreover, JUSTICE BREYER’s statistical analysis\nunderlying his conclusion that E-Verify queries, at least initially,\nwrongly “suggest[] that an individual [i]s not lawfully employable”\n“18% of the time” needs to be understood for what it is. Post, at 8. If\nE-Verify initially indicated that two individuals were not found work\nauthorized, and later revealed that one of those determinations was\nincorrect, JUSTICE BREYER would be able to exclaim that the error rate\nwas 50%.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

WHITING ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [May 26, 2011]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n   The federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of\n1986 (Act or IRCA) pre-empts “any State or local law\nimposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through\nlicensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or\nrecruit, or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized\naliens.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). The state law before us,\nthe Legal Arizona Workers Act, imposes civil sanctions\nupon those who employ unauthorized aliens. See Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §23–211 et seq. (West Supp. 2010). Thus\nthe state law falls within the federal Act’s general pre\nemption rule and is pre-empted—unless it also falls within\nthat rule’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.”\nUnlike the Court, I do not believe the state law falls\nwithin this exception, and I consequently would hold it\npre-empted.\n   Arizona calls its state statute a “licensing law,” and the\nstatute uses the word “licensing.” But the statute strays\nbeyond the bounds of the federal licensing exception, for\nit defines “license” to include articles of incorporation and\npartnership certificates, indeed virtually every state-law\nauthorization for any firm, corporation, or partnership to\ndo business in the State. §23–211(9)(a); cf. §23–211(9)(c)\n2     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n(excepting professional licenses, and water and environ\nmental permits). Congress did not intend its “licensing”\nlanguage to create so broad an exemption, for doing so\nwould permit States to eviscerate the federal Act’s pre\nemption provision, indeed to subvert the Act itself, by\nundermining Congress’ efforts (1) to protect lawful work\ners from national-origin-based discrimination and (2) to\nprotect lawful employers against erroneous prosecution or\npunishment.\n   Dictionary definitions of the word “licensing” are, as the\nmajority points out, broad enough to include virtually any\npermission that the State chooses to call a “license.” See\nante, at 10 (relying on a dictionary and the federal Admin\nistrative Procedure Act). But neither dictionary defini\ntions nor the use of the word “license” in an unrelated\nstatute can demonstrate what scope Congress intended\nthe word “licensing” to have as it used that word in this\nfederal statute. Instead, statutory context must ultimately\ndetermine the word’s coverage. Context tells a driver that\nhe cannot produce a partnership certificate when a po\nliceman stops the car and asks for a license. Context tells\nall of us that “licensing” as used in the Act does not in\nclude marriage licenses or the licensing of domestic ani\nmals. And context, which includes statutory purposes,\nlanguage, and history, tells us that the federal statute’s\n“licensing” language does not embrace Arizona’s overly\nbroad definition of that term. That is to say, ordinary\ncorporate charters, certificates of partnership, and the like\ndo not fall within the scope of the word “licensing” as used\nin this federal exception. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU. S. 481, 486 (2006) (statutory interpretation requires\ncourts to “rea[d] the whole statutory text, conside[r] the\npurpose and context of the statute, and consul[t] any\nprecedents or authorities that inform the analysis”);\nUnited States v.

Ordinarily, an express pre-emption provision\nin a federal statute indicates a particular congressional\ninterest in preventing States from enacting laws that\nmight interfere with Congress’ statutory objectives. See\nInternational Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494\n(1987). The majority’s reading of the provision’s “licens\ning” exception, however, does the opposite. It facilitates\nthe creation of “ ‘obstacle[s] to the accomplishment and\nexecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’ ”\nCrosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363,\n373 (2000) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67\n(1941)).\n                              A\n  Essentially, the federal Act requires employers to verify\nthe work eligibility of their employees. And in doing so,\nthe Act balances three competing goals. First, it seeks to\ndiscourage American employers from hiring aliens not\nauthorized to work in the United States. H. R. Rep. No.\n99–682, pt. 1, p. 56 (1986).\n  Second, Congress wished to avoid “placing an undue\nburden on employers,” id., at 90, and the Act seeks to\nprevent the “harassment” of “innocent employers,” S. Rep.\nNo. 99–132, p. 35 (1985).\n  Third, the Act seeks to prevent employers from disfavor\ning job applicants who appear foreign. Reiterating long\nstanding antidiscrimination concerns, the House Commit\ntee Report explained:\n    “Numerous witnesses . . . have expressed their deep\n    concern that the imposition of employer sanctions will\n    cause extensive employment discrimination against\n    Hispanic-Americans and other minority group mem\n4     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

These witnesses are genuinely concerned that\n    employers, faced with the possibility of civil and\n    criminal penalties, will be extremely reluctant to hire\n    persons because of their linguistic or physical charac\n    teristics.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 68.\nSee also 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) (making it an “unlaw\nful employment practice” for an employer to discriminate\nagainst an individual “because of such individual’s race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin”); U. S. Commission\non Civil Rights, The Tarnished Golden Door: Civil Rights\nIssues in Immigration 74 (1980) (finding that “increased\nemployment discrimination against United States citizens\nand legal residents who are racially and culturally iden\ntifiable with major immigrant groups could be the un\nintended result of an employer sanctions law”). The\nCommittee concluded that “every effort must be taken to\nminimize the potentiality of discrimination.” H. R. Rep.\nNo. 99–682, at 68.\n                             B\n  The Act reconciles these competing objectives in several\nways:\n  First, the Act prohibits employers from hiring an alien\nknowing that the alien is unauthorized to work in the\nUnited States. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(a)(1)(A).\n  Second, the Act provides an easy-to-use mechanism that\nwill allow employers to determine legality: the I–9 form.\nIn completing an I–9 form, the employer certifies that he\nor she has examined one or two documents (e.g., a pass\nport, or a driver’s license along with a Social Security\ncard) that tend to confirm the worker’s identity and em\nployability. §1324a(b)(1). Completion of the form in good\nfaith immunizes the employer from liability, even if the\nworker turns out to be unauthorized. §§1324a(a)(3),\n1324a(b)(6).\n  A later amendment to the law also allows an employer\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto verify an employee’s work eligibility through an\nInternet-based federal system called E-Verify. If the em\nployer does so, he or she will receive the benefit of a rebut\ntable presumption of compliance. Illegal Immigration Re\nform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA),\n§402(b), 110 Stat. 3009–656 to 3009–657, note following 8\nU. S. C. §1324a, p. 331 (Pilot Programs for Employment\nEligibility Confirmation).\n  Third, the Act creates a central enforcement mecha\nnism. The Act directs the Attorney General to establish a\nsingle set of procedures for receiving complaints, investi\ngating those complaints that “have a substantial proba\nbility of validity,” and prosecuting violations. 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(e)(1).     The relevant immigration officials and\nadministrative law judges have the power to access neces\nsary evidence and witnesses, §1324a(e)(2), and the em\nployer has the right to seek discovery from the Federal\nGovernment, 28 CFR §68.18 (2010). The employer also\nhas the right to administrative and judicial review of the\nadministrative law judge’s decision. §§68.54, 68.56.\n  Fourth, the Act makes it “an unfair immigration-related\nemployment practice . . . to discriminate against any\nindividual” in respect to employment “because of such\nindividual’s national origin.” 8 U. S. C. §1324b(a).\n  Fifth, the Act sets forth a carefully calibrated sanction\nsystem. The penalties for hiring unauthorized aliens are\ngraduated to prevent the Act from unduly burdening\nemployers who are not serious offenders. As adjusted for\ninflation, civil penalties for a first violation of the employ\nment restrictions range from $375–$3,200 per worker,\nand rise to $3,200–$16,000 per worker for repeat offend\ners. §1324a(e)(4)(A); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133 (2008); see also\n§1324a(f) (imposing criminal fines of not more than $3,000\nper worker and imprisonment for up to six months for\n“pattern or practice” violators of employment restrictions).\n  As importantly, the Act limits or removes any incentive\n6     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nto discriminate on the basis of national origin by setting\nantidiscrimination fines at equivalent levels: $375–$3,200\nper worker for first-time offenders, and $3,200–$16,000\nper worker for repeat offenders. §1324b(g)(2)(B)(iv); 73\nFed. Reg. 10134. The Act then ties its unlawful employ\nment and antidiscrimination provisions together by pro\nviding that, should the antihiring provisions terminate,\nthe antidiscrimination provisions will also terminate,\n§1324b(k), “the justification for them having been re\nmoved,” H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99–1000, p. 87 (1986).\n                              C\n   Now, compare and contrast Arizona’s statute. As I have\nsaid, that statute applies to virtually all business-related\nlicenses, other than professional licenses. Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §23–211(9). Like the federal Act, the state law for\nbids the employment of unauthorized aliens. §§23–212(A),\n23–212.01(A). It also provides employers with somewhat\nsimilar defenses. §§23–212(I)–(J), 23–212.01(I)–(J). But\nthereafter the state and federal laws part company.\n   First, the state statute seriously threatens the federal\nAct’s antidiscriminatory objectives by radically skewing\nthe relevant penalties. For example, in the absence of the\nArizona statute, an Arizona employer who intentionally\nhires an unauthorized alien for the second time would risk\na maximum penalty of $6,500. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(e)(4)\n(A)(ii); 73 Fed. Reg. 10133. But the Arizona statute sub\njects that same employer (in respect to the same two\nincidents) to mandatory, permanent loss of the right to do\nbusiness in Arizona–a penalty that Arizona’s Governor\nhas called the “business death penalty.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §23–212.01(F)(2); News Release, Governor Signs\nEmployer Sanctions Bill (2007), App. 399. At the same\ntime, the state law leaves the other side of the punishment\nbalance—the antidiscrimination side—unchanged.\n   This is no idle concern. Despite the federal Act’s efforts\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto prevent discriminatory practices, there is evidence that\nfour years after it had become law, discrimination was a\nserious problem. In 1990, the General Accounting Office\nidentified “widespread discrimination . . . as a result of”\nthe Act. Report to the Congress, Immigration Reform:\nEmployer Sanctions and the Question of Discrimination 3,\n37, 80. Sixteen percent of employers in Los Angeles ad\nmitted that they applied the I–9 requirement “only to\nforeign-looking or foreign-sounding persons,” and 22 per\ncent of Texas employers reported that they “began a prac\ntice to (1) hire only persons born in the United States or\n(2) not hire persons with temporary work eligibility docu\nments” because of the Act. Id., at 41–43. If even the\nfederal Act (with its carefully balanced penalties) can\nresult in some employers discriminating, how will employ\ners behave when erring on the side of discrimination leads\nonly to relatively small fines, while erring on the side of\nhiring unauthorized workers leads to the “business death\npenalty”?\n   Second, Arizona’s law subjects lawful employers to in\ncreased burdens and risks of erroneous prosecution. In\naddition to the Arizona law’s severely burdensome sanc\ntions, the law’s procedures create enforcement risks not\npresent in the federal system. The federal Act creates one\ncentralized enforcement scheme, run by officials versed in\nimmigration law and with access to the relevant federal\ndocuments. The upshot is an increased likelihood that\nfederal officials (or the employer) will discover whether\nadverse information flows from an error-prone source and\nthat they will proceed accordingly, thereby diminishing\nthe likelihood that burdensome proceedings and liability\nreflect documentary mistakes.\n   Contrast the enforcement system that Arizona’s statute\ncreates. Any citizen of the State can complain (anony\nmously or otherwise) to the state attorney general (or any\ncounty attorney), who then “shall investigate,” Ariz. Rev.\n8     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nStat. Ann. §23–212(B) (emphasis added), and, upon a\ndetermination that that the “complaint is not false and\nfrivolous . . . shall notify the appropriate county attorney\nto bring an action,” §23–212(C)(3). This mandatory lan\nguage, the lower standard (“not frivolous” instead of\n“substantial”), and the removal of immigration officials\nfrom the state screening process (substituting numerous,\nelected county attorneys) increase the likelihood that\nsuspicious circumstances will lead to prosecutions and\nliability of employers—even where more careful investiga\ntion would have revealed that there was no violation.\n   Again, this matter is far from trivial. Studies of one\nimportant source of Government information—the E-\nVerify system—describe how the federal administrative\nprocess corrected that system’s tentative “unemployable”\nindications 18% of the time. This substantial error rate is\nnot a function of a small sample size. See ante, at 26, n.\n12. Rather, data from one fiscal year showed 46,921\nworkers initially rejected but later “confirmed as work\nauthorized”—all while E-Verify was used by only a frac\ntion of the Nation’s employers. U. S.

(And those wrongly identified were likely\nto be persons of foreign, rather than domestic, origin, by a\nratio of approximately 20 to 1.)

The state statute says that\nin “determining whether an employee is an unauthorized\nalien, the court shall consider only the federal govern\nment’s determination pursuant to 8 [U. S. C.] §1373(c).”\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H). But the federal provi\nsion to which the state law refers, 8 U. S. C. §1373(c), says\nonly that the Federal Government, upon a State’s request,\nshall verify a person’s “citizenship or immigration status.”\nIt says nothing about work authorization. See post, at 7–\n10 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting). It says nothing about the\nsource of the Federal Government’s information. It im\nposes no duty upon the Federal Government or anyone\nelse to investigate the validity of that information, which\nmay falsely implicate an employer 18% of the time.\n   So what is the employer to do? What statute gives an\nemployer whom the State proceeds against in state court\nthe right to conduct discovery against the Federal Gov\nernment? The Arizona statute, like the federal statute,\nsays that the employer’s use of an I–9 form provides a\ndefense. But there is a hitch. The federal Act says that\nneither the I–9 form, nor “any information contained\nin or appended to” the form, “may . . . be used for pur\nposes other than for enforcement of this” federal Act.\n§1324a(b)(5). So how can the employer present a defense,\nsay, that the Government’s information base is flawed?\nThe majority takes the view that the forms are not neces­\nsary to receive the benefit of the affirmative defense. Ante,\nat 18, n. 9. But the I–9 form would surely be the em\nployer’s most effective evidence. See also post, at 11\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the unavail\nability of I–9 forms to defend against state-court charges\nmeans that Congress “intended no such” proceedings).\n   Nor does the Arizona statute facilitate the presentation\n10    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(H) (emphasis added). The\ntwo statements sound as if they mean that a Federal\nGovernment determination that the worker is unlawful\nis conclusive against the employer, but its determination\nthat the worker’s employment is lawful is subject to rebut\ntal by the State. Arizona tells us that the statute means\nthe opposite. See ante, at 16, n. 7. But the legal briefs of\nArizona’s attorney general do not bind the state courts.\nAnd until the matter is cleared up, employers, despite I–9\nchecks, despite efforts to use E-Verify, will hesitate to hire\nthose they fear will turn out to lack the right to work in\nthe United States.\n   And that is my basic point. Either directly or through\nthe uncertainty that it creates, the Arizona statute will\nimpose additional burdens upon lawful employers and\nconsequently lead those employers to erect ever stronger\nsafeguards against the hiring of unauthorized aliens—\nwithout counterbalancing protection against unlawful\ndiscrimination. And by defining “licensing” so broadly, by\nbringing nearly all businesses within its scope, Arizona’s\nstatute creates these effects statewide.\n   Why would Congress, after deliberately limiting ordi\nnary penalties to the range of a few thousand dollars per\nillegal worker, want to permit far more drastic state pen\nalties that would directly and mandatorily destroy entire\nbusinesses? Why would Congress, after carefully balanc\ning sanctions to avoid encouraging discrimination, want to\nallow States to destroy that balance? Why would Con\ngress, after creating detailed procedural protections for\nemployers, want to allow States to undermine them? Why\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

The answer to\nthese questions is that Congress would not have wanted to\ndo any of these things. And that fact indicates that the\nmajority’s reading of the licensing exception—a reading\nthat would allow what Congress sought to forbid—is\nwrong.\n                               II\n   The federal licensing exception cannot apply to a state\nstatute that, like Arizona’s statute, seeks to bring virtually\nall articles of incorporation and partnership certificates\nwithin its scope. I would find the scope of the exception\nto federal pre-emption to be far more limited. Context,\npurpose, and history make clear that the “licensing and\nsimilar laws” at issue involve employment-related licensing\nsystems.\n   The issuance of articles of incorporation and partnership\ncertificates and the like have long had little or nothing to\ndo with hiring or “employment.” Indeed, Arizona provides\nno evidence that any State, at the time the federal Act was\nenacted, had refused to grant or had revoked, say, part\nnership certificates, in light of the partners’ hiring prac\ntices of any kind, much less the hiring of unauthorized\naliens. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §29–308 (limited part\nnership formed upon the filing of a certificate of partner\nship providing names and addresses); §29–345 (providing\nfor dissolution of a limited partnership “[o]n application by\nor for a partner or assignee . . . whenever it is not rea\nsonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity\nwith the partnership agreement”).\n   To read the exception as covering laws governing corpo\nrate charters and partnership certificates (which are not\nusually called “licensing” laws) is to permit States to turn\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

The State need only\ncall the permission a “license” and revoke the license should\nits holder hire an unauthorized alien. If what was not\npreviously an employment-related licensing law can be\ncome one simply by using it as a sanction for hiring unau\nthorized aliens or simply by state definition, indeed, if the\nState can call a corporate charter an employment-related\nlicensing law, then why not an auto licensing law\n(amended to revoke the driver’s licenses of those who hire\nunauthorized aliens)? Why not a dog licensing law? Or\nwhy not “impute” a newly required license to conduct any\nbusiness to every human being in the State, withdrawing\nthat license should that individual hire an unauthorized\nalien? See S. C. Code Ann. §41–8–20 (Supp. 2010) (provid\ning that “[a]ll private employers in South Carolina . . .\nshall be imputed a South Carolina employment license,\nwhich permits a private employer to employ a person in\nthis State,” but conditioning the license on the company’s\nnot hiring unauthorized aliens).\n   Such laws might prove more effective in stopping the\nhiring of unauthorized aliens. But they are unlikely to do\nso consistent with Congress’ other critically important\ngoals, in particular, Congress’ efforts to protect from dis\ncrimination legal workers who look or sound foreign. That\nis why we should read the federal exemption’s “licensing”\nlaws as limited to those that involve the kind of licensing\nthat, in the absence of this general state statute, would\nnonetheless have some significant relation to employment\nor hiring practices. Otherwise we read the federal “licens\ning” exception as authorizing a State to undermine, if not\nto swallow up, the federal pre-emption rule.\n                            III\n  I would therefore read the words “licensing and similar\nlaws” as covering state licensing systems applicable pri\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

This reading is\nconsistent with the provision’s history and language, and\nit minimizes the risk of harm of the kind just described.\n   The Act’s history supports this interpretation. Ever\nsince 1964, the Federal Government has administered\nstatutes that create a federal licensing scheme for agricul\ntural labor contractors, firms that specialize in recruiting\nagricultural workers and referring them to farmers for a\nfee. Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963\n(FLCRA), 78 Stat. 920; Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural\nWorker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. The stat\nutes require agricultural labor contractors to register with\nthe federal Secretary of Labor, to obtain a registration\ncertificate (in effect a license), and to require the contrac\ntor’s employees to carry that certificate with them when\nengaging in agricultural labor contracting activities.\nAWPA §101; FLCRA §4. The statutes list a host of forbid\nden activities, one of which (prior to 1986) was hiring\nunauthorized aliens. See AWPA §§103, 106; FLCRA §5(b).\nPrior to 1986, if the federal Labor Department believed\na firm had violated these substantive provisions, it could\ninstitute administrative proceedings within the Labor\nDepartment. And if the Secretary found the labor con\ntracting firm had violated the provisions, the Secretary\ncould impose monetary penalties or withdraw the firm’s\nregistration. AWPA §§103, 503; FLCRA §§5(b), 9.\n   Most important, and unlike the 1986 Act before us, the\nearlier agricultural labor contracting statutes did not pre­\nempt similar state laws. To the contrary, the earlier Acts\nwere “intended to supplement State law” and did not\n“excuse any person from compliance with appropriate\nState law and regulation.” AWPA §521; see FLCRA §12.\nBy 1986, nearly a dozen States had developed state licens\n14    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ning systems for agricultural labor contractors, i.e., firms\nthat recruited and referred farm (and sometimes forestry)\nworkers for a fee; some of these laws provided that state\nlicenses could be revoked if the contractors hired unau\nthorized aliens. See, e.g., Cal. Lab. Code §1690(f) (Deering\nSupp. 1991); 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§1301.503(4), 1301.505(3)\n(1965–1983 Supp. Pamphlet); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§658.405(1),\n658.440(2)(d) (1987) (covering forestry workers).\n   In 1986, Congress (when enacting the Act now before\nus) focused directly upon the earlier federal agricultural\nlabor contractor licensing system. And it changed that\nearlier system by including a series of conforming\namendments in the Act. One amendment removes from\nthe earlier statutes the specific prohibition against hiring\nunauthorized aliens. It thereby makes agricultural labor\ncontractors subject to the Act’s similar general prohibition\nagainst such hiring. IRCA §101(b)(1)(C) (repealing AWPA\n§106). Another amendment takes from the Secretary of\nLabor most of the Secretary’s enforcement powers in\nrespect to the hiring of unauthorized aliens. It thereby\nleaves agricultural labor contractors subject to the same\nsingle unified enforcement system that the immigration\nAct applies to all employers. See 29 U. S. C. §1853. A\nthird amendment, however, leaves with the Secretary of\nLabor the power to withdraw the federal registration\ncertificate from an agricultural labor contractor that hired\nunauthorized aliens. IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 29 U. S. C.\n§1813(a)(6). Thus, the Act leaves this subset of employers\n(i.e., agricultural labor contractors but not other employ\ners) subject to a federal licensing scheme.\n   So far, the conforming amendments make sense. But\nhave they not omitted an important matter? Prior to\n1986, States as well as the Federal Government could\nlicense agricultural labor contractors. Should the 1986\nstatute not say whether Congress intended that dual\nsystem to continue? The answer is that the 1986 Act does\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnot omit this matter. It answers the coexistence question\ndirectly with the parenthetical phrase we are now consid\nering, namely, the phrase, “other than through licensing\nand similar laws,” placed in the middle of the Act’s pre\nemption provision. 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2). That phrase\nrefers to agricultural labor contractors, and it says that,\nin respect to those licensing schemes, dual state/federal\nlicensing can continue.\n   As of 1986, there were strong reasons for permitting\nthat dual system to continue in this specialized area. Dual\nenforcement had proved helpful in preventing particularly\nserious employment abuses. See, e.g., 128 Cong. Rec.\n24090 (1982) (reflecting concerns that agricultural work\ners were “housed in hovels; . . . subjected to physical abuse\nand kept in virtual slavery”). And because the contractors’\nbusiness consists of providing labor forces, their hiring of\nauthorized workers is closely related to their general\nfitness to do business. See S. Rep. No. 202, 88th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 1 (1963) (explaining that farm labor contractor\nregistration laws are needed to prevent “irresponsible\ncrew leaders” from “exploit[ing] . . . farmers”); Martin,\nGood Intentions Gone Awry: IRCA and U. S. Agriculture,\n534 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 44, 49 (1994) (de\nscribing how farmers who relied on contractors risked\nlosing their labor forces to immigration raids). Dual en\nforcement would not create a federal/state penalty dispar\nity, for federal systems as well as state systems provide for\nlicense revocation. Experience had shown that dual en\nforcement had not created any serious conflict or other\ndifficulty. And in light of the specialized nature and com\nparatively small set of businesses subject to dual enforce\nment, to permit licensing of that set of businesses would\nnot seriously undermine the objectives of the Act or its\npre-emption provision.\n   Thus, it is not surprising that the legislative history of\nthe 1986 Act’s pre-emption provision says that the licens\n16    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ning exception is about the licensing of agricultural labor\ncontractors. The House Report on the Act, referring to the\nlicensing exception, states that the Committee did “not\nintend to preempt licensing or ‘fitness to do business laws,’\nsuch as state farm labor contractor laws or forestry laws,\nwhich specifically require such licensee or contractor to\nrefrain from hiring, recruiting or referring undocumented\naliens.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis added).\n   The Act’s language, while not requiring this interpreta\ntion, is nonetheless consistent with limiting the scope of\nthe phrase in this way. Context can limit the application\nof the term “licensing” to particular types of licensing. The\nAct’s subject matter itself limits the term to employment\nrelated licensing. And the Act’s specific reference to those\nwho “recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthor\nized aliens,” is consistent with employment-related li\ncensing that focuses primarily upon labor contracting\nbusinesses.\n   Thus, reading the phrase as limited in scope to laws\nlicensing businesses that recruit or refer workers for\nemployment is consistent with the statute’s language,\nwith the relevant history, and with other statutory provi\nsions in the Act. That reading prevents state law from\nundermining the Act and from turning the pre-emption\nclause on its head. That is why I consider it the better\nreading of the statute.\n                             IV\n  Another section of the Arizona statute requires “every\nemployer, after hiring an employee,” to “verify the em\nployment eligibility of the employee” through the Federal\nGovernment’s E-Verify program. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§23–214. This state provision makes participation in the\nfederal E-Verify system mandatory for virtually all Ari\nzona employers. The federal law governing the E-Verify\nprogram, however, creates a program that is voluntary.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nBy making mandatory that which federal law seeks to\nmake voluntary, the state provision stands as a significant\n“ ‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objectives of Congress,’ ” Crosby, 530 U. S.,\nat 373 (quoting Hines, 312 U. S., at 67). And it is conse\nquently pre-empted.\n    The federal statute itself makes clear that participation\nin the E-Verify program is voluntary. The statute’s rele\nvant section bears the title “Voluntary Election to Partici\npate in a Pilot Program.” IIRIRA §402, note following 8\nU. S. C. §1324a, p. 331. A subsection bears the further\ntitle, “Voluntary Election.” §402(a). And within that\nsubsection, the statute says that employers “may elect to\nparticipate.” (Emphasis added.) The statute elsewhere\nrequires the Secretary of Homeland Security to “widely\npublicize . . . the voluntary nature” of the program.\n§402(d)(2); see also §402(d)(3)(A) (requiring the designa\ntion of local officials to advertise the “voluntary nature” of\nthe program). It adds that employers may “terminate”\ntheir “election” to participate by following certain proce\ndures. §402(c)(3). And it tells the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity (as an earlier version told the Attorney General)\nthat she “may not require any person or other entity to\nparticipate.” §402(a); see also §402(e) (creating exceptions,\nnone of which is applicable here, that require federal\nemployers and certain others to participate in E-Verify or\nanother pilot program).\n    Congress had strong reasons for insisting on the volun\ntary nature of the program. E-Verify was conceived as,\nand remains, a pilot program. Its database consists of\ntens of millions of Social Security and immigration records\nkept by the Federal Government. These records are prone\nto error. See, e.g., Office of the Inspector General, Social\nSecurity Administration, Congressional Response Report:\nAccuracy of the Social Security Administration’s Nu\nmident File 12 (2006) (hereinafter Social Security Report)\n18    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

Congress could decide\nthat, based on the results of the pilot, E-Verify should\nbecome a mandatory program. But it has not yet made\nthat determination. And in making that decision, it will\nhave to face a number of questions: Will workers receiving\ntentative negative verdicts understand the possibility of\nadministrative challenge? Will they make the effort to\ninvoke that process, say traveling from a farm to an urban\nSocial Security office? Will employers prove willing to\nundergo the financial burden of supporting a worker who\nmight lose the challenge? Will employers hesitate to train\nthose workers during the time they bring their challenges?\nWill employers simply hesitate to hire workers who might\nreceive an initial negative verdict—more likely those who\nlook or sound foreign? Or will they find ways to dismiss\nthose workers? These and other unanswered questions\nconvinced Congress to make E-Verify a pilot program, to\ncommission continuous study and evaluation, and to insist\nthat participation be voluntary.\n  In co-opting a federal program and changing the key\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Crosby, supra, at 373 (quoting\nHines, supra, at 67).\n    The majority reaches a contrary conclusion by pointing\nout (1) that Congress has renewed the E-Verify program\nseveral times, each time expanding its coverage, to the\npoint where it now encompasses all 50 States; (2) that the\nE-Verify database has become more accurate; (3) that\nthe Executive Branch has itself mandated participation\nfor federal contractors; and (4) that the statute’s language\ntells the Secretary of Homeland Security, not the States, to\nmaintain the program as voluntary.\n    The short, and, I believe, conclusive answers to these\nobjections are: (1) Congress has kept the language of the\nstatute—and the voluntary nature of the program—the\nsame throughout its program renewals. See 115 Stat.\n2407; 117 Stat. 1944; §547, 123 Stat. 2177. And it is up to\nCongress, not to Arizona or this Court, to decide when\nparticipation in the program should cease to be voluntary.\n    (2) The studies and reports have repeatedly found both\n(a) that the E-Verify program had achieved greater accu\nracy, but (b) that problems remain. See, e.g., Social Secu\nrity Report 11 (estimating that Social Security records\ncontain 4.8 million “discrepancies that could require the\nnumberholder to visit [the Social Security Administration]\n. . . before employment eligibility would be confirmed”);\nGAO Report 19 (estimating that, if E-Verify were made\nmandatory nationwide, 164,000 newly hired workers each\nyear would erroneously be adjudged ineligible to work\nbecause of name mismatches, as when the worker’s “first\nor last name is incorrectly spelled in government data\nbases or on identification documents”).

For the\nFederal Government to mandate that a special group\nparticipate in the E-Verify program tells us little or noth\ning about the effects of a State’s mandating that nearly\nevery employer within the State participate—as Arizona\nhas done. And insofar as we have not determined whether\nthe Executive was authorized by Congress to mandate E-\nVerify for federal contractors, it says nothing about Con\ngress’ intent.\n   (4) There is no reason to imply negatively from language\ntelling the Secretary not to make the program mandatory,\npermission for the States to do so. There is no presump\ntion that a State may modify the operation of a uniquely\nfederal program like E-Verify. Cf. Buckman Co. v. Plain­\ntiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U.

NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147 (2002). The Court reads\nIRCA’s saving clause—which preserves from pre-emption\nstate “licensing and similar laws,” 8 U. S. C.\n§1324a(h)(2)—to permit States to determine for them­\nselves whether someone has employed an unauthorized\nalien so long as they do so in conjunction with licensing\nsanctions. This reading of the saving clause cannot be\nreconciled with the rest of IRCA’s comprehensive scheme.\nHaving constructed a federal mechanism for determining\nwhether someone has knowingly employed an unauthor­\nized alien, and having withheld from the States the infor­\nmation necessary to make that determination, Congress\ncould not plausibly have intended for the saving clause to\noperate in the way the majority reads it to do. When\nviewed in context, the saving clause can only be under­\nstood to preserve States’ authority to impose licensing\nsanctions after a final federal determination that a person\nhas violated IRCA by knowingly employing an unauthor­\nized alien. Because the Legal Arizona Workers Act in­\n2       CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                   AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nstead creates a separate state mechanism for Arizona\nstate courts to determine whether a person has employed\nan unauthorized alien, I would hold that it falls outside\nthe saving clause and is pre-empted.\n  I would also hold that federal law pre-empts the provi­\nsion of the Arizona Act making mandatory the use of\nE-Verify, the federal electronic verification system. By\nrequiring Arizona employers to use E-Verify, Arizona has\neffectively made a decision for Congress regarding use of a\nfederal resource, in contravention of the significant policy\nobjectives motivating Congress’ decision to make partici­\npation in the E-Verify program voluntary.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   I begin with the plain text of IRCA’s pre-emption clause.\nIRCA expressly pre-empts States from “imposing civil or\ncriminal sanctions (other than through licensing and\nsimilar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer\nfor a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.”1 Ibid. The\nArizona Act, all agree, imposes civil sanctions upon those\nwho employ unauthorized aliens. The Act thus escapes\nexpress pre-emption only if it falls within IRCA’s paren­\nthetical saving clause for “licensing and similar laws.”\nIbid.\n   The saving clause is hardly a paragon of textual clarity.\nIRCA does not define “licensing,” nor does it use the word\n“licensing” in any other provision. Laws that impose\nsanctions by means of licensing exist in many forms.\nSome permit authorities to take action with respect to\nlicenses upon finding that a licensee has engaged in pro­\n——————\n  1 IRCA defines the term “unauthorized alien” to mean, “with respect\n\nto the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the alien is not\nat that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent\nresidence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the\nAttorney General.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(3).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhibited conduct. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §4–\n210(A)(1) (West 2011) (liquor licenses may be suspended\nor revoked if the licensing authority determines after\nnotice and a hearing that repeated acts of violence have\noccurred on the licensed premises). Others, more nar­\nrowly, permit authorities to take such action following a\npre-existing determination by another authorized body\nthat the licensee has violated another provision of law.\nSee, e.g., §4–202(D) (liquor licenses may not be renewed to\npersons who have been convicted of felonies within the\npast five years). That both types of laws might be defined\nin some contexts as licensing laws does not necessarily\nmean that Congress intended the saving clause to encom­\npass both types. See Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n481, 486 (2006) (“A word in a statute may or may not\nextend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities”);\nsee also FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U.

In isolation, the text of\nIRCA’s saving clause provides no hint as to which type or\ntypes of licensing laws Congress had in mind.\n                             B\n  Because the plain text of the saving clause does not\nresolve the question, it is necessary to look to the text\nof IRCA as a whole to illuminate Congress’ intent. See\nDolan, 546 U. S., at 486 (“Interpretation of a word or\nphrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,\nconsidering the purpose and context of the statute”); Ali v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.

It is a fundamental canon of statutory con­\nstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statu­\ntory scheme”).2\n   Before Congress enacted IRCA in 1986, a number of\nStates had enacted legislation prohibiting employment of\nunauthorized aliens. See ante, at 2, and n. 1 (citing 12\nsuch laws). California, for example, prohibited the know­\ning employment of an alien “who is not entitled to lawful\nresidence in the United States” when “such employment\nwould have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers,”\nand made violations punishable by fines of $200 to $500.\n1971 Cal. Stats. ch. 1442, §1; see also De Canas v. Bica,\n424 U. S. 351, 352, n. 1 (1976). Kansas went even further,\nmaking it a misdemeanor, punishable by a term of con­\nfinement not to exceed one month, to employ a person\nwithin Kansas knowing “such person to be illegally within\nthe territory of the United States.” Kan. Stat. Ann. §§21–\n4409, 21–4502 (1981).3\n   Congress enacted IRCA amidst this patchwork of state\nlaws. IRCA “ ‘forcefully’ made combating the employment\nof illegal aliens central to ‘the policy of immigration law.’ ”\nHoffman, 535 U. S., at 147 (quoting INS v. National Cen\nter for Immigrants’ Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194, and n.\n8 (1991); brackets omitted); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–\n682, pt. 1, p. 46 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.

To the contrary, the majority’s reading of the saving clause—with\nits singular focus on the undefined word “licensing” to the exclusion of\nall contextual considerations—is “untethered” from the statute as a\nwhole.\n   3 None of the pre-IRCA state laws cited by the majority provided for\n\nlicensing-related sanctions. The parties have not identified any pre-\nIRCA state laws related to licensing that purported to regulate the\nemployment of unauthorized aliens other than those governing agricul­\ntural labor contractors.

As the major­\nity explains, IRCA makes it “unlawful for a person or\nother entity to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for\nemployment in the United States an alien knowing the\nalien is an unauthorized alien.” §1324a(a)(1)(A); ante, at\n3. IRCA also requires employers to verify that they have\nreviewed documents establishing an employee’s eligibility\nfor employment. See §1324a(b); ante, at 3–4. These two\nprovisions are the foundation of IRCA’s “comprehensive\nscheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the\nUnited States.” Hoffman, 535 U. S., at 147.\n   Congress made explicit its intent that IRCA be enforced\nuniformly. IRCA declares that “[i]t is the sense of the\nCongress that . . . the immigration laws of the United\nStates should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.”\n§115, 100 Stat. 3384 (emphasis added). Congress struc­\ntured IRCA’s provisions in a number of ways to accom­\nplish this goal of uniform enforcement.\n   First, and most obviously, Congress expressly displaced\nthe myriad state laws that imposed civil and criminal\nsanctions on employers who hired unauthorized aliens.\nSee §1324a(h)(2); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58\n(“The penalties contained in this legislation are intended\nto specifically preempt any state or local laws providing\ncivil fines and/or criminal sanctions on the hiring, re­\ncruitment or referral of undocumented aliens”). Congress\ncould not have made its intent to pre-empt state and local\nlaws imposing civil or criminal sanctions any more “ ‘clear\n[or] manifest.’ ” Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485\n(1996) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.\n218, 230 (1947)).\n   Second, Congress centralized in the Federal Govern­\nment enforcement of IRCA’s prohibition on the knowing\nemployment of unauthorized aliens. IRCA instructs the\n6      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nAttorney General to designate a specialized federal agency\nunit whose “primary duty” will be to prosecute violations\nof IRCA. §1324a(e)(1)(D). IRCA also instructs the Attor­\nney General to establish procedures for receiving com­\nplaints, investigating complaints having “a substantial\nprobability of validity,” and investigating other violations.\n§1324a(e)(1); see also 8 CFR §274a.9 (2010). Upon con­\ncluding that a person has violated IRCA, the Attorney\nGeneral must provide the person with notice and an op­\nportunity for a hearing before a federal administrative law\njudge (ALJ). 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(e)(3)(A), (B). If the person\ndoes not request a hearing, the Attorney General may\nimpose a final, nonappealable order requiring payment of\nsanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(B). If the person requests a hear­\ning, the ALJ is required to hold a hearing and, upon find­\ning that the person has violated IRCA, must order the\npayment of sanctions. §1324a(e)(3)(C). The ALJ’s order is\nthe final agency order, unless the affected person requests\nand obtains further administrative appellate review.\n§1324a(e)(7); see also 28 CFR §68.54 (2010). IRCA grants\nimmigration officers and ALJs “reasonable access to\nexamine evidence of any person or entity being investi­\ngated” and provides them with extensive subpoena powers.\n§1324a(e)(2). And the immigration officers investigating\nsuspected violations obviously have access to the relevant\nfederal information concerning the work authorization\nstatus of the employee in question.4\n  Third, Congress provided persons “adversely affected”\nby an agency order with a right of review in the federal\ncourts of appeals. §1324a(e)(8); see also §1324a(e)(9)\n(directing the Attorney General in cases of noncompliance\nto file suit in federal district court to enforce a final order\n——————\n  4 By regulation, the Attorney General has conferred on parties\n\ncharged with violating IRCA the right to obtain discovery from the\nFederal Government in a hearing before an ALJ.

In this way, Congress ensured\nthat administrative orders finding violations of IRCA\nwould be reviewed by federal judges with experience\nadjudicating immigration-related matters.\n   Fourth, Congress created a uniquely federal system by\nwhich employers must verify the work authorization\nstatus of new hires. Under this system, an employer must\nattest under penalty of perjury on a form designated by\nthe Attorney General (the I–9 form) that it has examined\nenumerated identification documents to verify that a new\nhire is not an unauthorized alien. §1324a(b)(1)(A); see\nalso 8 CFR §274a.2; ante, at 3–4. Good-faith compliance\nwith this verification requirement entitles an employer to\nan affirmative defense if charged with violating IRCA.\n§1324a(a)(3); see also H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 57. Nota­\nbly, however, IRCA prohibits use of the I–9 form for any\npurpose other than enforcement of IRCA and various\nprovisions of federal criminal law. §1324a(b)(5); 8 CFR\n§274a.2(b)(4). Use of the I–9 form is thus limited to fed\neral proceedings, as the majority acknowledges. See ante,\nat 18, n. 9.\n   Finally, Congress created no mechanism for States to\naccess information regarding an alien’s work authoriza­\ntion status for purposes of enforcing state prohibitions on\nthe employment of unauthorized aliens. The relevant\nsections of IRCA make no provision for the sharing of\nwork authorization information between federal and state\nauthorities even though access to that information would\nbe critical to a State’s ability to determine whether an\nemployer has employed an unauthorized alien. In stark\ncontrast, a separate provision in the same title of IRCA\ncreates a verification system by which States can ascer­\ntain the immigration status of aliens applying for benefits\nunder programs such as Medicaid and the food stamp\n8      CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nprogram. See IRCA §121(a)(1)(C), 42 U. S. C. §1320b–\n7(d)(3). The existence of a verification system in one\nprovision of IRCA, coupled with its absence in the provi­\nsion governing employment of unauthorized aliens, sug­\ngests strongly that Congress did not contemplate any role\nfor the States in adjudicating questions regarding em­\nployment of unauthorized aliens. Cf. Bates v. United\nStates, 522 U. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (“Where Congress in­\ncludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion” (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted)).\n   In an attempt to show that Congress intended for the\nFederal Government to share immigration-related in­\nformation with the States, Arizona points to a federal\nstatute, 8 U. S. C. §1373(c), requiring the Government to\nrespond to certain inquiries from state agencies. Section\n1373(c), however, merely requires the Government to\nrespond to inquiries from state agencies “seeking to verify\nor ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any\nindividual within the jurisdiction of the agency.” It does\nnot require the provision of information regarding an\nalien’s work authorization status, which is not necessar-\nily synonymous with immigration status. See 8 CFR\n§274a.12(c) (identifying categories of legal aliens “who\nmust apply for employment authorization”).5 Arizona has\nnot identified any federal statute or regulation requiring\nthe Federal Government to provide information regarding\nan alien’s work authorization status to a State.6 More\n——————\n   5 For example, spouses and minor children of persons working in the\n\nUnited States as exchange visitors must apply for employment authori­\nzation even though they have lawful immigration status as dependents\nof the exchange visitor.

See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 238\n(1999).\n  Collectively, these provisions demonstrate Congress’\nintent to build a centralized, exclusively federal scheme\nfor determining whether a person has “employ[ed], or\nrecruit[ed] or refer[red] for a fee for employment, unau­\nthorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2).\n                              C\n   IRCA’s saving clause must be construed against this\nbackdrop. Focusing primarily on the text of the saving\nclause, Arizona and the majority read the clause to permit\nStates to determine themselves whether a person has\nemployed an unauthorized alien, so long as they do so in\nconnection with licensing sanctions. See ante, at 12–13.\nThis interpretation overlooks the broader statutory con­\ntext and renders the statutory scheme “[in]coherent and\n[in]consistent.” Ali, 552 U. S., at 222.\n   Under the majority’s reading of the saving clause, state\nprosecutors decide whether to commence licensing-related\nproceedings against a person suspected of employing an\nunauthorized alien. The majority’s holding also permits\nstate courts and other tribunals to adjudicate the question\nwhether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien.\nThe Arizona Act illustrates the problems with reading the\nsaving clause to permit such state action. The Act directs\nprosecutors to verify an employee’s work authorization\nwith the Federal Government pursuant to §1373(c), e.g.,\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–212(B) (West Supp. 2010), and\nthe state court “shall consider only the federal govern­\nment’s determination pursuant to [§]1373(c)” in “determin­\n——————\nthrough use of E-Verify.\n10     CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                  AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\ning whether an employee is an unauthorized alien,” e.g.,\n§23–212(H).7 Putting aside the question whether §1373(c)\nactually provides access to work authorization informa­\ntion, §1373(c) did not exist when IRCA was enacted in\n1986. See supra, at 9. Arizona has not identified any\navenue by which States could have accessed work authori­\nzation information in the first decade of IRCA’s existence.\nThe absence of any such avenue at the time of IRCA’s\nenactment speaks volumes as to how Congress would have\nunderstood the saving clause to operate: If States had no\naccess to information regarding the work authorization\nstatus of aliens, how could state courts have accurately\nadjudicated the question whether an employer had em­\nployed an unauthorized alien?\n   The Arizona Act’s reliance on §1373(c) highlights the\nanomalies inherent in state schemes that purport to adju­\ndicate whether an employee is an authorized alien. Even\nwhen Arizona prosecutors obtain information regarding\nan alien’s immigration status pursuant to §1373(c), the\nprosecutors and state court will have to determine the\nsignificance of that information to an alien’s work authori\nzation status, which will often require deciding techni-\ncal questions of immigration law. See, e.g., 8 CFR\n§§274a.12(a)–(c) (dividing 62 different classes of aliens\ninto those authorized for employment incident to immigra­\ntion status, those authorized for employment with a spe­\ncific employer incident to immigration status, and those\nwho must apply for work authorization). And, as dis­\ncussed above, that information may not shed light at all on\nan alien’s work authorization status, which is oftentimes\ndistinct from immigration status. See supra, at 8, and\nn. 5. As a result, in many cases state decisions—made by\n——————\n  7 However, the “federal government’s determination creates [only] a\n\nrebuttable presumption of the employee’s lawful status.” E.g., §23–\n212(H).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

I can discern no reason why Congress would\nhave intended for state courts inexperienced in immigra­\ntion matters to adjudicate, in the context of licensing\nsanctions, the very same question that IRCA commits to\nfederal officers, ALJs, and the courts of appeals.\n   Equally problematic is the fact that employers charged\nunder a state enforcement scheme with hiring unauthor­\nized aliens are foreclosed from using I–9 forms in their\ndefense in the state proceedings. Like IRCA, the Arizona\nAct confers an affirmative defense on employers who\ncomply in good faith with IRCA’s verification requirement.\nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§23–212(J), 23–212.01(J). As\ndiscussed above, however, IRCA prohibits an employer\nfrom using the I–9 form to establish that affirmative\ndefense under Arizona law. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(b)(5); 8\nCFR §274a.2(b)(4). Not to worry, the majority says: The\nemployer can establish the affirmative defense through\noffice policies and testimony of employees. Ante, at 18,\nn. 9. But Congress made the I–9 verification system and\naccompanying good-faith defense central to IRCA. See,\ne.g., H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 60 (“[A]n effective verifica­\ntion procedure, combined with an affirmative defense for\nthose who in good faith follow the procedure, is essential”).\nGiven the importance of this procedure, if Congress in fact\nintended for state courts to adjudicate whether a person\nhad employed an unauthorized alien in connection with\nlicensing sanctions, why would it have prohibited that\nperson from using the I–9 form—“the employer’s most\neffective evidence,” ante, at 9 (BREYER, J., dissenting)—in\nthe state-court proceeding? The question answers itself:\nCongress intended no such thing.\n   Furthermore, given Congress’ express goal of “uni­\n12    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.

Reading the sav­\ning clause as the majority does subjects employers to a\npatchwork of enforcement schemes similar to the one that\nCongress sought to displace when it enacted IRCA. Hav­\ning carefully constructed a uniform federal scheme for\ndetermining whether a person has employed an unauthor­\nized alien, Congress could not plausibly have meant to\ncreate such a gaping hole in that scheme through the\nundefined, parenthetical phrase “licensing and similar\nlaws.” See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\n531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one\nmight say, hide elephants in mouseholes”).\n   In sum, the statutory scheme as a whole defeats Ari­\nzona’s and the majority’s reading of the saving clause.\nCongress would not sensibly have permitted States to\ndetermine for themselves whether a person has employed\nan unauthorized alien, while at the same time creating a\nspecialized federal procedure for making such a determi­\nnation, withholding from the States the information nec­\nessary to make such a determination, and precluding use\nof the I–9 forms in nonfederal proceedings. See United\nStates v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 106 (2000) (“We decline to\ngive broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would\nupset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal\nlaw”).\n   To render IRCA’s saving clause consistent with the\nstatutory scheme, I read the saving clause to permit\nStates to impose licensing sanctions following a final\nfederal determination that a person has violated\n§1324a(a)(1)(A) by knowingly hiring, recruiting, or refer­\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 106. It also\nmakes sense as a practical matter. In enacting IRCA’s\npre-emption clause, Congress vested in the Federal Gov­\nernment the authority to impose civil and criminal sanc­\ntions on persons who employ unauthorized aliens. Licens­\ning and other types of business-related permissions are\ntypically a matter of state law, however. See, e.g., Kamen\nv. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991)\n(noting that “[c]orporation law” is an area traditionally\n“governed by state-law standards”); Chicago Title & Trust\n\n——————\n  8 This reading of the saving clause finds support in IRCA’s legislative\n\nhistory. The House Committee on the Judiciary reported that IRCA\nwas “not intended to preempt or prevent lawful state or local processes\nconcerning the suspension, revocation or refusal to reissue a license to\nany person who has been found to have violated the sanctions pro­\nvisions in this legislation.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–682, at 58 (emphasis\nadded). The Committee’s reference to “this legislation” is, of course, a\nreference to IRCA, and only federal officers, ALJs, and courts have\nauthority under IRCA to find that a person has violated the statute’s\nsanctions provisions.\n  My reading is also consistent with, though not compelled by, the\nprovisions in IRCA that amended the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul­\ntural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 96 Stat. 2583. As JUSTICE\nBREYER discusses in detail, see ante, at 13–15 (dissenting opinion),\nAWPA requires entities to secure a certificate of registration from the\nDepartment of Labor before engaging in any “farm labor contracting\nactivity.” AWPA §101, 96 Stat. 2587, 29 U. S. C. §1811(a). Before 1986,\nAWPA prohibited farm labor contractors from hiring unauthorized\naliens, and it permitted the Department of Labor to institute adminis­\ntrative proceedings to enforce this prohibition. See §§103(a)(3), 103(b),\n106(a), 96 Stat. 2588–2590. In IRCA, Congress repealed this pro­\nhibition, IRCA §101(b)(1)(C), but authorized the Secretary of Labor to\nwithdraw a contractor’s federal registration certificate upon a finding of\nan IRCA violation, IRCA §101(b)(1)(B)(iii), 100 Stat. 3372, 29 U. S. C.\n§1813(a)(6). Thus, IRCA made AWPA’s licensing sanctions turn on a\nprior federal adjudication of a violation of IRCA.\n14    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nCo. v. Forty-One Thirty-Six Wilcox Bldg. Corp., 302 U. S.\n120, 127 (1937) (“How long and upon what terms a state­\ncreated corporation may continue to exist is a matter\nexclusively of state power”). As a result, if Congress\nwanted to “ensur[e] that a full range of sanctions [was]\navailable to be used against businesses that employ unau­\nthorized aliens,” Brief for Respondent 37, Congress had to\nauthorize the States and localities to impose licensing\nsanctions following a federal adjudication of a violation of\nIRCA.\n    I do not mean to suggest that the mere existence of a\ncomprehensive federal scheme necessarily reveals a con­\ngressional intent to oust state remedies. Cf. English v.\nGeneral Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 87 (1990) (“[T]he mere\nexistence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme\n. . . does not by itself imply pre-emption of state reme­\ndies”); New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino,\n413 U. S. 405, 415 (1973) (rejecting the argument that\n“pre-emption is to be inferred merely from the comprehen­\nsive character of the federal [program]”). Here, Congress\nhas made clear its intent to oust state civil and criminal\nremedies; the sole question is the scope of the saving\nclause’s exception for “licensing and similar laws.” The\ncomprehensive scheme established by Congress necessar­\nily informs the scope of this clause. For all the reasons\nstated, the only interpretation of that clause that is consis­\ntent with the rest of the statute is that it preserves the\nStates’ authority to impose licensing sanctions after a final\nfederal determination that a person has violated IRCA’s\nprohibition on the knowing employment of unauthorized\naliens.\n    Under my construction of the saving clause, the Arizona\nAct cannot escape pre-emption. The Act authorizes Ari­\nzona county attorneys to commence actions charging an\nemployer with having employed an unauthorized alien.\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§23–212(D), 23–212.01(D).

Because the\nAct’s sanctions are not premised on a final federal deter­\nmination that an employer has violated IRCA, I would\nhold that the Act does not fall within IRCA’s saving clause\nand is therefore pre-empted.9\n                              II\n   I agree with the conclusion reached by JUSTICE BREYER\nin Part IV of his dissenting opinion that federal law impli­\nedly pre-empts the provision in the Arizona Act requiring\nall Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify program.\nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–214. I also agree with much\nof his reasoning. I write separately to offer a few addi­\ntional observations.\n   As we have recently recognized, that a state law makes\nmandatory something that federal law makes voluntary\ndoes not mean, in and of itself, that the state law “stands\nas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\nfull purposes and objectives of Congress,” Crosby v. Na\ntional Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 373 (2000)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See Williamson v.\nMazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 1–2) (concluding that a federal regulation\npermitting manufacturers to choose between two seatbelt\noptions did not pre-empt state tort liability based on a\ndecision to install one of those options); see also id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (“[T]he mere\nfact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a\nchoice between options is insufficient to justify implied\n——————\n  9 Because I believe that the Arizona Act does not fall within IRCA’s\n\nsaving clause for this reason, I have no reason to consider the sepa-\nrate question whether the Act’s definition of “license” sweeps too\nbroadly. Compare ante, at 9–11, with ante, at 1–2, 11–12 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting).\n16    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v. WHITING \n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\npre-emption”).\n   This case, however, is readily distinguishable from cases\nlike Williamson, in which state law regulates relationships\nbetween private parties. Here, the Arizona Act directly\nregulates the relationship between the Federal Govern­\nment and private parties by mandating use of a federally\ncreated and administered resource. This case thus impli­\ncates the “uniquely federal interes[t]” in managing use of a\nfederal resource. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487\nU. S. 500, 504 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S.\n341, 347 (2001) (“[T]he relationship between a federal\nagency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal\nin character because the relationship originates from, is\ngoverned by, and terminates according to federal law”).\n   Significant policy objectives motivated Congress’ deci­\nsion to make use of E-Verify voluntary. In addition to\nthose discussed by JUSTICE BREYER, see ante, at 17–19\n(dissenting opinion), I note that Congress considered the\ncost of a mandatory program. In 2003, when Congress\nelected to expand E-Verify to all 50 States but declined to\nrequire its use, it cited a congressionally mandated report\nconcluding that the annual cost of the pilot program was\n$6 million, the annual cost of a nationwide voluntary\nprogram would be $11 million, and the annual cost of a\nnationwide mandatory program would be $11.7 billion.\nH. R. Rep. No. 108–304, pt. 1, p. 6 (2003); see also Insti­\ntute for Survey Research, Temple Univ., and Westat, INS\nBasic Pilot Evaluation: Summary Report 38 (2002) (con­\ncluding that the Social Security Administration (SSA) and\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service were not\n“capable of enrolling and administering a program for the\nhundreds of thousands of employers in any of the large\nmandatory programs explored here”).

See Westat, Findings of the E-Verify® Program\nEvaluation 224 (2009) (observing that the SSA estimated\nthat it would have to hire an additional 1,500 field staff\nto handle a mandatory national program); id., at 251 (re­\ncommending that any expansion of E-Verify take place\ngradually “to allow the Federal government adequate time\nto hire and train the new staff required to run such a\nprogram”). Permitting States to make use of E-Verify\nmandatory improperly puts States in the position of mak­\ning decisions for the Federal Government that directly\naffect expenditure and depletion of federal resources.10\n   The majority highlights the Government’s statement in\nits amicus brief that “ ‘the E-Verify system can accommo­\ndate the increased use that the Arizona statute and exist­\ning similar laws would create.’ ” Ante, at 25 (quoting Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 34). But “[t]he pur­\npose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every\npre-emption case.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 494 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It matters not whether the\nExecutive Branch believes that the Government is now\ncapable of handling the burdens of a mandatory system.11\nCongressional intent controls, and Congress has repeat­\nedly decided to keep the E-Verify program voluntary.\nBecause state laws requiring use of E-Verify frustrate\nthe significant policy objectives underlying this decision,\n——————\n  10 In Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___\n\n(2011) (slip op., at 10), we held that the Federal Government’s judg­\nment regarding the cost effectiveness of seatbelt options did not reveal\nan intent “to forbid common-law tort suits in which a judge or jury\nmight reach a different conclusion.” The obvious distinction between\nthat case and this one is that Congress’ decision to keep use of E-Verify\nvoluntary bears directly on the costs to the Federal Government itself.\n  11 Notably, the Government’s brief does not state that the E-Verify\n\nsystem could accommodate the increased use that would result if all 50\nStates enacted similar laws; it limits its statement to “the Arizona\nstatute and existing similar laws.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 34 (emphasis added).\n18    CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES OF \n\n                 AMERICA v.
