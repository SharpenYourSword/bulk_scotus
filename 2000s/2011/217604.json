TINKLENBERG\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131498. Argued February 22, 2011\u2014Decided May 26, 2011\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) provides, inter alia, that in \u201cany case\n  in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial . . . shall commence\n  within seventy days\u201d after the arraignment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1),\n  but lists a number of exclusions from the 70-day period, including\n  \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the mo\n  tion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt dispo\n  sition of, such motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D).\n     Respondent Tinklenberg\u2019s trial on federal drug and gun charges\n  began 287 days after his arraignment. The District Court denied his\n  motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial violated\n  the Act\u2019s 70-day requirement, finding that 218 of the days fell within\n  various of the Act\u2019s exclusions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thus\n  making the trial timely. On Tinklenberg\u2019s appeal from his convic\n  tion, the Sixth Circuit agreed that many of the 287 days were exclud\n  able, but concluded that 9 days during which three pretrial motions\n  were pending were not, because the motions did not actually cause a\n  delay, or the expectation of delay, of trial. Since these 9 days were\n  sufficient to bring the number of nonexcludable days above 70, the\n  court found a violation of the Act. And given that Tinklenberg had\n  already served his prison sentence, it ordered the indictment dis\n  missed with prejudice.\nHeld:\n    1. The Act contains no requirement that the filing of a pretrial mo\n tion actually caused, or was expected to cause, delay of a trial.\n Rather, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) stops the Speedy Trial clock from running\n automatically upon the filing of a pretrial motion irrespective of\n whether the motion has any impact on when the trial begins. Pp. 3\u2013\n 12.\n2                  UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) The Sixth Circuit reasoned that subparagraph (D)\u2019s \u201cdelay re-\n    sulting from\u201d phrase, read most naturally, requires a court to apply\n    the exclusion provision only to motions that actually cause a trial de-\n    lay, or the expectation of such a delay. While such a reading is lin-\n    guistically reasonable, it is not the only reasonable interpretation.\n    The subparagraph falls within a general set of provisions introduced\n    by the phrase: \u201cThe following periods of delay shall be excluded.\u201d\n    \u00a73161(h). That phrase is followed by a list that includes \u201c[a]ny period\n    of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,\n    including. . . .\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1). This latter list is followed by a sublist,\n    each member (but one) of which is introduced by the phrase \u201cdelay\n    resulting from . . . .\u201d Ibid. Those words are followed by a more spe-\n    cific description, such as \u201cany pretrial motion\u201d from its \u201cfiling\u201d\n    \u201cthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition\n    of, such motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). The whole paragraph can be read\n    as requiring the automatic exclusion of the members of that specific\n    sublist, while referring to those members in general as \u201cperiods of de-\n    lay\u201d and as causing that delay, not because Congress intended the\n    judge to determine causation, but because, in a close to definitional\n    way, the words embody Congress\u2019 own view of the matter. Thus, lan-\n    guage alone cannot resolve the basic question presented. Pp. 4\u20137.\n          (b) Several considerations, taken together, compel the conclusion\n    that Congress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.\n    First, subparagraph (D) and neighboring subparagraphs (F) and (H)\n    contain language that instructs courts to measure the time actually\n    consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence, but those subpara-\n    graphs do not mention the date on which the trial begins or was ex-\n    pected to begin. Second, during the 37 years since Congress enacted\n    the statute, every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Sixth Cir-\n    cuit\u2019s interpretation. Third, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would\n    make the subparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to\n    administer, thereby hindering the Act\u2019s efforts to secure fair and effi-\n    cient trials. Fourth, the Court\u2019s conclusion is reinforced by the diffi-\n    culty of squaring the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation with the \u201cauto-\n    matic application\u201d rule expressed in, e.g., Henderson v. United States,\n    476 U. S. 321, 327. Fifth, the legislative history also supports the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one un-\n    der paragraph (1) begin with the phrase \u201cdelay resulting from,\u201d the\n    Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would potentially extend well beyond\n    pretrial motions and encompass such matters as mental and physical\n    competency examinations, interlocutory appeals, consideration of\n    plea agreements, and the absence of essential witnesses. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       2. The Sixth Circuit also misinterpreted \u00a73161(h)(1)(F), which ex-\n    cludes from the 70-day calculation \u201cdelay resulting from transporta-\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  tion of any defendant . . . to and from places of examination . . . , ex\n  cept that any time consumed in excess of ten days . . . shall be pre\n  sumed to be unreasonable.\u201d The lower courts agreed that a total of\n  20 transportation days had elapsed when Tinklenberg was evaluated\n  for competency, and that because the Government provided no justi\n  fication, all days in excess of the 10 days specified in the statute were\n  unreasonable. However, the Sixth Circuit exempted 8 weekend days\n  and holidays from the count on the theory that subparagraph (F) in\n  corporated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a), which, at the\n  time, excluded such days when computing any period specified in\n  \u201crules\u201d and \u201ccourt order[s]\u201d that was less than 11 days. Thus, the\n  Circuit considered only two transportation days excessive, and the\n  parties concede that the eight extra days were enough to make the\n  difference between compliance with, and violation of, the Act.\n     This Court exercises its discretion to consider the subsidiary sub\n  paragraph (F) question because doing so is fairer to Tinklenberg, who\n  has already served his sentence. In the Court\u2019s view, subparagraph\n  (F) does not incorporate Rule 45. The Act does not say that it does so,\n  the Government gives no good reason for such a reading, and the\n  Rule itself, as it existed at the relevant time, stated it applied to rules\n  and court orders, but said nothing about statutes. The fact that Rule\n  45 is revised from time to time also argues against its direct applica\n  tion to subparagraph (F) because such changes, likely reflecting con\n  siderations other than those related to the Act, may well leave courts\n  treating similar defendants differently. The better reading includes\n  weekend days and holidays in subparagraph (F)\u2019s 10-day period un\n  der the common-law rule that such days are included when counting\n  a statutory time period of 10 days unless a statute specifically ex\n  cludes them. Many courts have treated statutory time periods this\n  way, and Congress has tended specifically to exclude weekend days\n  and holidays from statutory time periods of 10 days when it intended\n  that result. Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently modified to require a\n  similar result. Pp. 12\u201314.\n     3. Although the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretations of subparagraphs\n  (D) and (F) are both mistaken, the conclusions the court drew from\n  its interpretations in relevant part cancel each other out, such that\n  the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Tinklenberg\u2019s trial failed to com\n  ply with the Act\u2019s deadline is correct.

JASON LOUIS \n\n               TINKLENBERG \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 26, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161 et seq.,\nprovides that in \u201cany case in which a plea of not guilty is\nentered, the trial . . . shall commence within seventy days\u201d\nfrom the later of (1) the \u201cfiling date\u201d of the information or\nindictment or (2) the defendant\u2019s initial appearance before\na judicial officer (i.e., the arraignment). \u00a73161(c)(1). The\nAct goes on to list a set of exclusions from the 70-day\nperiod, including \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial mo\ntion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion\nof the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such\nmotion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis\nadded).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nheld in this case that a pretrial motion falls within this\nexclusion only if it \u201cactually cause[s] a delay, or the expec\ntation of a delay, of trial.\u201d 579 F. 3d 589, 598 (2009). In\nour view, however, the statutory exclusion does not con\ntain this kind of causation requirement. Rather, the filing\nof a pretrial motion falls within this provision irrespective\nof whether it actually causes, or is expected to cause, delay\n2              UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nin starting a trial.\n                              I\n   Jason Louis Tinklenberg, the respondent, was convicted\nof violating federal drug and gun laws. 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g)(1) (felon in possession of a firearm); 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7843(a)(6) (possession of items used to manufacture a\ncontrolled substance). He made his initial appearance\nbefore a judicial officer on October 31, 2005, and the\nSpeedy Trial clock then began to run. His trial began on\nAugust 14, 2006, 287 days later. Just before trial,\nTinklenberg asked the District Court to dismiss the in\ndictment on the ground that the trial came too late, vio\nlating the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day requirement. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion after finding that 218\nof the 287 days fell within various Speedy Trial Act exclu\nsions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thereby making the\ntrial timely.\n   On appeal the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District\nCourt that many of the 287 days were excludable. But it\ndisagreed with the District Court about the excludability\nof time related to three pretrial motions. The Government\nfiled the first motion, an unopposed motion to conduct a\nvideo deposition of a witness, on August 1, 2006; the Dis\ntrict Court disposed of the motion on August 3, 2006. The\nGovernment filed the second motion, an unopposed motion\nto bring seized firearms into the courtroom as evidence at\ntrial, on August 8, 2006; the District Court disposed of the\nmotion on August 10, 2006. Tinklenberg filed the third\nmotion, a motion to dismiss the indictment under the\nSpeedy Trial Act, on August 11, 2006; the District Court\ndenied that motion on August 14, 2006. In the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s view, the nine days during which the three mo\ntions were pending were not excludable because the mo\ntions did not \u201cactually cause a delay, or the expectation of\ndelay, of trial.\u201d 579 F. 3d, at 598. Because these 9 days\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere sufficient to bring the number of nonexcludable days\nabove 70, the Court of Appeals found a violation of the Act.\nAnd given the fact that Tinklenberg had already served\nhis prison sentence, it ordered the District Court to dis\nmiss the indictment with prejudice.\n   We granted certiorari at the Government\u2019s request in\norder to review the Sixth Circuit\u2019s motion-by-motion cau\nsation test. We now reverse its determination. But be\ncause we agree with the defendant about a subsidiary\nmatter, namely, the exclusion of certain holidays and\nweekend days during the period in which he was trans\nported for a competency examination, id., at 597, we af\nfirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 ultimate conclusion.\n                           II\n                           A\n  In relevant part the Speedy Trial Act sets forth a basic\nrule:\n    \u201cIn any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered,\n    the trial of a defendant . . . shall commence within\n    seventy days from [the later of (1)] the filing date . . .\n    of the information or indictment, or . . . [(2)] the date\n    the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of\n    the court in which such charge is pending . . . .\u201d\n    \u00a73161(c)(1) (2006 ed.).\nThe Act then says that the \u201cfollowing periods of delay shall\nbe excluded in computing . . . the time within which the\ntrial . . . must commence.\u201d \u00a73161(h) (2006 ed., Supp. III).\nIt lists seven such \u201cperiods of delay.\u201d\n   It describes the first of these seven excludable periods as\n    \u201c(1) Any period of delay resulting from other proceed\n    ings concerning the defendant including but not lim\n    ited to\u2014\n       \u201c(A) delay resulting from any proceeding . . . to de\n    termine the mental competency or physical capacity of\n4            UNITED STATES v.

(2006 ed. and Supp. III)\n    (emphasis added).\n                             B\n   The particular provision before us, subparagraph (D),\nexcludes from the Speedy Trial period \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion\nthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\ndisposition of, such motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). The question\nis whether this provision stops the Speedy Trial clock from\nrunning automatically upon the filing of a pretrial motion\nirrespective of whether the motion has any impact on\nwhen the trial begins. Unlike the Sixth Circuit, we believe\nthe answer to this question is yes.\n   We begin with the Act\u2019s language. The Sixth Circuit\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbased its answer primarily upon that language. It argued\nthat the phrase \u201cdelay resulting from,\u201d read most natu\nrally, requires a court to apply the exclusion provision only\nto those \u201cmotion[s]\u201d that \u201cactually cause a delay, or the\nexpectation of a delay, of trial.\u201d 579 F. 3d, at 598. We\nagree that such a reading is linguistically reasonable, but\nthe Court of Appeals wrote that there \u201cis no conceivable\nway to read this language other than to require a delay to\nresult from any pretrial motion before excludable time\noccurs.\u201d Ibid. See also ibid. (\u201c[T]he statute is clear\u201d). And\nhere we disagree.\n   When the Court of Appeals says that its reading is the\nonly way any reasonable person could read this language,\nit overstates its claim. For one thing, even though the\nword \u201cdelay\u201d ordinarily indicates a postponement, it need\nnot inevitably do so. Compare The American Heritage\nDictionary 480 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201c[t]o postpone until a later\ntime\u201d or \u201c[t]o cause to be later or slower than expected or\ndesired\u201d) with ibid. (\u201c[t]he interval of time between two\nevents\u201d). In any event, terms must be read in their statu\ntory context in order to determine how the provision in\nquestion should be applied in an individual case.\n   Statutory language that describes a particular circum\nstance, for example, might require a judge to examine\neach individual case to see if that circumstance is present.\nBut, alternatively, it might ask a judge instead to look at\nmore general matters, such as when a statute requires a\njudge to increase the sentence of one convicted of a \u201ccrime\nof violence\u201d without requiring the judge to determine\nwhether the particular crime at issue in a particular case\nwas committed in a violent manner. See Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d char\nacterizes the generic crime, not the particular act commit\nted). Similarly a statute that forbids the importation of\n\u201cwild birds\u201d need not require a court to decide whether a\nparticular parrot is, in fact, wild or domesticated. It may\n6             UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintend to place the entire species within that definition\nwithout investigation of the characteristics of an individ\nual specimen. See United States v. Fifty-Three (53) Eclec\ntus Parrots, 685 F. 2d 1131, 1137 (CA9 1982).\n   More than that, statutory language can sometimes\nspecify that a set of circumstances exhibits a certain char\nacteristic virtually as a matter of definition and irrespec\ntive of how a court may view it in a particular case. A\nstatute that describes \u201cextortion\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nmakes that fact so by definition, without asking a court\nto second-guess Congress about the matter. 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2006 ed.) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d to\ninclude extortion for purposes of the Armed Career Crimi\nnal Act).\n   The statute before us, though more complex, can be read\nsimilarly. The pretrial motion subparagraph falls within a\ngeneral set of provisions introduced by the phrase: \u201cThe\nfollowing periods of delay shall be excluded.\u201d \u00a73161(h)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). That phrase is then followed by a list\nthat includes \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other\nproceedings concerning the defendant, including . . . .\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(1). This latter list is followed by a sublist, each\nmember (but one) of which is introduced by the phrase\n\u201cdelay resulting from . . . ,\u201d ibid. (2006 ed. and Supp. III),\nwhich words are followed by a more specific description,\nsuch as \u201cany pretrial motion\u201d from its \u201cfiling\u201d \u201cthrough the\nconclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition\nof, such motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The\nwhole paragraph can be read as requiring the automatic\nexclusion of the members of that specific sublist, while\nreferring to those members in general as \u201cperiods of delay\u201d\nand as causing that delay, not because Congress intended\nthe judge to determine causation, but because, in a close to\ndefinitional way, the words embody Congress\u2019 own view of\nthe matter.\n   It is not farfetched to describe the members of the spe\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncific sublist in the statute before us in this definitional\nsense\u2014as \u201cperiods of delay\u201d or as bringing about delay.\nAfter all, the exclusion of any of the specific periods de\nscribed always delays the expiration of the 70-day Speedy\nTrial deadline. Or Congress might have described the\nspecific periods listed in paragraph (1) as \u201cperiods of de\nlay\u201d and \u201cdelay[s] resulting from\u201d simply because periods\nof the type described often do cause a delay in the start of\ntrial. Both explanations show that, linguistically speak\ning, one can read the statutory exclusion as automatically\napplying to the specific periods described without leaving\nto the district court the task of determining whether the\nperiod described would or did actually cause a postpone\nment of the trial in the particular case. Thus, language\nalone cannot resolve the basic question presented in this\ncase. But when read in context and in light of the stat\nute\u2019s structure and purpose, we think it clear that Con\ngress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.\n                               C\n   We now turn to several considerations, which, taken\ntogether, convince us that the subparagraphs that specifi\ncally list common pretrial occurrences apply automatically\nin the way we have just described. First, subparagraph\n(D) clarifies that the trial court should measure the period\nof excludable delay for a pretrial motion \u201cfrom the filing of\nthe motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of such motion,\u201d but nowhere\ndoes it mention the date on which the trial begins or was\nexpected to begin. \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III).\nThus, it is best read to instruct measurement of the time\nactually consumed by consideration of the pretrial mo\ntion. Two other related subparagraphs contain clarifying\nlanguage that contemplates measurement of the time\nactually consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence\nwithout regard to the commencement of the trial. See\n8             UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (\u201cAny time consumed in excess of ten days\nfrom the date an order of removal or an order directing\nsuch transportation, and the defendant\u2019s arrival at the\ndestination shall be presumed to be unreasonable\u201d);\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(H) (\u201cdelay reasonably attributable to any\nperiod, not to exceed thirty days, during which any pro\nceeding concerning the defendant is actually under ad\nvisement by the court\u201d). If \u201cdelay\u201d truly referred to the\npostponement of trial, then presumably those subpara\ngraphs would instruct that excludable periods should be\nmeasured from the date that trial was otherwise sched\nuled to begin.\n  Second, we are impressed that during the 37 years since\nCongress enacted the Speedy Trial Act, every Court of\nAppeals has considered the question before us now, and\nevery Court of Appeals, implicitly or explicitly, has re\njected the interpretation that the Sixth Circuit adopted in\nthis case.

S. ____ (2011)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreat practical administrative importance in the daily\nworking lives of busy trial judges is itself entitled to strong\nconsideration, particularly when those courts have main\ntained that interpretation consistently over a long a period\nof time. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 593\u2013594 (2004).\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would make the\nsubparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to\nadminister. And in doing so, it would significantly hinder\nthe Speedy Trial Act\u2019s efforts to secure fair and efficient\ncriminal trial proceedings. See Zedner v. United States,\n547 U. S. 489, 497 (2006) (noting that the Act\u2019s exceptions\nprovide \u201cnecessary flexibility\u201d); H. R. Rep. No. 93\u20131508, p.\n15 (1974) (the Act seeks to achieve \u201cefficiency in the proc\nessing of cases which is commensurate with due process\u201d);\nS. Rep. No. 93\u20131021, p. 21 (1974). Trial judges may, for\nexample, set trial dates beyond 70 days in light of other\ncommitments. And in doing so, a trial judge may well be\naware, based on his or her experience, that pretrial mo\ntions will likely consume the extra time\u2014even though the\njudge may know little about which specific motions will be\nfiled, when, and how many. How is that judge to apply the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s approach, particularly when several, in\ncluding unanticipated, pretrial proceedings did consume\nthe time in question?\n   Moreover, what is to happen if several excludable and\nseveral nonexcludable potential causes of delay (e.g., pre\ntrial motions to take depositions, potential scheduling\nconflicts, various health examinations, etc.) coincide,\nparticularly in multidefendant cases? Can the judge,\nmotion by motion, decide which motions were responsible\nand which were not responsible for postponing what oth\nerwise might have been an earlier trial date? And how is\na defendant or his attorney to predict whether or when a\njudge will later find a particular motion to have caused a\npostponement of trial? And if the matter is difficult to\n10            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredict, how is the attorney to know when or whether he\nor she should seek further postponement of the 70-day\ndeadline?\n   With considerable time and judicial effort, perhaps\nthrough the use of various presumptions, courts could find\nmethods for overcoming these and other administrative\ndifficulties. In some instances, the judge may know at the\ntime of filing that a given motion is easily resolved or that\nits complexity will almost certainly postpone the trial.\nJudges could note on the record their predictions about\nwhether the motion will postpone trial at the time that the\nmotion is filed. Parties could also stipulate as to whether\na given motion would be excluded from the Speedy Trial\nclock. But those theoretical strategies would not prevent\nall or even most mistakes, needless dismissals of indict\nments, and potential retrials after appeal\u2014all of which\nexact a toll in terms of the fairness of and confidence in\nthe criminal justice system. And any such future strate\ngies for administering the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule cannot\nprovide a present justification for turning the federal\njudicial system away from the far less obstacle-strewn\npath that the system has long traveled.\n   Fourth, we are reinforced in our conclusion by the diffi\nculty of squaring the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation with\nthis Court\u2019s precedent. In Henderson v. United States, 476\nU. S. 321 (1986), the Court rejected the contention that\nthe exclusion provision for pretrial motions governs only\nreasonable delays. The Court there concluded (as the\nCourt of Appeals had held) that the exclusion \u201cwas in\ntended to be automatic.\u201d Id., at 327 (quoting United States\nv. Henderson, 746 F. 2d 619, 622 (CA9 1984); internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Bloate v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___ (2010) (holding based in part on\nthe view that the exclusion applies \u201cautomatically\u201d to the\nspecified period of delay). Henderson did not consider\nwhether a trial court must determine whether the pretrial\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmotion actually caused postponement of the trial in each\nindividual case. But the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation\nwould nonetheless significantly limit the premise of \u201cauto\nmatic application\u201d upon which the case rests.\n   Fifth, for those who find legislative history useful, it is\nworthwhile noting, (as this Court noted in Henderson)\nthat the Senate Report concerning the reenactment of the\nprovision in 1979 described it, along with the other provi\nsions in \u00a73161(h)(1), as referring to \u201cspecific and recurring\nperiods of time often found in criminal cases,\u201d and charac\nterized them as \u201cautomatically excludable delay,\u201d S. Rep.\nNo. 96\u2013212, p. 9 (1979). See H. R. Rep. No. 93\u20131508, at 21\n(\u201cThe time limits would be tolled by hearings, proceedings\nand necessary delay which normally occur prior to the\ntrial of criminal cases\u201d (emphasis added)); S. Rep. No. 93\u2013\n1021, at 21 (\u201c[The Act] has carefully constructed exclu\nsions and exceptions which permit normal pre-trial prepa\nration in the ordinary noncomplex cases which represent\nthe bulk of business in the Federal courts\u201d). But cf. id., at\n35 (paragraph (h)(1) excludes \u201c[d]elays caused by proceed\nings relating to the defendant\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one under\nparagraph (1) begin with the phrase \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom,\u201d the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would potentially\nextend well beyond pretrial motions and encompass such\nmatters as mental and physical competency examinations,\ninterlocutory appeals, consideration of plea agreements,\nand the absence of essential witnesses. See \u00a73161(h)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III); \u00a73161(h)(3)(A) (2006 ed.). Given the\nadministrative complexity the causation requirement\nwould bring about in all these areas, those Circuits that\nhave considered a causation requirement in respect to\nthese other matters have rejected it. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Pete, 525 F. 3d 844, 852 (CA9 2008) (interlocutory\nappeal); United States v. Miles, 290 F. 3d 1341, 1350\n(CA11 2002) (unavailability of essential witnesses); United\n12            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Robinson, 887 F. 2d 651, 656\u2013657 (CA6 1989)\n(trial on other charges). That further complexity, along\nwith these lower court holdings, reinforce our conclusion.\n   We consequently disagree with the Sixth Circuit that\nthe Act\u2019s exclusion requires a court to find that the event\nthe exclusion specifically describes, here the filing of the\npretrial motion, actually caused or was expected to cause\ndelay of a trial. We hold that the Act contains no such\nrequirement.\n                            III\n  Tinklenberg also argues that the Sixth Circuit wrongly\ninterpreted a different exclusion provision, this time the\nprovision excluding\n     \u201cdelay resulting from transportation of any defendant\n     from another district, or to and from places of exami\n     nation or hospitalization, except that any time con\n     sumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of\n     removal or an order directing such transportation,\n     and the defendant\u2019s arrival at the destination shall be\n     presumed to be unreasonable.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (2006\n     ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).\nThe District Court granted Tinklenberg\u2019s request for a\ncompetency evaluation and he was transported to a medi\ncal facility for examination. The lower courts agreed that\na total of 20 transportation days elapsed and that since\nthe Government provided no justification, all days in\nexcess of the 10 days specified in the statute were unrea\nsonable. But in counting those excess days, the court\nexempted weekend days and holidays. Since Veterans\nDay, Thanksgiving Day, and three weekends all fell\nwithin the 20-day period, only 2 days, not 10 days, were\nconsidered excessive, during which the 70-day Speedy\nTrial Act clock continued to tick.\n  Tinklenberg argues that subparagraph (F) does not\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexempt weekend days and holidays; hence the court\nshould have considered 10, not 2, days to be excessive.\nAnd the parties concede that those 8 extra ticking days are\nenough to make the difference between compliance with,\nand violation of, the Act.\n  As the Solicitor General notes, we may consider, or\n\u201cdecline to entertain,\u201d alternative grounds for affirmance.\nSee United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 242, n. 16\n(1975). In this case, we believe it treats Tinklenberg, who\nhas already served his sentence, more fairly to consider\nthe alternative ground and thereby more fully to dispose of\nthe case.\n  The Sixth Circuit exempted weekend days and holidays\nbecause it believed that subparagraph (F) incorporated\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a). At the relevant\ntime, that Rule excluded weekend days and holidays when\ncomputing any period of time specified in the \u201crules,\u201d in\n\u201cany local rule,\u201d or in \u201cany court order\u201d that was less than\n11 days. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(a) (2005). But in our\nview subparagraph (F) does not incorporate Rule 45. The\nAct does not say that it incorporates Rule 45. The Gov\nernment has given us no good reason for reading it as\nincorporating the Rule. And the Rule itself, as it existed\nat the relevant time, said that it applied to \u201crules\u201d and to\n\u201corders,\u201d but it said nothing about statutes. Other things\nbeing equal, the fact that Rule 45 is revised from time to\ntime also argues against its direct application to subpara\ngraph (F). That is because those changes, likely reflecting\nconsiderations other than those related to the Speedy\nTrial Act, may well leave courts treating similar defen\ndants differently.\n  Without relying upon a cross-reference to Rule 45, we\nbelieve the better reading of subparagraph (F) would\ninclude weekend days and holidays in its 10-day time\nperiod. Under the common-law rule, weekend days and\nholidays are included when counting a statutory time\n14            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nperiod of 10 days unless the statute specifically excludes\nthem. See 74 Am. Jur. 2d, Time \u00a722, p. 589 (2001)\n(in calculating time periods expressed in statutes, \u201cwhen\nthe time stipulated must necessarily include one or more\nSaturdays, Sundays, or holidays, those days will not be\nexcluded, in the absence of an express proviso for their\nexclusion\u201d). Many courts have treated statutory time\nperiods this way. See, e.g., Howeisen v. Chapman, 195\nInd. 381, 383\u2013384, 145 N. E. 487, 488 (1924); American\nTobacco Co. v. Strickling, 88 Md. 500, 508\u2013511, 41 A.\n1083, 1086 (1898). And Congress has tended specifically\nto exclude weekend days and holidays from statutory time\nperiods of 10 days when it intended that result. Compare\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73142(d)(2) (permitting the temporary deten\ntion of certain defendants \u201cfor a period of not more than\nten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays\u201d)\nand 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(d)(2)(A) (requiring an agency to\nacknowledge receipt of a request to amend agency records\nwithin \u201c10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal\npublic holidays)\u201d) with 18 U. S. C. \u00a72518(9) (establishing a\n10-day period for disclosing applications for and court\norders authorizing wiretaps without specifically excluding\nweekends and holidays) and \u00a74244(a) (providing a 10-day\nperiod after conviction for filing a motion to request men\ntal health treatment without specifically excluding week\nends and holidays). Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently\nmodified so that now (though not at the time of Tinklen\nberg\u2019s proceedings) it requires a similar result. Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 45(a)(1) (2010) (instructing that weekend days\nand holidays are to be counted when calculating all time\nperiods, including statutory time periods for which no\nalternative method of computing time is specified).\n                     *    *    *\n  We disagree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\nboth subparagraph (D) and subparagraph (F), and now\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Nonetheless the conclusions the court drew\nfrom those two interpretations in relevant part cancel\neach other out such that the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion\nthat Tinklenberg\u2019s trial failed to comply with the Speedy\nTrial Act\u2019s deadline is correct. Therefore, the Sixth Cir\ncuit\u2019s judgment ordering dismissal of the indictment on\nremand is\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

I agree with\nthe judgment of the Court in Part II that a pretrial motion\nneed not actually postpone a trial, or create an expecta\ntion of postponement, in order for its pendency to be ex\ncluded under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III). But I think that\nconclusion is entirely clear from the text of the Speedy\nTrial Act, and see no need to look beyond the text. The\nclarity of the text is doubtless why, as the Court\u2019s opinion\npoints out, ante, at 8, every Circuit disagrees with the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion. That is the direction in which\nthe causality proceeds: Clarity of text produces unanimity\nof Circuits\u2014not, as the Court\u2019s opinion would have it,\nunanimity of Circuits clarifies text.\n   As the Court discusses, ante, at 5, the word \u201cdelay\u201d can\nmean postponement, but it can also mean an \u201cinterval of\ntime between two events.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary\n480 (4th ed. 2000). One might refer to the \u201cdelay\u201d between\ntwo ticks of a clock, or between seeing lightning and hear\ning thunder, but that does not imply that the first post\nponed or slowed the second. Here there are substantial\ntextual indications that the word \u201cdelay\u201d similarly refers\n2               UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto the period between ticks of the speedy trial clock\u2014in\nother words, the period during which the Speedy Trial\nAct\u2019s 70-day requirement is tolled.\n   Interpreting the \u201cdelay\u201d referred to in \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (or\nreferred to anywhere else in \u00a73161(h)) as the delay of a\ntrial date* would make little sense in light of the context\nof the provision and the structure of the statute. Section\n3161(h)(1)(D) specifies starting and stopping points for the\nexcludable \u201cdelay\u201d that bear no relation whatsoever to the\nactual amount of time that a trial might be postponed by a\npretrial motion. It equates the \u201cdelay resulting from any\npretrial motion\u201d to the period of time between \u201cthe filing\nof the motion\u201d and \u201cthe conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d This equation is\npossible if \u201cdelay\u201d refers to an interval of time excludable\nfor purposes of the Speedy Trial Act, but it makes no sense\nif \u201cdelay\u201d refers to the time a trial is postponed. Consider,\nfor example, a pretrial motion that is pending for 10 days\nbut causes the district court to push back a trial\u2019s begin\nning by only one day. In such a situation, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D)\nwould require that the entire 10-day period be excluded\nfor Speedy Trial Act purposes.\n   Neighboring statutory provisions, moreover, link the\nexcludable \u201cdelay\u201d to the time consumed by the specified\nevent, not the number of days a trial is postponed. Section\n3161(h)(1)(H), for example, excludes \u201cdelay reasonably\nattributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days,\nduring which any proceeding concerning the defendant\nis actually under advisement by the court.\u201d And\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(F) excludes \u201cdelay resulting from transporta\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * I consider only this possibility, and not the extended meaning in\nvented by the Sixth Circuit (\u201cexpectation of a dela[y] of trial\u201d)\u2014\npresumably to explain how delay can be computed ex ante, before any\ntrial delay has actually occurred. See 579 F. 3d 589, 598 (2009).\n\u201c[E]xpectation of a delay\u201d is simply not one of the possible meanings of\n\u201cdelay.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

But the seventh, which\nexcludes \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance granted by\nany judge,\u201d conditions that exclusion upon certain find\nings, \u00a73161(h)(7)(A). In light of this difference in formula\ntion, we have held that the first six exclusions are \u201c \u2018auto\nmatic,\u2019 \u201d apply \u201cregardless of the specifics of the case,\u201d and\nrequire no district-court findings. Bloate v. United States,\n559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1, n. 1, 6);\nsee also Henderson v. United States, 476 U. S. 321, 327\n(1986). Tinklenberg\u2019s incorporation of a threshold inquiry\ninto \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) would make it none of these things.\n   Delay of trial is also ruled out by the fact that the text\nis forward looking. It says that the \u201cfollowing periods of\ndelay shall be excluded in computing . . . the time within\nwhich the trial . . . must commence.\u201d \u00a73161(h) (emphasis\nadded). This is designed to enable the determination in\nadvance of the date by which the trial \u201cmust commence.\u201d\nQuite obviously, if the specified delays did not count\nunless and until they delayed the trial, one could not know\nwhether they counted until after the fact. And on that\ninterpretation the provision should have read, not \u201cthe\ntime within which the trial . . . must commence,\u201d but\nrather \u201cthe time within which the trial . . . should have\ncommenced.\u201d\n4              UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   And finally, there are the administrative difficulties\nthat arise when \u201cdelay\u201d is taken to mean \u201cdelay in trial,\u201d\ndiscussed in the Court\u2019s opinion at pages 9\u201310. These are\nnot relevant on their own, but only because they bear upon\nthe meaning of the text. When one of two possible mean\nings yields impracticable results, the other meaning is\nmore likely correct.\n   Tinklenberg would invent a threshold inquiry applicable\nonly to \u00a73161(h)(1)(D): If, he says, at least some delay of\nthe trial date has occurred, then the entire period specified\nin \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) may be excluded. This makes no sense.\nFirst, nothing in the statute supports treating the word\n\u201cdelay\u201d as a trigger for an exclusion of an unrelated period\nof time; quite the opposite, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) treats the period\nof \u201cdelay\u201d and the pendency of the pretrial motion equiva\nlently. Second, that interpretation would ascribe different\nmeanings to the word \u201cdelay\u201d as it is used throughout the\nSpeedy Trial Act. \u201c[D]elay resulting from any interlocu\ntory appeal,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(C), for example, would refer to\nthe number of days a trial was postponed; but \u201cdelay\nresulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D), would\nrefer to the different period specified in that paragraph.\nIdentical words used in different parts of a statute are pre\nsumed to have the same meaning absent indication to\nthe contrary, and here no such indication exists. See IBP,\nInc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005).\n   Tinklenberg also argues that his interpretation draws\nsupport from the phrase \u201cresulting from,\u201d which appears\nafter the word \u201cdelay\u201d in \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). He asserts that\nthis phrase \u201cunderscores that Subsection (D) excludes\nperiods of delay that occur as a consequence of pretrial\nmotions, not merely the time during which such motions\nare pending.\u201d Brief for Respondent 17. That is true\nenough, but it sheds no light on the meaning of the word\n\u201cdelay.\u201d Cf.

Argued February 22, 2011\u2014Decided May 26, 2011\nThe Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) provides, inter alia, that in \u201cany case\n  in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial . . . shall commence\n  within seventy days\u201d after the arraignment, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1),\n  but lists a number of exclusions from the 70-day period, including\n  \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the mo\n  tion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt dispo\n  sition of, such motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D).\n     Respondent Tinklenberg\u2019s trial on federal drug and gun charges\n  began 287 days after his arraignment. The District Court denied his\n  motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the trial violated\n  the Act\u2019s 70-day requirement, finding that 218 of the days fell within\n  various of the Act\u2019s exclusions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thus\n  making the trial timely. On Tinklenberg\u2019s appeal from his convic\n  tion, the Sixth Circuit agreed that many of the 287 days were exclud\n  able, but concluded that 9 days during which three pretrial motions\n  were pending were not, because the motions did not actually cause a\n  delay, or the expectation of delay, of trial. Since these 9 days were\n  sufficient to bring the number of nonexcludable days above 70, the\n  court found a violation of the Act. And given that Tinklenberg had\n  already served his prison sentence, it ordered the indictment dis\n  missed with prejudice.\nHeld:\n    1. The Act contains no requirement that the filing of a pretrial mo\n tion actually caused, or was expected to cause, delay of a trial.\n Rather, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) stops the Speedy Trial clock from running\n automatically upon the filing of a pretrial motion irrespective of\n whether the motion has any impact on when the trial begins. Pp. 3\u2013\n 12.\n2                  UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) The Sixth Circuit reasoned that subparagraph (D)\u2019s \u201cdelay re-\n    sulting from\u201d phrase, read most naturally, requires a court to apply\n    the exclusion provision only to motions that actually cause a trial de-\n    lay, or the expectation of such a delay. While such a reading is lin-\n    guistically reasonable, it is not the only reasonable interpretation.\n    The subparagraph falls within a general set of provisions introduced\n    by the phrase: \u201cThe following periods of delay shall be excluded.\u201d\n    \u00a73161(h). That phrase is followed by a list that includes \u201c[a]ny period\n    of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,\n    including. . . .\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1). This latter list is followed by a sublist,\n    each member (but one) of which is introduced by the phrase \u201cdelay\n    resulting from . . . .\u201d Ibid. Those words are followed by a more spe-\n    cific description, such as \u201cany pretrial motion\u201d from its \u201cfiling\u201d\n    \u201cthrough the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition\n    of, such motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). The whole paragraph can be read\n    as requiring the automatic exclusion of the members of that specific\n    sublist, while referring to those members in general as \u201cperiods of de-\n    lay\u201d and as causing that delay, not because Congress intended the\n    judge to determine causation, but because, in a close to definitional\n    way, the words embody Congress\u2019 own view of the matter. Thus, lan-\n    guage alone cannot resolve the basic question presented. Pp. 4\u20137.\n          (b) Several considerations, taken together, compel the conclusion\n    that Congress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.\n    First, subparagraph (D) and neighboring subparagraphs (F) and (H)\n    contain language that instructs courts to measure the time actually\n    consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence, but those subpara-\n    graphs do not mention the date on which the trial begins or was ex-\n    pected to begin. Second, during the 37 years since Congress enacted\n    the statute, every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Sixth Cir-\n    cuit\u2019s interpretation. Third, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would\n    make the subparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to\n    administer, thereby hindering the Act\u2019s efforts to secure fair and effi-\n    cient trials. Fourth, the Court\u2019s conclusion is reinforced by the diffi-\n    culty of squaring the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation with the \u201cauto-\n    matic application\u201d rule expressed in, e.g., Henderson v. United States,\n    476 U. S. 321, 327. Fifth, the legislative history also supports the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one un-\n    der paragraph (1) begin with the phrase \u201cdelay resulting from,\u201d the\n    Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would potentially extend well beyond\n    pretrial motions and encompass such matters as mental and physical\n    competency examinations, interlocutory appeals, consideration of\n    plea agreements, and the absence of essential witnesses. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       2. The Sixth Circuit also misinterpreted \u00a73161(h)(1)(F), which ex-\n    cludes from the 70-day calculation \u201cdelay resulting from transporta-\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

However, the Sixth Circuit exempted 8 weekend days\n  and holidays from the count on the theory that subparagraph (F) in\n  corporated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a), which, at the\n  time, excluded such days when computing any period specified in\n  \u201crules\u201d and \u201ccourt order[s]\u201d that was less than 11 days. Thus, the\n  Circuit considered only two transportation days excessive, and the\n  parties concede that the eight extra days were enough to make the\n  difference between compliance with, and violation of, the Act.\n     This Court exercises its discretion to consider the subsidiary sub\n  paragraph (F) question because doing so is fairer to Tinklenberg, who\n  has already served his sentence. In the Court\u2019s view, subparagraph\n  (F) does not incorporate Rule 45. The Act does not say that it does so,\n  the Government gives no good reason for such a reading, and the\n  Rule itself, as it existed at the relevant time, stated it applied to rules\n  and court orders, but said nothing about statutes. The fact that Rule\n  45 is revised from time to time also argues against its direct applica\n  tion to subparagraph (F) because such changes, likely reflecting con\n  siderations other than those related to the Act, may well leave courts\n  treating similar defendants differently. The better reading includes\n  weekend days and holidays in subparagraph (F)\u2019s 10-day period un\n  der the common-law rule that such days are included when counting\n  a statutory time period of 10 days unless a statute specifically ex\n  cludes them. Many courts have treated statutory time periods this\n  way, and Congress has tended specifically to exclude weekend days\n  and holidays from statutory time periods of 10 days when it intended\n  that result. Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently modified to require a\n  similar result. Pp. 12\u201314.\n     3. Although the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretations of subparagraphs\n  (D) and (F) are both mistaken, the conclusions the court drew from\n  its interpretations in relevant part cancel each other out, such that\n  the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Tinklenberg\u2019s trial failed to com\n  ply with the Act\u2019s deadline is correct.

S. C. \u00a73161 et seq.,\nprovides that in \u201cany case in which a plea of not guilty is\nentered, the trial . . . shall commence within seventy days\u201d\nfrom the later of (1) the \u201cfiling date\u201d of the information or\nindictment or (2) the defendant\u2019s initial appearance before\na judicial officer (i.e., the arraignment). \u00a73161(c)(1). The\nAct goes on to list a set of exclusions from the 70-day\nperiod, including \u201cdelay resulting from any pretrial mo\ntion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion\nof the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such\nmotion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis\nadded).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nheld in this case that a pretrial motion falls within this\nexclusion only if it \u201cactually cause[s] a delay, or the expec\ntation of a delay, of trial.\u201d 579 F. 3d 589, 598 (2009). In\nour view, however, the statutory exclusion does not con\ntain this kind of causation requirement. Rather, the filing\nof a pretrial motion falls within this provision irrespective\nof whether it actually causes, or is expected to cause, delay\n2              UNITED STATES v.

He made his initial appearance\nbefore a judicial officer on October 31, 2005, and the\nSpeedy Trial clock then began to run. His trial began on\nAugust 14, 2006, 287 days later. Just before trial,\nTinklenberg asked the District Court to dismiss the in\ndictment on the ground that the trial came too late, vio\nlating the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s 70-day requirement. The\nDistrict Court denied the motion after finding that 218\nof the 287 days fell within various Speedy Trial Act exclu\nsions, leaving 69 nonexcludable days, thereby making the\ntrial timely.\n   On appeal the Sixth Circuit agreed with the District\nCourt that many of the 287 days were excludable. But it\ndisagreed with the District Court about the excludability\nof time related to three pretrial motions. The Government\nfiled the first motion, an unopposed motion to conduct a\nvideo deposition of a witness, on August 1, 2006; the Dis\ntrict Court disposed of the motion on August 3, 2006. The\nGovernment filed the second motion, an unopposed motion\nto bring seized firearms into the courtroom as evidence at\ntrial, on August 8, 2006; the District Court disposed of the\nmotion on August 10, 2006. Tinklenberg filed the third\nmotion, a motion to dismiss the indictment under the\nSpeedy Trial Act, on August 11, 2006; the District Court\ndenied that motion on August 14, 2006. In the Sixth\nCircuit\u2019s view, the nine days during which the three mo\ntions were pending were not excludable because the mo\ntions did not \u201cactually cause a delay, or the expectation of\ndelay, of trial.\u201d 579 F. 3d, at 598. Because these 9 days\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

We now reverse its determination. But be\ncause we agree with the defendant about a subsidiary\nmatter, namely, the exclusion of certain holidays and\nweekend days during the period in which he was trans\nported for a competency examination, id., at 597, we af\nfirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 ultimate conclusion.\n                           II\n                           A\n  In relevant part the Speedy Trial Act sets forth a basic\nrule:\n    \u201cIn any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered,\n    the trial of a defendant . . . shall commence within\n    seventy days from [the later of (1)] the filing date . . .\n    of the information or indictment, or . . .

We\nagree that such a reading is linguistically reasonable, but\nthe Court of Appeals wrote that there \u201cis no conceivable\nway to read this language other than to require a delay to\nresult from any pretrial motion before excludable time\noccurs.\u201d Ibid. See also ibid. (\u201c[T]he statute is clear\u201d). And\nhere we disagree.\n   When the Court of Appeals says that its reading is the\nonly way any reasonable person could read this language,\nit overstates its claim. For one thing, even though the\nword \u201cdelay\u201d ordinarily indicates a postponement, it need\nnot inevitably do so. Compare The American Heritage\nDictionary 480 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201c[t]o postpone until a later\ntime\u201d or \u201c[t]o cause to be later or slower than expected or\ndesired\u201d) with ibid. (\u201c[t]he interval of time between two\nevents\u201d). In any event, terms must be read in their statu\ntory context in order to determine how the provision in\nquestion should be applied in an individual case.\n   Statutory language that describes a particular circum\nstance, for example, might require a judge to examine\neach individual case to see if that circumstance is present.\nBut, alternatively, it might ask a judge instead to look at\nmore general matters, such as when a statute requires a\njudge to increase the sentence of one convicted of a \u201ccrime\nof violence\u201d without requiring the judge to determine\nwhether the particular crime at issue in a particular case\nwas committed in a violent manner. See Taylor v. United\nStates, 495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d char\nacterizes the generic crime, not the particular act commit\nted). Similarly a statute that forbids the importation of\n\u201cwild birds\u201d need not require a court to decide whether a\nparticular parrot is, in fact, wild or domesticated. It may\n6             UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintend to place the entire species within that definition\nwithout investigation of the characteristics of an individ\nual specimen. See United States v. Fifty-Three (53) Eclec\ntus Parrots, 685 F. 2d 1131, 1137 (CA9 1982).\n   More than that, statutory language can sometimes\nspecify that a set of circumstances exhibits a certain char\nacteristic virtually as a matter of definition and irrespec\ntive of how a court may view it in a particular case. A\nstatute that describes \u201cextortion\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\nmakes that fact so by definition, without asking a court\nto second-guess Congress about the matter. 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2006 ed.) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d to\ninclude extortion for purposes of the Armed Career Crimi\nnal Act).\n   The statute before us, though more complex, can be read\nsimilarly. The pretrial motion subparagraph falls within a\ngeneral set of provisions introduced by the phrase: \u201cThe\nfollowing periods of delay shall be excluded.\u201d \u00a73161(h)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). That phrase is then followed by a list\nthat includes \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from other\nproceedings concerning the defendant, including . . . .\u201d\n\u00a73161(h)(1). This latter list is followed by a sublist, each\nmember (but one) of which is introduced by the phrase\n\u201cdelay resulting from . . . ,\u201d ibid. (2006 ed. and Supp. III),\nwhich words are followed by a more specific description,\nsuch as \u201cany pretrial motion\u201d from its \u201cfiling\u201d \u201cthrough the\nconclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition\nof, such motion.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The\nwhole paragraph can be read as requiring the automatic\nexclusion of the members of that specific sublist, while\nreferring to those members in general as \u201cperiods of delay\u201d\nand as causing that delay, not because Congress intended\nthe judge to determine causation, but because, in a close to\ndefinitional way, the words embody Congress\u2019 own view of\nthe matter.\n   It is not farfetched to describe the members of the spe\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncific sublist in the statute before us in this definitional\nsense\u2014as \u201cperiods of delay\u201d or as bringing about delay.\nAfter all, the exclusion of any of the specific periods de\nscribed always delays the expiration of the 70-day Speedy\nTrial deadline. Or Congress might have described the\nspecific periods listed in paragraph (1) as \u201cperiods of de\nlay\u201d and \u201cdelay[s] resulting from\u201d simply because periods\nof the type described often do cause a delay in the start of\ntrial. Both explanations show that, linguistically speak\ning, one can read the statutory exclusion as automatically\napplying to the specific periods described without leaving\nto the district court the task of determining whether the\nperiod described would or did actually cause a postpone\nment of the trial in the particular case. Thus, language\nalone cannot resolve the basic question presented in this\ncase. But when read in context and in light of the stat\nute\u2019s structure and purpose, we think it clear that Con\ngress intended subparagraph (D) to apply automatically.\n                               C\n   We now turn to several considerations, which, taken\ntogether, convince us that the subparagraphs that specifi\ncally list common pretrial occurrences apply automatically\nin the way we have just described. First, subparagraph\n(D) clarifies that the trial court should measure the period\nof excludable delay for a pretrial motion \u201cfrom the filing of\nthe motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of such motion,\u201d but nowhere\ndoes it mention the date on which the trial begins or was\nexpected to begin. \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III).\nThus, it is best read to instruct measurement of the time\nactually consumed by consideration of the pretrial mo\ntion. Two other related subparagraphs contain clarifying\nlanguage that contemplates measurement of the time\nactually consumed by the specified pretrial occurrence\nwithout regard to the commencement of the trial. See\n8             UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (\u201cAny time consumed in excess of ten days\nfrom the date an order of removal or an order directing\nsuch transportation, and the defendant\u2019s arrival at the\ndestination shall be presumed to be unreasonable\u201d);\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(H) (\u201cdelay reasonably attributable to any\nperiod, not to exceed thirty days, during which any pro\nceeding concerning the defendant is actually under ad\nvisement by the court\u201d). If \u201cdelay\u201d truly referred to the\npostponement of trial, then presumably those subpara\ngraphs would instruct that excludable periods should be\nmeasured from the date that trial was otherwise sched\nuled to begin.\n  Second, we are impressed that during the 37 years since\nCongress enacted the Speedy Trial Act, every Court of\nAppeals has considered the question before us now, and\nevery Court of Appeals, implicitly or explicitly, has re\njected the interpretation that the Sixth Circuit adopted in\nthis case. See United States v. Wilson, 835 F. 2d 1440,\n1443 (CADC 1987) (explicit), abrogated on other grounds\nby Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S. ___ (2010); United\nStates v.

S. ____ (2011)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreat practical administrative importance in the daily\nworking lives of busy trial judges is itself entitled to strong\nconsideration, particularly when those courts have main\ntained that interpretation consistently over a long a period\nof time. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 593\u2013594 (2004).\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would make the\nsubparagraph (D) exclusion significantly more difficult to\nadminister. And in doing so, it would significantly hinder\nthe Speedy Trial Act\u2019s efforts to secure fair and efficient\ncriminal trial proceedings. See Zedner v. United States,\n547 U. S. 489, 497 (2006) (noting that the Act\u2019s exceptions\nprovide \u201cnecessary flexibility\u201d); H. R. Rep. No. 93\u20131508, p.\n15 (1974) (the Act seeks to achieve \u201cefficiency in the proc\nessing of cases which is commensurate with due process\u201d);\nS. Rep. No. 93\u20131021, p. 21 (1974). Trial judges may, for\nexample, set trial dates beyond 70 days in light of other\ncommitments. And in doing so, a trial judge may well be\naware, based on his or her experience, that pretrial mo\ntions will likely consume the extra time\u2014even though the\njudge may know little about which specific motions will be\nfiled, when, and how many. How is that judge to apply the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s approach, particularly when several, in\ncluding unanticipated, pretrial proceedings did consume\nthe time in question?\n   Moreover, what is to happen if several excludable and\nseveral nonexcludable potential causes of delay (e.g., pre\ntrial motions to take depositions, potential scheduling\nconflicts, various health examinations, etc.) coincide,\nparticularly in multidefendant cases? Can the judge,\nmotion by motion, decide which motions were responsible\nand which were not responsible for postponing what oth\nerwise might have been an earlier trial date? And how is\na defendant or his attorney to predict whether or when a\njudge will later find a particular motion to have caused a\npostponement of trial? And if the matter is difficult to\n10            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredict, how is the attorney to know when or whether he\nor she should seek further postponement of the 70-day\ndeadline?\n   With considerable time and judicial effort, perhaps\nthrough the use of various presumptions, courts could find\nmethods for overcoming these and other administrative\ndifficulties. In some instances, the judge may know at the\ntime of filing that a given motion is easily resolved or that\nits complexity will almost certainly postpone the trial.\nJudges could note on the record their predictions about\nwhether the motion will postpone trial at the time that the\nmotion is filed. Parties could also stipulate as to whether\na given motion would be excluded from the Speedy Trial\nclock. But those theoretical strategies would not prevent\nall or even most mistakes, needless dismissals of indict\nments, and potential retrials after appeal\u2014all of which\nexact a toll in terms of the fairness of and confidence in\nthe criminal justice system. And any such future strate\ngies for administering the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule cannot\nprovide a present justification for turning the federal\njudicial system away from the far less obstacle-strewn\npath that the system has long traveled.\n   Fourth, we are reinforced in our conclusion by the diffi\nculty of squaring the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation with\nthis Court\u2019s precedent. In Henderson v. United States, 476\nU. S. 321 (1986), the Court rejected the contention that\nthe exclusion provision for pretrial motions governs only\nreasonable delays. The Court there concluded (as the\nCourt of Appeals had held) that the exclusion \u201cwas in\ntended to be automatic.\u201d Id., at 327 (quoting United States\nv. Henderson, 746 F. 2d 619, 622 (CA9 1984); internal\nquotation marks omitted). See also Bloate v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___ (2010) (holding based in part on\nthe view that the exclusion applies \u201cautomatically\u201d to the\nspecified period of delay). Henderson did not consider\nwhether a trial court must determine whether the pretrial\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmotion actually caused postponement of the trial in each\nindividual case. But the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation\nwould nonetheless significantly limit the premise of \u201cauto\nmatic application\u201d upon which the case rests.\n   Fifth, for those who find legislative history useful, it is\nworthwhile noting, (as this Court noted in Henderson)\nthat the Senate Report concerning the reenactment of the\nprovision in 1979 described it, along with the other provi\nsions in \u00a73161(h)(1), as referring to \u201cspecific and recurring\nperiods of time often found in criminal cases,\u201d and charac\nterized them as \u201cautomatically excludable delay,\u201d S. Rep.\nNo. 96\u2013212, p. 9 (1979). See H. R. Rep. No. 93\u20131508, at 21\n(\u201cThe time limits would be tolled by hearings, proceedings\nand necessary delay which normally occur prior to the\ntrial of criminal cases\u201d (emphasis added)); S. Rep. No. 93\u2013\n1021, at 21 (\u201c[The Act] has carefully constructed exclu\nsions and exceptions which permit normal pre-trial prepa\nration in the ordinary noncomplex cases which represent\nthe bulk of business in the Federal courts\u201d). But cf. id., at\n35 (paragraph (h)(1) excludes \u201c[d]elays caused by proceed\nings relating to the defendant\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Sixth, because all the subparagraphs but one under\nparagraph (1) begin with the phrase \u201cdelay resulting\nfrom,\u201d the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation would potentially\nextend well beyond pretrial motions and encompass such\nmatters as mental and physical competency examinations,\ninterlocutory appeals, consideration of plea agreements,\nand the absence of essential witnesses. See \u00a73161(h)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III); \u00a73161(h)(3)(A) (2006 ed.). Given the\nadministrative complexity the causation requirement\nwould bring about in all these areas, those Circuits that\nhave considered a causation requirement in respect to\nthese other matters have rejected it. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Pete, 525 F. 3d 844, 852 (CA9 2008) (interlocutory\nappeal); United States v. Miles, 290 F. 3d 1341, 1350\n(CA11 2002) (unavailability of essential witnesses); United\n12            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Robinson, 887 F. 2d 651, 656\u2013657 (CA6 1989)\n(trial on other charges). That further complexity, along\nwith these lower court holdings, reinforce our conclusion.\n   We consequently disagree with the Sixth Circuit that\nthe Act\u2019s exclusion requires a court to find that the event\nthe exclusion specifically describes, here the filing of the\npretrial motion, actually caused or was expected to cause\ndelay of a trial. We hold that the Act contains no such\nrequirement.\n                            III\n  Tinklenberg also argues that the Sixth Circuit wrongly\ninterpreted a different exclusion provision, this time the\nprovision excluding\n     \u201cdelay resulting from transportation of any defendant\n     from another district, or to and from places of exami\n     nation or hospitalization, except that any time con\n     sumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of\n     removal or an order directing such transportation,\n     and the defendant\u2019s arrival at the destination shall be\n     presumed to be unreasonable.\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(F) (2006\n     ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added).\nThe District Court granted Tinklenberg\u2019s request for a\ncompetency evaluation and he was transported to a medi\ncal facility for examination. The lower courts agreed that\na total of 20 transportation days elapsed and that since\nthe Government provided no justification, all days in\nexcess of the 10 days specified in the statute were unrea\nsonable. But in counting those excess days, the court\nexempted weekend days and holidays. Since Veterans\nDay, Thanksgiving Day, and three weekends all fell\nwithin the 20-day period, only 2 days, not 10 days, were\nconsidered excessive, during which the 70-day Speedy\nTrial Act clock continued to tick.\n  Tinklenberg argues that subparagraph (F) does not\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexempt weekend days and holidays; hence the court\nshould have considered 10, not 2, days to be excessive.\nAnd the parties concede that those 8 extra ticking days are\nenough to make the difference between compliance with,\nand violation of, the Act.\n  As the Solicitor General notes, we may consider, or\n\u201cdecline to entertain,\u201d alternative grounds for affirmance.\nSee United States v. Nobles, 422 U. S. 225, 242, n. 16\n(1975). In this case, we believe it treats Tinklenberg, who\nhas already served his sentence, more fairly to consider\nthe alternative ground and thereby more fully to dispose of\nthe case.\n  The Sixth Circuit exempted weekend days and holidays\nbecause it believed that subparagraph (F) incorporated\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(a). At the relevant\ntime, that Rule excluded weekend days and holidays when\ncomputing any period of time specified in the \u201crules,\u201d in\n\u201cany local rule,\u201d or in \u201cany court order\u201d that was less than\n11 days. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(a) (2005). But in our\nview subparagraph (F) does not incorporate Rule 45. The\nAct does not say that it incorporates Rule 45. The Gov\nernment has given us no good reason for reading it as\nincorporating the Rule. And the Rule itself, as it existed\nat the relevant time, said that it applied to \u201crules\u201d and to\n\u201corders,\u201d but it said nothing about statutes. Other things\nbeing equal, the fact that Rule 45 is revised from time to\ntime also argues against its direct application to subpara\ngraph (F). That is because those changes, likely reflecting\nconsiderations other than those related to the Speedy\nTrial Act, may well leave courts treating similar defen\ndants differently.\n  Without relying upon a cross-reference to Rule 45, we\nbelieve the better reading of subparagraph (F) would\ninclude weekend days and holidays in its 10-day time\nperiod. Under the common-law rule, weekend days and\nholidays are included when counting a statutory time\n14            UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nperiod of 10 days unless the statute specifically excludes\nthem. See 74 Am. Jur. 2d, Time \u00a722, p. 589 (2001)\n(in calculating time periods expressed in statutes, \u201cwhen\nthe time stipulated must necessarily include one or more\nSaturdays, Sundays, or holidays, those days will not be\nexcluded, in the absence of an express proviso for their\nexclusion\u201d). Many courts have treated statutory time\nperiods this way. See, e.g., Howeisen v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383\u2013384, 145 N.

And Congress has tended specifically\nto exclude weekend days and holidays from statutory time\nperiods of 10 days when it intended that result. Compare\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73142(d)(2) (permitting the temporary deten\ntion of certain defendants \u201cfor a period of not more than\nten days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays\u201d)\nand 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(d)(2)(A) (requiring an agency to\nacknowledge receipt of a request to amend agency records\nwithin \u201c10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal\npublic holidays)\u201d) with 18 U. S. C. \u00a72518(9) (establishing a\n10-day period for disclosing applications for and court\norders authorizing wiretaps without specifically excluding\nweekends and holidays) and \u00a74244(a) (providing a 10-day\nperiod after conviction for filing a motion to request men\ntal health treatment without specifically excluding week\nends and holidays). Indeed, Rule 45 has been recently\nmodified so that now (though not at the time of Tinklen\nberg\u2019s proceedings) it requires a similar result. Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 45(a)(1) (2010) (instructing that weekend days\nand holidays are to be counted when calculating all time\nperiods, including statutory time periods for which no\nalternative method of computing time is specified).\n                     *    *    *\n  We disagree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\nboth subparagraph (D) and subparagraph (F), and now\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Therefore, the Sixth Cir\ncuit\u2019s judgment ordering dismissal of the indictment on\nremand is\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. III). But I think that\nconclusion is entirely clear from the text of the Speedy\nTrial Act, and see no need to look beyond the text. The\nclarity of the text is doubtless why, as the Court\u2019s opinion\npoints out, ante, at 8, every Circuit disagrees with the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion.

TINKLENBERG\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto the period between ticks of the speedy trial clock\u2014in\nother words, the period during which the Speedy Trial\nAct\u2019s 70-day requirement is tolled.\n   Interpreting the \u201cdelay\u201d referred to in \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) (or\nreferred to anywhere else in \u00a73161(h)) as the delay of a\ntrial date* would make little sense in light of the context\nof the provision and the structure of the statute. Section\n3161(h)(1)(D) specifies starting and stopping points for the\nexcludable \u201cdelay\u201d that bear no relation whatsoever to the\nactual amount of time that a trial might be postponed by a\npretrial motion. It equates the \u201cdelay resulting from any\npretrial motion\u201d to the period of time between \u201cthe filing\nof the motion\u201d and \u201cthe conclusion of the hearing on, or\nother prompt disposition of, such motion.\u201d This equation is\npossible if \u201cdelay\u201d refers to an interval of time excludable\nfor purposes of the Speedy Trial Act, but it makes no sense\nif \u201cdelay\u201d refers to the time a trial is postponed. Consider,\nfor example, a pretrial motion that is pending for 10 days\nbut causes the district court to push back a trial\u2019s begin\nning by only one day. In such a situation, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D)\nwould require that the entire 10-day period be excluded\nfor Speedy Trial Act purposes.\n   Neighboring statutory provisions, moreover, link the\nexcludable \u201cdelay\u201d to the time consumed by the specified\nevent, not the number of days a trial is postponed. Section\n3161(h)(1)(H), for example, excludes \u201cdelay reasonably\nattributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days,\nduring which any proceeding concerning the defendant\nis actually under advisement by the court.\u201d And\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(F) excludes \u201cdelay resulting from transporta\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * I consider only this possibility, and not the extended meaning in\nvented by the Sixth Circuit (\u201cexpectation of a dela[y] of trial\u201d)\u2014\npresumably to explain how delay can be computed ex ante, before any\ntrial delay has actually occurred. See 579 F. 3d 589, 598 (2009).\n\u201c[E]xpectation of a delay\u201d is simply not one of the possible meanings of\n\u201cdelay.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntion . . . except that any time consumed in excess of ten\ndays from . . . an order directing such transportation, and\nthe defendant\u2019s arrival at the destination shall be pre\nsumed to be unreasonable.\u201d If \u201cdelay\u201d means trial delay, it\nmakes little sense for Congress to have placed a limit upon\nthe \u201ctime consumed\u201d in transporting a defendant rather\nthan upon the permissible postponement of trial date.\n   The Speedy Trial Act\u2019s structure also suggests that\n\u00a73161(h)(1)(D) is meant to apply automatically and is not\ndependent on predicate findings of postponement. Section\n3161(h) lists various types of delay that may be excluded,\nthe first six of which (including \u00a73161(h)(1)(D)) make no\nreference to any required findings. But the seventh, which\nexcludes \u201cdelay resulting from a continuance granted by\nany judge,\u201d conditions that exclusion upon certain find\nings, \u00a73161(h)(7)(A). In light of this difference in formula\ntion, we have held that the first six exclusions are \u201c \u2018auto\nmatic,\u2019 \u201d apply \u201cregardless of the specifics of the case,\u201d and\nrequire no district-court findings. Bloate v. United States,\n559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1, n. 1, 6);\nsee also Henderson v. United States, 476 U. S. 321, 327\n(1986). Tinklenberg\u2019s incorporation of a threshold inquiry\ninto \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) would make it none of these things.\n   Delay of trial is also ruled out by the fact that the text\nis forward looking. It says that the \u201cfollowing periods of\ndelay shall be excluded in computing . . . the time within\nwhich the trial . . . must commence.\u201d \u00a73161(h) (emphasis\nadded). This is designed to enable the determination in\nadvance of the date by which the trial \u201cmust commence.\u201d\nQuite obviously, if the specified delays did not count\nunless and until they delayed the trial, one could not know\nwhether they counted until after the fact. And on that\ninterpretation the provision should have read, not \u201cthe\ntime within which the trial . . . must commence,\u201d but\nrather \u201cthe time within which the trial . . . should have\ncommenced.\u201d\n4              UNITED STATES v. TINKLENBERG\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   And finally, there are the administrative difficulties\nthat arise when \u201cdelay\u201d is taken to mean \u201cdelay in trial,\u201d\ndiscussed in the Court\u2019s opinion at pages 9\u201310. These are\nnot relevant on their own, but only because they bear upon\nthe meaning of the text. When one of two possible mean\nings yields impracticable results, the other meaning is\nmore likely correct.\n   Tinklenberg would invent a threshold inquiry applicable\nonly to \u00a73161(h)(1)(D): If, he says, at least some delay of\nthe trial date has occurred, then the entire period specified\nin \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) may be excluded. This makes no sense.\nFirst, nothing in the statute supports treating the word\n\u201cdelay\u201d as a trigger for an exclusion of an unrelated period\nof time; quite the opposite, \u00a73161(h)(1)(D) treats the period\nof \u201cdelay\u201d and the pendency of the pretrial motion equiva\nlently. Second, that interpretation would ascribe different\nmeanings to the word \u201cdelay\u201d as it is used throughout the\nSpeedy Trial Act. \u201c[D]elay resulting from any interlocu\ntory appeal,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(C), for example, would refer to\nthe number of days a trial was postponed; but \u201cdelay\nresulting from any pretrial motion,\u201d \u00a73161(h)(1)(D), would\nrefer to the different period specified in that paragraph.\nIdentical words used in different parts of a statute are pre\nsumed to have the same meaning absent indication to\nthe contrary, and here no such indication exists. See IBP,\nInc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005).\n   Tinklenberg also argues that his interpretation draws\nsupport from the phrase \u201cresulting from,\u201d which appears\nafter the word \u201cdelay\u201d in \u00a73161(h)(1)(D). He asserts that\nthis phrase \u201cunderscores that Subsection (D) excludes\nperiods of delay that occur as a consequence of pretrial\nmotions, not merely the time during which such motions\nare pending.\u201d Brief for Respondent 17. That is true\nenough, but it sheds no light on the meaning of the word\n\u201cdelay.\u201d Cf.
