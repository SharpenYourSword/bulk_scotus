A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u20136. Argued February 23, 2011\u2014Decided May 31, 2011\nAfter respondent SEB invented an innovative deep fryer, obtained a\n  U. S. patent for its design, and began selling its fryer in this country,\n  Sunbeam Products, Inc., asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises,\n  Ltd., a Hong Kong home appliance maker and wholly owned subsidi\n  ary of petitioner Global-Tech Appliances, Inc., to supply Sunbeam\n  with deep fryers meeting certain specifications. Pentalpha purchased\n  an SEB fryer that was made for sale in a foreign market and thus\n  lacked U. S. patent markings, copied all but the fryer\u2019s cosmetic fea\n  tures, and retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use study with\n  out telling him it had copied directly from SEB\u2019s design. Failing to\n  locate SEB\u2019s patent, the attorney issued an opinion letter stating that\n  Pentalpha\u2019s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had\n  found. Pentalpha then started selling its fryers to Sunbeam, which\n  resold them in this country under its own trademarks at a price that\n  undercut SEB\u2019s.\n     SEB then sued Sunbeam for patent infringement. Though Sun\n  beam notified Pentalpha of the lawsuit, Pentalpha went on to sell its\n  fryers to other companies, which resold them in the U. S. market un\n  der their respective trademarks. After settling the Sunbeam lawsuit,\n  SEB sued Pentalpha, asserting, as relevant here, that it had contra\n  vened 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) by actively inducing Sunbeam and the\n  other purchasers of Pentalpha fryers to sell or offer to sell them in\n  violation of SEB\u2019s patent rights. The jury found for SEB on the in\n  duced infringement theory, and the District Court entered judgment\n  for SEB. Affirming, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in\n  fringement under \u00a7271(b) requires a showing that the alleged in\n  fringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce ac\n  tual infringements; declared that this showing includes proof that the\n2           GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    alleged infringer knew of the patent; held that, although there was\n    no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of SEB\u2019s patent before it re\n    ceived notice of the Sunbeam suit, there was adequate proof that it\n    deliberately disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat\n    ent; and said that such disregard is not different from, but a form of,\n    actual knowledge.\nHeld:\n    1. Induced infringement under \u00a7271(b) requires knowledge that the\n induced acts constitute patent infringement. Pp. 3\u201310.\n       (a) Section 271(b)\u2019s text\u2014\u201c[w]hoever actively induces infringe\n ment of a patent shall be liable as an infringer\u201d\u2014is ambiguous as to\n the intent needed to impose liability. In referring to a party that \u201cin\n duces infringement,\u201d the provision may require merely that the in\n ducer must lead another to engage in conduct that happens to\n amount to infringement. On the other hand, the reference to a party\n that \u201cinduces infringement\u201d may also be read to mean that the in\n ducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer\n knows is infringement. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) Like \u00a7271(b)\u2019s language, the pre-1952 case law is susceptible\n to conflicting interpretations. However, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible\n Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476 (Aro II), resolves the question at\n issue. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of\n indirect liability in the pre-1952 case law, but was treated as evi\n dence of \u201ccontributory infringement,\u201d i.e., the aiding and abetting of\n direct infringement by another party. When Congress enacted \u00a7271,\n it separated the contributory infringement concept into two catego\n ries: induced infringement, covered by \u00a7271(b), and sale of a compo\n nent of a patented invention, covered by \u00a7271(c). In the badly frac\n tured Aro II decision, a majority concluded that a violator of \u00a7271(c)\n must know \u201cthat the combination for which his component was espe\n cially designed was both patented and infringing.\u201d 377 U. S., at 488.\n That conclusion, now a fixture in the law, compels this same knowl\n edge for liability under \u00a7271(b), given that the two provisions have a\n common origin and create the same difficult interpretive choice. Pp.\n 8\u201310.\n    2. Deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does\n not satisfy the knowledge required by \u00a7271(b). Nevertheless, the\n Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment must be affirmed because the evidence in\n this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalpha\u2019s\n knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness. Pp. 10\u201316.\n       (a) The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in crimi\n nal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted\n knowingly or willfully, and courts applying the doctrine have held\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliber\n  ately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that\n  are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The traditional ration\n  ale for the doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are\n  just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge. This Court en\n  dorsed a concept similar to willful blindness over a century ago in\n  Spurr v. United States, 174 U. S. 728, 735, and every Federal Court\n  of Appeals but one has fully embraced willful blindness. Given the\n  doctrine's long history and wide acceptance in the Federal Judiciary,\n  there is no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits\n  for induced patent infringement under \u00a7271(b). Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (b) Although the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of will\n  ful blindness in slightly different ways, all agree on two basic re\n  quirements. First, the defendant must subjectively believe that there\n  is a high probability that a fact exists. Second, the defendant must\n  take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact. These require\n  ments give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that sur\n  passes recklessness and negligence. Pp. 13\u201314.\n       (c) Although the Federal Circuit\u2019s test departs from the proper\n  willful blindness standard in important respects, the evidence when\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for SEB was suffi\n  cient under the correct standard. Pentalpha believed that SEB\u2019s\n  fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the\n  U. S. market as evidenced by its decision to copy all but the fryer\u2019s\n  cosmetic features. Also revealing is Pentalpha\u2019s decision to copy an\n  overseas model of SEB\u2019s fryer, aware that it would not bear U. S.\n  patent markings. Even more telling is Pentalpha\u2019s decision not to in\n  form its attorney that the product to be evaluated was simply a\n  knockoff of SEB\u2019s fryer. Taken together, the evidence was more than\n  sufficient for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed there\n  was a high probability that SEB\u2019s fryer was patented and took delib\n  erate steps to avoid knowing that fact, and that it therefore willfully\n  blinded itself to the infringing nature of Sunbeam\u2019s sales.

SEB S. A. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                [May 31, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   We consider whether a party who \u201cactively induces in\u00ad\nfringement of a patent\u201d under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) must know\nthat the induced acts constitute patent infringement.\n                              I\n  This case concerns a patent for an innovative deep fryer\ndesigned by respondent SEB S. A., a French maker of\nhome appliances. In the late 1980\u2019s, SEB invented a \u201ccool\u00ad\ntouch\u201d deep fryer, that is, a deep fryer for home use with\nexternal surfaces that remain cool during the frying proc\u00ad\ness. The cool-touch deep fryer consisted of a metal frying\npot surrounded by a plastic outer housing. Attached to the\nhousing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and\ninsulated the housing from heat by separating it from the\npot, creating air space between the two components. SEB\nobtained a U. S. patent for its design in 1991, and some\u00ad\ntime later, SEB started manufacturing the cool-touch fryer\nand selling it in this country under its well-known \u201cT-Fal\u201d\nbrand. Superior to other products in the American market\nat the time, SEB\u2019s fryer was a commercial success.\n2             GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1997, Sunbeam Products, Inc., a U. S. competitor of\nSEB, asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., to\nsupply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.\nPentalpha is a Hong Kong maker of home appliances and\na wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Ap\u00ad\npliances, Inc.1\n   In order to develop a deep fryer for Sunbeam, Pentalpha\npurchased an SEB fryer in Hong Kong and copied all but\nits cosmetic features. Because the SEB fryer bought in\nHong Kong was made for sale in a foreign market, it bore\nno U. S. patent markings. After copying SEB\u2019s design,\nPentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use\nstudy, but Pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney\nthat its design was copied directly from SEB\u2019s.\n   The attorney failed to locate SEB\u2019s patent, and in Au\u00ad\ngust 1997 he issued an opinion letter stating that Pental\u00ad\npha\u2019s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he\nhad found. That same month, Pentalpha started selling\nits deep fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in the\nUnited States under its trademarks. By obtaining its\nproduct from a manufacturer with lower production costs,\nSunbeam was able to undercut SEB in the U. S. market.\n   After SEB\u2019s customers started defecting to Sunbeam,\nSEB sued Sunbeam in March 1998, alleging that Sun\u00ad\nbeam\u2019s sales infringed SEB\u2019s patent. Sunbeam notified\nPentalpha of the lawsuit the following month. Unde\u00ad\nterred, Pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to Fingerhut\nCorp. and Montgomery Ward & Co., both of which resold\nthem in the United States under their respective trade\u00ad\nmarks.\n   SEB settled the lawsuit with Sunbeam, and then sued\nPentalpha, asserting two theories of recovery: First, SEB\nclaimed that Pentalpha had directly infringed SEB\u2019s\npatent in violation of 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(a), by selling or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 We   refer to both petitioners as \u201cPentalpha.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noffering to sell its deep fryers; and second, SEB claimed\nthat Pentalpha had contravened \u00a7271(b) by actively induc\u00ad\ning Sunbeam, Fingerhut, and Montgomery Ward to sell or\nto offer to sell Pentalpha\u2019s deep fryers in violation of SEB\u2019s\npatent rights.\n   Following a 5-day trial, the jury found for SEB on both\ntheories and also found that Pentalpha\u2019s infringement had\nbeen willful. Pentalpha filed post-trial motions seeking\na new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several\ngrounds. As relevant here, Pentalpha argued that there\nwas insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of\ninduced infringement under \u00a7271(b) because Pentalpha\ndid not actually know of SEB\u2019s patent until it received the\nnotice of the Sunbeam lawsuit in April 1998.\n   The District Court rejected Pentalpha\u2019s argument, as\ndid the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which\naffirmed the judgment, SEB S. A. v. Montgomery Ward &\nCo., 594 F. 3d 1360 (2010). Summarizing a recent en banc\ndecision, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in\u00ad\nfringement under \u00a7271(b) requires a \u201cplaintiff [to] show\nthat the alleged infringer knew or should have known\nthat his actions would induce actual infringements\u201d and\nthat this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer\nknew of the patent. Id., at 1376. Although the record\ncontained no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of\nSEB\u2019s patent before April 1998, the court found adequate\nevidence to support a finding that \u201cPentalpha deliberately\ndisregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat\u00ad\nent.\u201d Id., at 1377. Such disregard, the court said, \u201cis not\ndifferent from actual knowledge, but is a form of actual\nknowledge.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                           II\n  Pentalpha argues that active inducement liability under\n\u00a7271(b) requires more than deliberate indifference to a\n4        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown risk that the induced acts may violate an existing\npatent. Instead, Pentalpha maintains, actual knowledge\nof the patent is needed.\n                                A\n   In assessing Pentalpha\u2019s argument, we begin with the\ntext of \u00a7271(b)\u2014which is short, simple, and, with respect\nto the question presented in this case, inconclusive. Sec\u00ad\ntion 271(b) states: \u201cWhoever actively induces infringement\nof a patent shall be liable as an infringer.\u201d\n   Although the text of \u00a7271(b) makes no mention of intent,\nwe infer that at least some intent is required. The term\n\u201cinduce\u201d means \u201c[t]o lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to\nmove by persuasion or influence.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 1269 (2d ed. 1945). The addition of the\nadverb \u201cactively\u201d suggests that the inducement must\ninvolve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the\ndesired result, see id., at 27.\n   When a person actively induces another to take some\naction, the inducer obviously knows the action that he or\nshe wishes to bring about. If a used car salesman induces\na customer to buy a car, the salesman knows that the\ndesired result is the purchase of the car. But what if it\nis said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a\ndamaged car? Does this mean merely that the salesman\ninduced the customer to purchase a car that happened to\nbe damaged, a fact of which the salesman may have been\nunaware? Or does this mean that the salesman knew that\nthe car was damaged? The statement that the salesman\ninduced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.\n   So is \u00a7271(b). In referring to a party that \u201cinduces\ninfringement,\u201d this provision may require merely that the\ninducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to\namount to infringement, i.e., the making, using, offering to\nsell, selling, or importing of a patented invention.

S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7271(a).2 On the other hand, the reference to a party\nthat \u201cinduces infringement\u201d may also be read to mean that\nthe inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct\nthat the inducer knows is infringement. Both readings are\npossible.\n                              B\n   Finding no definitive answer in the statutory text, we\nturn to the case law that predates the enactment of \u00a7271\nas part the Patent Act of 1952. As we recognized in Aro\nMfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476\n(1964) (Aro II), \u201c[t]he section was designed to \u2018codify in\nstatutory form principles of contributory infringement\u2019\nwhich had been \u2018part of our law for about 80 years.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 485\u2013486, n. 6 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong.,\n2d Sess., 9 (1952)).\n   Unfortunately, the relevant pre-1952 cases are less clear\nthan one might hope with respect to the question pre\u00ad\nsented here. Before 1952, both the conduct now covered\nby \u00a7271(b) (induced infringement) and the conduct now\naddressed by \u00a7271(c) (sale of a component of a patented\ninvention) were viewed as falling within the overarching\nconcept of \u201ccontributory infringement.\u201d Cases in the latter\ncategory\u2014i.e., cases in which a party sold an item that\nwas not itself covered by the claims of a patent but that\nenabled another party to make or use a patented machine,\nprocess, or combination\u2014were more common.\n   The pre-1952 case law provides conflicting signals re\u00ad\ngarding the intent needed in such cases. In an oft-cited\ndecision, then-Judge Taft suggested that it was sufficient\nif the seller of the component part intended that the part\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Direct infringement has long been understood to require no more\n\nthan the unauthorized use of a patented invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v.\nConvertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 484 (1964); 3 A. Deller,\nWalker on Patents \u00a7453, p. 1684 (1937) (hereinafter Deller). Thus, a\ndirect infringer\u2019s knowledge or intent is irrelevant.\n6          GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbe used in an invention that happened to infringe a pat\u00ad\nent. He wrote that it was \u201cwell settled that where one\nmakes and sells one element of a combination covered by a\npatent with the intention and for the purpose of bringing\nabout its use in such a combination he is guilty of con\u00ad\ntributory infringement.\u201d Thomson-Houston Elec. Co. v.\nOhio Brass Co., 80 F. 712, 721 (CA6 1897).3\n   On the other hand, this Court, in Henry v. A. B. Dick\nCo., 224 U. S. 1 (1912), overruled on other grounds, Motion\nPicture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S.\n502 (1917), stated that \u201cif the defendants [who were ac\u00ad\ncused of contributory infringement] knew of the patent and\nthat [the direct infringer] had unlawfully made the pat\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 For an article that is particularly clear on this point, see H. Howson,\n\nPaper before American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers,\nWashington, D. C., Contributory Infringement of Patents 9 (Jan. 1895)\n(reading late 19th-century case law to require only that a party \u201cinten\u00ad\ntionally contribut[e] to the act, which the Court holds to be an in\u00ad\nfringement\u201d (emphasis in original)). Other authorities from this era\nlikewise suggest that it was sufficient if the seller intended a compo\u00ad\nnent part to be used in a manner that happened to infringe a patent.\nSee, e.g., Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper\nCo., 152 U.

Charles Eneu Johnson & Co., 207\n\nU. S. 196 (1907), contains language that may be read as adopting a\nsimilar position. In that case, the Neostyle Company had a patent for\na \u201cstencil duplicating machine\u201d called the \u201crotary Neostyle,\u201d and it\nlicensed the use of its machine pursuant to a license requiring the\nlicensee to use only Neostyle\u2019s ink. Id., at 198. Another company,\nCharles Eneu Johnson & Co., sold its ink to a Neostyle licensee, and\nNeostyle sued the Johnson company, claiming that it was \u201cinducing a\nbreach of the license contracts\u201d and was thus indirectly infringing\nNeostyle\u2019s patent rights. Id., at 199. The Court held that the defen\u00ad\ndant did not have \u201csufficient evidence of notice\u201d to support liability.\nThe Court wrote:\n\u201cTrue, the defendant filled a few orders for ink to be used on a rotary\nNeostyle, but it does not appear that it ever solicited an order for ink to\nbe so used, that it was ever notified by the plaintiffs of the rights which\nthey claimed, or that anything which it did was considered by them an\ninfringement upon those rights.\u201d Id., at 200 (emphasis added).\n   The italicized language above may suggest that it was necessary to\nshow that the defendants had notice of Neostyle\u2019s patent rights.

O\u2019Brien, 93 F. 200, 203 (CC Mass.\n1898) (\u201ca necessary condition of the defendant\u2019s guilt is his knowledge\nof the complainant\u2019s patent\u201d).\n8        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v.

S., at 488, and\nas we explain below, that conclusion compels this same\nknowledge for liability under \u00a7271(b).\n                             C\n  As noted above, induced infringement was not consid\u00ad\nered a separate theory of indirect liability in the pre-1952\ncase law. Rather, it was treated as evidence of \u201ccontribu\u00ad\ntory infringement,\u201d that is, the aiding and abetting of\ndirect infringement by another party. See Lemley, In\u00ad\nducing Patent Infringement, 39 U. C. D. L. Rev. 225, 227\n(2005). When Congress enacted \u00a7271, it separated what\nhad previously been regarded as contributory infringe\u00ad\nment into two categories, one covered by \u00a7271(b) and the\nother covered by \u00a7271(c).\n  Aro II concerned \u00a7271(c), which states in relevant part:\n      \u201cWhoever offers to sell or sells . . . a component of a\n    patented [invention] . . . , constituting a material part\n    of the invention, knowing the same to be especially\n    made or especially adapted for use in an infringement\n    of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity\n    of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing\n    use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.\u201d (Em\u00ad\n    phasis added.)\nThis language contains exactly the same ambiguity as\n\u00a7271(b). The phrase \u201cknowing [a component] to be espe\u00ad\ncially made or especially adapted for use in an infringe\u00ad\nment\u201d may be read to mean that a violator must know\nthat the component is \u201cespecially adapted for use\u201d in a\nproduct that happens to infringe a patent. Or the phrase\nmay be read to require, in addition, knowledge of the\npatent\u2019s existence.\n  This question closely divided the Aro II Court. In a\nbadly fractured decision, a majority concluded that knowl\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nedge of the patent was needed. 377 U. S., at 488, and n. 8;\nid., at 514 (White, J., concurring); id., at 524\u2013527 (Black,\nJ., dissenting).5 Justice Black\u2019s opinion, which explained\nthe basis for the majority\u2019s view, concluded that the lan\u00ad\nguage of \u00a7271(c) supported this interpretation. See id., at\n525. His opinion also relied on an amendment to this\nlanguage that was adopted when the bill was in commit\u00ad\ntee. Id., at 525\u2013527.\n   Four Justices disagreed with this interpretation and\nwould have held that a violator of \u00a7271(c) need know only\nthat the component is specially adapted for use in a prod\u00ad\nuct that happens to infringe a patent. See id., at 488\u2013490,\nn. 8. These Justices thought that this reading was sup\u00ad\nported by the language of \u00a7271(c) and the pre-1952 case\nlaw, and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the\nmajority from the amendment of \u00a7271(c)\u2019s language. Ibid.\n   While there is much to be said in favor of both views\nexpressed in Aro II, the \u201cholding in Aro II has become\na fixture in the law of contributory infringement under\n[section] 271(c),\u201d 5 R. Moy, Walker on Patents \u00a715:20,\np. 15\u2013131 (4th ed. 2009)\u2014so much so that SEB has not\nasked us to overrule it, see Brief for Respondent 19, n. 3.\nNor has Congress seen fit to alter \u00a7271(c)\u2019s intent re\u00ad\nquirement in the nearly half a century since Aro II was\ndecided. In light of the \u201c \u2018special force\u2019 \u201d of the doctrine of\nstare decisis with regard to questions of statutory inter\u00ad\npretation, see John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,\n552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008), we proceed on the premise that\n\u00a7271(c) requires knowledge of the existence of the patent\nthat is infringed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although Justice Black disagreed with the judgment and was thus\n\nin dissent, he was in the majority with respect to the interpretation of\n\u00a7271(c), and his opinion sets out the reasoning of the majority on this\npoint. Three other Justices joined his opinion, and a fourth, Justice\nWhite, endorsed his reasoning with respect to the interpretation of\n\u00a7271(c). See 377 U. S., at 514 (White, J., concurring).\n10      GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Based on this premise, it follows that the same knowl\u00ad\nedge is needed for induced infringement under \u00a7271(b). As\nnoted, the two provisions have a common origin in the pre\u00ad\n1952 understanding of contributory infringement, and the\nlanguage of the two provisions creates the same difficult\ninterpretive choice. It would thus be strange to hold that\nknowledge of the relevant patent is needed under \u00a7271(c)\nbut not under \u00a7271(b).\n  Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringement\nunder \u00a7271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts\nconstitute patent infringement.\n                              III\n  Returning to Pentalpha\u2019s principal challenge, we agree\nthat deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent\nexists is not the appropriate standard under \u00a7271(b). We\nnevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nbecause the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to\nsupport a finding of Pentalpha\u2019s knowledge under the\ndoctrine of willful blindness.\n                             A\n  The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in\ncriminal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a\ndefendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts apply\u00ad\ning the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants\ncannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately\nshielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts\nthat are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The\ntraditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants\nwho behave in this manner are just as culpable as those\nwho have actual knowledge. Edwards, The Criminal\nDegrees of Knowledge, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954)\n(hereinafter Edwards) (observing on the basis of English\nauthorities that \u201cup to the present day, no real doubt has\nbeen cast on the proposition that [willful blindness] is as\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nculpable as actual knowledge\u201d). It is also said that per\u00ad\nsons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof\nof critical facts in effect have actual knowledge of those\nfacts. See United States v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697, 700 (CA9\n1976) (en banc).\n   This Court\u2019s opinion more than a century ago in Spurr\nv. United States, 174 U. S. 728 (1899),6 while not using the\nterm \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d endorsed a similar concept. The\ncase involved a criminal statute that prohibited a bank\nofficer from \u201cwillfully\u201d certifying a check drawn against\ninsufficient funds. We said that a willful violation would\noccur \u201cif the [bank] officer purposely keeps himself in\nignorance of whether the drawer has money in the bank.\u201d\nId., at 735. Following our decision in Spurr, several fed\u00ad\neral prosecutions in the first half of the 20th century\ninvoked the doctrine of willful blindness.7 Later, a 1962\nproposed draft of the Model Penal Code, which has since\nbecome official, attempted to incorporate the doctrine by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  doctrine emerged in English law almost four decades earlier\nand became firmly established by the end of the 19th century. Edwards\n298\u2013301. In American law, one of the earliest references to the doctrine\nappears in an 1882 jury charge in a federal prosecution. In the charge,\nthe trial judge rejected the \u201cgreat misapprehension\u201d that a person may\n\u201cclose his eyes, when he pleases, upon all sources of information, and\nthen excuse his ignorance by saying that he does not see anything.\u201d\nSee United States v. Houghton, 14 F. 544, 547 (DC NJ).\n   7 United States v. Yasser, 114 F. 2d 558, 560 (CA3 1940) (interpreting\n\nthe crime of knowingly and fraudulently concealing property belonging\nto the estate of a bankrupt debtor to include someone who \u201cclosed his\neyes to facts which made the existence of\u201d the receiver or trustee\n\u201cobvious\u201d); Rachmil v.

Our Court has\nused the Code\u2019s definition as a guide in analyzing whether\ncertain statutory presumptions of knowledge comported\nwith due process. See Turner v. United States, 396 U. S.\n398, 416\u2013417 (1970); Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6,\n46\u201347, and n. 93 (1969). And every Court of Appeals\u2014\nwith the possible exception of the District of Columbia\nCircuit, see n. 9, infra\u2014has fully embraced willful blind\u00ad\nness, applying the doctrine to a wide range of criminal\nstatutes.\n   Given the long history of willful blindness and its wide\nacceptance in the Federal Judiciary, we can see no reason\nwhy the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for\ninduced patent infringement under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b).8\n   Pentalpha urges us not to take this step, arguing that\n\u00a7271(b) demands more than willful blindness with respect\nto the induced acts that constitute infringement. See\nReply Brief for Petitioners 13\u201314. This question, however,\nis not at issue here. There is no need to invoke the doc\u00ad\ntrine of willful blindness to establish that Pentalpha knew\nthat the retailers who purchased its fryer were selling that\nproduct in the American market; Pentalpha was indis\u00ad\nputably aware that its customers were selling its product\nin this country.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Unlike  the dissent, we do not think that utilitarian concerns de\u00ad\nmand a stricter standard for knowledge under \u00a7271(b), see post, at 3\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).

Reply Brief for Petitioners 14 (citing Brief for\nUnited States, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u2013480, pp. 29\u201330). But the\nCourt had no need to consider the doctrine of willful\nblindness in that case because the Court found ample\nevidence that Grokster and StreamCast were fully\naware\u2014in the ordinary sense of the term\u2014that their file\u00ad\nsharing software was routinely used in carrying out the\nacts that constituted infringement (the unauthorized\nsharing of copyrighted works) and that these acts violated\nthe rights of copyright holders. See 545 U.

A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements give willful blindness an appropriately\nlimited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.\nUnder this formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one\nwho takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high\nprobability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to\nhave actually known the critical facts. See G. Williams,\nCriminal Law \u00a757, p. 159 (2d ed. 1961) (\u201cA court can prop\u00ad\nerly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said\nthat the defendant actually knew\u201d). By contrast, a reck\u00ad\nless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial\nand unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, see ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a72.02(2)(c) (1985), and a negligent defendant is\none who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact,\ndid not, see \u00a72.02(2)(d).\n   The test applied by the Federal Circuit in this case\ndeparts from the proper willful blindness standard in two\nimportant respects. First, it permits a finding of knowl\u00ad\nedge when there is merely a \u201cknown risk\u201d that the induced\nacts are infringing. Second, in demanding only \u201cdeliberate\nindifference\u201d to that risk, the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does\nnot require active efforts by an inducer to avoid knowing\nabout the infringing nature of the activities.\n   In spite of these flaws, we believe that the evidence\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for\nSEB is sufficient under the correct standard. The jury\ncould have easily found that before April 1998 Pentalpha\nwillfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of the sales\nit encouraged Sunbeam to make.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1042, 1044 (CA8 2004) (\u201cIgnorance is deliberate if the defendant was\npresented with facts that put her on notice that criminal activity was\nparticularly likely and yet she intentionally failed to investigate those\nfacts\u201d); United States v.

App. to Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 49. As one would expect with any superior\nproduct, sales of SEB\u2019s fryer had been growing for some\ntime. Ibid. Pentalpha knew all of this, for its CEO and\npresident, John Sham, testified that, in developing a\nproduct for Sunbeam, Pentalpha performed \u201cmarket re\u00ad\nsearch\u201d and \u201cgather[ed] information as much as possible.\u201d\nApp. 23a. Pentalpha\u2019s belief that SEB\u2019s fryer embodied\nadvanced technology that would be valuable in the U. S.\nmarket is evidenced by its decision to copy all but the\ncosmetic features of SEB\u2019s fryer.\n  Also revealing is Pentalpha\u2019s decision to copy an over\u00ad\nseas model of SEB\u2019s fryer. Pentalpha knew that the prod\u00ad\nuct it was designing was for the U. S. market, and Sham\u2014\nhimself a named inventor on numerous U. S. patents, see\nid., at 78a\u201386a\u2014was well aware that products made for\noverseas markets usually do not bear U. S. patent mark\u00ad\nings, App. in No. 2009\u20131099 etc. (CA Fed.), pp. A\u20131904 to\nA\u20131906. Even more telling is Sham\u2019s decision not to in\u00ad\nform the attorney from whom Pentalpha sought a right-to\u00ad\nuse opinion that the product to be evaluated was simply a\nknockoff of SEB\u2019s deep fryer. On the facts of this case, we\ncannot fathom what motive Sham could have had for\nwithholding this information other than to manufacture a\nclaim of plausible deniability in the event that his com\u00ad\npany was later accused of patent infringement. Nor does\nSham\u2019s testimony on this subject provide any reason to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndard we set out today, see App. to Brief for Respondent 26\u201327, and\nPentalpha asks us to remand the case so it can move for a new trial.\nWe reject that request. Pentalpha did not challenge the jury instruc\u00ad\ntions in the Court of Appeals, see Brief for Appellants in No. 2009\u20131099\netc. (CA Fed.), pp. 21\u201322, and that court did not pass upon the issue.\nFinding no \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances in this case, we follow our usual\ncourse and refuse to consider the issue.

S. C. \u00a7271(b) must be read in tandem with \u00a7271(c), and\ntherefore that to induce infringement a defendant must\nknow \u201cthe induced acts constitute patent infringement.\u201d\nAnte, at 10.\n  Yet the Court does more. Having interpreted the stat\nute to require a showing of knowledge, the Court holds\nthat willful blindness will suffice. This is a mistaken step.\nWillful blindness is not knowledge; and judges should not\nbroaden a legislative proscription by analogy. See United\nStates v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697, 706 (CA9 1976) (en banc)\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhen a statute specifically\nrequires knowledge as an element of a crime, however, the\nsubstitution of some other state of mind cannot be justified\neven if the court deems that both are equally blamewor\nthy\u201d) In my respectful submission, the Court is incorrect\nin the definition it now adopts; but even on its own terms\nthe Court should remand to the Court of Appeals to con\nsider in the first instance whether there is sufficient evi\ndence of knowledge to support the jury\u2019s finding of\ninducement.\n  The Court invokes willful blindness to bring those who\nlack knowledge within \u00a7271(b)\u2019s prohibition.

A.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nCulpability\u201d Thesis: A Study of the Deeper Significance of\nthe Principle of Legality, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 29, 35; see also\nL. Alexander & K. Ferzan, Crime and Culpability: A The\nory of Criminal Law 34\u201335 (2009) (cautioning against\nthe temptation to \u201cdistort\u201d cases of willful blindness \u201cinto\ncases of knowledge\u201d); G. Williams, Criminal Law: The\nGeneral Part \u00a757, p. 157 (2d ed. 1961). The Court\u2019s defini\ntion of willful blindness reveals this basic purpose. One\ncan believe that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that acts\nmight infringe a patent but nonetheless conclude they do\nnot infringe. Ante, at 14; see also ibid. (describing a will\nfully blind defendant as one \u201cwho can almost be said\nto have actually known the critical facts\u201d). The alleged\ninducer who believes a device is noninfringing cannot be\nsaid to know otherwise.\n   The Court justifies its substitution of willful blindness\nfor the statutory knowledge requirement in two ways,\nneither of which is convincing.\n   First, the Court appeals to moral theory by citing the\n\u201ctraditional rationale\u201d that willfully blind defendants \u201care\njust as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But the moral question is a difficult one. Is it\ntrue that the lawyer who knowingly suborns perjury is no\nmore culpable than the lawyer who avoids learning that\nhis client, a criminal defendant, lies when he testifies that\nhe was not the shooter? See Hellman, Willfully Blind\nfor Good Reason, 3 Crim. L. & Philosophy 301, 305\u2013308\n(2009); Luban, Contrived Ignorance, 87 Geo. L. J. 957\n(1999). The answer is not obvious. Perhaps the culpabil\nity of willful blindness depends on a person\u2019s reasons for\nremaining blind. E.g., ibid. Or perhaps only the person\u2019s\njustification for his conduct is relevant. E.g., Alexander &\nFerzan, supra, at 23\u201368. This is a question of morality\nand of policy best left to the political branches. Even if\none were to accept the substitution of equally blamewor\nthy mental states in criminal cases in light of the retribu\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntive purposes of the criminal law, those purposes have no\nforce in the domain of patent law that controls in this case.\nThe Constitution confirms that the purpose of the patent\nlaw is a utilitarian one, to \u201cpromote the Progress of Sci\nence and useful Arts,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.\n   Second, the Court appeals to precedent, noting that\na \u201csimilar concept\u201d to willful blindness appears in this\nCourt\u2019s cases as early as 1899. Ante, at 11. But this Court\nhas never before held that willful blindness can substitute\nfor a statutory requirement of knowledge. Spurr v. United\nStates, 174 U. S. 728, 735 (1899), explained that \u201cevil\ndesign may be presumed if the [bank] officer purposefully\nkeeps himself in ignorance of whether the drawer has\nmoney in the bank or not, or is grossly indifferent to his\nduty in respect to the ascertainment of that fact.\u201d The\nquestion in Spurr was whether the defendant\u2019s admitted\nviolation was willful, and with this sentence the Court\nsimply explained that wrongful intent may be inferred\nfrom the circumstances. It did not suggest that blindness\ncan substitute for knowledge. Neither did Turner v.\nUnited States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970), or Leary v. United\nStates, 395 U. S. 6 (1969). As the Court here explains,\nboth cases held only that certain statutory presumptions\nof knowledge were consistent with due process. Ante, at\n12. And although most Courts of Appeals have embraced\nwillful blindness, counting courts in a circuit split is not\nthis Court\u2019s usual method for deciding important ques\ntions of law.\n   The Court appears to endorse the willful blindness\ndoctrine here for all federal criminal cases involving\nknowledge. It does so in a civil case where it has received\nno briefing or argument from the criminal defense bar,\nwhich might have provided important counsel on this\ndifficult issue.\n   There is no need to invoke willful blindness for the first\ntime in this case. Facts that support willful blindness are\n4        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\noften probative of actual knowledge. Circumstantial facts\nlike these tend to be the only available evidence in any\nevent, for the jury lacks direct access to the defendant\u2019s\nmind. The jury must often infer knowledge from conduct,\nand attempts to eliminate evidence of knowledge may\njustify such inference, as where an accused inducer avoids\nfurther confirming what he already believes with good\nreason to be true. The majority\u2019s decision to expand the\nstatute\u2019s scope appears to depend on the unstated premise\nthat knowledge requires certainty, but the law often per\nmits probabilistic judgments to count as knowledge. Cf.\nConnecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Lathrop, 111 U. S. 612,\n620 (1884) (Harlan, J.) (\u201c[B]eing founded on actual obser\nvation, and being consistent with common experience and\nthe ordinary manifestations of the condition of the mind, it\nis knowledge, so far as the human intellect can acquire\nknowledge, upon such subjects\u201d).\n   The instant dispute provides a case in point. Pentalpha\ncopied an innovative fryer. The model it copied bore no\nU. S. patent markings, but that could not have been a\nsurprise, for Pentalpha knew that a fryer purchased in\nHong Kong was unlikely to bear such markings. And\nPentalpha failed to tell the lawyer who ran a patent\nsearch that it copied the SEB fryer. These facts may\nsuggest knowledge that Pentalpha\u2019s fryers were infring\ning, and perhaps a jury could so find.\n   But examining the sufficiency of the evidence presented\nin the 5-day trial requires careful review of an extensive\nrecord. The trial transcript alone spans over 1,000 pages.\nIf willful blindness is as close to knowledge and as far\nfrom the \u201cknew or should have known\u201d jury instruction\nprovided in this case as the Court suggests, then review\ning the record becomes all the more difficult. I would\nleave that task to the Court of Appeals in the first in\nstance on remand.\n   For these reasons, and with respect, I dissent.\n",

A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u20136. Argued February 23, 2011\u2014Decided May 31, 2011\nAfter respondent SEB invented an innovative deep fryer, obtained a\n  U. S. patent for its design, and began selling its fryer in this country,\n  Sunbeam Products, Inc., asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises,\n  Ltd., a Hong Kong home appliance maker and wholly owned subsidi\n  ary of petitioner Global-Tech Appliances, Inc., to supply Sunbeam\n  with deep fryers meeting certain specifications. Pentalpha purchased\n  an SEB fryer that was made for sale in a foreign market and thus\n  lacked U. S. patent markings, copied all but the fryer\u2019s cosmetic fea\n  tures, and retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use study with\n  out telling him it had copied directly from SEB\u2019s design. Failing to\n  locate SEB\u2019s patent, the attorney issued an opinion letter stating that\n  Pentalpha\u2019s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had\n  found. Pentalpha then started selling its fryers to Sunbeam, which\n  resold them in this country under its own trademarks at a price that\n  undercut SEB\u2019s.\n     SEB then sued Sunbeam for patent infringement. Though Sun\n  beam notified Pentalpha of the lawsuit, Pentalpha went on to sell its\n  fryers to other companies, which resold them in the U. S. market un\n  der their respective trademarks. After settling the Sunbeam lawsuit,\n  SEB sued Pentalpha, asserting, as relevant here, that it had contra\n  vened 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(b) by actively inducing Sunbeam and the\n  other purchasers of Pentalpha fryers to sell or offer to sell them in\n  violation of SEB\u2019s patent rights. The jury found for SEB on the in\n  duced infringement theory, and the District Court entered judgment\n  for SEB. Affirming, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in\n  fringement under \u00a7271(b) requires a showing that the alleged in\n  fringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce ac\n  tual infringements; declared that this showing includes proof that the\n2           GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    alleged infringer knew of the patent; held that, although there was\n    no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of SEB\u2019s patent before it re\n    ceived notice of the Sunbeam suit, there was adequate proof that it\n    deliberately disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat\n    ent; and said that such disregard is not different from, but a form of,\n    actual knowledge.\nHeld:\n    1. Induced infringement under \u00a7271(b) requires knowledge that the\n induced acts constitute patent infringement. Pp. 3\u201310.\n       (a) Section 271(b)\u2019s text\u2014\u201c[w]hoever actively induces infringe\n ment of a patent shall be liable as an infringer\u201d\u2014is ambiguous as to\n the intent needed to impose liability. In referring to a party that \u201cin\n duces infringement,\u201d the provision may require merely that the in\n ducer must lead another to engage in conduct that happens to\n amount to infringement. On the other hand, the reference to a party\n that \u201cinduces infringement\u201d may also be read to mean that the in\n ducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer\n knows is infringement. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) Like \u00a7271(b)\u2019s language, the pre-1952 case law is susceptible\n to conflicting interpretations. However, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible\n Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476 (Aro II), resolves the question at\n issue. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of\n indirect liability in the pre-1952 case law, but was treated as evi\n dence of \u201ccontributory infringement,\u201d i.e., the aiding and abetting of\n direct infringement by another party. When Congress enacted \u00a7271,\n it separated the contributory infringement concept into two catego\n ries: induced infringement, covered by \u00a7271(b), and sale of a compo\n nent of a patented invention, covered by \u00a7271(c). In the badly frac\n tured Aro II decision, a majority concluded that a violator of \u00a7271(c)\n must know \u201cthat the combination for which his component was espe\n cially designed was both patented and infringing.\u201d 377 U. S., at 488.\n That conclusion, now a fixture in the law, compels this same knowl\n edge for liability under \u00a7271(b), given that the two provisions have a\n common origin and create the same difficult interpretive choice. Pp.\n 8\u201310.\n    2. Deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does\n not satisfy the knowledge required by \u00a7271(b). Nevertheless, the\n Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment must be affirmed because the evidence in\n this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalpha\u2019s\n knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness. Pp. 10\u201316.\n       (a) The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in crimi\n nal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted\n knowingly or willfully, and courts applying the doctrine have held\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliber\n  ately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that\n  are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The traditional ration\n  ale for the doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are\n  just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge. This Court en\n  dorsed a concept similar to willful blindness over a century ago in\n  Spurr v. United States, 174 U. S. 728, 735, and every Federal Court\n  of Appeals but one has fully embraced willful blindness. Given the\n  doctrine's long history and wide acceptance in the Federal Judiciary,\n  there is no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits\n  for induced patent infringement under \u00a7271(b). Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (b) Although the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of will\n  ful blindness in slightly different ways, all agree on two basic re\n  quirements. First, the defendant must subjectively believe that there\n  is a high probability that a fact exists. Second, the defendant must\n  take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact. These require\n  ments give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that sur\n  passes recklessness and negligence. Pp. 13\u201314.\n       (c) Although the Federal Circuit\u2019s test departs from the proper\n  willful blindness standard in important respects, the evidence when\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for SEB was suffi\n  cient under the correct standard. Pentalpha believed that SEB\u2019s\n  fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the\n  U. S. market as evidenced by its decision to copy all but the fryer\u2019s\n  cosmetic features. Also revealing is Pentalpha\u2019s decision to copy an\n  overseas model of SEB\u2019s fryer, aware that it would not bear U. S.\n  patent markings. Even more telling is Pentalpha\u2019s decision not to in\n  form its attorney that the product to be evaluated was simply a\n  knockoff of SEB\u2019s fryer. Taken together, the evidence was more than\n  sufficient for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed there\n  was a high probability that SEB\u2019s fryer was patented and took delib\n  erate steps to avoid knowing that fact, and that it therefore willfully\n  blinded itself to the infringing nature of Sunbeam\u2019s sales.

A., a French maker of\nhome appliances. In the late 1980\u2019s, SEB invented a \u201ccool\u00ad\ntouch\u201d deep fryer, that is, a deep fryer for home use with\nexternal surfaces that remain cool during the frying proc\u00ad\ness. The cool-touch deep fryer consisted of a metal frying\npot surrounded by a plastic outer housing. Attached to the\nhousing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and\ninsulated the housing from heat by separating it from the\npot, creating air space between the two components. SEB\nobtained a U. S. patent for its design in 1991, and some\u00ad\ntime later, SEB started manufacturing the cool-touch fryer\nand selling it in this country under its well-known \u201cT-Fal\u201d\nbrand. Superior to other products in the American market\nat the time, SEB\u2019s fryer was a commercial success.\n2             GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1997, Sunbeam Products, Inc., a U. S. competitor of\nSEB, asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., to\nsupply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.\nPentalpha is a Hong Kong maker of home appliances and\na wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Ap\u00ad\npliances, Inc.1\n   In order to develop a deep fryer for Sunbeam, Pentalpha\npurchased an SEB fryer in Hong Kong and copied all but\nits cosmetic features. Because the SEB fryer bought in\nHong Kong was made for sale in a foreign market, it bore\nno U. S. patent markings. After copying SEB\u2019s design,\nPentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use\nstudy, but Pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney\nthat its design was copied directly from SEB\u2019s.\n   The attorney failed to locate SEB\u2019s patent, and in Au\u00ad\ngust 1997 he issued an opinion letter stating that Pental\u00ad\npha\u2019s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he\nhad found. That same month, Pentalpha started selling\nits deep fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in the\nUnited States under its trademarks. By obtaining its\nproduct from a manufacturer with lower production costs,\nSunbeam was able to undercut SEB in the U. S. market.\n   After SEB\u2019s customers started defecting to Sunbeam,\nSEB sued Sunbeam in March 1998, alleging that Sun\u00ad\nbeam\u2019s sales infringed SEB\u2019s patent. Sunbeam notified\nPentalpha of the lawsuit the following month. Unde\u00ad\nterred, Pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to Fingerhut\nCorp. and Montgomery Ward & Co., both of which resold\nthem in the United States under their respective trade\u00ad\nmarks.\n   SEB settled the lawsuit with Sunbeam, and then sued\nPentalpha, asserting two theories of recovery: First, SEB\nclaimed that Pentalpha had directly infringed SEB\u2019s\npatent in violation of 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(a), by selling or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 We   refer to both petitioners as \u201cPentalpha.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noffering to sell its deep fryers; and second, SEB claimed\nthat Pentalpha had contravened \u00a7271(b) by actively induc\u00ad\ning Sunbeam, Fingerhut, and Montgomery Ward to sell or\nto offer to sell Pentalpha\u2019s deep fryers in violation of SEB\u2019s\npatent rights.\n   Following a 5-day trial, the jury found for SEB on both\ntheories and also found that Pentalpha\u2019s infringement had\nbeen willful. Pentalpha filed post-trial motions seeking\na new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several\ngrounds. As relevant here, Pentalpha argued that there\nwas insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of\ninduced infringement under \u00a7271(b) because Pentalpha\ndid not actually know of SEB\u2019s patent until it received the\nnotice of the Sunbeam lawsuit in April 1998.\n   The District Court rejected Pentalpha\u2019s argument, as\ndid the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which\naffirmed the judgment, SEB S. A. v. Montgomery Ward &\nCo., 594 F. 3d 1360 (2010). Summarizing a recent en banc\ndecision, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in\u00ad\nfringement under \u00a7271(b) requires a \u201cplaintiff [to] show\nthat the alleged infringer knew or should have known\nthat his actions would induce actual infringements\u201d and\nthat this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer\nknew of the patent. Id., at 1376. Although the record\ncontained no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of\nSEB\u2019s patent before April 1998, the court found adequate\nevidence to support a finding that \u201cPentalpha deliberately\ndisregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat\u00ad\nent.\u201d Id., at 1377. Such disregard, the court said, \u201cis not\ndifferent from actual knowledge, but is a form of actual\nknowledge.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                           II\n  Pentalpha argues that active inducement liability under\n\u00a7271(b) requires more than deliberate indifference to a\n4        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown risk that the induced acts may violate an existing\npatent. Instead, Pentalpha maintains, actual knowledge\nof the patent is needed.\n                                A\n   In assessing Pentalpha\u2019s argument, we begin with the\ntext of \u00a7271(b)\u2014which is short, simple, and, with respect\nto the question presented in this case, inconclusive. Sec\u00ad\ntion 271(b) states: \u201cWhoever actively induces infringement\nof a patent shall be liable as an infringer.\u201d\n   Although the text of \u00a7271(b) makes no mention of intent,\nwe infer that at least some intent is required. The term\n\u201cinduce\u201d means \u201c[t]o lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to\nmove by persuasion or influence.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Interna\u00ad\ntional Dictionary 1269 (2d ed. 1945). The addition of the\nadverb \u201cactively\u201d suggests that the inducement must\ninvolve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the\ndesired result, see id., at 27.\n   When a person actively induces another to take some\naction, the inducer obviously knows the action that he or\nshe wishes to bring about. If a used car salesman induces\na customer to buy a car, the salesman knows that the\ndesired result is the purchase of the car. But what if it\nis said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a\ndamaged car? Does this mean merely that the salesman\ninduced the customer to purchase a car that happened to\nbe damaged, a fact of which the salesman may have been\nunaware? Or does this mean that the salesman knew that\nthe car was damaged? The statement that the salesman\ninduced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.\n   So is \u00a7271(b). In referring to a party that \u201cinduces\ninfringement,\u201d this provision may require merely that the\ninducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to\namount to infringement, i.e., the making, using, offering to\nsell, selling, or importing of a patented invention.

Both readings are\npossible.\n                              B\n   Finding no definitive answer in the statutory text, we\nturn to the case law that predates the enactment of \u00a7271\nas part the Patent Act of 1952. As we recognized in Aro\nMfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476\n(1964) (Aro II), \u201c[t]he section was designed to \u2018codify in\nstatutory form principles of contributory infringement\u2019\nwhich had been \u2018part of our law for about 80 years.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 485\u2013486, n. 6 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong.,\n2d Sess., 9 (1952)).\n   Unfortunately, the relevant pre-1952 cases are less clear\nthan one might hope with respect to the question pre\u00ad\nsented here. Before 1952, both the conduct now covered\nby \u00a7271(b) (induced infringement) and the conduct now\naddressed by \u00a7271(c) (sale of a component of a patented\ninvention) were viewed as falling within the overarching\nconcept of \u201ccontributory infringement.\u201d Cases in the latter\ncategory\u2014i.e., cases in which a party sold an item that\nwas not itself covered by the claims of a patent but that\nenabled another party to make or use a patented machine,\nprocess, or combination\u2014were more common.\n   The pre-1952 case law provides conflicting signals re\u00ad\ngarding the intent needed in such cases. In an oft-cited\ndecision, then-Judge Taft suggested that it was sufficient\nif the seller of the component part intended that the part\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Direct infringement has long been understood to require no more\n\nthan the unauthorized use of a patented invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v.\nConvertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 484 (1964); 3 A. Deller,\nWalker on Patents \u00a7453, p. 1684 (1937) (hereinafter Deller). Thus, a\ndirect infringer\u2019s knowledge or intent is irrelevant.\n6          GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S.

In Aro II, a majority\nheld that a violator of \u00a7271(c) must know \u201cthat the combi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The earlier case of Cortelyou v. Charles Eneu Johnson & Co., 207\n\nU. S. 196 (1907), contains language that may be read as adopting a\nsimilar position. In that case, the Neostyle Company had a patent for\na \u201cstencil duplicating machine\u201d called the \u201crotary Neostyle,\u201d and it\nlicensed the use of its machine pursuant to a license requiring the\nlicensee to use only Neostyle\u2019s ink. Id., at 198. Another company,\nCharles Eneu Johnson & Co., sold its ink to a Neostyle licensee, and\nNeostyle sued the Johnson company, claiming that it was \u201cinducing a\nbreach of the license contracts\u201d and was thus indirectly infringing\nNeostyle\u2019s patent rights. Id., at 199. The Court held that the defen\u00ad\ndant did not have \u201csufficient evidence of notice\u201d to support liability.\nThe Court wrote:\n\u201cTrue, the defendant filled a few orders for ink to be used on a rotary\nNeostyle, but it does not appear that it ever solicited an order for ink to\nbe so used, that it was ever notified by the plaintiffs of the rights which\nthey claimed, or that anything which it did was considered by them an\ninfringement upon those rights.\u201d Id., at 200 (emphasis added).\n   The italicized language above may suggest that it was necessary to\nshow that the defendants had notice of Neostyle\u2019s patent rights.

SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnation for which his component was especially designed\nwas both patented and infringing,\u201d 377 U. S., at 488, and\nas we explain below, that conclusion compels this same\nknowledge for liability under \u00a7271(b).\n                             C\n  As noted above, induced infringement was not consid\u00ad\nered a separate theory of indirect liability in the pre-1952\ncase law. Rather, it was treated as evidence of \u201ccontribu\u00ad\ntory infringement,\u201d that is, the aiding and abetting of\ndirect infringement by another party. See Lemley, In\u00ad\nducing Patent Infringement, 39 U. C. D. L. Rev. 225, 227\n(2005). When Congress enacted \u00a7271, it separated what\nhad previously been regarded as contributory infringe\u00ad\nment into two categories, one covered by \u00a7271(b) and the\nother covered by \u00a7271(c).\n  Aro II concerned \u00a7271(c), which states in relevant part:\n      \u201cWhoever offers to sell or sells . . . a component of a\n    patented [invention] . . . , constituting a material part\n    of the invention, knowing the same to be especially\n    made or especially adapted for use in an infringement\n    of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity\n    of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing\n    use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.\u201d (Em\u00ad\n    phasis added.)\nThis language contains exactly the same ambiguity as\n\u00a7271(b). The phrase \u201cknowing [a component] to be espe\u00ad\ncially made or especially adapted for use in an infringe\u00ad\nment\u201d may be read to mean that a violator must know\nthat the component is \u201cespecially adapted for use\u201d in a\nproduct that happens to infringe a patent. Or the phrase\nmay be read to require, in addition, knowledge of the\npatent\u2019s existence.\n  This question closely divided the Aro II Court. In a\nbadly fractured decision, a majority concluded that knowl\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nedge of the patent was needed. 377 U. S., at 488, and n. 8;\nid., at 514 (White, J., concurring); id., at 524\u2013527 (Black,\nJ., dissenting).5 Justice Black\u2019s opinion, which explained\nthe basis for the majority\u2019s view, concluded that the lan\u00ad\nguage of \u00a7271(c) supported this interpretation. See id., at\n525. His opinion also relied on an amendment to this\nlanguage that was adopted when the bill was in commit\u00ad\ntee. Id., at 525\u2013527.\n   Four Justices disagreed with this interpretation and\nwould have held that a violator of \u00a7271(c) need know only\nthat the component is specially adapted for use in a prod\u00ad\nuct that happens to infringe a patent. See id., at 488\u2013490,\nn. 8. These Justices thought that this reading was sup\u00ad\nported by the language of \u00a7271(c) and the pre-1952 case\nlaw, and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the\nmajority from the amendment of \u00a7271(c)\u2019s language. Ibid.\n   While there is much to be said in favor of both views\nexpressed in Aro II, the \u201cholding in Aro II has become\na fixture in the law of contributory infringement under\n[section] 271(c),\u201d 5 R. Moy, Walker on Patents \u00a715:20,\np. 15\u2013131 (4th ed. 2009)\u2014so much so that SEB has not\nasked us to overrule it, see Brief for Respondent 19, n. 3.\nNor has Congress seen fit to alter \u00a7271(c)\u2019s intent re\u00ad\nquirement in the nearly half a century since Aro II was\ndecided. In light of the \u201c \u2018special force\u2019 \u201d of the doctrine of\nstare decisis with regard to questions of statutory inter\u00ad\npretation, see John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,\n552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008), we proceed on the premise that\n\u00a7271(c) requires knowledge of the existence of the patent\nthat is infringed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although Justice Black disagreed with the judgment and was thus\n\nin dissent, he was in the majority with respect to the interpretation of\n\u00a7271(c), and his opinion sets out the reasoning of the majority on this\npoint. Three other Justices joined his opinion, and a fourth, Justice\nWhite, endorsed his reasoning with respect to the interpretation of\n\u00a7271(c). See 377 U. S., at 514 (White, J., concurring).\n10      GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Based on this premise, it follows that the same knowl\u00ad\nedge is needed for induced infringement under \u00a7271(b). As\nnoted, the two provisions have a common origin in the pre\u00ad\n1952 understanding of contributory infringement, and the\nlanguage of the two provisions creates the same difficult\ninterpretive choice. It would thus be strange to hold that\nknowledge of the relevant patent is needed under \u00a7271(c)\nbut not under \u00a7271(b).\n  Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringement\nunder \u00a7271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts\nconstitute patent infringement.\n                              III\n  Returning to Pentalpha\u2019s principal challenge, we agree\nthat deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent\nexists is not the appropriate standard under \u00a7271(b). We\nnevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nbecause the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to\nsupport a finding of Pentalpha\u2019s knowledge under the\ndoctrine of willful blindness.\n                             A\n  The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in\ncriminal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a\ndefendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts apply\u00ad\ning the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants\ncannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately\nshielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts\nthat are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The\ntraditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants\nwho behave in this manner are just as culpable as those\nwho have actual knowledge. Edwards, The Criminal\nDegrees of Knowledge, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954)\n(hereinafter Edwards) (observing on the basis of English\nauthorities that \u201cup to the present day, no real doubt has\nbeen cast on the proposition that [willful blindness] is as\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nculpable as actual knowledge\u201d). It is also said that per\u00ad\nsons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof\nof critical facts in effect have actual knowledge of those\nfacts. See United States v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697, 700 (CA9\n1976) (en banc).\n   This Court\u2019s opinion more than a century ago in Spurr\nv. United States, 174 U. S. 728 (1899),6 while not using the\nterm \u201cwillful blindness,\u201d endorsed a similar concept. The\ncase involved a criminal statute that prohibited a bank\nofficer from \u201cwillfully\u201d certifying a check drawn against\ninsufficient funds. We said that a willful violation would\noccur \u201cif the [bank] officer purposely keeps himself in\nignorance of whether the drawer has money in the bank.\u201d\nId., at 735. Following our decision in Spurr, several fed\u00ad\neral prosecutions in the first half of the 20th century\ninvoked the doctrine of willful blindness.7 Later, a 1962\nproposed draft of the Model Penal Code, which has since\nbecome official, attempted to incorporate the doctrine by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The  doctrine emerged in English law almost four decades earlier\nand became firmly established by the end of the 19th century. Edwards\n298\u2013301. In American law, one of the earliest references to the doctrine\nappears in an 1882 jury charge in a federal prosecution. In the charge,\nthe trial judge rejected the \u201cgreat misapprehension\u201d that a person may\n\u201cclose his eyes, when he pleases, upon all sources of information, and\nthen excuse his ignorance by saying that he does not see anything.\u201d\nSee United States v.

Our Court has\nused the Code\u2019s definition as a guide in analyzing whether\ncertain statutory presumptions of knowledge comported\nwith due process. See Turner v. United States, 396 U. S.\n398, 416\u2013417 (1970); Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6,\n46\u201347, and n. 93 (1969). And every Court of Appeals\u2014\nwith the possible exception of the District of Columbia\nCircuit, see n. 9, infra\u2014has fully embraced willful blind\u00ad\nness, applying the doctrine to a wide range of criminal\nstatutes.\n   Given the long history of willful blindness and its wide\nacceptance in the Federal Judiciary, we can see no reason\nwhy the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits for\ninduced patent infringement under 35 U.

See\nReply Brief for Petitioners 13\u201314. This question, however,\nis not at issue here. There is no need to invoke the doc\u00ad\ntrine of willful blindness to establish that Pentalpha knew\nthat the retailers who purchased its fryer were selling that\nproduct in the American market; Pentalpha was indis\u00ad\nputably aware that its customers were selling its product\nin this country.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Unlike  the dissent, we do not think that utilitarian concerns de\u00ad\nmand a stricter standard for knowledge under \u00a7271(b), see post, at 3\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).

Reply Brief for Petitioners 14 (citing Brief for\nUnited States, O. T. 2004, No. 04\u2013480, pp. 29\u201330). But the\nCourt had no need to consider the doctrine of willful\nblindness in that case because the Court found ample\nevidence that Grokster and StreamCast were fully\naware\u2014in the ordinary sense of the term\u2014that their file\u00ad\nsharing software was routinely used in carrying out the\nacts that constituted infringement (the unauthorized\nsharing of copyrighted works) and that these acts violated\nthe rights of copyright holders. See 545 U.

A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements give willful blindness an appropriately\nlimited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.\nUnder this formulation, a willfully blind defendant is one\nwho takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high\nprobability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to\nhave actually known the critical facts. See G. Williams,\nCriminal Law \u00a757, p. 159 (2d ed. 1961) (\u201cA court can prop\u00ad\nerly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said\nthat the defendant actually knew\u201d). By contrast, a reck\u00ad\nless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial\nand unjustified risk of such wrongdoing, see ALI, Model\nPenal Code \u00a72.02(2)(c) (1985), and a negligent defendant is\none who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact,\ndid not, see \u00a72.02(2)(d).\n   The test applied by the Federal Circuit in this case\ndeparts from the proper willful blindness standard in two\nimportant respects. First, it permits a finding of knowl\u00ad\nedge when there is merely a \u201cknown risk\u201d that the induced\nacts are infringing. Second, in demanding only \u201cdeliberate\nindifference\u201d to that risk, the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does\nnot require active efforts by an inducer to avoid knowing\nabout the infringing nature of the activities.\n   In spite of these flaws, we believe that the evidence\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for\nSEB is sufficient under the correct standard. The jury\ncould have easily found that before April 1998 Pentalpha\nwillfully blinded itself to the infringing nature of the sales\nit encouraged Sunbeam to make.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1042, 1044 (CA8 2004) (\u201cIgnorance is deliberate if the defendant was\npresented with facts that put her on notice that criminal activity was\nparticularly likely and yet she intentionally failed to investigate those\nfacts\u201d); United States v.

App. to Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 49. As one would expect with any superior\nproduct, sales of SEB\u2019s fryer had been growing for some\ntime. Ibid. Pentalpha knew all of this, for its CEO and\npresident, John Sham, testified that, in developing a\nproduct for Sunbeam, Pentalpha performed \u201cmarket re\u00ad\nsearch\u201d and \u201cgather[ed] information as much as possible.\u201d\nApp. 23a. Pentalpha\u2019s belief that SEB\u2019s fryer embodied\nadvanced technology that would be valuable in the U. S.\nmarket is evidenced by its decision to copy all but the\ncosmetic features of SEB\u2019s fryer.\n  Also revealing is Pentalpha\u2019s decision to copy an over\u00ad\nseas model of SEB\u2019s fryer. Pentalpha knew that the prod\u00ad\nuct it was designing was for the U. S. market, and Sham\u2014\nhimself a named inventor on numerous U. S. patents, see\nid., at 78a\u201386a\u2014was well aware that products made for\noverseas markets usually do not bear U. S. patent mark\u00ad\nings, App. in No. 2009\u20131099 etc. (CA Fed.), pp. A\u20131904 to\nA\u20131906. Even more telling is Sham\u2019s decision not to in\u00ad\nform the attorney from whom Pentalpha sought a right-to\u00ad\nuse opinion that the product to be evaluated was simply a\nknockoff of SEB\u2019s deep fryer. On the facts of this case, we\ncannot fathom what motive Sham could have had for\nwithholding this information other than to manufacture a\nclaim of plausible deniability in the event that his com\u00ad\npany was later accused of patent infringement. Nor does\nSham\u2019s testimony on this subject provide any reason to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndard we set out today, see App. to Brief for Respondent 26\u201327, and\nPentalpha asks us to remand the case so it can move for a new trial.\nWe reject that request. Pentalpha did not challenge the jury instruc\u00ad\ntions in the Court of Appeals, see Brief for Appellants in No. 2009\u20131099\netc. (CA Fed.), pp. 21\u201322, and that court did not pass upon the issue.\nFinding no \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances in this case, we follow our usual\ncourse and refuse to consider the issue. See Youakim v. Miller, 425\nU. S. 231, 234 (1976) (per curiam).\n16       GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoubt that inference. Asked whether the attorney would\nhave fared better had he known of SEB\u2019s design, Sham\nwas nonresponsive. All he could say was that a patent\nsearch is not an \u201ceasy job\u201d and that is why he hired attor\u00ad\nneys to perform them. App. 112a.\n  Taken together, this evidence was more than sufficient\nfor a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed\nthere was a high probability that SEB\u2019s fryer was pat\u00ad\nented, that Pentalpha took deliberate steps to avoid know\u00ad\ning that fact, and that it therefore willfully blinded itself\nto the infringing nature of Sunbeam\u2019s sales.\n                       *   *    *\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit is\n                                              Affirmed.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. \u00a7271(b) must be read in tandem with \u00a7271(c), and\ntherefore that to induce infringement a defendant must\nknow \u201cthe induced acts constitute patent infringement.\u201d\nAnte, at 10.\n  Yet the Court does more. Having interpreted the stat\nute to require a showing of knowledge, the Court holds\nthat willful blindness will suffice. This is a mistaken step.\nWillful blindness is not knowledge; and judges should not\nbroaden a legislative proscription by analogy. See United\nStates v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697, 706 (CA9 1976) (en banc)\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhen a statute specifically\nrequires knowledge as an element of a crime, however, the\nsubstitution of some other state of mind cannot be justified\neven if the court deems that both are equally blamewor\nthy\u201d) In my respectful submission, the Court is incorrect\nin the definition it now adopts; but even on its own terms\nthe Court should remand to the Court of Appeals to con\nsider in the first instance whether there is sufficient evi\ndence of knowledge to support the jury\u2019s finding of\ninducement.\n  The Court invokes willful blindness to bring those who\nlack knowledge within \u00a7271(b)\u2019s prohibition. Husak &\nCallender, Wilful Ignorance, Knowledge, and the \u201cEqual\n2        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nCulpability\u201d Thesis: A Study of the Deeper Significance of\nthe Principle of Legality, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 29, 35; see also\nL. Alexander & K. Ferzan, Crime and Culpability: A The\nory of Criminal Law 34\u201335 (2009) (cautioning against\nthe temptation to \u201cdistort\u201d cases of willful blindness \u201cinto\ncases of knowledge\u201d); G. Williams, Criminal Law: The\nGeneral Part \u00a757, p. 157 (2d ed. 1961). The Court\u2019s defini\ntion of willful blindness reveals this basic purpose. One\ncan believe that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that acts\nmight infringe a patent but nonetheless conclude they do\nnot infringe. Ante, at 14; see also ibid. (describing a will\nfully blind defendant as one \u201cwho can almost be said\nto have actually known the critical facts\u201d). The alleged\ninducer who believes a device is noninfringing cannot be\nsaid to know otherwise.\n   The Court justifies its substitution of willful blindness\nfor the statutory knowledge requirement in two ways,\nneither of which is convincing.\n   First, the Court appeals to moral theory by citing the\n\u201ctraditional rationale\u201d that willfully blind defendants \u201care\njust as culpable as those who have actual knowledge.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But the moral question is a difficult one. Is it\ntrue that the lawyer who knowingly suborns perjury is no\nmore culpable than the lawyer who avoids learning that\nhis client, a criminal defendant, lies when he testifies that\nhe was not the shooter? See Hellman, Willfully Blind\nfor Good Reason, 3 Crim. L. & Philosophy 301, 305\u2013308\n(2009); Luban, Contrived Ignorance, 87 Geo. L. J. 957\n(1999). The answer is not obvious. Perhaps the culpabil\nity of willful blindness depends on a person\u2019s reasons for\nremaining blind. E.g., ibid. Or perhaps only the person\u2019s\njustification for his conduct is relevant. E.g., Alexander &\nFerzan, supra, at 23\u201368. This is a question of morality\nand of policy best left to the political branches. Even if\none were to accept the substitution of equally blamewor\nthy mental states in criminal cases in light of the retribu\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntive purposes of the criminal law, those purposes have no\nforce in the domain of patent law that controls in this case.\nThe Constitution confirms that the purpose of the patent\nlaw is a utilitarian one, to \u201cpromote the Progress of Sci\nence and useful Arts,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.\n   Second, the Court appeals to precedent, noting that\na \u201csimilar concept\u201d to willful blindness appears in this\nCourt\u2019s cases as early as 1899. Ante, at 11. But this Court\nhas never before held that willful blindness can substitute\nfor a statutory requirement of knowledge. Spurr v. United\nStates, 174 U. S. 728, 735 (1899), explained that \u201cevil\ndesign may be presumed if the [bank] officer purposefully\nkeeps himself in ignorance of whether the drawer has\nmoney in the bank or not, or is grossly indifferent to his\nduty in respect to the ascertainment of that fact.\u201d The\nquestion in Spurr was whether the defendant\u2019s admitted\nviolation was willful, and with this sentence the Court\nsimply explained that wrongful intent may be inferred\nfrom the circumstances. It did not suggest that blindness\ncan substitute for knowledge. Neither did Turner v.\nUnited States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970), or Leary v. United\nStates, 395 U. S. 6 (1969). As the Court here explains,\nboth cases held only that certain statutory presumptions\nof knowledge were consistent with due process. Ante, at\n12. And although most Courts of Appeals have embraced\nwillful blindness, counting courts in a circuit split is not\nthis Court\u2019s usual method for deciding important ques\ntions of law.\n   The Court appears to endorse the willful blindness\ndoctrine here for all federal criminal cases involving\nknowledge. It does so in a civil case where it has received\nno briefing or argument from the criminal defense bar,\nwhich might have provided important counsel on this\ndifficult issue.\n   There is no need to invoke willful blindness for the first\ntime in this case. Facts that support willful blindness are\n4        GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\noften probative of actual knowledge. Circumstantial facts\nlike these tend to be the only available evidence in any\nevent, for the jury lacks direct access to the defendant\u2019s\nmind. The jury must often infer knowledge from conduct,\nand attempts to eliminate evidence of knowledge may\njustify such inference, as where an accused inducer avoids\nfurther confirming what he already believes with good\nreason to be true. The majority\u2019s decision to expand the\nstatute\u2019s scope appears to depend on the unstated premise\nthat knowledge requires certainty, but the law often per\nmits probabilistic judgments to count as knowledge. Cf.\nConnecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Lathrop, 111 U. S. 612,\n620 (1884) (Harlan, J.) (\u201c[B]eing founded on actual obser\nvation, and being consistent with common experience and\nthe ordinary manifestations of the condition of the mind, it\nis knowledge, so far as the human intellect can acquire\nknowledge, upon such subjects\u201d).\n   The instant dispute provides a case in point. Pentalpha\ncopied an innovative fryer. The model it copied bore no\nU. S. patent markings, but that could not have been a\nsurprise, for Pentalpha knew that a fryer purchased in\nHong Kong was unlikely to bear such markings. And\nPentalpha failed to tell the lawyer who ran a patent\nsearch that it copied the SEB fryer. These facts may\nsuggest knowledge that Pentalpha\u2019s fryers were infring\ning, and perhaps a jury could so find.\n   But examining the sufficiency of the evidence presented\nin the 5-day trial requires careful review of an extensive\nrecord. The trial transcript alone spans over 1,000 pages.\nIf willful blindness is as close to knowledge and as far\nfrom the \u201cknew or should have known\u201d jury instruction\nprovided in this case as the Court suggests, then review\ning the record becomes all the more difficult. I would\nleave that task to the Court of Appeals in the first in\nstance on remand.\n   For these reasons, and with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
