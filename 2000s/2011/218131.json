VICE, AS EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF VICE, \n\n                        ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013114.     Argued March 22, 2011\u2014Decided June 6, 2011\nClaiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful\n  campaign to become the police chief of Vinton, La., petitioner Fox\n  filed a state-court suit against Vice, the incumbent chief, and the\n  town (Vice, for short). Fox\u2019s suit asserted both state-law claims, in\n  cluding defamation, and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, including interference with Fox\u2019s right to seek public office.\n  Vice removed the case to federal court based on the \u00a71983 claims. Af\n  ter discovery, he sought summary judgment on the federal claims,\n  which Fox conceded were not valid. The District Court accordingly\n  dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims\n  to state court, noting that Vice\u2019s attorneys\u2019 work could be useful in\n  the state-court proceedings. Vice then asked the federal court for at\n  torney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988, submitting attorney billing records esti\n  mating the time spent on the entire suit, without differentiating be\n  tween time spent on the now-dismissed federal claims and on the\n  remaining state claims. The court granted the motion on the ground\n  that Fox\u2019s federal claims were frivolous, awarding Fox fees for all\n  work his attorneys had performed in the suit. Although the state-law\n  allegations had not been found frivolous, the court did not require\n  Vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets\n  of claims. It also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the sur\n  viving state-law claims, noting that both sides had focused on the\n  frivolous \u00a71983 claims. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Fox\u2019s\n  argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defen\n  dant to recover any fees, and agreeing with the District Court that\n  the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.\n2                             FOX v. VICE\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. When a plaintiff\u2019s suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous\n claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only\n for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivo\n lous claims. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Section 1988 allows the award of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d\n to \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d in certain civil rights cases, including \u00a71983\n suits. While most of this Court\u2019s \u00a71988 decisions have concerned fees\n to prevailing plaintiffs, \u00a71988 also authorizes a fee award to a pre\n vailing defendant \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivo\n lous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d Christiansburg Garment\n Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421. Just as plaintiffs may receive fees\n under \u00a71988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, Hensley v.\n Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed\n for costs under \u00a71988 even if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is not wholly frivo\n lous, ibid., n. 10. The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from\n these non-frivolous charges, see Christiansburg, 434 U. S., at 420\u2013\n 421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize\n the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims im\n posed. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit\n having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Congress\u2019s purpose\n in enacting \u00a71988\u2014to relieve defendants of the burdens associated\n with fending off frivolous litigation\u2014points to the proper standard:\n Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\n incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; i.e., \u00a71988\n permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he\n would not have paid but for the frivolous claim. A standard allowing\n more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defen\n dants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely be\n cause the plaintiff\u2019s suit also included frivolous claims. This \u201cbut-for\u201d\n standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant\n for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims,\n for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work\n because of the defendant\u2019s greater financial exposure on that claim.\n The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to\n a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been in\n curred in the absence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to\n those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge,\n it is the second one that matters. The determination of fees \u201cshould\n not result in a second major litigation.\u201d Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.\n The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to\n achieve auditing perfection. The trial court has wide discretion, but\n must apply the correct but-for standard. And the appeals court must\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for\n  question, rather than some other. Pp. 7\u201311.\n     2. The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to\n  Vice. The District Court\u2019s analysis suggests that Vice\u2019s attorneys\n  would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought\n  his frivolous claims. The charges arose out of Vice\u2019s conduct in the\n  campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to\n  the non-frivolous state-law claims, his \u201cdefense entailed proof or de\n  nial of essentially the same facts.\u201d It thus seems likely that Vice\u2019s at\n  torneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions. Al\n  though the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys\u2019 work\n  in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper ac\n  count of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.\n  Its reasoning\u2014that the close relationship between the federal and\n  state-law claims supported the award\u2014cannot be squared with the\n  congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of\n  frivolous litigation. Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on\n  the proper ground. It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any\n  work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers\n  would have done that work regardless. On this record, the case must\n  be returned to the lower courts.

FOX, PETITIONER v. JUDY ANN VICE, AS\n EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OFBILLY RAY VICE, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                  [June 6, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Federal law authorizes a court to award a reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights\ncases. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988. We have held that a defen\ndant may receive such an award if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is\nfrivolous. In this case, the plaintiff asserted both frivolous\nand non-frivolous claims. We hold today that a court may\ngrant reasonable fees to the defendant in this circum\nstance, but only for costs that the defendant would not\nhave incurred but for the frivolous claims. A trial court\nhas wide discretion in applying this standard. But here\nwe must vacate the judgment below because the court\nused a different and incorrect standard in awarding fees.\n                             I\n   This case arises out of an election for chief of police in\nthe town of Vinton, Louisiana. The candidates were peti\ntioner Ricky Fox (the challenger) and respondent Billy Ray\nVice (the incumbent).1 By Fox\u2019s account, Vice resorted to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Vice died during the course of this litigation.   Pursuant to this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 35.1, we substituted the executor of his estate as respon\ndent. 562 U. S. ___ (2011). But for the sake of clarity, we refer to the\n2                        FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan assortment of dirty tricks to try to force Fox out of the\nrace. In particular, Vice sent an anonymous letter to Fox\nthreatening to publish damaging charges against him if he\nremained a candidate. Vice also arranged for a third party\nto publicly accuse Fox of using racial slurs and then to file\na criminal complaint against Fox repeating those allega\ntions. And when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint,\nVice leaked it to the press. Yet all of these machinations\nfailed; Fox won the election. And Vice got an even greater\ncomeuppance: He was subsequently convicted of criminal\nextortion for his election-related conduct.\n   Fox, however, chose not to let the matter rest; he filed\nthis suit in Louisiana state court against Vice and the\ntown of Vinton, also a respondent here. Fox\u2019s complaint\nasserted both state-law claims, including defamation, and\nfederal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, includ\ning interference with his right to seek public office. Vice\nand the town (Vice, for short) removed the case to federal\ncourt on the basis of the \u00a71983 claims.\n   At the end of discovery in the suit, Vice moved for sum\nmary judgment on Fox\u2019s federal claims. Fox conceded that\nthe claims were \u201cno[t] valid,\u201d App. 169, and the District\nCourt accordingly dismissed them with prejudice. In the\nsame ruling, the court declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. Docket\nNo. 2:06\u2013cv\u2013135 (WD La., Oct. 16, 2007), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38a\u201340a. The court instead remanded the now\nslimmed-down case to state court for adjudication. In\ndoing so, the District Court observed that \u201c[a]ny trial\npreparation, legal research, and discovery may be used by\nthe parties in the state court proceedings.\u201d Id., at 40a.\n   Vice then asked the federal court for an award of attor\nney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988, arguing that Fox\u2019s federal claims\nwere \u201cbaseless and without merit.\u201d App. 198. Vice stated\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrespondent as Vice.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat his lawyers had had to participate in five lengthy\ndepositions and review numerous records to defend\nagainst Fox\u2019s charges. Id., at 199. In support of his fee\nrequest, Vice submitted attorney billing records estimat\ning the time spent on the whole suit, without differentiat\ning between the federal and state-law claims. See Supp.\nApp. 8\u201367.\n   The District Court granted the motion for attorney\u2019s fees\non the ground that Fox\u2019s federal claims were frivolous.\nAlthough the state-law allegations had not been found\nfrivolous (and indeed remained live), the court did not\nrequire Vice to separate out the work his attorneys had\ndone on the two sets of claims. Docket No. 2:06\u2013cv\u2013135\n(WD La., Sept. 22, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Ac\ncording to the court, such \u201csegregation\u201d was unnecessary\nbecause the \u201cvarious claims arose out of the same transac\ntion and were so interrelated that their prosecution or\ndefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Simi\nlarly, the court declined to reduce the fee award to reflect\nthe surviving state-law claims. \u201c[T]hroughout the litiga\ntion,\u201d the court stated, both sides \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on Fox\u2019s\nfrivolous \u00a71983 claims. Id., at 32a\u201333a. The court there\nfore concluded that Vice should receive all of the fees he\nreasonably incurred in defending the suit\u2014a total of\n$48,681. Id., at 34a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 594 F. 3d 423\n(CA5 2010). The majority first rejected Fox\u2019s contention\nthat all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defen\ndant to recover any fees. That rule, the court explained,\nwould \u201c \u2018allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims with\nout consequenc[e]\u2019 \u201d so long as they added a single non\nfrivolous claim. Id., at 428 (quoting Tutor-Saliba Corp. v.\nHailey, 452 F. 3d 1055, 1064 (CA9 2006)). The Court of\nAppeals then turned to the District Court\u2019s decision that\nVice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the\n4                            FOX v. VICE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncase, even though state-law claims remained unadjudi\ncated. Repeating the trial court\u2019s view that the whole\nlitigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims, the\nFifth Circuit upheld the fee award. See 594 F. 3d, at 428.\n   Judge Southwick dissented. He agreed that Vice was\nentitled to some reimbursement for fees. Id., at 430. But\nhe thought the District Court had erred in declining to\n\u201callocate the fees separately between the successful claims\nand the unsuccessful\u201d ones just because all of them were\n\u201cinterrelated.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[W]hen some claims are dismissed\nas frivolous and others are not,\u201d he stated, the defendants\nshould receive fees only for \u201cthe legal work allocable solely\nor dominantly to the dismissed\u201d claims. Id., at 431. Be\ncause in this case \u201calmost all of the defendant[s\u2019] discovery\nand factual analysis would have been necessary even if no\nfederal claims had been brought,\u201d he concluded, the fee\naward should have been much smaller. Ibid.\n   The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepened a Circuit split\nabout whether and to what extent a court may award fees\nto a defendant under \u00a71988 when a plaintiff asserts both\nfrivolous and non-frivolous claims.2 One Court of Appeals\nhas forbidden any compensation unless all of the plaintiff\u2019s\nclaims are frivolous. See Balmer v. HCA, Inc., 423 F. 3d\n606, 617 (CA6 2005). Others have rejected this approach,\nbut struggled with how to allocate fees in a suit that in\nvolves a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Com\npare, e.g., 594 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2010) (opinion below), with\nColombrito v. Kelly, 764 F. 2d 122, 132 (CA2 1985) (declin\ning to award fees when the frivolous claim \u201cadded no\nadditional testimony or expense to the trial\u201d). We granted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The parties do not dispute for purposes of argument here that this\n\ncase involves both kinds of claims. The District Court deemed the\nfederal claims frivolous, and Fox has not asked us to disturb that\nruling. See Brief for Petitioner 26, and n. 2. The court remanded the\nstate-law claims to state court, and Vice has assumed in this Court that\nthey are not frivolous. See Brief for Respondents 8, n. 5.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. ___ (2010).\n                               II\n   Our legal system generally requires each party to bear\nhis own litigation expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, re\ngardless whether he wins or loses. Indeed, this principle\nis so firmly entrenched that it is known as the \u201cAmerican\nRule.\u201d See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness\nSociety, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975). But Congress has\nauthorized courts to deviate from this background rule in\ncertain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to\nanother. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562\n(1992) (listing federal fee-shifting provisions).\n   The statute involved here, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, allows the\naward of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to \u201cthe prevailing\nparty\u201d in various kinds of civil rights cases, including suits\nbrought under \u00a71983. Most of our decisions addressing\nthis provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevail\ning plaintiffs. When a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a\ncivil rights violation, we have stated, he serves \u201cas\na \u2018private attorney general,\u2019 vindicating a policy that\nCongress considered of the highest priority.\u201d Newman v.\nPiggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968)\n(per curiam). He therefore \u201cshould ordinarily recover an\nattorney\u2019s fee\u201d from the defendant\u2014the party whose mis\nconduct created the need for legal action. Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 416 (1978) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Fee shifting in such a case at\nonce reimburses a plaintiff for \u201cwhat it cos[t] [him] to\nvindicate [civil] rights,\u201d Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 561,\n577\u2013578 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\nholds to account \u201ca violator of federal law,\u201d Christians\nburg, 434 U. S., at 418.\n   In Christiansburg, we held that \u00a71988 also authorizes a\nfee award to a prevailing defendant, but under a different\nstandard reflecting the \u201cquite different equitable consid\n6                        FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nerations\u201d at stake. Id., at 419. In enacting \u00a71988, we\nstated, Congress sought \u201cto protect defendants from bur\ndensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.\u201d Id.,\nat 420. Accordingly, \u00a71988 authorizes a district court to\naward attorney\u2019s fees to a defendant \u201cupon a finding that\nthe plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or with\nout foundation.\u201d Id., at 421; see also Kentucky v. Graham,\n473 U. S. 159, 165, n. 9 (1985).\n   These standards would be easy to apply if life were like\nthe movies, but that is usually not the case. In Hollywood,\nlitigation most often concludes with a dramatic verdict\nthat leaves one party fully triumphant and the other\nutterly prostrate. The court in such a case would know\nexactly how to award fees (even if that anti-climactic scene\nis generally left on the cutting-room floor). But in the real\nworld, litigation is more complex, involving multiple\nclaims for relief that implicate a mix of legal theories and\nhave different merits. Some claims succeed; others fail.\nSome charges are frivolous; others (even if not ultimately\nsuccessful) have a reasonable basis. In short, litigation is\nmessy, and courts must deal with this untidiness in\nawarding fees.\n   Given this reality, we have made clear that plaintiffs\nmay receive fees under \u00a71988 even if they are not victori\nous on every claim. A civil rights plaintiff who obtains\nmeaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law\nand, in so doing, has vindicated Congress\u2019s statutory pur\nposes. That \u201cresult is what matters,\u201d we explained in\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983): A court\nshould compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney\nreasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome, even\nif \u201cthe plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.\u201d Ibid.\nThe fee award, of course, should not reimburse the plain\ntiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to\nthe grant of relief: Such work \u201ccannot be deemed to have\nbeen expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But the pres\nence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a\ndefendant against paying for the attorney\u2019s fees that the\nplaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his\ncivil rights.\n   Analogous principles indicate that a defendant may\ndeserve fees even if not all the plaintiff\u2019s claims were\nfrivolous. In this context, \u00a71988 serves to relieve a defen\ndant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges. The\nplaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations, and\nthe court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those\nclaims imposed on his adversary. See Christiansburg, 434\nU. S., at 420\u2013421. That remains true when the plaintiff\u2019s\nsuit also includes non-frivolous claims. The defendant, of\ncourse, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non\nfrivolous charges. See ibid. But the presence of reason\nable allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff\nagainst paying for the fees that his frivolous claims\nimposed.\n   Indeed, we have previously said exactly this much. In\nHensley, we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might\nprevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an\nunrelated frivolous claim. In this situation, we explained,\na court could properly award fees to both parties\u2014to the\nplaintiff, to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the\nmeritorious claim; and to the defendant, to compensate for\nthe fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.\nSee 461 U. S., at 435, n. 10. We thus made clear that a\ncourt may reimburse a defendant for costs under \u00a71988\neven if a plaintiff\u2019s suit is not wholly frivolous. Fee\nshifting to recompense a defendant (as to recompense a\nplaintiff) is not all-or-nothing: A defendant need not show\nthat every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify for\nfees.\n   The question then becomes one of allocation: In a law\nsuit involving a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims,\n8                       FOX v. VICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhat work may the defendant receive fees for? Vice con\ncedes, as he must, that a defendant may not obtain com\npensation for work unrelated to a frivolous claim. Brief\nfor Respondents 42, n. 13. Similarly, we think Fox would\nhave to concede (once he has lost the argument that the\npresence of any non-frivolous claim precludes a fee award)\nthat the defendant may receive reasonable fees for work\nrelated exclusively to a frivolous claim. The question in\ndispute concerns work that helps defend against non\nfrivolous and frivolous claims alike\u2014for example, a depo\nsition eliciting facts relevant to both allegations.\n   Vice proposes authorizing the trial court to award fees\nfor work that is \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the frivolous por\ntion of the lawsuit. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 45. But\nthat standard is in truth no standard at all. The very\nquestion under consideration is: What fees may be fairly\nattributed to frivolous claims under \u00a71988? To answer\n\u201cThose that are fairly attributable to frivolous claims\u201d is\njust to restate this question. And that non-response re\nsponse would leave to each and every trial court not only\nthe implementation, but also the invention, of the applica\nble legal standard. We do not think trial courts would\nappreciate that lack of guidance. And yet more important,\nwe do not think such an empty and amorphous test would\nensure that all fee awards to defendants comport with\nCongress\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a71988.\n   That congressional policy points to a different and more\nmeaningful standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to\nrecover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred because of, but\nonly because of, a frivolous claim. Or what is the same\nthing stated as a but-for test: Section 1988 permits the\ndefendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he\nwould not have paid but for the frivolous claim. Recall\nthat the relevant purpose of \u00a71988 is to relieve defendants\nof the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litiga\ntion. See supra, at 5\u20136. So if a frivolous claim occasioned\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe attorney\u2019s fees at issue, a court may decide that the\ndefendant should not have to pay them. But if the defen\ndant would have incurred those fees anyway, to defend\nagainst non-frivolous claims, then a court has no basis\nfor transferring the expense to the plaintiff. Suppose, for\nexample, that a defendant\u2019s attorney conducts a deposition\non matters relevant to both a frivolous and a non-frivolous\nclaim\u2014and more, that the lawyer would have taken and\ncommitted the same time to this deposition even if the\ncase had involved only the non-frivolous allegation. In\nthat circumstance, the work does not implicate Congress\u2019s\nreason for allowing defendants to collect fees. The defen\ndant would have incurred the expense in any event; he has\nsuffered no incremental harm from the frivolous claim. In\nshort, the defendant has never shouldered the burden that\nCongress, in enacting \u00a71988, wanted to relieve. The basic\nAmerican Rule thus continues to operate.3\n  A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would\nfurnish windfalls to some defendants, making them better\noff because they were subject to a suit including frivolous\nclaims. For under any more permissive test, the simple\npresence of a frivolous claim would allow the court to shift\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The test set out here differs from the one we adopted in Hensley v.\n\nEckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983), to govern fee awards to plaintiffs\nin cases involving both successful and unsuccessful claims. See supra,\nat 6\u20137. That difference reflects the disparate legislative purposes we\nhave recognized in the two settings. See Christiansburg Garment Co. v.\nEEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419\u2013420 (1978); supra, at 5\u20136. Congress author\nized fees to plaintiffs to compensate them for the costs of redressing\ncivil rights violations; accordingly, a plaintiff may receive fees for all\nwork relating to the accomplishment of that result, even if \u201cthe plaintiff\nfailed to prevail on every contention raised.\u201d Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435.\nBy contrast, Congress authorized fees to defendants to remove the\nburden associated with fending off frivolous claims; accordingly, a\ndefendant may recover for fees that those claims caused him to incur.\nIn each context, the standard for allocating fees in \u201cmixed\u201d cases\nmatches the relevant congressional purpose.\n10                       FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the plaintiff some of the costs of defending against\nregular, non-frivolous charges. So two defendants (call\nthem Vice and Rice) could face identical non-frivolous\nallegations, but because Vice also confronted a frivolous\nclaim, he might end by paying less than Rice to his attor\nneys. The chance assertion\u2014for Vice, the downright lucky\nassertion\u2014of the frivolous claim could relieve him not only\nof the incremental costs of that claim but also of costs that\nhe, like Rice, would have had to pay in its absence. Sec\ntion 1988 provides no warrant for that peculiar result;\nthat statute was \u201cnever intended to produce windfalls\u201d for\nparties. See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 115 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   At the same time, the \u201cbut-for\u201d standard we require may\nin some cases allow compensation to a defendant for at\ntorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous\nclaims. Suppose, for example, that a plaintiff asserts one\nfrivolous and one non-frivolous claim, but that only the\nfrivolous allegation can legally result in a damages award.\nIf an attorney performs work useful to defending against\nboth, but did so only because of the defendant\u2019s monetary\nexposure on the frivolous charge, a court may decide to\nshift fees. Or similarly, imagine that the frivolous claim\nenables removal of the case to federal court, which in\nturn drives up litigation expenses. Here too, our standard\nwould permit awarding fees for work relevant to both\nclaims in order to reflect the increased costs (if any) of the\nfederal forum. And frivolous claims may increase the cost\nof defending a suit in ways that are not reflected in the\nnumber of hours billed. If a defendant could prove, for\nexample, that a frivolous claim involved a specialized area\nthat reasonably caused him to hire more expensive coun\nsel for the entire case, then the court may reimburse the\ndefendant for the increased marginal cost. As all these\nexamples show, the dispositive question is not whether\nattorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the costs would have been incurred in the ab\nsence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to those\ninquiries will usually track each other, but when they\ndiverge, it is the second that matters.\n    We emphasize, as we have before, that the determina\ntion of fees \u201cshould not result in a second major litigation.\u201d\nHensley, 461 U. S., at 437. The fee applicant (whether a\nplaintiff or a defendant) must, of course, submit appropri\nate documentation to meet \u201cthe burden of establishing\nentitlement to an award.\u201d Ibid. But trial courts need not,\nand indeed should not, become green-eyeshade account\nants. The essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is\nto do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So\ntrial courts may take into account their overall sense of a\nsuit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating\nan attorney\u2019s time. And appellate courts must give sub\nstantial deference to these determinations, in light of \u201cthe\ndistrict court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation.\u201d\nIbid.; see Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of Ed., 471 U. S. 234,\n244 (1985). We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial\ndecisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has\nless to recommend it.\n    But the trial court must apply the correct standard, and\nthe appeals court must make sure that has occurred. See\nPerdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n14) (\u201cDetermining a \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 is a matter\nthat is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\n. . . but the judge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited\u201d); Cf. Koon\nv. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996) (\u201cA district court\nby definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error\nof law\u201d). That means the trial court must determine\nwhether the fees requested would not have accrued but for\nthe frivolous claim. And the appeals court must determine\nwhether the trial court asked and answered that question,\nrather than some other. A trial court has wide discretion\nwhen, but only when, it calls the game by the right rules.\n12                      FOX v. VICE \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III \n\n   The task remains of applying these principles to the fee\naward Vice received. The District Court\u2019s analysis sug\ngests that Vice\u2019s attorneys would have done much the\nsame work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous\nclaims. As noted earlier, see supra, at 3, the court ac\nknowledged that Fox\u2019s federal and state-law claims were\n\u201cinterrelated,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). The charges \u201carose out of the same\ntransaction\u201d\u2014Vice\u2019s conduct in the campaign\u2014and their\n\u201cdefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). It there\nfore seems likely that Vice\u2019s attorneys would at least have\nconducted similar fact-gathering activities\u2014taken many of\nthe same depositions, produced and reviewed many of the\nsame documents, and so forth. Indeed, the District Court\nhighlighted the usefulness of the attorneys\u2019 work to de\nfending against the state-law claims: In its order remand\ning those claims, the court noted that the \u201ctrial prepara\ntion, legal research, and discovery\u201d done in the federal\ncourt could \u201cbe used by the parties in the state court pro\nceedings.\u201d Id., at 40a.\n   The District Court\u2019s decision to award full attorney\u2019s\nfees to Vice failed to take proper account of this overlap\nbetween the frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Rather\nthan apply the but-for standard we have set out, the court\nindicated that the paramount factor was the parties\u2019 \u201cfo\ncus\u201d in the litigation. Id., at 33a. The court did not ad\ndress whether the \u201cinterrelated[ness]\u201d of the claims meant\nthat Vice would have incurred part or most of his fees even\nif Fox had asserted only the non-frivolous state-law\nclaims. To the contrary, the court suggested that the close\nrelationship between the federal and state-law claims\nsupported Vice\u2019s request to recover all of his attorney\u2019s\nfees. See id., at 28a; supra, at 3. That reasoning stands\nthe appropriate analysis on its head. It cannot be squared\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the congressional policy of sparing defendants from\nthe costs of frivolous litigation.\n   Nor did the Court of Appeals uphold the award of fees\non the ground that we would require. The majority articu\nlated a standard that, taken alone, might be read as con\nsistent with our opinion; according to the court, a defen\ndant should receive fees for \u201cwork which can be distinctly\ntraced to a plaintiff\u2019s frivolous claims.\u201d 594 F. 3d, at 429.\nBut the court seemed to think that its test permitted\nawarding Vice fees for any work useful to defending\nagainst a frivolous claim, even if lawyers would have done\nthat work regardless. Indeed, this very point divided the\nmajority and the dissent. Judge Southwick objected to the\nfee award on the ground that \u201calmost all [of] the defen\ndant[s\u2019] discovery and factual analysis would have been\nnecessary even if no federal claims had been brought.\u201d Id.,\nat 431. But the majority never responded to that argu\nment or otherwise engaged this crucial question. The\nmajority instead merely reiterated the District Court\u2019s\nreasoning that the parties had principally \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on\nthe \u00a71983 allegations. That finding, as we have explained,\nis irrelevant if Vice\u2019s attorneys would have performed the\nsame work to defend against the state-law claims.\n   On this record, we must return the case to the lower\ncourts. See, e.g., Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n12\u201315); Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council\nfor Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 566\u2013568 (1986); Hensley, 461\nU. S., at 438\u2013440. In a suit of this kind, involving both\nfrivolous and non-frivolous claims, a defendant may re\ncover the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees he expended solely\nbecause of the frivolous allegations. And that is all. Con\nsistent with the policy underlying \u00a71988, the defendant\nmay not receive compensation for any fees that he would\nhave paid in the absence of the frivolous claims. We there\nfore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Argued March 22, 2011\u2014Decided June 6, 2011\nClaiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful\n  campaign to become the police chief of Vinton, La., petitioner Fox\n  filed a state-court suit against Vice, the incumbent chief, and the\n  town (Vice, for short). Fox\u2019s suit asserted both state-law claims, in\n  cluding defamation, and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71983, including interference with Fox\u2019s right to seek public office.\n  Vice removed the case to federal court based on the \u00a71983 claims. Af\n  ter discovery, he sought summary judgment on the federal claims,\n  which Fox conceded were not valid. The District Court accordingly\n  dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims\n  to state court, noting that Vice\u2019s attorneys\u2019 work could be useful in\n  the state-court proceedings. Vice then asked the federal court for at\n  torney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988, submitting attorney billing records esti\n  mating the time spent on the entire suit, without differentiating be\n  tween time spent on the now-dismissed federal claims and on the\n  remaining state claims. The court granted the motion on the ground\n  that Fox\u2019s federal claims were frivolous, awarding Fox fees for all\n  work his attorneys had performed in the suit. Although the state-law\n  allegations had not been found frivolous, the court did not require\n  Vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets\n  of claims. It also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the sur\n  viving state-law claims, noting that both sides had focused on the\n  frivolous \u00a71983 claims. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Fox\u2019s\n  argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defen\n  dant to recover any fees, and agreeing with the District Court that\n  the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.\n2                             FOX v. VICE\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. When a plaintiff\u2019s suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous\n claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only\n for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivo\n lous claims. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Section 1988 allows the award of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d\n to \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d in certain civil rights cases, including \u00a71983\n suits. While most of this Court\u2019s \u00a71988 decisions have concerned fees\n to prevailing plaintiffs, \u00a71988 also authorizes a fee award to a pre\n vailing defendant \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivo\n lous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d Christiansburg Garment\n Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421. Just as plaintiffs may receive fees\n under \u00a71988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, Hensley v.\n Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed\n for costs under \u00a71988 even if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is not wholly frivo\n lous, ibid., n. 10. The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from\n these non-frivolous charges, see Christiansburg, 434 U. S., at 420\u2013\n 421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize\n the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims im\n posed. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit\n having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Congress\u2019s purpose\n in enacting \u00a71988\u2014to relieve defendants of the burdens associated\n with fending off frivolous litigation\u2014points to the proper standard:\n Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\n incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; i.e., \u00a71988\n permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he\n would not have paid but for the frivolous claim. A standard allowing\n more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defen\n dants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely be\n cause the plaintiff\u2019s suit also included frivolous claims. This \u201cbut-for\u201d\n standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant\n for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims,\n for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work\n because of the defendant\u2019s greater financial exposure on that claim.\n The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to\n a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been in\n curred in the absence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to\n those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge,\n it is the second one that matters. The determination of fees \u201cshould\n not result in a second major litigation.\u201d Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.\n The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to\n achieve auditing perfection. The trial court has wide discretion, but\n must apply the correct but-for standard. And the appeals court must\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for\n  question, rather than some other. Pp. 7\u201311.\n     2. The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to\n  Vice. The District Court\u2019s analysis suggests that Vice\u2019s attorneys\n  would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought\n  his frivolous claims. The charges arose out of Vice\u2019s conduct in the\n  campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to\n  the non-frivolous state-law claims, his \u201cdefense entailed proof or de\n  nial of essentially the same facts.\u201d It thus seems likely that Vice\u2019s at\n  torneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions. Al\n  though the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys\u2019 work\n  in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper ac\n  count of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.\n  Its reasoning\u2014that the close relationship between the federal and\n  state-law claims supported the award\u2014cannot be squared with the\n  congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of\n  frivolous litigation. Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on\n  the proper ground. It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any\n  work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers\n  would have done that work regardless.

See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988. We have held that a defen\ndant may receive such an award if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is\nfrivolous. In this case, the plaintiff asserted both frivolous\nand non-frivolous claims. We hold today that a court may\ngrant reasonable fees to the defendant in this circum\nstance, but only for costs that the defendant would not\nhave incurred but for the frivolous claims. A trial court\nhas wide discretion in applying this standard. But here\nwe must vacate the judgment below because the court\nused a different and incorrect standard in awarding fees.\n                             I\n   This case arises out of an election for chief of police in\nthe town of Vinton, Louisiana. The candidates were peti\ntioner Ricky Fox (the challenger) and respondent Billy Ray\nVice (the incumbent).1 By Fox\u2019s account, Vice resorted to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Vice died during the course of this litigation.   Pursuant to this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 35.1, we substituted the executor of his estate as respon\ndent. 562 U. S. ___ (2011). But for the sake of clarity, we refer to the\n2                        FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan assortment of dirty tricks to try to force Fox out of the\nrace. In particular, Vice sent an anonymous letter to Fox\nthreatening to publish damaging charges against him if he\nremained a candidate. Vice also arranged for a third party\nto publicly accuse Fox of using racial slurs and then to file\na criminal complaint against Fox repeating those allega\ntions. And when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint,\nVice leaked it to the press. Yet all of these machinations\nfailed; Fox won the election. And Vice got an even greater\ncomeuppance: He was subsequently convicted of criminal\nextortion for his election-related conduct.\n   Fox, however, chose not to let the matter rest; he filed\nthis suit in Louisiana state court against Vice and the\ntown of Vinton, also a respondent here. Fox\u2019s complaint\nasserted both state-law claims, including defamation, and\nfederal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, includ\ning interference with his right to seek public office. Vice\nand the town (Vice, for short) removed the case to federal\ncourt on the basis of the \u00a71983 claims.\n   At the end of discovery in the suit, Vice moved for sum\nmary judgment on Fox\u2019s federal claims. Fox conceded that\nthe claims were \u201cno[t] valid,\u201d App. 169, and the District\nCourt accordingly dismissed them with prejudice. In the\nsame ruling, the court declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. Docket\nNo. 2:06\u2013cv\u2013135 (WD La., Oct. 16, 2007), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 38a\u201340a. The court instead remanded the now\nslimmed-down case to state court for adjudication. In\ndoing so, the District Court observed that \u201c[a]ny trial\npreparation, legal research, and discovery may be used by\nthe parties in the state court proceedings.\u201d Id., at 40a.\n   Vice then asked the federal court for an award of attor\nney\u2019s fees under \u00a71988, arguing that Fox\u2019s federal claims\nwere \u201cbaseless and without merit.\u201d App. 198.

Id., at 199. In support of his fee\nrequest, Vice submitted attorney billing records estimat\ning the time spent on the whole suit, without differentiat\ning between the federal and state-law claims. See Supp.\nApp. 8\u201367.\n   The District Court granted the motion for attorney\u2019s fees\non the ground that Fox\u2019s federal claims were frivolous.\nAlthough the state-law allegations had not been found\nfrivolous (and indeed remained live), the court did not\nrequire Vice to separate out the work his attorneys had\ndone on the two sets of claims. Docket No. 2:06\u2013cv\u2013135\n(WD La., Sept. 22, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Ac\ncording to the court, such \u201csegregation\u201d was unnecessary\nbecause the \u201cvarious claims arose out of the same transac\ntion and were so interrelated that their prosecution or\ndefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Simi\nlarly, the court declined to reduce the fee award to reflect\nthe surviving state-law claims. \u201c[T]hroughout the litiga\ntion,\u201d the court stated, both sides \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on Fox\u2019s\nfrivolous \u00a71983 claims. Id., at 32a\u201333a. The court there\nfore concluded that Vice should receive all of the fees he\nreasonably incurred in defending the suit\u2014a total of\n$48,681. Id., at 34a.\n   A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 594 F. 3d 423\n(CA5 2010). The majority first rejected Fox\u2019s contention\nthat all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defen\ndant to recover any fees. That rule, the court explained,\nwould \u201c \u2018allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims with\nout consequenc[e]\u2019 \u201d so long as they added a single non\nfrivolous claim. Id., at 428 (quoting Tutor-Saliba Corp. v.\nHailey, 452 F. 3d 1055, 1064 (CA9 2006)). The Court of\nAppeals then turned to the District Court\u2019s decision that\nVice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the\n4                            FOX v. VICE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncase, even though state-law claims remained unadjudi\ncated. Repeating the trial court\u2019s view that the whole\nlitigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims, the\nFifth Circuit upheld the fee award. See 594 F. 3d, at 428.\n   Judge Southwick dissented. He agreed that Vice was\nentitled to some reimbursement for fees. Id., at 430. But\nhe thought the District Court had erred in declining to\n\u201callocate the fees separately between the successful claims\nand the unsuccessful\u201d ones just because all of them were\n\u201cinterrelated.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[W]hen some claims are dismissed\nas frivolous and others are not,\u201d he stated, the defendants\nshould receive fees only for \u201cthe legal work allocable solely\nor dominantly to the dismissed\u201d claims. Id., at 431. Be\ncause in this case \u201calmost all of the defendant[s\u2019] discovery\nand factual analysis would have been necessary even if no\nfederal claims had been brought,\u201d he concluded, the fee\naward should have been much smaller. Ibid.\n   The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepened a Circuit split\nabout whether and to what extent a court may award fees\nto a defendant under \u00a71988 when a plaintiff asserts both\nfrivolous and non-frivolous claims.2 One Court of Appeals\nhas forbidden any compensation unless all of the plaintiff\u2019s\nclaims are frivolous. See Balmer v. HCA, Inc., 423 F. 3d\n606, 617 (CA6 2005). Others have rejected this approach,\nbut struggled with how to allocate fees in a suit that in\nvolves a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Com\npare, e.g., 594 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2010) (opinion below), with\nColombrito v. Kelly, 764 F. 2d 122, 132 (CA2 1985) (declin\ning to award fees when the frivolous claim \u201cadded no\nadditional testimony or expense to the trial\u201d). We granted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The parties do not dispute for purposes of argument here that this\n\ncase involves both kinds of claims. The District Court deemed the\nfederal claims frivolous, and Fox has not asked us to disturb that\nruling. See Brief for Petitioner 26, and n. 2. The court remanded the\nstate-law claims to state court, and Vice has assumed in this Court that\nthey are not frivolous. See Brief for Respondents 8, n. 5.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. ___ (2010).\n                               II\n   Our legal system generally requires each party to bear\nhis own litigation expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, re\ngardless whether he wins or loses. Indeed, this principle\nis so firmly entrenched that it is known as the \u201cAmerican\nRule.\u201d See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness\nSociety, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975). But Congress has\nauthorized courts to deviate from this background rule in\ncertain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to\nanother. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562\n(1992) (listing federal fee-shifting provisions).\n   The statute involved here, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, allows the\naward of \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to \u201cthe prevailing\nparty\u201d in various kinds of civil rights cases, including suits\nbrought under \u00a71983. Most of our decisions addressing\nthis provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevail\ning plaintiffs. When a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a\ncivil rights violation, we have stated, he serves \u201cas\na \u2018private attorney general,\u2019 vindicating a policy that\nCongress considered of the highest priority.\u201d Newman v.\nPiggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968)\n(per curiam). He therefore \u201cshould ordinarily recover an\nattorney\u2019s fee\u201d from the defendant\u2014the party whose mis\nconduct created the need for legal action. Christiansburg\nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 416 (1978) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Fee shifting in such a case at\nonce reimburses a plaintiff for \u201cwhat it cos[t] [him] to\nvindicate [civil] rights,\u201d Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 561,\n577\u2013578 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\nholds to account \u201ca violator of federal law,\u201d Christians\nburg, 434 U. S., at 418.\n   In Christiansburg, we held that \u00a71988 also authorizes a\nfee award to a prevailing defendant, but under a different\nstandard reflecting the \u201cquite different equitable consid\n6                        FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nerations\u201d at stake. Id., at 419. In enacting \u00a71988, we\nstated, Congress sought \u201cto protect defendants from bur\ndensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.\u201d Id.,\nat 420. Accordingly, \u00a71988 authorizes a district court to\naward attorney\u2019s fees to a defendant \u201cupon a finding that\nthe plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or with\nout foundation.\u201d Id., at 421; see also Kentucky v. Graham,\n473 U. S. 159, 165, n. 9 (1985).\n   These standards would be easy to apply if life were like\nthe movies, but that is usually not the case. In Hollywood,\nlitigation most often concludes with a dramatic verdict\nthat leaves one party fully triumphant and the other\nutterly prostrate. The court in such a case would know\nexactly how to award fees (even if that anti-climactic scene\nis generally left on the cutting-room floor). But in the real\nworld, litigation is more complex, involving multiple\nclaims for relief that implicate a mix of legal theories and\nhave different merits. Some claims succeed; others fail.\nSome charges are frivolous; others (even if not ultimately\nsuccessful) have a reasonable basis. In short, litigation is\nmessy, and courts must deal with this untidiness in\nawarding fees.\n   Given this reality, we have made clear that plaintiffs\nmay receive fees under \u00a71988 even if they are not victori\nous on every claim. A civil rights plaintiff who obtains\nmeaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law\nand, in so doing, has vindicated Congress\u2019s statutory pur\nposes. That \u201cresult is what matters,\u201d we explained in\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983): A court\nshould compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney\nreasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome, even\nif \u201cthe plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.\u201d Ibid.\nThe fee award, of course, should not reimburse the plain\ntiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to\nthe grant of relief: Such work \u201ccannot be deemed to have\nbeen expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But the pres\nence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a\ndefendant against paying for the attorney\u2019s fees that the\nplaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his\ncivil rights.\n   Analogous principles indicate that a defendant may\ndeserve fees even if not all the plaintiff\u2019s claims were\nfrivolous. In this context, \u00a71988 serves to relieve a defen\ndant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges. The\nplaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations, and\nthe court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those\nclaims imposed on his adversary. See Christiansburg, 434\nU. S., at 420\u2013421. That remains true when the plaintiff\u2019s\nsuit also includes non-frivolous claims. The defendant, of\ncourse, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non\nfrivolous charges. See ibid. But the presence of reason\nable allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff\nagainst paying for the fees that his frivolous claims\nimposed.\n   Indeed, we have previously said exactly this much. In\nHensley, we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might\nprevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an\nunrelated frivolous claim. In this situation, we explained,\na court could properly award fees to both parties\u2014to the\nplaintiff, to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the\nmeritorious claim; and to the defendant, to compensate for\nthe fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.\nSee 461 U. S., at 435, n. 10. We thus made clear that a\ncourt may reimburse a defendant for costs under \u00a71988\neven if a plaintiff\u2019s suit is not wholly frivolous. Fee\nshifting to recompense a defendant (as to recompense a\nplaintiff) is not all-or-nothing: A defendant need not show\nthat every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify for\nfees.\n   The question then becomes one of allocation: In a law\nsuit involving a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims,\n8                       FOX v. VICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhat work may the defendant receive fees for? Vice con\ncedes, as he must, that a defendant may not obtain com\npensation for work unrelated to a frivolous claim. Brief\nfor Respondents 42, n. 13. Similarly, we think Fox would\nhave to concede (once he has lost the argument that the\npresence of any non-frivolous claim precludes a fee award)\nthat the defendant may receive reasonable fees for work\nrelated exclusively to a frivolous claim. The question in\ndispute concerns work that helps defend against non\nfrivolous and frivolous claims alike\u2014for example, a depo\nsition eliciting facts relevant to both allegations.\n   Vice proposes authorizing the trial court to award fees\nfor work that is \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the frivolous por\ntion of the lawsuit. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 45. But\nthat standard is in truth no standard at all. The very\nquestion under consideration is: What fees may be fairly\nattributed to frivolous claims under \u00a71988? To answer\n\u201cThose that are fairly attributable to frivolous claims\u201d is\njust to restate this question. And that non-response re\nsponse would leave to each and every trial court not only\nthe implementation, but also the invention, of the applica\nble legal standard. We do not think trial courts would\nappreciate that lack of guidance. And yet more important,\nwe do not think such an empty and amorphous test would\nensure that all fee awards to defendants comport with\nCongress\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a71988.\n   That congressional policy points to a different and more\nmeaningful standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to\nrecover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred because of, but\nonly because of, a frivolous claim. Or what is the same\nthing stated as a but-for test: Section 1988 permits the\ndefendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he\nwould not have paid but for the frivolous claim. Recall\nthat the relevant purpose of \u00a71988 is to relieve defendants\nof the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litiga\ntion. See supra, at 5\u20136. So if a frivolous claim occasioned\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe attorney\u2019s fees at issue, a court may decide that the\ndefendant should not have to pay them. But if the defen\ndant would have incurred those fees anyway, to defend\nagainst non-frivolous claims, then a court has no basis\nfor transferring the expense to the plaintiff. Suppose, for\nexample, that a defendant\u2019s attorney conducts a deposition\non matters relevant to both a frivolous and a non-frivolous\nclaim\u2014and more, that the lawyer would have taken and\ncommitted the same time to this deposition even if the\ncase had involved only the non-frivolous allegation. In\nthat circumstance, the work does not implicate Congress\u2019s\nreason for allowing defendants to collect fees. The defen\ndant would have incurred the expense in any event; he has\nsuffered no incremental harm from the frivolous claim. In\nshort, the defendant has never shouldered the burden that\nCongress, in enacting \u00a71988, wanted to relieve. The basic\nAmerican Rule thus continues to operate.3\n  A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would\nfurnish windfalls to some defendants, making them better\noff because they were subject to a suit including frivolous\nclaims. For under any more permissive test, the simple\npresence of a frivolous claim would allow the court to shift\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The test set out here differs from the one we adopted in Hensley v.\n\nEckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983), to govern fee awards to plaintiffs\nin cases involving both successful and unsuccessful claims. See supra,\nat 6\u20137. That difference reflects the disparate legislative purposes we\nhave recognized in the two settings. See Christiansburg Garment Co. v.\nEEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419\u2013420 (1978); supra, at 5\u20136. Congress author\nized fees to plaintiffs to compensate them for the costs of redressing\ncivil rights violations; accordingly, a plaintiff may receive fees for all\nwork relating to the accomplishment of that result, even if \u201cthe plaintiff\nfailed to prevail on every contention raised.\u201d Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435.\nBy contrast, Congress authorized fees to defendants to remove the\nburden associated with fending off frivolous claims; accordingly, a\ndefendant may recover for fees that those claims caused him to incur.\nIn each context, the standard for allocating fees in \u201cmixed\u201d cases\nmatches the relevant congressional purpose.\n10                       FOX v. VICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the plaintiff some of the costs of defending against\nregular, non-frivolous charges. So two defendants (call\nthem Vice and Rice) could face identical non-frivolous\nallegations, but because Vice also confronted a frivolous\nclaim, he might end by paying less than Rice to his attor\nneys. The chance assertion\u2014for Vice, the downright lucky\nassertion\u2014of the frivolous claim could relieve him not only\nof the incremental costs of that claim but also of costs that\nhe, like Rice, would have had to pay in its absence. Sec\ntion 1988 provides no warrant for that peculiar result;\nthat statute was \u201cnever intended to produce windfalls\u201d for\nparties. See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 115 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   At the same time, the \u201cbut-for\u201d standard we require may\nin some cases allow compensation to a defendant for at\ntorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous\nclaims. Suppose, for example, that a plaintiff asserts one\nfrivolous and one non-frivolous claim, but that only the\nfrivolous allegation can legally result in a damages award.\nIf an attorney performs work useful to defending against\nboth, but did so only because of the defendant\u2019s monetary\nexposure on the frivolous charge, a court may decide to\nshift fees. Or similarly, imagine that the frivolous claim\nenables removal of the case to federal court, which in\nturn drives up litigation expenses. Here too, our standard\nwould permit awarding fees for work relevant to both\nclaims in order to reflect the increased costs (if any) of the\nfederal forum. And frivolous claims may increase the cost\nof defending a suit in ways that are not reflected in the\nnumber of hours billed. If a defendant could prove, for\nexample, that a frivolous claim involved a specialized area\nthat reasonably caused him to hire more expensive coun\nsel for the entire case, then the court may reimburse the\ndefendant for the increased marginal cost. As all these\nexamples show, the dispositive question is not whether\nattorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the costs would have been incurred in the ab\nsence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to those\ninquiries will usually track each other, but when they\ndiverge, it is the second that matters.\n    We emphasize, as we have before, that the determina\ntion of fees \u201cshould not result in a second major litigation.\u201d\nHensley, 461 U. S., at 437. The fee applicant (whether a\nplaintiff or a defendant) must, of course, submit appropri\nate documentation to meet \u201cthe burden of establishing\nentitlement to an award.\u201d Ibid. But trial courts need not,\nand indeed should not, become green-eyeshade account\nants. The essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is\nto do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So\ntrial courts may take into account their overall sense of a\nsuit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating\nan attorney\u2019s time. And appellate courts must give sub\nstantial deference to these determinations, in light of \u201cthe\ndistrict court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation.\u201d\nIbid.; see Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of Ed., 471 U. S. 234,\n244 (1985). We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial\ndecisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has\nless to recommend it.\n    But the trial court must apply the correct standard, and\nthe appeals court must make sure that has occurred. See\nPerdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n14) (\u201cDetermining a \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 is a matter\nthat is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\n. . . but the judge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited\u201d); Cf. Koon\nv. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996) (\u201cA district court\nby definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error\nof law\u201d). That means the trial court must determine\nwhether the fees requested would not have accrued but for\nthe frivolous claim. And the appeals court must determine\nwhether the trial court asked and answered that question,\nrather than some other. A trial court has wide discretion\nwhen, but only when, it calls the game by the right rules.\n12                      FOX v. VICE \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III \n\n   The task remains of applying these principles to the fee\naward Vice received. The District Court\u2019s analysis sug\ngests that Vice\u2019s attorneys would have done much the\nsame work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous\nclaims. As noted earlier, see supra, at 3, the court ac\nknowledged that Fox\u2019s federal and state-law claims were\n\u201cinterrelated,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). The charges \u201carose out of the same\ntransaction\u201d\u2014Vice\u2019s conduct in the campaign\u2014and their\n\u201cdefense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same\nfacts.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). It there\nfore seems likely that Vice\u2019s attorneys would at least have\nconducted similar fact-gathering activities\u2014taken many of\nthe same depositions, produced and reviewed many of the\nsame documents, and so forth. Indeed, the District Court\nhighlighted the usefulness of the attorneys\u2019 work to de\nfending against the state-law claims: In its order remand\ning those claims, the court noted that the \u201ctrial prepara\ntion, legal research, and discovery\u201d done in the federal\ncourt could \u201cbe used by the parties in the state court pro\nceedings.\u201d Id., at 40a.\n   The District Court\u2019s decision to award full attorney\u2019s\nfees to Vice failed to take proper account of this overlap\nbetween the frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Rather\nthan apply the but-for standard we have set out, the court\nindicated that the paramount factor was the parties\u2019 \u201cfo\ncus\u201d in the litigation. Id., at 33a. The court did not ad\ndress whether the \u201cinterrelated[ness]\u201d of the claims meant\nthat Vice would have incurred part or most of his fees even\nif Fox had asserted only the non-frivolous state-law\nclaims. To the contrary, the court suggested that the close\nrelationship between the federal and state-law claims\nsupported Vice\u2019s request to recover all of his attorney\u2019s\nfees. See id., at 28a; supra, at 3. That reasoning stands\nthe appropriate analysis on its head. It cannot be squared\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the congressional policy of sparing defendants from\nthe costs of frivolous litigation.\n   Nor did the Court of Appeals uphold the award of fees\non the ground that we would require. The majority articu\nlated a standard that, taken alone, might be read as con\nsistent with our opinion; according to the court, a defen\ndant should receive fees for \u201cwork which can be distinctly\ntraced to a plaintiff\u2019s frivolous claims.\u201d 594 F. 3d, at 429.\nBut the court seemed to think that its test permitted\nawarding Vice fees for any work useful to defending\nagainst a frivolous claim, even if lawyers would have done\nthat work regardless. Indeed, this very point divided the\nmajority and the dissent. Judge Southwick objected to the\nfee award on the ground that \u201calmost all [of] the defen\ndant[s\u2019] discovery and factual analysis would have been\nnecessary even if no federal claims had been brought.\u201d Id.,\nat 431. But the majority never responded to that argu\nment or otherwise engaged this crucial question. The\nmajority instead merely reiterated the District Court\u2019s\nreasoning that the parties had principally \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on\nthe \u00a71983 allegations. That finding, as we have explained,\nis irrelevant if Vice\u2019s attorneys would have performed the\nsame work to defend against the state-law claims.\n   On this record, we must return the case to the lower\ncourts. See, e.g., Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n12\u201315); Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council\nfor Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 566\u2013568 (1986); Hensley, 461\nU. S., at 438\u2013440. In a suit of this kind, involving both\nfrivolous and non-frivolous claims, a defendant may re\ncover the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees he expended solely\nbecause of the frivolous allegations. And that is all. Con\nsistent with the policy underlying \u00a71988, the defendant\nmay not receive compensation for any fees that he would\nhave paid in the absence of the frivolous claims. We there\nfore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
