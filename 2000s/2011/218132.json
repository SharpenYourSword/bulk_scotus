UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10–5258. Argued April 25, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011\nUnder the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a felon unlawfully in\n possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), is subject to a 15-year\n minimum prison sentence if he has three prior convictions for a “vio\n lent felony” or “serious drug offense.” As relevant here, a “serious\n drug offense” is defined as “an offense under State law . . . , for which\n a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed\n by law,” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violat\n ing §922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for\n ACCA’s sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North\n Carolina drug trafficking convictions. When McNeill committed\n those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which\n McNeill in fact received. However, because the State later reduced\n the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years,\n McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for “serious\n drug offenses” within the meaning of §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The District\n Court rejected McNeill’s request that it look to current state law and\n instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the\n time he committed his state offenses. The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. A federal sentencing court must determine whether “an offense\n under State law” is a “serious drug offense” by consulting the “maxi\n mum term of imprisonment” applicable to a defendant’s prior state\n drug offense at the time of the defendant’s conviction for that offense.\n §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Pp. 3–7.\n       (a) ACCA’s plain text requires this result by mandating that the\n court determine whether a “previous conviction” was for a serious\n drug offense. The only way to answer this backward-looking question\n is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.\n2                      MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ACCA’s use of the present tense in defining a “serious drug offense”\n    as, inter alia, “an offense . . . for which a maximum [10-year] term . . .\n    is prescribed by law” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill’s argument\n    that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the\n    federal sentencing ignores ACCA’s focus on convictions that have al\n    ready occurred. Pp. 3–4.\n          (b) The statute’s broader context, specifically the adjacent defini\n    tion of “violent felony,” confirms this interpretation. Although Con\n    gress used the present tense in defining “violent felony,” see\n    §924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state\n    law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in deter\n    mining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.g., Taylor v.\n    United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. The Court sees no reason to inter\n    pret “serious drug offenses” any differently. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder,\n    557 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–6.\n          (c) This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results\n    that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previ\n    ous offense. Pp. 6–7.\n       2. The District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en\n    hancement to McNeill because all six of his prior drug convictions\n    were for “serious drug offenses.” Pp. 7–8.\n598 F. 3d 161, affirmed.\n\n    THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The question in this case concerns how a\nfederal court should determine the maximum sentence for\na prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes. We hold\nthat the “maximum term of imprisonment” for a defen\ndant’s prior state drug offense is the maximum sentence\napplicable to his offense when he was convicted of it.\n                            I\n  After an extended chase, police officers in Fayetteville,\nNorth Carolina apprehended petitioner Clifton Terelle\nMcNeill. McNeill was caught with 3.1 grams of crack\ncocaine packaged for distribution and a .38-caliber re\nvolver. In August 2008, he pleaded guilty to unlawful\npossession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1),\nand possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21\nU. S. C. §841(a)(1).\n  At sentencing, the District Court determined that\n2                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcNeill qualified for ACCA’s sentencing enhancement.\nUnder ACCA, a person who violates 18 U. S. C. §922(g)\nand “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony\nor a serious drug offense” is subject to a 15-year minimum\nprison sentence. §924(e)(1). McNeill conceded that two of\nhis prior convictions—assault with a deadly weapon and\nrobbery—were for “violent felonies.”\n  McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug\ntrafficking convictions were for “serious drug offenses” be\ncause those crimes no longer carried a “maximum term\nof imprisonment of ten years or more.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\nWhen McNeill committed those crimes between 1991 and\n1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and\nMcNeill in fact received 10-year sentences. See N. C. Gen.\nStat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993)\n(sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine).\nBut as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the\nmaximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and\nthe maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent\nto sell to 30 months. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§15A–\n1340.17(c) and (d), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).\n  The District Court rejected McNeill’s request that it\nlook to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year\nmaximum sentence that applied to McNeill’s drug offenses\nat the time he committed them. No. 5:08–CR–2–D–1\n(EDNC, Jan. 26, 2009), App. 118. Finding that McNeill\ntherefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or\nserious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA’s sentencing\nenhancement. The court then departed upward from the\nadvisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced\nMcNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his “long and\nunrelenting history of serious criminal conduct” and “near\ncertain likelihood of recidivism.” Id., at 119, 121.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nAlthough the court consulted the maximum sentence\nunder current state law, it reached the same conclusion as\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court because North Carolina’s revised sen\ntencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before\nOctober 1, 1994. 598 F. 3d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with\nUnited States v. Hinojosa, 349 F. 3d 200 (CA5 2003), and\ndisagreeing with United States v. Darden, 539 F. 3d 116\n(CA2 2008)). Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today\nfor his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he\nwould still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maxi\nmum. 598 F. 3d, at 165 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. §15A–\n1340.10 and State v. Branch, 134 N. C. App. 637, 639–640,\n518 S. E. 2d 213, 215 (1999)). We granted certiorari, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm, albeit for a different\nreason.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with\n“the language itself [and] the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S.\n337, 341 (1997). ACCA’s sentencing enhancement applies\nto individuals who have “three previous convictions . . . for\na violent felony or a serious drug offense.” §924(e)(1). As\nrelevant here, the statute defines a “serious drug offense”\nas “an offense under State law, involving manufacturing,\ndistributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or\ndistribute, a controlled substance . . . , for which a maxi\nmum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is pre\nscribed by law.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\n   The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing\ncourt to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a\ndefendant’s previous drug offense at the time of his convic\ntion for that offense. The statute requires the court to\ndetermine whether a “previous conviction” was for a seri\nous drug offense. The only way to answer this backward\nlooking question is to consult the law that applied at the\ntime of that conviction. We did precisely that in United\n4                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), where we ad\ndressed whether the “maximum term of imprisonment” in\ncludes recidivism enhancements. In assessing the “max\nimum term of imprisonment” for Rodriguez’s state drug\noffenses, we consulted the version of state law “that\n[he] was convicted of violating,” that is, the 1994 statutes\nand penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his\nstate convictions. Id., at 380–381.\n    Use of the present tense in the definition of “serious\ndrug offense” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill argues\nthat the present-tense verb in the phrase “is prescribed by\nlaw” requires federal courts to determine the maximum\nsentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the\nstate law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as\nif the state offense were committed on the day of federal\nsentencing. That argument overlooks the fact that ACCA\nis concerned with convictions that have already occurred.\nWhether the prior conviction was for an offense “involving\nmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to\nmanufacture or distribute, a controlled substance” can\nonly be answered by reference to the law under which the\ndefendant was convicted. Likewise, the maximum sen\ntence that “is prescribed by law” for that offense must also\nbe determined according to the law applicable at that\ntime.\n    McNeill’s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of\nthe statute. Although North Carolina courts actually\nsentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses,\nMcNeill now contends that the “maximum term of impris\nonment” for those offenses is 30 or 38 months. We find it\n“hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may\nlawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprison\nment that exceeds the ‘maximum term of imprisonment\n. . . prescribed by law.’ ” Id., at 383.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   The “broader context of the statute as a whole,” specifi\ncally the adjacent definition of “violent felony,” confirms\nthis interpretation. Robinson, supra, at 341. ACCA de\nfines “violent felony” in part as a crime that “has as an\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person of another” or “is bur\nglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B) (em\nphasis added).\n   Despite Congress’ use of present tense in that definition,\nwhen determining whether a defendant was convicted of a\n“violent felony,” we have turned to the version of state law\nthat the defendant was actually convicted of violating. In\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), the Court\nheld that whether Taylor’s 1963 and 1971 convictions were\nfor a crime that “is burglary” depended on the “former\nMissouri statutes defining second-degree burglary” that\n“were the bases for Taylor’s prior convictions.” Id., at 602;\nsee id., at 578, n. 1 (noting a subsequent change in state\nlaw, but relying on the burglary statutes in force “[i]n\nthose years” in which Taylor was convicted). Similarly, in\nJames v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007), this Court\nlooked to the versions of Florida’s burglary and criminal\nattempt statutes that were in effect “at the time of James’\n[1993 state] conviction.” Id., at 197; see ibid. (quoting the\n1993 versions of the Florida statutes). The present-tense\nverbs in the definition of “violent felony” did not persuade\nus to look anywhere other than the law under which the\ndefendants were actually convicted to determine the ele\nments of their offenses.\n   Having repeatedly looked to the historical statute of\nconviction in the context of violent felonies, we see no\nreason to interpret “serious drug offenses” in the adjacent\nsection of the same statute any differently. In both defini\n6                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past\nconvictions. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 8) (“Where, as here, Congress uses\nsimilar statutory language . . . in two adjoining provisions,\nit normally intends similar interpretations”).\n                             C\n   This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd\nresults that would follow from consulting current state law\nto define a previous offense. See United States v. Wilson,\n503 U. S. 329, 334 (1992) (“[A]bsurd results are to be\navoided”).\n   For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach,\na prior conviction could “disappear” entirely for ACCA\npurposes if a State reformulated the offense between the\ndefendant’s state conviction and federal sentencing. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 12–13. The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar\nscenario in Mallett v. United States, 334 F. 3d 491 (2003),\nwhere Ohio had substantially changed how drug quanti\nties were measured since Mallett’s state drug conviction.\nId., at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the\ncareer offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines).\nThe Sixth Circuit could not “determine how Mallett would\nnow be sentenced under Ohio’s revised drug laws” because\nthe offense for which he had been convicted “no longer\nexist[ed] and no conversion between the former and\namended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.” Ibid. The\ncourt therefore was compelled to look to state law “as of\nthe time of the state-court conviction” to determine the\nmaximum possible sentence for Mallet’s prior offense. Id.,\nat 503.\n   It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state\nlaw can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes. A\ndefendant’s history of criminal activity—and the culpabil\nity and dangerousness that such history demonstrates—\ndoes not cease to exist when a State reformulates its\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncriminal statutes in a way that prevents precise transla\ntion of the old conviction into the new statutes. Congress\nbased ACCA’s sentencing enhancement on prior convic\ntions and could not have expected courts to treat those\nconvictions as if they had simply disappeared. To the\ncontrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior\nviolent felony conviction remains a “conviction” unless it\nhas been “expunged, or set aside or [the] person has been\npardoned or has had civil rights restored.” 18 U. S. C.\n§921(a)(20); see also Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,\n491 (1994) (explaining that §921(a)(20) “creates a clear\nnegative implication that courts may count a conviction\nthat has not been set aside”).\n   In addition, McNeill’s interpretation would make\nACCA’s applicability depend on the timing of the federal\nsentencing proceeding. McNeill cannot explain why two\ndefendants who violated §922(g) on the same day and who\nhad identical criminal histories—down to the dates on\nwhich they committed and were sentenced for their prior\noffenses—should receive dramatically different federal\nsentences solely because one’s §922(g) sentencing hap\npened to occur after the state legislature amended the\npunishment for one of the shared prior offenses. In con\ntrast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to\nknow even before he violates §922(g) whether ACCA\nwould apply.\n                              III\n   Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the\nDistrict Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en\nhancement to McNeill. In light of his two admitted violent\nfelony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for\na “serious drug offense” to trigger ACCA, but we note that\nall six of his prior drug convictions qualify.\n   In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was\nsentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses:\n8                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nselling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991\nand possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion\nin February 1992. At the time of McNeill’s November\n1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dic\ntated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in\n1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine\nwith intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison. See\nN. C. Gen. Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1)\n(Michie 1991). McNeill’s 1992 convictions were therefore\nfor “serious drug offenses” within the meaning of ACCA.\n  McNeill’s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with\nintent to sell in September 1994. He pleaded guilty and\nwas sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995. By\nApril 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence\napplicable to that type of drug offense but still provided\nthat the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with\nintent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison.\nSee 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §2 (repealing N. C.\nGen Stat. §14–1.1); 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §56 (as\nmodified by Extra Session 1994 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 24,\n§14(b)) (“This act becomes effective October 1, 1994, and\napplies only to offenses occurring on or after that date.\nProsecutions for, or sentences based on, offenses occurring\nbefore the effective date of this act [are controlled by] the\nstatutes that would be applicable to those prosecutions or\nsentences but for the provisions of this act”). Therefore,\nMcNeill’s 1995 conviction was also for a “serious drug\noffense.”\n                       *     *    *\n  We conclude that a federal sentencing court must de\ntermine whether “an offense under State law” is a “serious\ndrug offense” by consulting the “maximum term of impris\nonment” applicable to a defendant’s previous drug offense\nat the time of the defendant’s state conviction for that\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

In sentencing petitioner McNeill for violat\n ing §922(g), the District Court determined that he qualified for\n ACCA’s sentencing enhancement based in part on six prior North\n Carolina drug trafficking convictions. When McNeill committed\n those crimes, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, which\n McNeill in fact received. However, because the State later reduced\n the maximum sentence for those offenses to fewer than 10 years,\n McNeill argued that none of his six prior convictions were for “serious\n drug offenses” within the meaning of §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The District\n Court rejected McNeill’s request that it look to current state law and\n instead relied on the 10-year maximum sentence that applied at the\n time he committed his state offenses. The Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. A federal sentencing court must determine whether “an offense\n under State law” is a “serious drug offense” by consulting the “maxi\n mum term of imprisonment” applicable to a defendant’s prior state\n drug offense at the time of the defendant’s conviction for that offense.\n §924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Pp. 3–7.\n       (a) ACCA’s plain text requires this result by mandating that the\n court determine whether a “previous conviction” was for a serious\n drug offense. The only way to answer this backward-looking question\n is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.\n2                      MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ACCA’s use of the present tense in defining a “serious drug offense”\n    as, inter alia, “an offense . . . for which a maximum [10-year] term . . .\n    is prescribed by law” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill’s argument\n    that this language looks to the state law in effect at the time of the\n    federal sentencing ignores ACCA’s focus on convictions that have al\n    ready occurred. Pp. 3–4.\n          (b) The statute’s broader context, specifically the adjacent defini\n    tion of “violent felony,” confirms this interpretation. Although Con\n    gress used the present tense in defining “violent felony,” see\n    §924(e)(2)(B), this Court has repeatedly turned to the version of state\n    law that the defendant was actually convicted of violating in deter\n    mining whether he was convicted of such a felony, see, e.g., Taylor v.\n    United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. The Court sees no reason to inter\n    pret “serious drug offenses” any differently. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder,\n    557 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–6.\n          (c) This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd results\n    that would follow from consulting current state law to define a previ\n    ous offense. Pp. 6–7.\n       2. The District Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en\n    hancement to McNeill because all six of his prior drug convictions\n    were for “serious drug offenses.” Pp. 7–8.\n598 F. 3d 161, affirmed.\n\n    THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 563 U.

S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The question in this case concerns how a\nfederal court should determine the maximum sentence for\na prior state drug offense for ACCA purposes. We hold\nthat the “maximum term of imprisonment” for a defen\ndant’s prior state drug offense is the maximum sentence\napplicable to his offense when he was convicted of it.\n                            I\n  After an extended chase, police officers in Fayetteville,\nNorth Carolina apprehended petitioner Clifton Terelle\nMcNeill. McNeill was caught with 3.1 grams of crack\ncocaine packaged for distribution and a .38-caliber re\nvolver. In August 2008, he pleaded guilty to unlawful\npossession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1),\nand possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21\nU. S. C. §841(a)(1).\n  At sentencing, the District Court determined that\n2                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcNeill qualified for ACCA’s sentencing enhancement.\nUnder ACCA, a person who violates 18 U. S. C. §922(g)\nand “has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony\nor a serious drug offense” is subject to a 15-year minimum\nprison sentence. §924(e)(1). McNeill conceded that two of\nhis prior convictions—assault with a deadly weapon and\nrobbery—were for “violent felonies.”\n  McNeill argued, however, that none of his six state drug\ntrafficking convictions were for “serious drug offenses” be\ncause those crimes no longer carried a “maximum term\nof imprisonment of ten years or more.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\nWhen McNeill committed those crimes between 1991 and\n1994, each carried a 10-year maximum sentence, and\nMcNeill in fact received 10-year sentences. See N. C. Gen.\nStat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Michie 1993)\n(sale of cocaine and possession with intent to sell cocaine).\nBut as of October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the\nmaximum sentence for selling cocaine to 38 months and\nthe maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent\nto sell to 30 months. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§15A–\n1340.17(c) and (d), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Lexis 2009).\n  The District Court rejected McNeill’s request that it\nlook to current state law and instead relied on the 10-year\nmaximum sentence that applied to McNeill’s drug offenses\nat the time he committed them. No. 5:08–CR–2–D–1\n(EDNC, Jan. 26, 2009), App. 118. Finding that McNeill\ntherefore had three prior convictions for violent felonies or\nserious drug offenses, the court applied ACCA’s sentencing\nenhancement. The court then departed upward from the\nadvisory Sentencing Guidelines range and sentenced\nMcNeill to 300 months in prison in light of his “long and\nunrelenting history of serious criminal conduct” and “near\ncertain likelihood of recidivism.” Id., at 119, 121.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nAlthough the court consulted the maximum sentence\nunder current state law, it reached the same conclusion as\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court because North Carolina’s revised sen\ntencing scheme does not apply to crimes committed before\nOctober 1, 1994. 598 F. 3d 161, 165 (2010) (agreeing with\nUnited States v. Hinojosa, 349 F. 3d 200 (CA5 2003), and\ndisagreeing with United States v. Darden, 539 F. 3d 116\n(CA2 2008)). Thus, even if McNeill were convicted today\nfor his 1991, 1992, and September 1994 drug offenses, he\nwould still be subject to the old 10-year statutory maxi\nmum. 598 F. 3d, at 165 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. §15A–\n1340.10 and State v. Branch, 134 N. C. App. 637, 639–640,\n518 S. E. 2d 213, 215 (1999)). We granted certiorari, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm, albeit for a different\nreason.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with\n“the language itself [and] the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S.\n337, 341 (1997). ACCA’s sentencing enhancement applies\nto individuals who have “three previous convictions . . . for\na violent felony or a serious drug offense.” §924(e)(1). As\nrelevant here, the statute defines a “serious drug offense”\nas “an offense under State law, involving manufacturing,\ndistributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or\ndistribute, a controlled substance . . . , for which a maxi\nmum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is pre\nscribed by law.” §924(e)(2)(A)(ii).\n   The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing\ncourt to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a\ndefendant’s previous drug offense at the time of his convic\ntion for that offense. The statute requires the court to\ndetermine whether a “previous conviction” was for a seri\nous drug offense. The only way to answer this backward\nlooking question is to consult the law that applied at the\ntime of that conviction. We did precisely that in United\n4                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377 (2008), where we ad\ndressed whether the “maximum term of imprisonment” in\ncludes recidivism enhancements. In assessing the “max\nimum term of imprisonment” for Rodriguez’s state drug\noffenses, we consulted the version of state law “that\n[he] was convicted of violating,” that is, the 1994 statutes\nand penalties that applied to his offenses at the time of his\nstate convictions. Id., at 380–381.\n    Use of the present tense in the definition of “serious\ndrug offense” does not suggest otherwise. McNeill argues\nthat the present-tense verb in the phrase “is prescribed by\nlaw” requires federal courts to determine the maximum\nsentence for a potential predicate offense by looking to the\nstate law in effect at the time of the federal sentencing, as\nif the state offense were committed on the day of federal\nsentencing. That argument overlooks the fact that ACCA\nis concerned with convictions that have already occurred.\nWhether the prior conviction was for an offense “involving\nmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to\nmanufacture or distribute, a controlled substance” can\nonly be answered by reference to the law under which the\ndefendant was convicted. Likewise, the maximum sen\ntence that “is prescribed by law” for that offense must also\nbe determined according to the law applicable at that\ntime.\n    McNeill’s interpretation contorts the plain meaning of\nthe statute. Although North Carolina courts actually\nsentenced him to 10 years in prison for his drug offenses,\nMcNeill now contends that the “maximum term of impris\nonment” for those offenses is 30 or 38 months. We find it\n“hard to accept the proposition that a defendant may\nlawfully [have] be[en] sentenced to a term of imprison\nment that exceeds the ‘maximum term of imprisonment\n. . . prescribed by law.’ ” Id., at 383.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   The “broader context of the statute as a whole,” specifi\ncally the adjacent definition of “violent felony,” confirms\nthis interpretation. Robinson, supra, at 341. ACCA de\nfines “violent felony” in part as a crime that “has as an\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person of another” or “is bur\nglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B) (em\nphasis added).\n   Despite Congress’ use of present tense in that definition,\nwhen determining whether a defendant was convicted of a\n“violent felony,” we have turned to the version of state law\nthat the defendant was actually convicted of violating. In\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), the Court\nheld that whether Taylor’s 1963 and 1971 convictions were\nfor a crime that “is burglary” depended on the “former\nMissouri statutes defining second-degree burglary” that\n“were the bases for Taylor’s prior convictions.” Id., at 602;\nsee id., at 578, n. 1 (noting a subsequent change in state\nlaw, but relying on the burglary statutes in force “[i]n\nthose years” in which Taylor was convicted). Similarly, in\nJames v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007), this Court\nlooked to the versions of Florida’s burglary and criminal\nattempt statutes that were in effect “at the time of James’\n[1993 state] conviction.” Id., at 197; see ibid. (quoting the\n1993 versions of the Florida statutes). The present-tense\nverbs in the definition of “violent felony” did not persuade\nus to look anywhere other than the law under which the\ndefendants were actually convicted to determine the ele\nments of their offenses.\n   Having repeatedly looked to the historical statute of\nconviction in the context of violent felonies, we see no\nreason to interpret “serious drug offenses” in the adjacent\nsection of the same statute any differently. In both defini\n6                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions, Congress used the present tense to refer to past\nconvictions. Cf. Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 8) (“Where, as here, Congress uses\nsimilar statutory language . . . in two adjoining provisions,\nit normally intends similar interpretations”).\n                             C\n   This natural reading of ACCA also avoids the absurd\nresults that would follow from consulting current state law\nto define a previous offense. See United States v. Wilson,\n503 U. S. 329, 334 (1992) (“[A]bsurd results are to be\navoided”).\n   For example, McNeill concedes that under his approach,\na prior conviction could “disappear” entirely for ACCA\npurposes if a State reformulated the offense between the\ndefendant’s state conviction and federal sentencing. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 12–13. The Sixth Circuit confronted a similar\nscenario in Mallett v. United States, 334 F. 3d 491 (2003),\nwhere Ohio had substantially changed how drug quanti\nties were measured since Mallett’s state drug conviction.\nId., at 502 (addressing this issue in the context of the\ncareer offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines).\nThe Sixth Circuit could not “determine how Mallett would\nnow be sentenced under Ohio’s revised drug laws” because\nthe offense for which he had been convicted “no longer\nexist[ed] and no conversion between the former and\namended statutes [wa]s facially apparent.” Ibid. The\ncourt therefore was compelled to look to state law “as of\nthe time of the state-court conviction” to determine the\nmaximum possible sentence for Mallet’s prior offense. Id.,\nat 503.\n   It cannot be correct that subsequent changes in state\nlaw can erase an earlier conviction for ACCA purposes. A\ndefendant’s history of criminal activity—and the culpabil\nity and dangerousness that such history demonstrates—\ndoes not cease to exist when a State reformulates its\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncriminal statutes in a way that prevents precise transla\ntion of the old conviction into the new statutes. Congress\nbased ACCA’s sentencing enhancement on prior convic\ntions and could not have expected courts to treat those\nconvictions as if they had simply disappeared. To the\ncontrary, Congress has expressly directed that a prior\nviolent felony conviction remains a “conviction” unless it\nhas been “expunged, or set aside or [the] person has been\npardoned or has had civil rights restored.” 18 U. S. C.\n§921(a)(20); see also Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,\n491 (1994) (explaining that §921(a)(20) “creates a clear\nnegative implication that courts may count a conviction\nthat has not been set aside”).\n   In addition, McNeill’s interpretation would make\nACCA’s applicability depend on the timing of the federal\nsentencing proceeding. McNeill cannot explain why two\ndefendants who violated §922(g) on the same day and who\nhad identical criminal histories—down to the dates on\nwhich they committed and were sentenced for their prior\noffenses—should receive dramatically different federal\nsentences solely because one’s §922(g) sentencing hap\npened to occur after the state legislature amended the\npunishment for one of the shared prior offenses. In con\ntrast, the interpretation we adopt permits a defendant to\nknow even before he violates §922(g) whether ACCA\nwould apply.\n                              III\n   Applying our holding to this case, we conclude that the\nDistrict Court properly applied ACCA’s sentencing en\nhancement to McNeill. In light of his two admitted violent\nfelony convictions, McNeill needed only one conviction for\na “serious drug offense” to trigger ACCA, but we note that\nall six of his prior drug convictions qualify.\n   In November 1992, McNeill pleaded guilty and was\nsentenced in a North Carolina court for five offenses:\n8                MCNEILL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nselling cocaine on four separate occasions in October 1991\nand possessing cocaine with intent to sell on one occasion\nin February 1992. At the time of McNeill’s November\n1992 conviction and sentencing, North Carolina law dic\ntated that the maximum sentence for selling cocaine in\n1991 and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine\nwith intent to sell in 1992 was 10 years in prison. See\nN. C. Gen. Stat. §§14–1.1(a)(8), 90–95(a)(1) and (b)(1)\n(Michie 1991). McNeill’s 1992 convictions were therefore\nfor “serious drug offenses” within the meaning of ACCA.\n  McNeill’s sixth drug offense was possessing cocaine with\nintent to sell in September 1994. He pleaded guilty and\nwas sentenced in a North Carolina court in April 1995. By\nApril 1995, North Carolina had changed the sentence\napplicable to that type of drug offense but still provided\nthat the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with\nintent to sell in September 1994 was 10 years in prison.\nSee 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §2 (repealing N. C.\nGen Stat. §14–1.1); 1993 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 538, §56 (as\nmodified by Extra Session 1994 N. C. Sess. Laws, ch. 24,\n§14(b)) (“This act becomes effective October 1, 1994, and\napplies only to offenses occurring on or after that date.\nProsecutions for, or sentences based on, offenses occurring\nbefore the effective date of this act [are controlled by] the\nstatutes that would be applicable to those prosecutions or\nsentences but for the provisions of this act”). Therefore,\nMcNeill’s 1995 conviction was also for a “serious drug\noffense.”\n                       *     *    *\n  We conclude that a federal sentencing court must de\ntermine whether “an offense under State law” is a “serious\ndrug offense” by consulting the “maximum term of impris\nonment” applicable to a defendant’s previous drug offense\nat the time of the defendant’s state conviction for that\n                    Cite as: 563 U.
