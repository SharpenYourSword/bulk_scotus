Argued February 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 6, 2011\nIn 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to\n  develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immu\n  nodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize\n  winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral\n  part of these efforts.\n     In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford\n  University\u2019s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of\n  new AIDS drugs. Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow\n  in the department around that time. When he did so, he signed an\n  agreement stating that he \u201cagree[d] to assign\u201d to Stanford his \u201cright,\n  title and interest in\u201d inventions resulting from his employment there.\n  Holodniy\u2019s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus\n  to learn about PCR. As a condition of gaining access to Cetus,\n  Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he \u201cwill as\n  sign and do[es] hereby assign\u201d to Cetus his \u201cright, title and interest\n  in . . . the ideas, inventions, and improvements\u201d made \u201cas a conse\n  quence of [his] access\u201d to Cetus. Working with Cetus employees,\n  Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount\n  of HIV in a patient\u2019s blood. Upon returning to Stanford, he and other\n  Stanford employees tested the procedure. Stanford secured three\n  patents to the measurement process.\n     Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus\u2019s PCR-related assets.\n  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method de\n  veloped at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, its\n  HIV test kits are used worldwide.\n     The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980\n2      BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n          UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded \u201csubject\n    invention[s]\u201d between the Federal Government and federal contrac\n    tors. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines \u201csubject inven\n    tion\u201d as \u201cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually\n    reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding\n    agreement,\u201d \u00a7201(e), and provides that contractors may \u201celect to re\n    tain title to any subject invention,\u201d \u00a7202(a). Because some of Stan\n    ford\u2019s research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by\n    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.\n    In accordance with the Act\u2019s requirements, Stanford notified NIH\n    that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on\n    the Government a license to use the patented procedure.\n       Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit\n    against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits in\n    fringed Stanford\u2019s patents. Roche responded that Holodniy\u2019s agree\n    ment with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus\n    Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement. Stanford\n    countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer\n    sity had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. The District Court\n    agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holod\n    niy had no rights to assign to Cetus. The Court of Appeals for the\n    Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy\u2019s agreement with\n    Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche. It also found\n    that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor\u2019s\n    rights in federally funded inventions. Thus, the Act did not extin\n    guish Roche\u2019s ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was\n    deprived of standing.\nHeld: The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally\n funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to\n unilaterally take title to such inventions. Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights\n in an invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v. Wilder, 10\n How. 477, 493. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an ap\n plying inventor, or\u2014because an inventor\u2019s interest in his invention is\n assignable in law by an instrument in writing\u2014an inventor\u2019s as\n signee. See United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178,\n 187. Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not\n have rights in an invention \u201cwhich is the original conception of the\n employee alone,\u201d id., at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those\n rights to his employer, see id., at 187. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Stanford and amicus United States contend that, when an in\n vention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of\n federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the\n inventor\u2019s employer\u2014the federal contractor. Congress has in the\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npast divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing un\nambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified\nfederal contracts become the Government\u2019s property. Such unambi\nguous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act. Instead,\nthe Act provides that contractors may \u201celect to retain title to any sub\nject invention,\u201d \u00a7202(a), defining a \u201csubject invention\u201d as \u201cany inven\ntion of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in\nthe performance of work under a funding agreement,\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n   Stanford contends that \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d means all in\nventions that a contractor\u2019s employees make with the aid of federal\nfunds. That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two cen\nturies of patent law in a statutory definition. This Court has rejected\nthe idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an em\nployee\u2019s invention in the employer. Stanford\u2019s reading also renders\nthe phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d superfluous since the definition already\ncovers inventions made under a funding agreement. Construing the\nphrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions con\nceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement\u2014inventions\n\u201cof the contractor,\u201d that is, those owned by or belonging to the con\ntractor\u2014makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.\nAnd \u201cinvention owned by the contractor\u201d or \u201cinvention belonging to\nthe contractor\u201d are natural readings of the phrase \u201cinvention of the\ncontractor.\u201d\n   Section 202(a), which states that contractors may \u201celect to retain\ntitle,\u201d confirms that the Act does not vest title. Stanford reaches the\nopposite conclusion, but only because it reads \u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cac\nquire\u201d and \u201creceive.\u201d That is certainly not the common meaning of\n\u201cretain,\u201d which is \u201cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\u201d\nYou cannot retain something unless you already have it. And\n\u00a7210(a)\u2014which provides that the Act \u201ctake[s] precedence over any\nother Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inven\ntions . . . that is inconsistent with\u201d the Act\u2014does not displace the ba\nsic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention. Only\nwhen an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act\ncome into play. The Act\u2019s disposition of rights does nothing more\nthan clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Gov\nernment and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that\nalready belongs to the contractor.\n   The Act\u2019s isolated provisions dealing with inventors\u2019 rights in sub\nject inventions are consistent with the Court\u2019s construction of the Act.\nSee \u00a7202(d). That construction is also bolstered by the Act\u2019s limited\nprocedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to\nchallenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a\nsubject invention, \u00a7202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for\n4      BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n          UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    inventor and third-party rights.\n       Stanford\u2019s contrary construction would permit title to an em\n    ployee\u2019s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was\n    conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the in\n    vention\u2019s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding. It\n    also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar\n    of federal funding applied toward an invention\u2019s conception or reduc\n    tion to practice. It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to sup\n    plant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive in\n    ventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under such\n    unusual terms would be truly surprising. Had Congress intended\n    such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so\n    clearly\u2014not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of \u201csubject\n    invention\u201d and an idiosyncratic use of the word \u201cretain.\u201d\n       The Court\u2019s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common\n    practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their\n    employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typi\n    cally expect those contractors to obtain assignments. With effective\n    assignments, federally funded inventions become \u201csubject inventions\u201d\n    and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stan\n    ford says it should. The only significant difference is that it does so\n    without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own\n    their inventions.

The\nquestion here is whether the University and Small Busi\nness Patent Procedures Act of 1980\u2014commonly referred to\nas the Bayh-Dole Act\u2014displaces that norm and automati\ncally vests title to federally funded inventions in federal\ncontractors. We hold that it does not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n   In 1985, a small California research company called\nCetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood\nborne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the\nvirus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize winning technique\ndeveloped at Cetus\u2014polymerase chain reaction, or PCR\u2014\nwas an integral part of these efforts. PCR allows billions\nof copies of DNA sequences to be made from a small initial\nblood sample.\n   In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at\n2   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStanford University\u2019s Department of Infectious Diseases\nto test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr. Mark Holodniy\njoined Stanford as a research fellow in the department\naround that time. When he did so, he signed a Copyright\nand Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he \u201cagree[d] to\nassign\u201d to Stanford his \u201cright, title and interest in\u201d inven\ntions resulting from his employment at the University.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 118a\u2013119a.\n   At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an improved\nmethod for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood sam\nples, using PCR. Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar\nwith PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct\nresearch at Cetus. As a condition of gaining access to\nCetus, Holodniy signed a Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agree\nment (VCA). That agreement stated that Holodniy \u201cwill\nassign and do[es] hereby assign\u201d to Cetus his \u201cright, title\nand interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improve\nments\u201d made \u201cas a consequence of [his] access\u201d to Cetus.\nId., at 122a\u2013124a.\n   For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted research\nat Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy de\nvised a PCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of\nHIV in a patient\u2019s blood. That technique allowed doctors\nto determine whether a patient was benefiting from HIV\ntherapy.\n   Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other\nUniversity employees tested the HIV measurement tech\nnique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written\nassignments of rights from the Stanford employees in\nvolved in refinement of the technique, including Holodniy,\nand filed several patent applications related to the proce\ndure. Stanford secured three patents to the HIV meas\nurement process.\n   In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company that\nspecializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus\u2019s\nPCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had ob\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantifica\ntion method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the\nprocedure. Today, Roche\u2019s HIV test \u201ckits are used in\nhospitals and AIDS clinics worldwide.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 10\u201311.\n                              B\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act to \u201cpromote\nthe utilization of inventions arising from federally sup\nported research,\u201d \u201cpromote collaboration between commer\ncial concerns and nonprofit organizations,\u201d and \u201censure\nthat the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally\nsupported inventions.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7200. To achieve these\naims, the Act allocates rights in federally funded \u201csubject\ninvention[s]\u201d between the Federal Government and federal\ncontractors (\u201cany person, small business firm, or nonprofit\norganization that is a party to a funding agreement\u201d).\n\u00a7\u00a7201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines \u201csubject invention\u201d\nas \u201cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actu\nally reduced to practice in the performance of work under\na funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n  The Bayh-Dole Act provides that contractors may \u201celect\nto retain title to any subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(a). To be\nable to retain title, a contractor must fulfill a number of\nobligations imposed by the statute. The contractor must\n\u201cdisclose each subject invention to the [relevant] Federal\nagency within a reasonable time\u201d; it must \u201cmake a written\nelection within two years after disclosure\u201d stating that\nthe contractor opts to retain title to the invention; and the\ncontractor must \u201cfile a patent application prior to any\nstatutory bar date.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7202(c)(1)\u2013(3). The \u201cFederal Gov\nernment may receive title\u201d to a subject invention if a\ncontractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.\nIbid.\n  The Government has several rights in federally funded\n4   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsubject inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act. The agency\nthat granted the federal funds receives from the contractor\n\u201ca nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up\nlicense to practice . . . [the] subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(c)(4).\nThe agency also possesses \u201c[m]arch-in rights,\u201d which\npermit the agency to grant a license to a responsible third\nparty under certain circumstances, such as when the con\ntractor fails to take \u201ceffective steps to achieve practical\napplication\u201d of the invention. \u00a7203. The Act further pro\nvides that when the contractor does not elect to retain title\nto a subject invention, the Government \u201cmay consider and\nafter consultation with the contractor grant requests for\nretention of rights by the inventor.\u201d \u00a7202(d).\n   Some of Stanford\u2019s research related to the HIV meas\nurement technique was funded by the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the\nBayh-Dole Act. Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the in\nvention, conferred on the Government a nonexclusive,\nnontransferable, paid-up license to use the patented proce\ndure, and formally notified NIH that it elected to retain\ntitle to the invention.\n                             C\n   In 2005, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University\nfiled suit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Roche\nDiagnostics Corporation, and Roche Diagnostics Opera\ntions, Inc. (collectively Roche), contending that Roche\u2019s\nHIV test kits infringed Stanford\u2019s patents. As relevant\nhere, Roche responded by asserting that it was a co-owner\nof the HIV quantification procedure, based on Holodniy\u2019s\nassignment of his rights in the Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality\nAgreement. As a result, Roche argued, Stanford lacked\nstanding to sue it for patent infringement. 487 F. Supp.\n2d 1099, 1111, 1115 (ND Cal. 2007). Stanford claimed\nthat Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer\nsity\u2019s HIV research was federally funded, giving the school\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuperior rights in the invention under the Bayh-Dole Act.\nIbid.1\n  The District Court held that the \u201cVCA effectively as\nsigned any rights that Holodniy had in the patented in\nvention to Cetus,\u201d and thus to Roche. Id., at 1117. But\nbecause of the operation of the Bayh-Dole Act, \u201cHolodniy\nhad no interest to assign.\u201d Id., at 1117, 1119. The court\nconcluded that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201cprovides that the indi\nvidual inventor may obtain title\u201d to a federally funded\ninvention \u201conly after the government and the contracting\nparty have declined to do so.\u201d Id., at 1118.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed.\nFirst, the court concluded that Holodniy\u2019s initial agree\nment with Stanford in the Copyright and Patent Agree\nment constituted a mere promise to assign rights in the\nfuture, unlike Holodniy\u2019s agreement with Cetus in the\nVisitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agreement, which itself assigned\nHolodniy\u2019s rights in the invention to Cetus. See 583 F. 3d\n832, 841\u2013842 (2009). Therefore, as a matter of contract\nlaw, Cetus obtained Holodniy\u2019s rights in the HIV quantifi\ncation technique through the VCA.2 Next, the court ex\nplained that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201cdoes not automatically\nvoid ab initio the inventors\u2019 rights in government-funded\ninventions\u201d and that the \u201cstatutory scheme did not auto\nmatically void the patent rights that Cetus received from\nHolodniy.\u201d Id., at 844\u2013845. The court held that \u201cRoche\npossesse[d] an ownership interest in the patents-in-suit\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Roche submitted a host of other claims to the District Court, includ\n\ning that it had \u201cshop rights\u201d to the patents and was entitled to a license\nto use the patents.

S. Const. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. The first\nCongress put that power to use by enacting the Patent Act\nof 1790. That Act provided \u201c[t]hat upon the petition of any\nperson or persons . . . setting forth, that he, she, or they,\nhath or have invented or discovered\u201d an invention, a pat\nent could be granted to \u201csuch petitioner or petitioners\u201d or\n\u201ctheir heirs, administrators or assigns.\u201d Act of Apr. 10,\n1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 109\u2013110. Under that law, the first patent\nwas granted in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins, who had devised\nan improved method for making potash, America\u2019s first\nindustrial chemical. U. S. Patent No. 1 (issued July 31,\n1790).3\n   Although much in intellectual property law has changed\nin the 220 years since the first Patent Act, the basic idea\nthat inventors have the right to patent their inventions\nhas not. Under the law in its current form, \u201c[w]hoever\ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter . . . may obtain a\npatent therefor.\u201d 35 U.

In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an\napplying inventor, or\u2014because an inventor\u2019s interest in\nhis invention is \u201cassignable in law by an instrument in\nwriting\u201d\u2014an inventor\u2019s assignee. \u00a7\u00a7151, 152, 261.\n   Our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in\nan invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v.\nWilder, 10 How. 477, 493 (1851) (\u201cthe discoverer of a new\nand useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate\nright to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make\nabsolute by proceeding in the manner which the law re\nquires\u201d); Solomons v. United States, 137 U. S. 342, 346\n(1890) (\u201cwhatever invention [an inventor] may thus con\nceive and perfect is his individual property\u201d); United\nStates v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178, 188\n(1933) (an inventor owns \u201cthe product of [his] original\nthought\u201d). The treatises are to the same effect. See, e.g., 8\nChisum on Patents \u00a722.01, p. 22\u20132 (2011) (\u201cThe presump\ntive owner of the property right in a patentable invention\nis the single human inventor\u201d).\n   It is equally well established that an inventor can assign\nhis rights in an invention to a third party. See Dubilier\nCondenser Corp., supra, at 187 (\u201cA patent is property and\ntitle to it can pass only by assignment\u201d); 8 Chisum on\nPatents, supra, \u00a722.01, at 22\u20132 (\u201cThe inventor . . . [may]\ntransfer ownership interests by written assignment to\nanyone\u201d). Thus, although others may acquire an interest\nin an invention, any such interest\u2014as a general rule\u2014\nmust trace back to the inventor.\n   In accordance with these principles, we have recognized\nthat unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an\nemployer does not have rights in an invention \u201cwhich is\nthe original conception of the employee alone.\u201d Dubilier\nCondenser Corp., 289 U. S., at 189. Such an invention\n\u201cremains the property of him who conceived it.\u201d Ibid. In\nmost circumstances, an inventor must expressly grant his\nrights in an invention to his employer if the employer is to\n8   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nobtain those rights. See id., at 187 (\u201cThe respective rights\nand obligations of employer and employee, touching an\ninvention conceived by the latter, spring from the contract\nof employment\u201d).\n                             B\n   Stanford and the United States as amicus curiae con\ntend that the Bayh-Dole Act reorders the normal priority\nof rights in an invention when the invention is conceived\nor first reduced to practice with the support of federal\nfunds. In their view, the Act moves inventors from the\nfront of the line to the back by vesting title to federally\nfunded inventions in the inventor\u2019s employer\u2014the federal\ncontractor. See Brief for Petitioner 26\u201327; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 6.\n   Congress has in the past divested inventors of their\nrights in inventions by providing unambiguously that\ninventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts\nbecome the property of the United States. For example,\nwith respect to certain contracts dealing with nuclear\nmaterial and atomic energy, Congress provided that title\nto such inventions \u201cshall be vested in, and be the property\nof, the [Atomic Energy] Commission.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72182.\nCongress has also enacted laws requiring that title to\ncertain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration \u201cshall be\nthe exclusive property of the United States,\u201d Pub. L. 111\u2013\n314, \u00a73, 124 Stat. 3339, 51 U. S. C. \u00a720135(b)(1), and that\ntitle to certain inventions under contracts with the De\npartment of Energy \u201cshall vest in the United States.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a75908.\n   Such language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole\nAct. Nowhere in the Act is title expressly vested in con\ntractors or anyone else; nowhere in the Act are inventors\nexpressly deprived of their interest in federally funded\ninventions. Instead, the Act provides that contractors may\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

A \u201csubject invention\u201d is defined as \u201cany invention\nof the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to\npractice in the performance of work under a funding\nagreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n   Stanford asserts that the phrase \u201cinvention of the con\ntractor\u201d in this provision \u201cis naturally read to include all\ninventions made by the contractor\u2019s employees with the\naid of federal funding.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32 (footnote\nomitted). That reading assumes that Congress subtly set\naside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.\nIt also renders the phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d superfluous.\nIf the phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d were deleted from the\ndefinition of \u201csubject invention,\u201d the definition would cover\n\u201cany invention . . . conceived or first actually reduced to\npractice in the performance of work under a funding\nagreement.\u201d Reading \u201cof the contractor\u201d to mean \u201call\ninventions made by the contractor\u2019s employees with the\naid of federal funding,\u201d as Stanford would, adds nothing\nthat is not already in the definition, since the definition\nalready covers inventions made under the funding agree\nment. That is contrary to our general \u201creluctan[ce] to\ntreat statutory terms as surplusage.\u201d Duncan v. Walker,\n533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular\ncategory of inventions conceived or reduced to practice\nunder a funding agreement\u2014inventions \u201cof the contrac\ntor,\u201d that is, those owned by or belonging to the con\ntractor\u2014makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory\ndefinition. And \u201cinvention owned by the contractor\u201d or\n\u201cinvention belonging to the contractor\u201d are natural read\nings of the phrase \u201cinvention of the contractor.\u201d As we\nhave explained, \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018of\u2019 denotes owner\nship.\u201d Poe v.

No one would\nclaim that an autoworker who builds a car while working\nin a factory owns that car. But, as noted, patent law has\nalways been different: We have rejected the idea that mere\nemployment is sufficient to vest title to an employee\u2019s\ninvention in the employer. Against this background, a\ncontractor\u2019s invention\u2014an \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d\u2014\ndoes not automatically include inventions made by the\ncontractor\u2019s employees.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent suggests that \u201cwe could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as\nordinarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an assignment\nof patent rights by the federally funded employee to the federally\nfunded employer.\u201d Post, at 8.

S. C. \u00a7202(a) (emphasis added). Stanford\nreaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads\n\u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cacquire\u201d and \u201creceive.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is\ncertainly not the common meaning of \u201cretain.\u201d \u201c[R]etain\u201d\nmeans \u201cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third, supra, at 1938; see Webster\u2019s New Colle\ngiate Dictionary 980 (1980) (\u201cto keep in possession or\nuse\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 1109 (1969) (\u201c[t]o\nkeep or hold in one\u2019s possession\u201d). You cannot retain\nsomething unless you already have it. See Alaska v.\nUnited States, 545 U. S. 75, 104 (2005) (interpreting the\nphrase \u201cthe United States shall retain title to all property\u201d\nto mean that \u201c[t]he United States . . . retained title to its\nproperty located within Alaska\u2019s borders\u201d) (emphasis\nadded). The Bayh-Dole Act does not confer title to feder\nally funded inventions on contractors or authorize contrac\ntors to unilaterally take title to those inventions; it simply\nassures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it\nis they already have. Such a provision makes sense in a\nstatute specifying the respective rights and responsibili\nties of federal contractors and the Government.\n   The Bayh-Dole Act states that it \u201ctake[s] precedence\nover any other Act which would require a disposition of\nrights in subject inventions . . . that is inconsistent with\u201d\nthe Act. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7210(a). The United States as amicus\ncuriae argues that this provision operates to displace the\nbasic principle, codified in the Patent Act, that an inventor\nowns the rights to his invention. See Brief for United\nStates 21. But because the Bayh-Dole Act, including\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nequivalent executive order governing invention rights with respect to \n\nfederally funded research; that issue is of course addressed by the \n\nBayh-Dole Act. \n\n12   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7210(a), applies only to \u201csubject inventions\u201d\u2014\u201cinventions\nof the contractor\u201d\u2014it does not displace an inventor\u2019s ante\ncedent title to his invention. Only when an invention\nbelongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into\nplay. The Act\u2019s disposition of rights\u2014like much of the\nrest of the Bayh-Dole Act\u2014serves to clarify the order of\npriority of rights between the Federal Government and a\nfederal contractor in a federally funded invention that\nalready belongs to the contractor. Nothing more.5\n  The isolated provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act dealing\nwith inventors\u2019 rights in subject inventions are consistent\nwith our construction of the Act. Under the Act, a federal\nagency may \u201cgrant requests for retention of rights by the\ninventor . . . [i]f a contractor does not elect to retain title to\na subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(d). If an employee inventor\nnever had title to his invention because title vested in the\ncontractor by operation of law\u2014as Stanford submits\u2014it\nwould be odd to allow the Government to grant \u201crequests\nfor retention of rights by the inventor.\u201d By using the word\n\u201cretention,\u201d \u00a7202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights\nin the subject invention at some point, undermining the\nnotion that the Act automatically vests title to federally\nfunded inventions in federal contractors.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Far from superseding the Patent Act in such a backhanded way, it is\nclear that \u00a7210(a)\u2019s concern is far narrower. That provision specifies 21\ndifferent statutory provisions that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201ctake[s] prece\ndence over,\u201d the vast majority of which deal with the division of owner\nship in certain inventions between a contractor and the Government.\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7210(a)(1)\u2013(21); see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7210(a)(19)\u2013(20) (the Bayh-Dole\nAct takes precedence over \u201csection 6(b) of the Solar Photovoltaic Energy\nResearch Development and Demonstration Act\u201d and \u201csection 12 of the\nNative Latex Commercialization and Economic Development Act\u201d).\n  6 Stanford contends that it cannot be the case \u201cthat the contractor can\n\nonly \u2018retain title\u2019 to an invention that it already owns, while an inventor\nmay be considered for \u2018retention\u2019 of title only when he has assigned title\naway.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 8. That argument has some force.\nBut there may be situations where an inventor, by the terms of an\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The limited scope of the Act\u2019s procedural protections\nalso bolsters our conclusion. The Bayh-Dole Act expressly\nconfers on contractors the right to challenge a Govern\nment-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject\ninvention. \u00a7202(b)(4). As Roche correctly notes, however,\n\u201cthe Act contains not a single procedural protection for\nthird parties that have neither sought nor received federal\nfunds,\u201d such as cooperating private research institutions.\nBrief for Respondents 29. Nor does the Bayh-Dole Act\nallow inventors employed by federal contractors to contest\ntheir employer\u2019s claim to a subject invention. The Act, for\nexample, does not expressly permit an interested third\nparty or an inventor to challenge a claim that a particular\ninvention was supported by federal funding. In a world in\nwhich there is frequent collaboration between private\nentities, inventors, and federal contractors, see Brief for\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\nas Amicus Curiae 22\u201323, that absence would be deeply\ntroubling. But the lack of procedures protecting inventor\nand third-party rights makes perfect sense if the Act\napplies only when a federal contractor has already ac\nquired title to an inventor\u2019s interest. In that case, there is\nno need to protect inventor or third-party rights, because\nthe only rights at issue are those of the contractor and the\nGovernment.\n  The Bayh-Dole Act applies to subject inventions \u201ccon\nceived or first actually reduced to practice in the perform\nance of work\u201d \u201cfunded in whole or in part by the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7201(e), 201(b) (emphasis\nadded). Under Stanford\u2019s construction of the Act, title to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nassignment, has subsidiary rights in an invention to which a contractor\n\nhas title, as \u00a7202(d) suggests. Compare \u00a7202(d) (\u201cretention of rights\u201d)\n\nwith \u00a7202(a) (\u201cretain title\u201d) (emphasis added). And at the end of the \n\nday, it is Stanford\u2019s contention that \u201cretain\u201d must be \u201cread as a syno\n\nnym for \u2018acquire\u2019 or \u2018receive\u2019 \u201d that dooms its argument on this point.\n\nBrief for Petitioner 37. \n\n14   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\none of its employee\u2019s inventions could vest in the Univer\nsity even if the invention was conceived before the inven\ntor became a University employee, so long as the inven\ntion\u2019s reduction to practice was supported by federal\nfunding. What is more, Stanford\u2019s reading suggests that\nthe school would obtain title to one of its employee\u2019s inven\ntions even if only one dollar of federal funding was applied\ntoward the invention\u2019s conception or reduction to practice.\n   It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant\none of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive\ninventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under\nsuch unusual terms would be truly surprising. We are\nconfident that if Congress had intended such a sea change\nin intellectual property rights it would have said so\nclearly\u2014not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of\n\u201csubject invention\u201d and an idiosyncratic use of the word\n\u201cretain.\u201d Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\n531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress . . . does not alter\nthe fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague\nterms or ancillary provisions\u201d).\n   Though unnecessary to our conclusion, it is worth noting\nthat our construction of the Bayh-Dole Act is reflected in\nthe common practice among parties operating under the\nAct. Contractors generally institute policies to obtain\nassignments from their employees. See Brief for Respon\ndents 34; Brief for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufac\nturers of America as Amicus Curiae 13\u201318. Agencies that\ngrant funds to federal contractors typically expect those\ncontractors to obtain assignments. So it is with NIH, the\nagency that granted the federal funds at issue in this case.\nIn guidance documents made available to contractors, NIH\nhas made clear that \u201c[b]y law, an inventor has initial\nownership of an invention \u201d and that contractors should\ntherefore \u201chave in place employee agreements requiring\nan inventor to \u2018assign\u2019 or give ownership of an invention to\nthe organization upon acceptance of Federal funds.\u201d NIH\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Such guidance would be unnecessary if Stan\nford\u2019s reading of the statute were correct.\n   Stanford contends that reading the Bayh-Dole Act as\nnot vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal\ncontractors \u201cfundamentally undermin[es]\u201d the Act\u2019s frame\nwork and severely threatens its continued \u201csuccessful\napplication.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 45. We do not agree. As\njust noted, universities typically enter into agreements\nwith their employees requiring the assignment to the\nuniversity of rights in inventions.

The statute applies to \u201csubject in\nvention[s]\u201d defined as \u201cany invention of the contractor\nconceived or first actually reduced to practice in the per\nformance of work under a funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e)\n(emphasis added).

We all agree\nthat the term covers those employee inventions that the\nemployee properly assigns to the contractor, i.e., his or\nher employer. But does the term \u201csubject invention\u201d\nalso include inventions that the employee fails to assign\nproperly?\n                                 II\n   Congress enacted this statute against a background\nnorm that often, but not always, denies individual inven\ntors patent rights growing out of research for which the\npublic has already paid. This legal norm reflects the fact\nthat patents themselves have both benefits and costs.\nPatents, for example, help to elicit useful inventions and\nresearch and to assure public disclosure of technological\nadvances. See, e.g., Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 219\n(1954); Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 4); id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (Stevens, J., concurring in\njudgment). But patents sometimes mean unnecessarily\nhigh prices or restricted dissemination; and they some\ntimes discourage further innovation and competition by re\nquiring costly searches for earlier, related patents or by\ntying up ideas, which, were they free, would more effec\ntively spur research and development.

Rakove ed. 1999).\n   The importance of assuring this community \u201cbenefit\u201d is\nreflected in legal rules that may deny or limit the award of\npatent rights where the public has already paid to produce\nan invention, lest the public bear the potential costs of\npatent protection where there is no offsetting need for\nsuch protection to elicit that invention. Why should the\npublic have to pay twice for the same invention?\n   Legal rules of this kind include an Executive Order that\nordinarily gives to the Government \u201cthe entire right, title\nand interest\u201d to inventions made by Government employ\nees who \u201cconduct or perform research, development work,\nor both.\u201d 37 CFR \u00a7501.6 (2010) (codifying, as amended,\nExec.

They also include statutes,\nwhich, in specific research areas, give the Government\ntitle to inventions made pursuant to Government con\ntracts. See Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \u00a7152, 68 Stat. 944\n(codified as amended at 42 U. S.

And they have included Government\nregulations, established prior to the Bayh-Dole Act\u2019s en\nactment, that work in roughly similar ways. See, e.g., 45\nCFR \u00a7650.4(b) (1977) (National Science Foundation regu\nlations providing that Foundation would \u201cdetermine the\ndisposition of the invention [made under the grant] and\ntitle to and rights under any patent application\u201d); \u00a7\u00a78.1(a),\n8.2(d) (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\nregulations providing that inventions made under de\npartment grants \u201cshall be subject to determination\u201d by the\nagency and that the department may \u201crequire that all\ndomestic rights in the invention shall be assigned to the\nUnited States\u201d).\n   These legal rules provide the basic background against\nwhich Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act. And the Act\u2019s\nprovisions reflect a related effort to assure that rights to\ninventions arising out of research for which the public has\npaid are distributed and used in ways that further specific\nimportant public interests. I agree with the majority that\nthe Act does not simply take the individual inventors\u2019\nrights and grant them to the Government. Rather, it\nassumes that the federal funds\u2019 recipient, say a university\nor small business, will possess those rights. The Act\nleaves those rights in the hands of that recipient, not\nbecause it seeks to make the public pay twice for the same\ninvention, but for a special public policy reason. In doing\nso, it seeks to encourage those institutions to commercial\nize inventions that otherwise might not realize their po\ntentially beneficial public use. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7200. The Act\nhelps assure that commercialization (while \u201cpromot[ing]\nfree competition\u201d and \u201cprotect[ing] the public,\u201d ibid.) by\nimposing a set of conditions upon the federal funds recipi\nent, by providing that sometimes the Government will\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

That conclusion, in my\nview, is inconsistent with the Act\u2019s basic purposes. It may\nsignificantly undercut the Act\u2019s ability to achieve its objec\ntives. It allows individual inventors, for whose invention\nthe public has paid, to avoid the Act\u2019s corresponding re\nstrictions and conditions. And it makes the commerciali\nzation and marketing of such an invention more difficult:\nA potential purchaser of rights from the contractor, say a\nuniversity, will not know if the university itself possesses\nthe patent right in question or whether, as here, the indi\nvidual, inadvertently or deliberately, has previously as\nsigned the title to a third party.\n   Moreover, I do not agree that the language to which the\nmajority points\u2014the words \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d\nand \u201cretain\u201d\u2014requires its result. As the majority con\ncedes, Stanford\u2019s alternative reading of the phrase \u201c \u2018in\nvention of the contractor\u2019 \u201d is \u201cplausible enough in the\nabstract.\u201d Ante, at 10.

ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe Government\u2019s reading) of the Act because it believes\nthat it is inconsistent with certain background norms of\npatent law, norms that ordinarily provide an individual\ninventor with full patent rights. Ante, at 10. But in my\nview, the competing norms governing rights in inventions\nfor which the public has already paid, along with the\nBayh-Dole Act\u2019s objectives, suggest a different result.\n                               III\n   There are two different legal routes to what I consider\nan interpretation more consistent with the statute\u2019s objec\ntives. First, we could set aside the Federal Circuit\u2019s inter\npretation of the licensing agreements and its related\nlicensing doctrine. That doctrine governs interpretation of\nlicensing agreements made before an invention is con\nceived or reduced to practice. Here, there are two such\nagreements. In the earlier agreement\u2014that between Dr.\nHolodniy and Stanford University\u2014Dr. Holodniy said, \u201cI\nagree to assign . . . to Stanford . . . that right, title and\ninterest in and to . . . such inventions as required by Con\ntracts and Grants.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a (emphasis\nadded). In the later agreement\u2014that between Dr. Holod\nniy and the private research firm Cetus\u2014Dr. Holodniy\nsaid, \u201cI will assign and do hereby assign to Cetus, my\nright, title, and interest in\u201d here relevant \u201cideas\u201d and\n\u201cinventions.\u201d Id., at 123a (emphasis added; capitalization\nomitted).\n   The Federal Circuit held that the earlier Stanford agree\nment\u2019s use of the words \u201cagree to assign,\u201d when compared\nwith the later Cetus agreement\u2019s use of the words \u201cdo\nhereby assign,\u201d made all the difference. It concluded that,\nonce the invention came into existence, the latter words\nmeant that the Cetus agreement trumped the earlier,\nStanford agreement. 583 F. 3d 832, 841\u2013842 (CA Fed.\n2009). That, in the Circuit\u2019s view, is because the latter\nwords operated upon the invention automatically, while\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                7\n\n                       BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe former did not. Quoting its 1991 opinion in FilmTec\nCorp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 939 F. 2d 1568, 1572, the\nCircuit declared that \u201c \u2018[o]nce the invention is made and\n[the] application for [a] patent is filed, . . . legal title to the\nrights accruing thereunder would be in the assignee [i.e.,\nCetus] . . . , and the assignor-inventor would have nothing\nremaining to assign.\u2019 \u201d 583 F. 3d, at 842.\n  Given what seem only slight linguistic differences in the\ncontractual language, this reasoning seems to make too\nmuch of too little. Dr. Holodniy executed his agreement\nwith Stanford in 1988. At that time, patent law appears\nto have long specified that a present assignment of future\ninventions (as in both contracts here) conveyed equitable,\nbut not legal, title. See, e.g., G. Curtis, A Treatise on the\nLaw of Patents for Useful Inventions \u00a7170, p. 155 (3d ed.\n1867) (\u201cA contract to convey a future invention . . . cannot\nalone authorize a patent to be taken by the party in whose\nfavor such a contract was intended to operate\u201d); Comment,\nContract Rights as Commercial Security: Present and\nFuture Intangibles, 67 Yale L. J. 847, 854, n. 27 (1958)\n(\u201cThe rule generally applicable grants equitable enforce\nment to an assignment of an expectancy but demands a\nfurther act, either reduction to possession or further as\nsignment of the right when it comes into existence\u201d).\n  Under this rule, both the initial Stanford and later\nCetus agreements would have given rise only to equitable\ninterests in Dr. Holodniy\u2019s invention. And as between\nthese two claims in equity, the facts that Stanford\u2019s con\ntract came first and that Stanford subsequently obtained a\npostinvention assignment as well should have meant that\nStanford, not Cetus, would receive the rights its contract\nconveyed.\n  In 1991, however, the Federal Circuit, in FilmTec,\nadopted the new rule quoted above\u2014a rule that distin\nguishes between these equitable claims and, in effect, says\nthat Cetus must win. The Federal Circuit provided no\n8   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nexplanation for what seems a significant change in the\nlaw. See 939 F. 2d, at 1572. Nor did it give any explana\ntion for that change in its opinion in this case. See 583\nF. 3d, at 841\u2013842. The Federal Circuit\u2019s FilmTec rule\nundercuts the objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act. While the\ncognoscenti may be able to meet the FilmTec rule in future\ncontracts simply by copying the precise words blessed by\nthe Federal Circuit, the rule nonetheless remains a tech\nnical drafting trap for the unwary. See AAU Brief 35\u201336.\nBut cf. ante, at 15 (assuming ease of obtaining effective\nassignments). It is unclear to me why, where the Bayh-\nDole Act is at issue, we should prefer the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nFilmTec rule to the rule, of apparently much longer vin\ntage, that would treat both agreements in this case as\ncreating merely equitable rights.\n   At the same time, the Federal Circuit\u2019s reasoning brings\nabout an interpretation contrary to the intention of the\nparties to the earlier, Stanford, contract. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 120a (provision in Stanford contract promising\nthat Dr. Holodniy \u201cwill not enter into any agreement\ncreating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with\nthis agreement\u201d). And it runs counter to what may well\nhave been the drafters\u2019 reasonable expectations of how\ncourts would interpret the relevant language.\n   Second, we could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as ordi\nnarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an\nassignment of patent rights by the federally funded em\nployee to the federally funded employer. I concede that\nthis interpretation would treat federally funded employees\nof contractors (subject to the Act) differently than the law\nordinarily treats private sector employees. The Court long\nago described the latter, private sector principles. In\nUnited States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178\n(1933), the Court explained that a \u201cpatent is property, and\ntitle to it can pass only by assignment.\u201d Id., at 187. It\nthen described two categories of private sector employee\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

And it applied these same principles govern\ning assignment to inventions made by employees of the\nUnited States. Id., at 189\u2013190.\n  Subsequently, however, the President promulgated\nExecutive Order 10096. Courts have since found that this\nExecutive Order, not Dubilier, governs Federal Govern\nment employee-to-employer patent right assignments.\nSee, e.g., Kaplan v. Corcoran, 545 F. 2d 1073, 1076\u20131077\n(CA7 1976); Heinemann, 796 F. 2d, at 455\u2013456; Wright v.\nUnited States, 164 F. 3d 267, 269 (CA5 1999); Halas v.\nUnited States, 28 Fed. Cl. 354, 364 (1993). The Bayh-Dole\nAct seeks objectives roughly analogous to the objectives of\nthe Executive Order. At least one agency has promulgated\nregulations that require Bayh-Dole contractors to insist\nupon similar assignments. See NIH Policies, Procedures,\nand Forms, A \u201c20\u201320\u201d View of Invention Reporting to the\nNational Institutes of Health (Sept. 22, 1995) (available in\nthe Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (requiring a Government\ncontractor, such as Stanford University, to \u201chave in place\nemployee agreements requiring an inventor to \u2018assign\u2019 or\n10   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v.

And since a university often enters\ninto a grant agreement with the Government for a re\nsearcher\u2019s benefit and at his request, see J. Hall, Grant\nManagement 205 (2010), implying such a presumption in\nfavor of compliance with the grant agreement, and thus\nwith the Bayh-Dole Act, would ordinarily be equitable.\n                               IV\n  As I have suggested, these views are tentative.

Argued February 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 6, 2011\nIn 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to\n  develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immu\n  nodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize\n  winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral\n  part of these efforts.\n     In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford\n  University\u2019s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of\n  new AIDS drugs. Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow\n  in the department around that time. When he did so, he signed an\n  agreement stating that he \u201cagree[d] to assign\u201d to Stanford his \u201cright,\n  title and interest in\u201d inventions resulting from his employment there.\n  Holodniy\u2019s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus\n  to learn about PCR. As a condition of gaining access to Cetus,\n  Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he \u201cwill as\n  sign and do[es] hereby assign\u201d to Cetus his \u201cright, title and interest\n  in . . . the ideas, inventions, and improvements\u201d made \u201cas a conse\n  quence of [his] access\u201d to Cetus. Working with Cetus employees,\n  Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount\n  of HIV in a patient\u2019s blood. Upon returning to Stanford, he and other\n  Stanford employees tested the procedure. Stanford secured three\n  patents to the measurement process.\n     Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus\u2019s PCR-related assets.\n  After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method de\n  veloped at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, its\n  HIV test kits are used worldwide.\n     The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980\n2      BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n          UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded \u201csubject\n    invention[s]\u201d between the Federal Government and federal contrac\n    tors. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines \u201csubject inven\n    tion\u201d as \u201cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually\n    reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding\n    agreement,\u201d \u00a7201(e), and provides that contractors may \u201celect to re\n    tain title to any subject invention,\u201d \u00a7202(a). Because some of Stan\n    ford\u2019s research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by\n    the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.\n    In accordance with the Act\u2019s requirements, Stanford notified NIH\n    that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on\n    the Government a license to use the patented procedure.\n       Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit\n    against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits in\n    fringed Stanford\u2019s patents. Roche responded that Holodniy\u2019s agree\n    ment with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus\n    Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement. Stanford\n    countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer\n    sity had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. The District Court\n    agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holod\n    niy had no rights to assign to Cetus. The Court of Appeals for the\n    Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy\u2019s agreement with\n    Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche. It also found\n    that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor\u2019s\n    rights in federally funded inventions. Thus, the Act did not extin\n    guish Roche\u2019s ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was\n    deprived of standing.\nHeld: The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally\n funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to\n unilaterally take title to such inventions. Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights\n in an invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v. Wilder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86619\"><a href=\"/opinion/86619/gayler-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span>\n <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an ap\n plying inventor, or\u2014because an inventor\u2019s interest in his invention is\n assignable in law by an instrument in writing\u2014an inventor\u2019s as\n signee. See United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178,\n 187. Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not\n have rights in an invention \u201cwhich is the original conception of the\n employee alone,\u201d id., at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those\n rights to his employer, see id., at 187. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Stanford and amicus United States contend that, when an in\n vention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of\n federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the\n inventor\u2019s employer\u2014the federal contractor. Congress has in the\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npast divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing un\nambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified\nfederal contracts become the Government\u2019s property. Such unambi\nguous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act. Instead,\nthe Act provides that contractors may \u201celect to retain title to any sub\nject invention,\u201d \u00a7202(a), defining a \u201csubject invention\u201d as \u201cany inven\ntion of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in\nthe performance of work under a funding agreement,\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n   Stanford contends that \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d means all in\nventions that a contractor\u2019s employees make with the aid of federal\nfunds. That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two cen\nturies of patent law in a statutory definition. This Court has rejected\nthe idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an em\nployee\u2019s invention in the employer. Stanford\u2019s reading also renders\nthe phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d superfluous since the definition already\ncovers inventions made under a funding agreement. Construing the\nphrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions con\nceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement\u2014inventions\n\u201cof the contractor,\u201d that is, those owned by or belonging to the con\ntractor\u2014makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.\nAnd \u201cinvention owned by the contractor\u201d or \u201cinvention belonging to\nthe contractor\u201d are natural readings of the phrase \u201cinvention of the\ncontractor.\u201d\n   Section 202(a), which states that contractors may \u201celect to retain\ntitle,\u201d confirms that the Act does not vest title. Stanford reaches the\nopposite conclusion, but only because it reads \u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cac\nquire\u201d and \u201creceive.\u201d That is certainly not the common meaning of\n\u201cretain,\u201d which is \u201cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\u201d\nYou cannot retain something unless you already have it. And\n\u00a7210(a)\u2014which provides that the Act \u201ctake[s] precedence over any\nother Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inven\ntions . . . that is inconsistent with\u201d the Act\u2014does not displace the ba\nsic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention. Only\nwhen an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act\ncome into play. The Act\u2019s disposition of rights does nothing more\nthan clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Gov\nernment and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that\nalready belongs to the contractor.\n   The Act\u2019s isolated provisions dealing with inventors\u2019 rights in sub\nject inventions are consistent with the Court\u2019s construction of the Act.\nSee \u00a7202(d). That construction is also bolstered by the Act\u2019s limited\nprocedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to\nchallenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a\nsubject invention, \u00a7202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for\n4      BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n          UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    inventor and third-party rights.\n       Stanford\u2019s contrary construction would permit title to an em\n    ployee\u2019s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was\n    conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the in\n    vention\u2019s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding. It\n    also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar\n    of federal funding applied toward an invention\u2019s conception or reduc\n    tion to practice. It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to sup\n    plant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive in\n    ventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under such\n    unusual terms would be truly surprising. Had Congress intended\n    such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so\n    clearly\u2014not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of \u201csubject\n    invention\u201d and an idiosyncratic use of the word \u201cretain.\u201d\n       The Court\u2019s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common\n    practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their\n    employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typi\n    cally expect those contractors to obtain assignments. With effective\n    assignments, federally funded inventions become \u201csubject inventions\u201d\n    and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stan\n    ford says it should. The only significant difference is that it does so\n    without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own\n    their inventions.

The\nquestion here is whether the University and Small Busi\nness Patent Procedures Act of 1980\u2014commonly referred to\nas the Bayh-Dole Act\u2014displaces that norm and automati\ncally vests title to federally funded inventions in federal\ncontractors. We hold that it does not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n   In 1985, a small California research company called\nCetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood\nborne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the\nvirus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize winning technique\ndeveloped at Cetus\u2014polymerase chain reaction, or PCR\u2014\nwas an integral part of these efforts. PCR allows billions\nof copies of DNA sequences to be made from a small initial\nblood sample.\n   In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at\n2   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nStanford University\u2019s Department of Infectious Diseases\nto test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr. Mark Holodniy\njoined Stanford as a research fellow in the department\naround that time. When he did so, he signed a Copyright\nand Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he \u201cagree[d] to\nassign\u201d to Stanford his \u201cright, title and interest in\u201d inven\ntions resulting from his employment at the University.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 118a\u2013119a.\n   At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an improved\nmethod for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood sam\nples, using PCR. Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar\nwith PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct\nresearch at Cetus. As a condition of gaining access to\nCetus, Holodniy signed a Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agree\nment (VCA). That agreement stated that Holodniy \u201cwill\nassign and do[es] hereby assign\u201d to Cetus his \u201cright, title\nand interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improve\nments\u201d made \u201cas a consequence of [his] access\u201d to Cetus.\nId., at 122a\u2013124a.\n   For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted research\nat Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy de\nvised a PCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of\nHIV in a patient\u2019s blood. That technique allowed doctors\nto determine whether a patient was benefiting from HIV\ntherapy.\n   Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other\nUniversity employees tested the HIV measurement tech\nnique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written\nassignments of rights from the Stanford employees in\nvolved in refinement of the technique, including Holodniy,\nand filed several patent applications related to the proce\ndure. Stanford secured three patents to the HIV meas\nurement process.\n   In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company that\nspecializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus\u2019s\nPCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had ob\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantifica\ntion method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the\nprocedure. Today, Roche\u2019s HIV test \u201ckits are used in\nhospitals and AIDS clinics worldwide.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndents 10\u201311.\n                              B\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act to \u201cpromote\nthe utilization of inventions arising from federally sup\nported research,\u201d \u201cpromote collaboration between commer\ncial concerns and nonprofit organizations,\u201d and \u201censure\nthat the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally\nsupported inventions.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7200. To achieve these\naims, the Act allocates rights in federally funded \u201csubject\ninvention[s]\u201d between the Federal Government and federal\ncontractors (\u201cany person, small business firm, or nonprofit\norganization that is a party to a funding agreement\u201d).\n\u00a7\u00a7201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines \u201csubject invention\u201d\nas \u201cany invention of the contractor conceived or first actu\nally reduced to practice in the performance of work under\na funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n  The Bayh-Dole Act provides that contractors may \u201celect\nto retain title to any subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(a). To be\nable to retain title, a contractor must fulfill a number of\nobligations imposed by the statute. The contractor must\n\u201cdisclose each subject invention to the [relevant] Federal\nagency within a reasonable time\u201d; it must \u201cmake a written\nelection within two years after disclosure\u201d stating that\nthe contractor opts to retain title to the invention; and the\ncontractor must \u201cfile a patent application prior to any\nstatutory bar date.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7202(c)(1)\u2013(3). The \u201cFederal Gov\nernment may receive title\u201d to a subject invention if a\ncontractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.\nIbid.\n  The Government has several rights in federally funded\n4   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v.

The agency\nthat granted the federal funds receives from the contractor\n\u201ca nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up\nlicense to practice . . . [the] subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(c)(4).\nThe agency also possesses \u201c[m]arch-in rights,\u201d which\npermit the agency to grant a license to a responsible third\nparty under certain circumstances, such as when the con\ntractor fails to take \u201ceffective steps to achieve practical\napplication\u201d of the invention. \u00a7203. The Act further pro\nvides that when the contractor does not elect to retain title\nto a subject invention, the Government \u201cmay consider and\nafter consultation with the contractor grant requests for\nretention of rights by the inventor.\u201d \u00a7202(d).\n   Some of Stanford\u2019s research related to the HIV meas\nurement technique was funded by the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the\nBayh-Dole Act. Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the in\nvention, conferred on the Government a nonexclusive,\nnontransferable, paid-up license to use the patented proce\ndure, and formally notified NIH that it elected to retain\ntitle to the invention.\n                             C\n   In 2005, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University\nfiled suit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Roche\nDiagnostics Corporation, and Roche Diagnostics Opera\ntions, Inc. (collectively Roche), contending that Roche\u2019s\nHIV test kits infringed Stanford\u2019s patents. As relevant\nhere, Roche responded by asserting that it was a co-owner\nof the HIV quantification procedure, based on Holodniy\u2019s\nassignment of his rights in the Visitor\u2019s Confidentiality\nAgreement. As a result, Roche argued, Stanford lacked\nstanding to sue it for patent infringement. 487 F. Supp.\n2d 1099, 1111, 1115 (ND Cal. 2007). Stanford claimed\nthat Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer\nsity\u2019s HIV research was federally funded, giving the school\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 1117. But\nbecause of the operation of the Bayh-Dole Act, \u201cHolodniy\nhad no interest to assign.\u201d Id., at 1117, 1119. The court\nconcluded that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201cprovides that the indi\nvidual inventor may obtain title\u201d to a federally funded\ninvention \u201conly after the government and the contracting\nparty have declined to do so.\u201d Id., at 1118.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed.\nFirst, the court concluded that Holodniy\u2019s initial agree\nment with Stanford in the Copyright and Patent Agree\nment constituted a mere promise to assign rights in the\nfuture, unlike Holodniy\u2019s agreement with Cetus in the\nVisitor\u2019s Confidentiality Agreement, which itself assigned\nHolodniy\u2019s rights in the invention to Cetus. See 583 F. 3d\n832, 841\u2013842 (2009). Therefore, as a matter of contract\nlaw, Cetus obtained Holodniy\u2019s rights in the HIV quantifi\ncation technique through the VCA.2 Next, the court ex\nplained that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201cdoes not automatically\nvoid ab initio the inventors\u2019 rights in government-funded\ninventions\u201d and that the \u201cstatutory scheme did not auto\nmatically void the patent rights that Cetus received from\nHolodniy.\u201d Id., at 844\u2013845. The court held that \u201cRoche\npossesse[d] an ownership interest in the patents-in-suit\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Roche submitted a host of other claims to the District Court, includ\n\ning that it had \u201cshop rights\u201d to the patents and was entitled to a license\nto use the patents. See 583 F. 3d 832, 838 (CA Fed. 2009). None of\nthose claims is now before us; we deal only with Roche\u2019s claim to co\nownership to rebut Stanford\u2019s standing to bring an infringement action.\n   2 Because the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the relevant assign\n\nment agreements is not an issue on which we granted certiorari, we\nhave no occasion to pass on the validity of the lower court\u2019s construction\nof those agreements.\n6      BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n          UNIV. v.

That Act provided \u201c[t]hat upon the petition of any\nperson or persons . . . setting forth, that he, she, or they,\nhath or have invented or discovered\u201d an invention, a pat\nent could be granted to \u201csuch petitioner or petitioners\u201d or\n\u201ctheir heirs, administrators or assigns.\u201d Act of Apr. 10,\n1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 109\u2013110. Under that law, the first patent\nwas granted in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins, who had devised\nan improved method for making potash, America\u2019s first\nindustrial chemical. U. S. Patent No. 1 (issued July 31,\n1790).3\n   Although much in intellectual property law has changed\nin the 220 years since the first Patent Act, the basic idea\nthat inventors have the right to patent their inventions\nhas not. Under the law in its current form, \u201c[w]hoever\ninvents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter . . . may obtain a\npatent therefor.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. The inventor must\nattest that \u201che believes himself to be the original and first\ninventor of the [invention] for which he solicits a patent.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\n        patent was signed by President George Washington, Secretary\nof State Thomas Jefferson, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph.\nSee Maxey, Samuel Hopkins, The Holder of the First U. S. Patent: A\nStudy of Failure, 122 Pa. Magazine of Hist. and Biography 6 (1998).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7115. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an\napplying inventor, or\u2014because an inventor\u2019s interest in\nhis invention is \u201cassignable in law by an instrument in\nwriting\u201d\u2014an inventor\u2019s assignee. \u00a7\u00a7151, 152, 261.\n   Our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in\nan invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v.\nWilder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86619\"><a href=\"/opinion/86619/gayler-v-wilder/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (1851) (\u201cthe discoverer of a new\nand useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate\nright to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make\nabsolute by proceeding in the manner which the law re\nquires\u201d); Solomons v. United States, 137 U. S. 342, 346\n(1890) (\u201cwhatever invention [an inventor] may thus con\nceive and perfect is his individual property\u201d); United\nStates v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178, 188\n(1933) (an inventor owns \u201cthe product of [his] original\nthought\u201d). The treatises are to the same effect. See, e.g., 8\nChisum on Patents \u00a722.01, p. 22\u20132 (2011) (\u201cThe presump\ntive owner of the property right in a patentable invention\nis the single human inventor\u201d).\n   It is equally well established that an inventor can assign\nhis rights in an invention to a third party. See Dubilier\nCondenser Corp., supra, at 187 (\u201cA patent is property and\ntitle to it can pass only by assignment\u201d); 8 Chisum on\nPatents, supra, \u00a722.01, at 22\u20132 (\u201cThe inventor . . . [may]\ntransfer ownership interests by written assignment to\nanyone\u201d). Thus, although others may acquire an interest\nin an invention, any such interest\u2014as a general rule\u2014\nmust trace back to the inventor.\n   In accordance with these principles, we have recognized\nthat unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an\nemployer does not have rights in an invention \u201cwhich is\nthe original conception of the employee alone.\u201d Dubilier\nCondenser Corp., 289 U. S., at 189. Such an invention\n\u201cremains the property of him who conceived it.\u201d Ibid. In\nmost circumstances, an inventor must expressly grant his\nrights in an invention to his employer if the employer is to\n8   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n       UNIV. v.

In their view, the Act moves inventors from the\nfront of the line to the back by vesting title to federally\nfunded inventions in the inventor\u2019s employer\u2014the federal\ncontractor. See Brief for Petitioner 26\u201327; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 6.\n   Congress has in the past divested inventors of their\nrights in inventions by providing unambiguously that\ninventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts\nbecome the property of the United States. For example,\nwith respect to certain contracts dealing with nuclear\nmaterial and atomic energy, Congress provided that title\nto such inventions \u201cshall be vested in, and be the property\nof, the [Atomic Energy] Commission.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72182.\nCongress has also enacted laws requiring that title to\ncertain inventions made pursuant to contracts with the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration \u201cshall be\nthe exclusive property of the United States,\u201d Pub. L. 111\u2013\n314, \u00a73, 124 Stat. 3339, 51 U. S. C. \u00a720135(b)(1), and that\ntitle to certain inventions under contracts with the De\npartment of Energy \u201cshall vest in the United States.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a75908.\n   Such language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole\nAct. Nowhere in the Act is title expressly vested in con\ntractors or anyone else; nowhere in the Act are inventors\nexpressly deprived of their interest in federally funded\ninventions. Instead, the Act provides that contractors may\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201celect to retain title to any subject invention.\u201d 35 U. S. C.\n\u00a7202(a). A \u201csubject invention\u201d is defined as \u201cany invention\nof the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to\npractice in the performance of work under a funding\nagreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e).\n   Stanford asserts that the phrase \u201cinvention of the con\ntractor\u201d in this provision \u201cis naturally read to include all\ninventions made by the contractor\u2019s employees with the\naid of federal funding.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32 (footnote\nomitted). That reading assumes that Congress subtly set\naside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.\nIt also renders the phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d superfluous.\nIf the phrase \u201cof the contractor\u201d were deleted from the\ndefinition of \u201csubject invention,\u201d the definition would cover\n\u201cany invention . . . conceived or first actually reduced to\npractice in the performance of work under a funding\nagreement.\u201d Reading \u201cof the contractor\u201d to mean \u201call\ninventions made by the contractor\u2019s employees with the\naid of federal funding,\u201d as Stanford would, adds nothing\nthat is not already in the definition, since the definition\nalready covers inventions made under the funding agree\nment. That is contrary to our general \u201creluctan[ce] to\ntreat statutory terms as surplusage.\u201d Duncan v. Walker,\n533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular\ncategory of inventions conceived or reduced to practice\nunder a funding agreement\u2014inventions \u201cof the contrac\ntor,\u201d that is, those owned by or belonging to the con\ntractor\u2014makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory\ndefinition. And \u201cinvention owned by the contractor\u201d or\n\u201cinvention belonging to the contractor\u201d are natural read\nings of the phrase \u201cinvention of the contractor.\u201d As we\nhave explained, \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018of\u2019 denotes owner\nship.\u201d Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U. S. 101, 109 (1930); see Flores-\nFigueroa v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___, ___\n10   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n(2009) (slip op., at 2, 11) (treating the phrase \u201cidentifica\ntion [papers] of another person\u201d as meaning such items\nbelonging to another person (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Ellis v. United States, 206 U. S. 246, 259 (1907)\n(interpreting the phrase \u201cworks of the United States\u201d to\nmean \u201cworks belonging to the United States\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   That reading follows from a common definition of the\nword \u201cof.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\ntionary 1565 (2002) (\u201cof\u201d can be \u201cused as a function word\nindicating a possessive relationship\u201d); New Oxford Ameri\ncan Dictionary 1180 (2d ed. 2005) (defining \u201cof\u201d as \u201cindi\ncating an association between two entities, typically one of\nbelonging\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary\n1241 (2d ed. 1979) (defining \u201cof\u201d as \u201cbelonging to\u201d).\n   Stanford\u2019s reading of the phrase \u201cinvention of the con\ntractor\u201d to mean \u201call inventions made by the contractor\u2019s\nemployees\u201d is plausible enough in the abstract; it is often\nthe case that whatever an employee produces in the course\nof his employment belongs to his employer. No one would\nclaim that an autoworker who builds a car while working\nin a factory owns that car. But, as noted, patent law has\nalways been different: We have rejected the idea that mere\nemployment is sufficient to vest title to an employee\u2019s\ninvention in the employer. Against this background, a\ncontractor\u2019s invention\u2014an \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d\u2014\ndoes not automatically include inventions made by the\ncontractor\u2019s employees.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent suggests that \u201cwe could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as\nordinarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an assignment\nof patent rights by the federally funded employee to the federally\nfunded employer.\u201d Post, at 8. That suggestion is based in large part on\nExecutive Order 10096, which \u201cgoverns Federal Government employee\nto-employer patent right assignments.\u201d Post, at 9. Lest there be any\ndoubt, employees of nonfederal entities that have federal funding\ncontracts\u2014like Holodniy\u2014are not federal employees. And there is no\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. \u00a7202(a) (emphasis added). Stanford\nreaches the opposite conclusion, but only because it reads\n\u201cretain\u201d to mean \u201cacquire\u201d and \u201creceive.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 36 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is\ncertainly not the common meaning of \u201cretain.\u201d \u201c[R]etain\u201d\nmeans \u201cto hold or continue to hold in possession or use.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third, supra, at 1938; see Webster\u2019s New Colle\ngiate Dictionary 980 (1980) (\u201cto keep in possession or\nuse\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 1109 (1969) (\u201c[t]o\nkeep or hold in one\u2019s possession\u201d). You cannot retain\nsomething unless you already have it. See Alaska v.\nUnited States, 545 U. S. 75, 104 (2005) (interpreting the\nphrase \u201cthe United States shall retain title to all property\u201d\nto mean that \u201c[t]he United States . . . retained title to its\nproperty located within Alaska\u2019s borders\u201d) (emphasis\nadded). The Bayh-Dole Act does not confer title to feder\nally funded inventions on contractors or authorize contrac\ntors to unilaterally take title to those inventions; it simply\nassures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it\nis they already have. Such a provision makes sense in a\nstatute specifying the respective rights and responsibili\nties of federal contractors and the Government.\n   The Bayh-Dole Act states that it \u201ctake[s] precedence\nover any other Act which would require a disposition of\nrights in subject inventions . . . that is inconsistent with\u201d\nthe Act. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7210(a). The United States as amicus\ncuriae argues that this provision operates to displace the\nbasic principle, codified in the Patent Act, that an inventor\nowns the rights to his invention. See Brief for United\nStates 21. But because the Bayh-Dole Act, including\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nequivalent executive order governing invention rights with respect to \n\nfederally funded research; that issue is of course addressed by the \n\nBayh-Dole Act. \n\n12   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7210(a), applies only to \u201csubject inventions\u201d\u2014\u201cinventions\nof the contractor\u201d\u2014it does not displace an inventor\u2019s ante\ncedent title to his invention. Only when an invention\nbelongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into\nplay. The Act\u2019s disposition of rights\u2014like much of the\nrest of the Bayh-Dole Act\u2014serves to clarify the order of\npriority of rights between the Federal Government and a\nfederal contractor in a federally funded invention that\nalready belongs to the contractor. Nothing more.5\n  The isolated provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act dealing\nwith inventors\u2019 rights in subject inventions are consistent\nwith our construction of the Act. Under the Act, a federal\nagency may \u201cgrant requests for retention of rights by the\ninventor . . . [i]f a contractor does not elect to retain title to\na subject invention.\u201d \u00a7202(d). If an employee inventor\nnever had title to his invention because title vested in the\ncontractor by operation of law\u2014as Stanford submits\u2014it\nwould be odd to allow the Government to grant \u201crequests\nfor retention of rights by the inventor.\u201d By using the word\n\u201cretention,\u201d \u00a7202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights\nin the subject invention at some point, undermining the\nnotion that the Act automatically vests title to federally\nfunded inventions in federal contractors.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Far from superseding the Patent Act in such a backhanded way, it is\nclear that \u00a7210(a)\u2019s concern is far narrower. That provision specifies 21\ndifferent statutory provisions that the Bayh-Dole Act \u201ctake[s] prece\ndence over,\u201d the vast majority of which deal with the division of owner\nship in certain inventions between a contractor and the Government.\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7210(a)(1)\u2013(21); see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7210(a)(19)\u2013(20) (the Bayh-Dole\nAct takes precedence over \u201csection 6(b) of the Solar Photovoltaic Energy\nResearch Development and Demonstration Act\u201d and \u201csection 12 of the\nNative Latex Commercialization and Economic Development Act\u201d).\n  6 Stanford contends that it cannot be the case \u201cthat the contractor can\n\nonly \u2018retain title\u2019 to an invention that it already owns, while an inventor\nmay be considered for \u2018retention\u2019 of title only when he has assigned title\naway.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 8. That argument has some force.\nBut there may be situations where an inventor, by the terms of an\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The limited scope of the Act\u2019s procedural protections\nalso bolsters our conclusion. The Bayh-Dole Act expressly\nconfers on contractors the right to challenge a Govern\nment-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject\ninvention. \u00a7202(b)(4). As Roche correctly notes, however,\n\u201cthe Act contains not a single procedural protection for\nthird parties that have neither sought nor received federal\nfunds,\u201d such as cooperating private research institutions.\nBrief for Respondents 29. Nor does the Bayh-Dole Act\nallow inventors employed by federal contractors to contest\ntheir employer\u2019s claim to a subject invention. The Act, for\nexample, does not expressly permit an interested third\nparty or an inventor to challenge a claim that a particular\ninvention was supported by federal funding. In a world in\nwhich there is frequent collaboration between private\nentities, inventors, and federal contractors, see Brief for\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\nas Amicus Curiae 22\u201323, that absence would be deeply\ntroubling. But the lack of procedures protecting inventor\nand third-party rights makes perfect sense if the Act\napplies only when a federal contractor has already ac\nquired title to an inventor\u2019s interest. In that case, there is\nno need to protect inventor or third-party rights, because\nthe only rights at issue are those of the contractor and the\nGovernment.\n  The Bayh-Dole Act applies to subject inventions \u201ccon\nceived or first actually reduced to practice in the perform\nance of work\u201d \u201cfunded in whole or in part by the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7201(e), 201(b) (emphasis\nadded). Under Stanford\u2019s construction of the Act, title to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nassignment, has subsidiary rights in an invention to which a contractor\n\nhas title, as \u00a7202(d) suggests. Compare \u00a7202(d) (\u201cretention of rights\u201d)\n\nwith \u00a7202(a) (\u201cretain title\u201d) (emphasis added). And at the end of the \n\nday, it is Stanford\u2019s contention that \u201cretain\u201d must be \u201cread as a syno\n\nnym for \u2018acquire\u2019 or \u2018receive\u2019 \u201d that dooms its argument on this point.\n\nBrief for Petitioner 37. \n\n14   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR\n        UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\none of its employee\u2019s inventions could vest in the Univer\nsity even if the invention was conceived before the inven\ntor became a University employee, so long as the inven\ntion\u2019s reduction to practice was supported by federal\nfunding. What is more, Stanford\u2019s reading suggests that\nthe school would obtain title to one of its employee\u2019s inven\ntions even if only one dollar of federal funding was applied\ntoward the invention\u2019s conception or reduction to practice.\n   It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to supplant\none of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive\ninventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under\nsuch unusual terms would be truly surprising. We are\nconfident that if Congress had intended such a sea change\nin intellectual property rights it would have said so\nclearly\u2014not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of\n\u201csubject invention\u201d and an idiosyncratic use of the word\n\u201cretain.\u201d Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\n531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress . . . does not alter\nthe fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague\nterms or ancillary provisions\u201d).\n   Though unnecessary to our conclusion, it is worth noting\nthat our construction of the Bayh-Dole Act is reflected in\nthe common practice among parties operating under the\nAct. Contractors generally institute policies to obtain\nassignments from their employees. See Brief for Respon\ndents 34; Brief for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufac\nturers of America as Amicus Curiae 13\u201318. Agencies that\ngrant funds to federal contractors typically expect those\ncontractors to obtain assignments. So it is with NIH, the\nagency that granted the federal funds at issue in this case.\nIn guidance documents made available to contractors, NIH\nhas made clear that \u201c[b]y law, an inventor has initial\nownership of an invention \u201d and that contractors should\ntherefore \u201chave in place employee agreements requiring\nan inventor to \u2018assign\u2019 or give ownership of an invention to\nthe organization upon acceptance of Federal funds.\u201d NIH\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Such guidance would be unnecessary if Stan\nford\u2019s reading of the statute were correct.\n   Stanford contends that reading the Bayh-Dole Act as\nnot vesting title to federally funded inventions in federal\ncontractors \u201cfundamentally undermin[es]\u201d the Act\u2019s frame\nwork and severely threatens its continued \u201csuccessful\napplication.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 45. We do not agree. As\njust noted, universities typically enter into agreements\nwith their employees requiring the assignment to the\nuniversity of rights in inventions. With an effective as\nsignment, those inventions\u2014if federally funded\u2014become\n\u201csubject inventions\u201d under the Act, and the statute as a\npractical matter works pretty much the way Stanford says\nit should. The only significant difference is that it does so\nwithout violence to the basic principle of patent law that\ninventors own their inventions.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

It sets forth conditions that mean\n(1) the funded firm; (2) failing that, the United States\nGovernment; and (3) failing that, the employee who made\n2   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7202\u2013203. The statute applies to \u201csubject in\nvention[s]\u201d defined as \u201cany invention of the contractor\nconceived or first actually reduced to practice in the per\nformance of work under a funding agreement.\u201d \u00a7201(e)\n(emphasis added). Since the \u201ccontractor\u201d (e.g., a univer\nsity or small business) is unlikely to \u201cconceiv[e]\u201d of an idea\nor \u201creduc[e]\u201d it \u201cto practice\u201d other than through its employ\nees, the term \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d must refer\nto the work and ideas of those employees. We all agree\nthat the term covers those employee inventions that the\nemployee properly assigns to the contractor, i.e., his or\nher employer. But does the term \u201csubject invention\u201d\nalso include inventions that the employee fails to assign\nproperly?\n                                 II\n   Congress enacted this statute against a background\nnorm that often, but not always, denies individual inven\ntors patent rights growing out of research for which the\npublic has already paid. This legal norm reflects the fact\nthat patents themselves have both benefits and costs.\nPatents, for example, help to elicit useful inventions and\nresearch and to assure public disclosure of technological\nadvances. See, e.g., Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 219\n(1954); Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 4); id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (Stevens, J., concurring in\njudgment). But patents sometimes mean unnecessarily\nhigh prices or restricted dissemination; and they some\ntimes discourage further innovation and competition by re\nquiring costly searches for earlier, related patents or by\ntying up ideas, which, were they free, would more effec\ntively spur research and development. See, e.g., Labora\ntory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories,\nInc., 548 U. S. 124, 128 (2006) (BREYER, J., dissenting\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Ecclesiastical Endowments., in J. Madison, Writings\n756 (J. Rakove ed. 1999).\n   The importance of assuring this community \u201cbenefit\u201d is\nreflected in legal rules that may deny or limit the award of\npatent rights where the public has already paid to produce\nan invention, lest the public bear the potential costs of\npatent protection where there is no offsetting need for\nsuch protection to elicit that invention. Why should the\npublic have to pay twice for the same invention?\n   Legal rules of this kind include an Executive Order that\nordinarily gives to the Government \u201cthe entire right, title\nand interest\u201d to inventions made by Government employ\nees who \u201cconduct or perform research, development work,\nor both.\u201d 37 CFR \u00a7501.6 (2010) (codifying, as amended,\nExec.

They also include statutes,\nwhich, in specific research areas, give the Government\ntitle to inventions made pursuant to Government con\ntracts. See Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \u00a7152, 68 Stat. 944\n(codified as amended at 42 U. S.

And they have included Government\nregulations, established prior to the Bayh-Dole Act\u2019s en\nactment, that work in roughly similar ways. See, e.g., 45\nCFR \u00a7650.4(b) (1977) (National Science Foundation regu\nlations providing that Foundation would \u201cdetermine the\ndisposition of the invention [made under the grant] and\ntitle to and rights under any patent application\u201d); \u00a7\u00a78.1(a),\n8.2(d) (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\nregulations providing that inventions made under de\npartment grants \u201cshall be subject to determination\u201d by the\nagency and that the department may \u201crequire that all\ndomestic rights in the invention shall be assigned to the\nUnited States\u201d).\n   These legal rules provide the basic background against\nwhich Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act. And the Act\u2019s\nprovisions reflect a related effort to assure that rights to\ninventions arising out of research for which the public has\npaid are distributed and used in ways that further specific\nimportant public interests. I agree with the majority that\nthe Act does not simply take the individual inventors\u2019\nrights and grant them to the Government. Rather, it\nassumes that the federal funds\u2019 recipient, say a university\nor small business, will possess those rights. The Act\nleaves those rights in the hands of that recipient, not\nbecause it seeks to make the public pay twice for the same\ninvention, but for a special public policy reason. In doing\nso, it seeks to encourage those institutions to commercial\nize inventions that otherwise might not realize their po\ntentially beneficial public use. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7200. The Act\nhelps assure that commercialization (while \u201cpromot[ing]\nfree competition\u201d and \u201cprotect[ing] the public,\u201d ibid.) by\nimposing a set of conditions upon the federal funds recipi\nent, by providing that sometimes the Government will\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

That conclusion, in my\nview, is inconsistent with the Act\u2019s basic purposes. It may\nsignificantly undercut the Act\u2019s ability to achieve its objec\ntives. It allows individual inventors, for whose invention\nthe public has paid, to avoid the Act\u2019s corresponding re\nstrictions and conditions. And it makes the commerciali\nzation and marketing of such an invention more difficult:\nA potential purchaser of rights from the contractor, say a\nuniversity, will not know if the university itself possesses\nthe patent right in question or whether, as here, the indi\nvidual, inadvertently or deliberately, has previously as\nsigned the title to a third party.\n   Moreover, I do not agree that the language to which the\nmajority points\u2014the words \u201cinvention of the contractor\u201d\nand \u201cretain\u201d\u2014requires its result. As the majority con\ncedes, Stanford\u2019s alternative reading of the phrase \u201c \u2018in\nvention of the contractor\u2019 \u201d is \u201cplausible enough in the\nabstract.\u201d Ante, at 10.

ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe Government\u2019s reading) of the Act because it believes\nthat it is inconsistent with certain background norms of\npatent law, norms that ordinarily provide an individual\ninventor with full patent rights. Ante, at 10. But in my\nview, the competing norms governing rights in inventions\nfor which the public has already paid, along with the\nBayh-Dole Act\u2019s objectives, suggest a different result.\n                               III\n   There are two different legal routes to what I consider\nan interpretation more consistent with the statute\u2019s objec\ntives. First, we could set aside the Federal Circuit\u2019s inter\npretation of the licensing agreements and its related\nlicensing doctrine. That doctrine governs interpretation of\nlicensing agreements made before an invention is con\nceived or reduced to practice. Here, there are two such\nagreements. In the earlier agreement\u2014that between Dr.\nHolodniy and Stanford University\u2014Dr. Holodniy said, \u201cI\nagree to assign . . . to Stanford . . . that right, title and\ninterest in and to . . . such inventions as required by Con\ntracts and Grants.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a (emphasis\nadded). In the later agreement\u2014that between Dr. Holod\nniy and the private research firm Cetus\u2014Dr. Holodniy\nsaid, \u201cI will assign and do hereby assign to Cetus, my\nright, title, and interest in\u201d here relevant \u201cideas\u201d and\n\u201cinventions.\u201d Id., at 123a (emphasis added; capitalization\nomitted).\n   The Federal Circuit held that the earlier Stanford agree\nment\u2019s use of the words \u201cagree to assign,\u201d when compared\nwith the later Cetus agreement\u2019s use of the words \u201cdo\nhereby assign,\u201d made all the difference. It concluded that,\nonce the invention came into existence, the latter words\nmeant that the Cetus agreement trumped the earlier,\nStanford agreement. 583 F. 3d 832, 841\u2013842 (CA Fed.\n2009). That, in the Circuit\u2019s view, is because the latter\nwords operated upon the invention automatically, while\n                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                7\n\n                       BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe former did not. Quoting its 1991 opinion in FilmTec\nCorp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 939 F. 2d 1568, 1572, the\nCircuit declared that \u201c \u2018[o]nce the invention is made and\n[the] application for [a] patent is filed, . . . legal title to the\nrights accruing thereunder would be in the assignee [i.e.,\nCetus] . . . , and the assignor-inventor would have nothing\nremaining to assign.\u2019 \u201d 583 F. 3d, at 842.\n  Given what seem only slight linguistic differences in the\ncontractual language, this reasoning seems to make too\nmuch of too little. Dr. Holodniy executed his agreement\nwith Stanford in 1988. At that time, patent law appears\nto have long specified that a present assignment of future\ninventions (as in both contracts here) conveyed equitable,\nbut not legal, title. See, e.g., G. Curtis, A Treatise on the\nLaw of Patents for Useful Inventions \u00a7170, p. 155 (3d ed.\n1867) (\u201cA contract to convey a future invention . . . cannot\nalone authorize a patent to be taken by the party in whose\nfavor such a contract was intended to operate\u201d); Comment,\nContract Rights as Commercial Security: Present and\nFuture Intangibles, 67 Yale L. J. 847, 854, n. 27 (1958)\n(\u201cThe rule generally applicable grants equitable enforce\nment to an assignment of an expectancy but demands a\nfurther act, either reduction to possession or further as\nsignment of the right when it comes into existence\u201d).\n  Under this rule, both the initial Stanford and later\nCetus agreements would have given rise only to equitable\ninterests in Dr. Holodniy\u2019s invention. And as between\nthese two claims in equity, the facts that Stanford\u2019s con\ntract came first and that Stanford subsequently obtained a\npostinvention assignment as well should have meant that\nStanford, not Cetus, would receive the rights its contract\nconveyed.\n  In 1991, however, the Federal Circuit, in FilmTec,\nadopted the new rule quoted above\u2014a rule that distin\nguishes between these equitable claims and, in effect, says\nthat Cetus must win. The Federal Circuit provided no\n8   BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR \n\n       UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nexplanation for what seems a significant change in the\nlaw. See 939 F. 2d, at 1572. Nor did it give any explana\ntion for that change in its opinion in this case. See 583\nF. 3d, at 841\u2013842. The Federal Circuit\u2019s FilmTec rule\nundercuts the objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act. While the\ncognoscenti may be able to meet the FilmTec rule in future\ncontracts simply by copying the precise words blessed by\nthe Federal Circuit, the rule nonetheless remains a tech\nnical drafting trap for the unwary. See AAU Brief 35\u201336.\nBut cf. ante, at 15 (assuming ease of obtaining effective\nassignments). It is unclear to me why, where the Bayh-\nDole Act is at issue, we should prefer the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nFilmTec rule to the rule, of apparently much longer vin\ntage, that would treat both agreements in this case as\ncreating merely equitable rights.\n   At the same time, the Federal Circuit\u2019s reasoning brings\nabout an interpretation contrary to the intention of the\nparties to the earlier, Stanford, contract. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 120a (provision in Stanford contract promising\nthat Dr. Holodniy \u201cwill not enter into any agreement\ncreating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with\nthis agreement\u201d). And it runs counter to what may well\nhave been the drafters\u2019 reasonable expectations of how\ncourts would interpret the relevant language.\n   Second, we could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as ordi\nnarily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an\nassignment of patent rights by the federally funded em\nployee to the federally funded employer. I concede that\nthis interpretation would treat federally funded employees\nof contractors (subject to the Act) differently than the law\nordinarily treats private sector employees. The Court long\nago described the latter, private sector principles. In\nUnited States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178\n(1933), the Court explained that a \u201cpatent is property, and\ntitle to it can pass only by assignment.\u201d Id., at 187. It\nthen described two categories of private sector employee\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

And it applied these same principles govern\ning assignment to inventions made by employees of the\nUnited States. Id., at 189\u2013190.\n  Subsequently, however, the President promulgated\nExecutive Order 10096. Courts have since found that this\nExecutive Order, not Dubilier, governs Federal Govern\nment employee-to-employer patent right assignments.\nSee, e.g., Kaplan v.
