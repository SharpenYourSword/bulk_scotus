ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09–1403. Argued April 25, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011\nPetitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a\n  putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co.\n  and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton). EPJ Fund alleges\n  that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate\n  the company’s stock price, in violation of §10(b) of the Securities Ex\n  change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule\n  10b–5. EPJ Fund also contends that Halliburton later made a num\n  ber of corrective disclosures that caused the stock price to drop and,\n  consequently, investors to lose money. EPJ Fund sought to have its\n  proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n  23. The District Court found that the suit could proceed as a class\n  action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Fifth Circuit prece\n  dent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove “loss causation”—\n  i.e., that the defendant’s deceptive conduct caused the investors’\n  claimed economic loss—in order to obtain class certification. The\n  District Court concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to satisfy that re\n  quirement. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the denial of\n  class certification.\nHeld: Securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation in order\n to obtain class certification. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) In order to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a court must find\n “that the questions of law or fact common to class members predomi\n nate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that\n a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and ef\n ficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Considering whether “ques\n2         ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tions of law or fact common to class members predominate” begins, of\n    course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action. The ele\n    ments of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)\n    and Rule 10b–5 are: “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by\n    the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresen\n    tation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance\n    upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6)\n    loss causation.” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___,\n    ___.\n       Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in such an\n    action often turns on the element of reliance. The traditional way a\n    plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of\n    a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—e.g.,\n    purchasing common stock—based on that specific misrepresentation.\n    The Court recognized in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, how\n    ever, that “[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each\n    member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would” prevent such\n    plaintiffs “from proceeding with a class action, since individual is\n    sues” would “overwhelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242. The Court\n    in Basic sought to alleviate that concern by permitting plaintiffs to\n    invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known\n    as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory, “the\n    market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\n    publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepre\n    sentations.” Id., at 246. Under that doctrine, the Court explained,\n    one can assume an investor relies on public misstatements whenever\n    he “buys or sells stock at the price set by the market.” Id., at 247.\n    The Court also made clear that the presumption could be rebutted by\n    appropriate evidence. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove cer\n    tain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable presumption of reli\n    ance. According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund had to prove the\n    separate element of loss causation in order to trigger the presump\n    tion. That requirement is not justified by Basic or its logic. This\n    Court has never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invok\n    ing Basic’s rebuttable presumption. Loss causation addresses a mat\n    ter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,\n    presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.\n       The Court has referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule\n    10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss causation. Dura\n    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342. Consistent\n    with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied\n    on a misrepresentation, the Court has typically focused on facts sur\n    rounding the investor’s decision to engage in the transaction. Loss\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepre\n  sentation caused a subsequent economic loss. That has nothing to do\n  with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first\n  place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory. The\n  Court of Appeals’ rule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—\n  that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long\n  as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.\n  Pp. 5–8.\n     (c) Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not\n  be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke Basic’s pre\n  sumption of reliance. Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment\n  below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually re\n  quire EPJ Fund to prove “loss causation” as the Court has used that\n  term. According to Halliburton, “loss causation” was shorthand for a\n  different analysis. The lower court’s actual inquiry, Halliburton in\n  sists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated “price impact”—that\n  is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price\n  in the first place.\n     The Court does not accept Halliburton’s interpretation of the Court\n  of Appeals’ opinion. Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept\n  in securities law; it is not price impact. Whatever Halliburton thinks\n  the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.\n  The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those\n  words, the decision below cannot stand. Pp. 8–9.\n597 F. 3d 330, vacated and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

We hold that they\nneed not.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the\nlead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action\nfiled against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives\n(collectively Halliburton). The suit was brought on behalf\nof all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock\nbetween June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001.\n   EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various mis\nrepresentations designed to inflate its stock price, in viola\ntion of §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\n2      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5. See 48\nStat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010).\nThe complaint asserts that Halliburton deliberately made\nfalse statements about (1) the scope of its potential liabil\nity in asbestos litigation, (2) its expected revenue from\ncertain construction contracts, and (3) the benefits of its\nmerger with another company. EPJ Fund contends that\nHalliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures\nthat caused its stock price to drop and, consequently,\ninvestors to lose money.\n   After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to\nhave its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23. The parties agreed, and the District\nCourt held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general require\nments for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was\nsufficiently numerous, there were common questions of\nlaw or fact, the claims of the representative parties were\ntypical, and the representative parties would fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 3a.\n   The District Court also found that the action could\nproceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one\nproblem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain\ntiffs to prove “loss causation” in order to obtain class certi\nfication. Id., at 4a, and n. 2 (citing Oscar Private Equity\nInvs. v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F. 3d 261, 269 (CA5\n2007)). As the District Court explained, loss causation is\nthe “ ‘causal connection between the material misrepresen\ntation and the [economic] loss’ ” suffered by investors.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, and n. 3 (quoting Dura Pharma\nceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342 (2005)). After\nreviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective\ndisclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not\ncertify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had “failed\nto establish loss causation with respect to any” of its\nclaims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The court made clear,\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certifi\ncation. See 597 F. 3d 330 (CA5 2010). It confirmed that,\n“[i]n order to obtain class certification on its claims, [EPJ\nFund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the\ncorrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused\nthe stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” Id., at\n334. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals con\ncluded that EPJ Fund had failed to meet the “require\nments for proving loss causation at the class certification\nstage.” Id., at 344.\n   We granted the Fund’s petition for certiorari, 562 U. S.\n___ (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to\nwhether securities fraud plaintiffs must prove loss causa\ntion in order to obtain class certification.

We\nagree.\n                             A\n  As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund\nsatisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(3). In order to\ncertify a class under that Rule, a court must find “that the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members pre\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\n4      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). Consider\ning whether “questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate” begins, of course, with the ele\nments of the underlying cause of action. The elements of a\nprivate securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)\nand Rule 10b–5 are: “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or\nomission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection\nbetween the misrepresentation or omission and the pur\nchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misre-\npresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.’ ” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Stoneridge\nInvestment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552\nU. S. 148, 157 (2008)).\n   Whether common questions of law or fact predominate\nin a securities fraud action often turns on the element of\nreliance. The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had\nto prove the separate element of loss causation in order to\nestablish that reliance was capable of resolution on a\ncommon, classwide basis.\n   “Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive\nacts is an essential element of the §10(b) private cause of\naction.” Stoneridge, supra, at 159. This is because proof of\nreliance ensures that there is a proper “connection be\ntween a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s\ninjury.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 243 (1988).\nThe traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can\ndemonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware\nof a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant\ntransaction—e.g., purchasing common stock—based on\nthat specific misrepresentation. In that situation, the\nplaintiff plainly would have relied on the company’s decep\ntive conduct. A plaintiff unaware of the relevant state\nment, on the other hand, could not establish reliance on\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat basis.\n   We recognized in Basic, however, that limiting proof of\nreliance in such a way “would place an unnecessarily\nunrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff\nwho has traded on an impersonal market.” Id., at 245.\nWe also observed that “[r]equiring proof of individualized\nreliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class\neffectively would” prevent such plaintiffs “from proceeding\nwith a class action, since individual issues” would “over\nwhelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242.\n   The Court in Basic sought to alleviate those related\nconcerns by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable\npresumption of reliance based on what is known as the\n“fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory,\n“the market price of shares traded on well-developed\nmarkets reflects all publicly available information, and,\nhence, any material misrepresentations.” Id., at 246.\nBecause the market “transmits information to the investor\nin the processed form of a market price,” we can assume,\nthe Court explained, that an investor relies on public\nmisstatements whenever he “buys or sells stock at the\nprice set by the market.” Id., at 244, 247 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted); see also Stoneridge, supra, at 159;\nDura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U. S., at 341–342. The Court\nalso made clear that the presumption was just that, and\ncould be rebutted by appropriate evidence. See Basic,\nsupra, at 248.\n                            B\n  It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must\nprove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable\npresumption of reliance. It is common ground, for exam\nple, that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged\nmisrepresentations were publicly known (else how would\nthe market take them into account?), that the stock traded\nin an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction\n6      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntook place “between the time the misrepresentations were\nmade and the time the truth was revealed.” Basic, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27; id., at 241–247; see also Stoneridge,\nsupra, at 159.\n   According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to\nestablish loss causation at the certification stage to “trig\nger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.” 597 F. 3d, at\n335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (EPJ\nFund must “establish a causal link between the alleged\nfalsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on\nthe-market presumption”). The court determined that, in\norder to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ\nFund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton’s\nstock was “because of the correction to a prior misleading\nstatement” and “that the subsequent loss could not other\nwise be explained by some additional factors revealed then\nto the market.” Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted). This is the\nloss causation requirement as we have described it. See\nDura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 342; see also 15 U. S. C.\n§78u–4(b)(4).\n   The Court of Appeals’ requirement is not justified by\nBasic or its logic. To begin, we have never before men\ntioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basic’s\nrebuttable presumption of reliance. The term “loss causa\ntion” does not even appear in our Basic opinion. And for\ngood reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different\nfrom whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,\npresumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a\nstock.\n   We have referred to the element of reliance in a pri-\nvate Rule 10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss\ncausation. Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 341–342\n(citing Basic, supra, at 248–249). Consistent with that\ndescription, when considering whether a plaintiff has\nrelied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused\non facts surrounding the investor’s decision to engage in\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe transaction. See Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at\n342. Under Basic’s fraud-on-the-market doctrine, an in\nvestor presumptively relies on a defendant’s misrepre\nsentation if that “information is reflected in [the] market\nprice” of the stock at the time of the relevant transaction.\nSee Basic, 485 U. S., at 247.\n  Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show\nthat a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the\nmarket price also caused a subsequent economic loss. As\nwe made clear in Dura Pharmaceuticals, the fact that a\nstock’s “price on the date of purchase was inflated because\nof [a] misrepresentation” does not necessarily mean that\nthe misstatement is the cause of a later decline in value.\n544 U. S., at 342 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We observed that the drop could instead\nbe the result of other intervening causes, such as “changed\neconomic circumstances, changed investor expectations,\nnew industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or\nother events.” Id., at 342–343. If one of those factors were\nresponsible for the loss or part of it, a plaintiff would not\nbe able to prove loss causation to that extent. This is true\neven if the investor purchased the stock at a distorted\nprice, and thereby presumptively relied on the misrepre\nsentation reflected in that price.\n  According to the Court of Appeals, however, an inability\nto prove loss causation would prevent a plaintiff from\ninvoking the rebuttable presumption of reliance. Such a\nrule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—that an\ninvestor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so\nlong as it was reflected in the market price at the time of\nhis transaction. The fact that a subsequent loss may have\nbeen caused by factors other than the revelation of a mis\nrepresentation has nothing to do with whether an investor\nrelied on the misrepresentation in the first place, either\ndirectly or presumptively through the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory. Loss causation has no logical connection to the\n8        ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts necessary to establish the efficient market predicate\nto the fraud-on-the-market theory.\n  The Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund\nto show loss causation as a condition of obtaining class\ncertification.\n                               C\n  Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs\nshould not be required to prove loss causation in order to\ninvoke Basic’s presumption of reliance or otherwise\nachieve class certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–29.\nHalliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on\nthe ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually\nrequire plaintiffs to prove “loss causation” as we have used\nthat term. See id., at 27 (“it’s not loss causation as this\nCourt knows it in Dura”). According to Halliburton, “loss\ncausation” was merely “shorthand” for a different analysis.\nBrief for Respondents 18. The lower court’s actual in\nquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had\ndemonstrated “price impact”—that is, whether the alleged\nmisrepresentations affected the market price in the first\nplace. See, e.g., id., at 16–19, 24–27, 50–51; see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27 (stating that the Court of Appeals’ “test is\nsimply price impact” and that EPJ Fund’s “only burden\nunder the Fifth Circuit case law was to show price\nimpact”).*\n  “Price impact” simply refers to the effect of a misrepre\nsentation on a stock price. Halliburton’s theory is that if a\n——————\n   * Halliburton further concedes that, even if its conception of what the\nCourt of Appeals meant by “loss causation” is correct, the Court of\nAppeals erred by placing the initial burden on EPJ Fund. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 29 (“We agree . . . that the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden\nof production on the plaintiff, and that’s contrary to Basic”). According\nto Halliburton, a plaintiff must prove price impact only after Basic’s\npresumption has been successfully rebutted by the defendant. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28, 38–40.

While the opinion below may\ninclude some language consistent with a “price impact”\napproach, see, e.g., 597 F. 3d, at 336, we simply cannot\nignore the Court of Appeals’ repeated and explicit refer\nences to “loss causation,” see id., at 334 (three times), 334\nn. 2, 335, 335 n. 10 (twice), 335 n. 11, 336, 336 n. 19, 336\nn. 20, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341 n. 46, 342 n. 47, 343, 344\n(three times).\n  Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals\nmeant to say, what it said was loss causation: “[EPJ Fund]\nwas required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the cor\nrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the\nstock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” 597 F. 3d, at\n334; see id., at 335 (“we require plaintiffs to establish loss\ncausation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the lead plaintiff in a\n  putative securities fraud class action filed against Halliburton Co.\n  and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton). EPJ Fund alleges\n  that Halliburton made various misrepresentations designed to inflate\n  the company’s stock price, in violation of §10(b) of the Securities Ex\n  change Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule\n  10b–5. EPJ Fund also contends that Halliburton later made a num\n  ber of corrective disclosures that caused the stock price to drop and,\n  consequently, investors to lose money. EPJ Fund sought to have its\n  proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n  23. The District Court found that the suit could proceed as a class\n  action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one problem: Fifth Circuit prece\n  dent required securities fraud plaintiffs to prove “loss causation”—\n  i.e., that the defendant’s deceptive conduct caused the investors’\n  claimed economic loss—in order to obtain class certification. The\n  District Court concluded that EPJ Fund had failed to satisfy that re\n  quirement. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the denial of\n  class certification.\nHeld: Securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation in order\n to obtain class certification. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) In order to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a court must find\n “that the questions of law or fact common to class members predomi\n nate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that\n a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and ef\n ficiently adjudicating the controversy.” Considering whether “ques\n2         ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tions of law or fact common to class members predominate” begins, of\n    course, with the elements of the underlying cause of action. The ele\n    ments of a private securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)\n    and Rule 10b–5 are: “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by\n    the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresen\n    tation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance\n    upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6)\n    loss causation.” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___,\n    ___.\n       Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in such an\n    action often turns on the element of reliance. The traditional way a\n    plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of\n    a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—e.g.,\n    purchasing common stock—based on that specific misrepresentation.\n    The Court recognized in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, how\n    ever, that “[r]equiring proof of individualized reliance from each\n    member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would” prevent such\n    plaintiffs “from proceeding with a class action, since individual is\n    sues” would “overwhelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242. The Court\n    in Basic sought to alleviate that concern by permitting plaintiffs to\n    invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on what is known\n    as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory, “the\n    market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all\n    publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepre\n    sentations.” Id., at 246. Under that doctrine, the Court explained,\n    one can assume an investor relies on public misstatements whenever\n    he “buys or sells stock at the price set by the market.” Id., at 247.\n    The Court also made clear that the presumption could be rebutted by\n    appropriate evidence. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must prove cer\n    tain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable presumption of reli\n    ance. According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund had to prove the\n    separate element of loss causation in order to trigger the presump\n    tion. That requirement is not justified by Basic or its logic. This\n    Court has never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invok\n    ing Basic’s rebuttable presumption. Loss causation addresses a mat\n    ter different from whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,\n    presumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a stock.\n       The Court has referred to the element of reliance in a private Rule\n    10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss causation. Dura\n    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342. Consistent\n    with that description, when considering whether a plaintiff has relied\n    on a misrepresentation, the Court has typically focused on facts sur\n    rounding the investor’s decision to engage in the transaction. Loss\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show that the misrepre\n  sentation caused a subsequent economic loss. That has nothing to do\n  with whether an investor relied on that misrepresentation in the first\n  place, either directly or through the fraud-on-the-market theory. The\n  Court of Appeals’ rule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—\n  that an investor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so long\n  as it was reflected in the market price at the time of his transaction.\n  Pp. 5–8.\n     (c) Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs should not\n  be required to prove loss causation in order to invoke Basic’s pre\n  sumption of reliance. Halliburton nonetheless defends the judgment\n  below on the ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually re\n  quire EPJ Fund to prove “loss causation” as the Court has used that\n  term. According to Halliburton, “loss causation” was shorthand for a\n  different analysis. The lower court’s actual inquiry, Halliburton in\n  sists, was whether EPJ Fund had demonstrated “price impact”—that\n  is, whether the alleged misrepresentations affected the market price\n  in the first place.\n     The Court does not accept Halliburton’s interpretation of the Court\n  of Appeals’ opinion. Loss causation is a familiar and distinct concept\n  in securities law; it is not price impact. Whatever Halliburton thinks\n  the Court of Appeals meant to say, what it said was loss causation.\n  The Court takes the Court of Appeals at its word.

We hold that they\nneed not.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the\nlead plaintiff in a putative securities fraud class action\nfiled against Halliburton Co. and one of its executives\n(collectively Halliburton). The suit was brought on behalf\nof all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock\nbetween June 3, 1999, and December 7, 2001.\n   EPJ Fund alleges that Halliburton made various mis\nrepresentations designed to inflate its stock price, in viola\ntion of §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\n2      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5. See 48\nStat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b); 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010).\nThe complaint asserts that Halliburton deliberately made\nfalse statements about (1) the scope of its potential liabil\nity in asbestos litigation, (2) its expected revenue from\ncertain construction contracts, and (3) the benefits of its\nmerger with another company. EPJ Fund contends that\nHalliburton later made a number of corrective disclosures\nthat caused its stock price to drop and, consequently,\ninvestors to lose money.\n   After defeating a motion to dismiss, EPJ Fund sought to\nhave its proposed class certified pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23. The parties agreed, and the District\nCourt held, that EPJ Fund satisfied the general require\nments for class actions set out in Rule 23(a): The class was\nsufficiently numerous, there were common questions of\nlaw or fact, the claims of the representative parties were\ntypical, and the representative parties would fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 3a.\n   The District Court also found that the action could\nproceed as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3), but for one\nproblem: Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain\ntiffs to prove “loss causation” in order to obtain class certi\nfication. Id., at 4a, and n. 2 (citing Oscar Private Equity\nInvs. v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F. 3d 261, 269 (CA5\n2007)). As the District Court explained, loss causation is\nthe “ ‘causal connection between the material misrepresen\ntation and the [economic] loss’ ” suffered by investors.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, and n. 3 (quoting Dura Pharma\nceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342 (2005)). After\nreviewing the alleged misrepresentations and corrective\ndisclosures, the District Court concluded that it could not\ncertify the class in this case because EPJ Fund had “failed\nto establish loss causation with respect to any” of its\nclaims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a. The court made clear,\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, that absent “this stringent loss causation re\nquirement,” it would have granted the Fund’s certification\nrequest. Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of class certifi\ncation. See 597 F. 3d 330 (CA5 2010). It confirmed that,\n“[i]n order to obtain class certification on its claims, [EPJ\nFund] was required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the\ncorrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused\nthe stock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” Id., at\n334. Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals con\ncluded that EPJ Fund had failed to meet the “require\nments for proving loss causation at the class certification\nstage.” Id., at 344.\n   We granted the Fund’s petition for certiorari, 562 U. S.\n___ (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to\nwhether securities fraud plaintiffs must prove loss causa\ntion in order to obtain class certification. Compare 597\nF. 3d, at 334 (case below), with In re Salomon Analyst\nMetromedia Litigation, 544 F. 3d 474, 483 (CA2 2008) (not\nrequiring investors to prove loss causation at class certifi\ncation stage); Schleicher v.

We\nagree.\n                             A\n  As noted, the sole dispute here is whether EPJ Fund\nsatisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(3). In order to\ncertify a class under that Rule, a court must find “that the\nquestions of law or fact common to class members pre\ndominate over any questions affecting only individual\n4      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmembers, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating\nthe controversy.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). Consider\ning whether “questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate” begins, of course, with the ele\nments of the underlying cause of action. The elements of a\nprivate securities fraud claim based on violations of §10(b)\nand Rule 10b–5 are: “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or\nomission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection\nbetween the misrepresentation or omission and the pur\nchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misre-\npresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss\ncausation.’ ” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Stoneridge\nInvestment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552\nU. S. 148, 157 (2008)).\n   Whether common questions of law or fact predominate\nin a securities fraud action often turns on the element of\nreliance. The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had\nto prove the separate element of loss causation in order to\nestablish that reliance was capable of resolution on a\ncommon, classwide basis.\n   “Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive\nacts is an essential element of the §10(b) private cause of\naction.” Stoneridge, supra, at 159. This is because proof of\nreliance ensures that there is a proper “connection be\ntween a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s\ninjury.” Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 243 (1988).\nThe traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can\ndemonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware\nof a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant\ntransaction—e.g., purchasing common stock—based on\nthat specific misrepresentation. In that situation, the\nplaintiff plainly would have relied on the company’s decep\ntive conduct. A plaintiff unaware of the relevant state\nment, on the other hand, could not establish reliance on\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat basis.\n   We recognized in Basic, however, that limiting proof of\nreliance in such a way “would place an unnecessarily\nunrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff\nwho has traded on an impersonal market.” Id., at 245.\nWe also observed that “[r]equiring proof of individualized\nreliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class\neffectively would” prevent such plaintiffs “from proceeding\nwith a class action, since individual issues” would “over\nwhelm[ ] the common ones.” Id., at 242.\n   The Court in Basic sought to alleviate those related\nconcerns by permitting plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable\npresumption of reliance based on what is known as the\n“fraud-on-the-market” theory. According to that theory,\n“the market price of shares traded on well-developed\nmarkets reflects all publicly available information, and,\nhence, any material misrepresentations.” Id., at 246.\nBecause the market “transmits information to the investor\nin the processed form of a market price,” we can assume,\nthe Court explained, that an investor relies on public\nmisstatements whenever he “buys or sells stock at the\nprice set by the market.” Id., at 244, 247 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted); see also Stoneridge, supra, at 159;\nDura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U. S., at 341–342. The Court\nalso made clear that the presumption was just that, and\ncould be rebutted by appropriate evidence. See Basic,\nsupra, at 248.\n                            B\n  It is undisputed that securities fraud plaintiffs must\nprove certain things in order to invoke Basic’s rebuttable\npresumption of reliance. It is common ground, for exam\nple, that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged\nmisrepresentations were publicly known (else how would\nthe market take them into account?), that the stock traded\nin an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction\n6      ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntook place “between the time the misrepresentations were\nmade and the time the truth was revealed.” Basic, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27; id., at 241–247; see also Stoneridge,\nsupra, at 159.\n   According to the Court of Appeals, EPJ Fund also had to\nestablish loss causation at the certification stage to “trig\nger the fraud-on-the-market presumption.” 597 F. 3d, at\n335 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (EPJ\nFund must “establish a causal link between the alleged\nfalsehoods and its losses in order to invoke the fraud-on\nthe-market presumption”). The court determined that, in\norder to invoke a rebuttable presumption of reliance, EPJ\nFund needed to prove that the decline in Halliburton’s\nstock was “because of the correction to a prior misleading\nstatement” and “that the subsequent loss could not other\nwise be explained by some additional factors revealed then\nto the market.” Id., at 336 (emphasis deleted). This is the\nloss causation requirement as we have described it. See\nDura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 342; see also 15 U. S. C.\n§78u–4(b)(4).\n   The Court of Appeals’ requirement is not justified by\nBasic or its logic. To begin, we have never before men\ntioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basic’s\nrebuttable presumption of reliance. The term “loss causa\ntion” does not even appear in our Basic opinion. And for\ngood reason: Loss causation addresses a matter different\nfrom whether an investor relied on a misrepresentation,\npresumptively or otherwise, when buying or selling a\nstock.\n   We have referred to the element of reliance in a pri-\nvate Rule 10b–5 action as “transaction causation,” not loss\ncausation. Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at 341–342\n(citing Basic, supra, at 248–249). Consistent with that\ndescription, when considering whether a plaintiff has\nrelied on a misrepresentation, we have typically focused\non facts surrounding the investor’s decision to engage in\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe transaction. See Dura Pharmaceuticals, supra, at\n342. Under Basic’s fraud-on-the-market doctrine, an in\nvestor presumptively relies on a defendant’s misrepre\nsentation if that “information is reflected in [the] market\nprice” of the stock at the time of the relevant transaction.\nSee Basic, 485 U. S., at 247.\n  Loss causation, by contrast, requires a plaintiff to show\nthat a misrepresentation that affected the integrity of the\nmarket price also caused a subsequent economic loss. As\nwe made clear in Dura Pharmaceuticals, the fact that a\nstock’s “price on the date of purchase was inflated because\nof [a] misrepresentation” does not necessarily mean that\nthe misstatement is the cause of a later decline in value.\n544 U. S., at 342 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We observed that the drop could instead\nbe the result of other intervening causes, such as “changed\neconomic circumstances, changed investor expectations,\nnew industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or\nother events.” Id., at 342–343. If one of those factors were\nresponsible for the loss or part of it, a plaintiff would not\nbe able to prove loss causation to that extent. This is true\neven if the investor purchased the stock at a distorted\nprice, and thereby presumptively relied on the misrepre\nsentation reflected in that price.\n  According to the Court of Appeals, however, an inability\nto prove loss causation would prevent a plaintiff from\ninvoking the rebuttable presumption of reliance. Such a\nrule contravenes Basic’s fundamental premise—that an\ninvestor presumptively relies on a misrepresentation so\nlong as it was reflected in the market price at the time of\nhis transaction. The fact that a subsequent loss may have\nbeen caused by factors other than the revelation of a mis\nrepresentation has nothing to do with whether an investor\nrelied on the misrepresentation in the first place, either\ndirectly or presumptively through the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory. Loss causation has no logical connection to the\n8        ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC. v. HALLIBURTON CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts necessary to establish the efficient market predicate\nto the fraud-on-the-market theory.\n  The Court of Appeals erred by requiring EPJ Fund\nto show loss causation as a condition of obtaining class\ncertification.\n                               C\n  Halliburton concedes that securities fraud plaintiffs\nshould not be required to prove loss causation in order to\ninvoke Basic’s presumption of reliance or otherwise\nachieve class certification. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–29.\nHalliburton nonetheless defends the judgment below on\nthe ground that the Court of Appeals did not actually\nrequire plaintiffs to prove “loss causation” as we have used\nthat term. See id., at 27 (“it’s not loss causation as this\nCourt knows it in Dura”). According to Halliburton, “loss\ncausation” was merely “shorthand” for a different analysis.\nBrief for Respondents 18. The lower court’s actual in\nquiry, Halliburton insists, was whether EPJ Fund had\ndemonstrated “price impact”—that is, whether the alleged\nmisrepresentations affected the market price in the first\nplace. See, e.g., id., at 16–19, 24–27, 50–51; see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27 (stating that the Court of Appeals’ “test is\nsimply price impact” and that EPJ Fund’s “only burden\nunder the Fifth Circuit case law was to show price\nimpact”).*\n  “Price impact” simply refers to the effect of a misrepre\nsentation on a stock price. Halliburton’s theory is that if a\n——————\n   * Halliburton further concedes that, even if its conception of what the\nCourt of Appeals meant by “loss causation” is correct, the Court of\nAppeals erred by placing the initial burden on EPJ Fund. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 29 (“We agree . . . that the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden\nof production on the plaintiff, and that’s contrary to Basic”). According\nto Halliburton, a plaintiff must prove price impact only after Basic’s\npresumption has been successfully rebutted by the defendant. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28, 38–40. We express no views on the merits of such a\nframework.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmisrepresentation does not affect market price, an inves\ntor cannot be said to have relied on the misrepresentation\nmerely because he purchased stock at that price. If the\nprice is unaffected by the fraud, the price does not reflect\nthe fraud.\n  We do not accept Halliburton’s wishful interpretation of\nthe Court of Appeals’ opinion. As we have explained, loss\ncausation is a familiar and distinct concept in securities\nlaw; it is not price impact. While the opinion below may\ninclude some language consistent with a “price impact”\napproach, see, e.g., 597 F. 3d, at 336, we simply cannot\nignore the Court of Appeals’ repeated and explicit refer\nences to “loss causation,” see id., at 334 (three times), 334\nn. 2, 335, 335 n. 10 (twice), 335 n. 11, 336, 336 n. 19, 336\nn. 20, 337, 338, 341 (twice), 341 n. 46, 342 n. 47, 343, 344\n(three times).\n  Whatever Halliburton thinks the Court of Appeals\nmeant to say, what it said was loss causation: “[EPJ Fund]\nwas required to prove loss causation, i.e., that the cor\nrected truth of the former falsehoods actually caused the\nstock price to fall and resulted in the losses.” 597 F. 3d, at\n334; see id., at 335 (“we require plaintiffs to establish loss\ncausation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ntake the Court of Appeals at its word. Based on those\nwords, the decision below cannot stand.\n                        *    *   *\n  Because we conclude the Court of Appeals erred by\nrequiring EPJ Fund to prove loss causation at the certifi\ncation stage, we need not, and do not, address any other\nquestion about Basic, its presumption, or how and when it\nmay be rebutted. To the extent Halliburton has preserved\nany further arguments against class certification, they\nmay be addressed in the first instance by the Court of\nAppeals on remand.\n10    ERICA P.
