UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131533. Argued February 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 9, 2011\nIn 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugs\u2014in\n  particular, the new phenomenon of crack cocaine\u2014prompted Con\n  gress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine\n  related substances. Following several hearings, Congress enacted\n  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA). The statute provides a\n  mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses in\n  volving \u201c(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing\n  a detectable amount of . . . (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric\n  isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture\n  or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d 21\n  U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). The statute similarly provides a 5-year sen\n  tence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in\n  clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii). \u00a7841(b)(1)(B).\n     In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50\n  grams or more of cocaine base under \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).\n  The District Court declined DePierre\u2019s request that the jury be in\n  structed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of \u201cco\n  caine base,\u201d it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.\n  DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120\n  months in prison mandated by the statute. The First Circuit af\n  firmed, rejecting DePierre\u2019s argument that \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should\n  be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine. Instead, it\n  adhered to its precedent holding that \u201ccocaine base\u201d refers to all\n  forms of cocaine base.\nHeld: \u201c[C]ocaine base,\u201d as used in \u00a7841(b)(1), means not just \u201ccrack co\n caine,\u201d but cocaine in its chemically basic form. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) The most natural reading of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) is co\n caine in its chemically basic form\u2014i.e., the molecule found in crack\n2                     DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cocaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then, \u201ccocaine\n    base\u201d reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine. In arguing to the\n    contrary, DePierre urges the Court to stray far from the statute\u2019s\n    text, which nowhere contains the term \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d The Govern\n    ment\u2019s reading, on the other hand, follows the words Congress chose\n    to use. DePierre is correct that \u201ccocaine base\u201d is technically redun\n    dant\u2014chemically speaking, cocaine is a base. But Congress had good\n    reason to use \u201ccocaine base\u201d\u2014to make clear that clause (iii) does not\n    apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride (i.e., powder co\n    caine) or other nonbasic cocaine-related substances. At the time the\n    statute was enacted, \u201ccocaine\u201d was commonly used to refer to powder\n    cocaine, and the scientific and medical literature often uses \u201ccocaine\u201d\n    to refer to all cocaine-related substances, including ones that are not\n    chemically basic. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) This reading of \u201ccocaine base\u201d is also consistent with\n    \u00a7841(b)(1)\u2019s somewhat confusing structure. Subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II)\n    lists \u201ccocaine,\u201d along with \u201cits salts, optical and geometric isomers,\n    and salts of isomers,\u201d as elements subject to clause (ii)\u2019s higher quan\n    tity threshold. DePierre is correct that, because \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201cco\n    caine base\u201d both refer to chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving\n    a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized accord\n    ing to the lower quantity threshold of clause (iii), and never the\n    higher threshold clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances\n    containing \u201ccocaine.\u201d But the Court does not agree that the term \u201cco\n    caine\u201d in clause (ii) is therefore superfluous\u2014in light of the structure\n    of subclause (II), \u201ccocaine\u201d is needed as the reference point for \u201csalts\u201d\n    and \u201cisomers,\u201d which would otherwise be meaningless.\n       The term \u201ccocaine\u201d in clause (ii) also performs another critical func\n    tion. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance\n    \u201cdescribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d Thus, clause\n    (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related sub\n    stances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for a sub\n    set of those substances\u2014the ones that \u201ccontai[n] cocaine base.\u201d For\n    this structure to work, however, \u00a7841(b)(1) must \u201cdescrib[e] in clause\n    (ii)\u201d substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then com\n    prise the subset described in clause (iii). Congress thus had good\n    reason to include the term \u201ccocaine\u201d in clause (ii), and the slight in\n    consistency created by its use of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) is insuf\n    ficient reason to adopt DePierre\u2019s interpretation. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) DePierre\u2019s additional arguments are unpersuasive. First, the\n    records of the 1986 congressional hearings do not support his conten\n    tion that Congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving\n    crack cocaine. Second, reading \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean chemically ba\n    sic cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, does not lead to an absurd re\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Third, the fact that \u201ccocaine base\u201d in the Federal Sentencing\n  Guidelines is defined as \u201ccrack\u201d does not require that the statutory\n  term be interpreted the same way. Fourth, the statute is sufficiently\n  clear that the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre\u2019s favor.\n  Pp. 13\u201318.\n599 F. 3d 25, affirmed.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C.\n\u00a7841(a), including those involving 50 grams or more of\n\u201ca mixture or substance . . . which contains cocaine base,\u201d\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), and a minimum 5-year sentence for\noffenses involving 5 grams or more of the same,\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii). This case requires us to decide whether\nthe term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in this statute refers\ngenerally to cocaine in its chemically basic form or exclu\nsively to what is colloquially known as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d We\nconclude that \u201ccocaine base\u201d means the former.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  As a matter of chemistry, cocaine is an alkaloid with the\nmolecular formula C17H21NO4. Webster\u2019s Third New In\nternational Dictionary 434 (2002). An alkaloid is a base\u2014\nthat is, a compound capable of reacting with an acid to\nform a salt.1 Id., at 54, 180; see also Brief for Individual\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 There   are more detailed theories of how acids and bases interact.\n2                  DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nPhysicians and Scientists as Amici Curiae 2\u20133 (herein\nafter Physicians Brief). Cocaine is derived from the coca\nplant native to South America. The leaves of the coca\nplant can be processed with water, kerosene, sodium car\nbonate, and sulphuric acid to produce a paste-like sub\nstance. R. Weiss, S. Mirin, & R. Bartel, Cocaine 10 (2d\ned. 1994). When dried, the resulting \u201ccoca paste\u201d can be\nvaporized (through the application of heat) and inhaled,\ni.e., \u201csmoked.\u201d See United States Sentencing Commission,\nSpecial Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal\nSentencing Policy 11\u201312 (1995) (hereinafter Commission\nReport). Coca paste contains C17H21NO4\u2014that is, cocaine\nin its base form.\n   Dissolving coca paste in water and hydrochloric acid\nproduces (after several intermediate steps) cocaine hydro\nchloride, which is a salt with the molecular formula\nC17H22NO4+Cl-. Id., at 12; Physicians Brief 3. Cocaine\nhydrochloride, therefore, is not a base. It generally comes\nin powder form, which we will refer to as \u201cpowder cocaine.\u201d\nIt is usually insufflated (breathed in through the nose),\nthough it can also be ingested or diluted in water and\ninjected. Because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a\nmuch higher temperature than chemically basic cocaine\n(at which point the cocaine molecule tends to decompose),\nit is generally not smoked. See Commission Report 11,\nn. 15, 12\u201313.\n   Cocaine hydrochloride can be converted into cocaine in\nits base form by combining powder cocaine with water and\na base, like sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking\nsoda). Id., at 14. The chemical reaction changes the\ncocaine hydrochloride molecule into a chemically basic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFor our purposes, it is sufficient to note the fundamental proposition\nthat a base and an acid can combine to form a salt, and all three are\ndifferent types of compounds. See generally Brief for Individual Physi\ncians and Scientists as Amici Curiae 8; A Dictionary of Chemistry 6\u20137,\n62\u201363, 496 (J. Dainith ed., 5th ed. 2004).\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncocaine molecule, Physicians Brief 4, and the resulting\nsolid substance can be cooled and broken into small pieces\nand then smoked, Commission Report 14. This substance\nis commonly known as \u201ccrack\u201d or \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d2 Alter\nnatively, powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and\nammonia (also a base); with the addition of ether, a solid\nsubstance\u2014known as \u201cfreebase\u201d\u2014separates from the solu\ntion, and can be smoked. Id., at 13. As with crack cocaine,\nfreebase contains cocaine in its chemically basic form.\nIbid.\n   Chemically, therefore, there is no difference between the\ncocaine in coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase\u2014all are\ncocaine in its base form. On the other hand, cocaine in its\nbase form and in its salt form (i.e., cocaine hydrochloride)\nare chemically different, though they have the same active\ningredient and produce the same physiological and psy\nchotropic effects. See id., at 14\u201322. The key difference\nbetween them is the method by which they generally enter\nthe body; smoking cocaine in its base form\u2014whether as\ncoca paste, freebase, or crack cocaine\u2014allows the body to\nabsorb the active ingredient quickly, thereby producing a\nshorter, more intense high than obtained from insufflating\ncocaine hydrochloride. Ibid.; see generally Kimbrough v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 85, 94 (2007).\n                             B\n  In 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers\nassociated with illicit drugs\u2014and the new phenomenon\nof crack cocaine in particular\u2014prompted Congress to re\nvise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine\nrelated substances. See id., at 95\u201396. At the time, federal\nlaw generally tied the penalties for drug offenses to both\nthe type of drug and the quantity involved, with no pro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Though the terms \u201ccrack\u201d and \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d are interchangeable,\n\nin this opinion we adopt DePierre\u2019s practice and generally employ the\nlatter.\n4                  DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nvision for mandatory minimum sentences. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III). After holding several\nhearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack\ncocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of\n1986 (ADAA), 100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory\nminimum sentences for controlled-substance offenses in\nvolving specific quantities of drugs.\n   As relevant here, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10\nyear sentence for certain drug offenses involving 5 kilo\ngrams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance containing a\ndetectable amount of \u201d various cocaine-related elements,\nincluding coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts; it also\ncalled for the same sentence for offenses involving only\n50 grams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance . . . which\ncontains cocaine base.\u201d ADAA, \u00a71002, 100 Stat. 3207\u20132\n(amending \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2013(iii)) (emphasis added). The\nADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for\noffenses involving 500 grams of a mixture or substance\ncontaining coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5\ngrams of a mixture or substance containing \u201ccocaine base.\u201d\nId., at 3207\u20133 (amending \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(ii)\u2013(iii)).\n   Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio for the\nthreshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that\ntriggered the statute\u2019s mandatory minimum penalties.\nThat is, 5 grams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance . . .\nwhich contains cocaine base\u201d was penalized as severely as\n100 times that amount of the other cocaine-related ele\nments enumerated in the statute. These provisions were\nstill in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s conviction and\nsentence.3 See \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B) (2000 ed. and Supp. V).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Due to a recent amendment, the quantity ratio in \u00a7841(b)(1) is now\n\nroughly 18-to-1, but otherwise the relevant statutory provisions are\nunchanged from those in effect at the time DePierre was sentenced.\nSee Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), \u00a72, 124 Stat. 2372 (changing the\nquantity in \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) from 50 to 280 grams and in subparagraph\n(B)(iii) from 5 to 28 grams).\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Under the Guidelines, the offense levels for drug\ncrimes are tied to the drug type and quantity involved.\nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2010) (USSG). The Commission\noriginally adopted the ADAA\u2019s 100-to-1 ratio for offenses\ninvolving \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base,\u201d though instead of\nsetting only two quantity thresholds, as the ADAA did, the\nGuidelines \u201cset sentences for the full range of possible\ndrug quantities.\u201d Commission Report 1; see generally\nKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 96\u201397.4\n  The original version of \u00a72D1.1(c) did not define \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d as used in that provision, but in 1993 the Commis\nsion issued an amendment to explain that \u201c \u2018[c]ocaine\nbase,\u2019 for the purposes of this guideline, means \u2018crack,\u2019 \u201d\nthat is, \u201cthe street name for a form of cocaine base, usually\nprepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium\nbicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike\nform.\u201d USSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov. 1, 1993);\nsee also USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n.

The Commission noted\nthat \u201cforms of cocaine base other than crack (e.g., coca\npaste . . .) will be treated as cocaine.\u201d USSG App. C,\nAmdt. 487.5\n                             C\n  In April 2005, petitioner Frantz DePierre sold two bags\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In 2007 the Commission increased the quantity of cocaine base re\n\nquired to trigger each offense level, reducing the cocaine base-to-cocaine\nsentencing ratio under the Guidelines. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.\n706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Unless otherwise noted, we cite to the\ncurrent versions of the relevant Guidelines provisions.\n  5 The Guidelines\u2019 Drug Quantity Table only lists \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201cco\n\ncaine base\u201d among its enumerated controlled substances, but the\napplication notes make clear that the term \u201ccocaine\u201d includes \u201cecgonine\nand coca leaves,\u201d as well as \u201csalts, isomers, and salts of isomers\u201d of\ncocaine. \u00a72D1.1(c), and comment., n. 5.\n6                  DEPIERRE v.

DePierre was subse\nquently indicted on a charge of distributing 50 grams or\nmore of cocaine base under \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).6\nAt trial, a Government chemist testified that the sub\nstance in the bags, which weighed 55.1 grams, was \u201cco\ncaine base.\u201d Tr. 488, 490. She was not able to identify any\nsodium bicarbonate. Id., at 499. A police officer testified\nthat the substance in question was \u201coff-white [and]\nchunky.\u201d Id., at 455.\n   DePierre asked the District Court to instruct the jury\nthat, in order to find him guilty of distribution of cocaine\nbase, it must find that his offense involved \u201cthe form\nof cocaine base known as crack cocaine.\u201d App. in No. 08\u2013\n2101 (CA1), p. 43. His proposed jury instruction defined\n\u201ccrack\u201d identically to the Guidelines definition. See id., at\n43\u201344; see also USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D). In addition, De-\nPierre asked the court to instruct the jury that \u201c[c]hemi\ncal analysis cannot establish a substance as crack because\ncrack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base,\nalthough it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,\nwhich is usually used in the processing of crack.\u201d App. in\nNo. 08\u20132101, at 44.\n   The court, however, instructed the jury that \u201cthe statute\nthat\u2019s relevant asks about cocaine base.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     scribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d7\n  We agree with the Government that the most natural\nreading of the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d is \u201ccocaine in its base\nform\u201d\u2014i.e., C17H21NO4, the molecule found in crack co\ncaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then,\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d reaches more broadly than just crack co\ncaine. In arguing to the contrary, DePierre asks us to\nstray far from the statute\u2019s text, as the term \u201ccrack co\ncaine\u201d appears nowhere in the ADAA (or the United States\nCode, for that matter). While the Government\u2019s reading is\nnot without its problems,8 that reading follows from the\nwords Congress chose to include in the text. See United\nStates v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, 384 (2008) (eschewing\nan interpretation that was \u201cnot faithful to the statutory\ntext\u201d). In short, the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d is more plausibly\nread to mean the \u201cchemically basic form of cocaine,\u201d Brief\nfor United States 15, than it is \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d Brief for\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 As noted earlier, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B) calls for a mandatory minimum 5\n\nyear sentence for offenses involving exactly the same substances; the\nonly difference in subparagraph (B) is that the threshold quantity in\nclause (ii) is 500 grams, and in clause (iii) it is 5 grams. Because the\n100-to-1 ratio is a feature of both \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A) and (B), and those\nsubparagraphs are identical in all other respects, throughout this\nopinion we use the terms \u201cclause (ii)\u201d and \u201cclause (iii)\u201d to refer to those\nclauses as present in either subparagraph.\n   8 The Government urges us to give \u201ccocaine base\u201d its \u201csettled, unam\n\nbiguous scientific meaning,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe form of cocaine classified chemi\ncally as a base, with the chemical formula C17H21NO4 and a particular\nmolecular structure.\u201d Brief for United States 20; cf. McDermott Int\u2019l,\nInc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 342 (1991) (\u201cIn the absence of contrary\nindication, we assume that when a statute uses . . . a term [of art],\nCongress intended it to have its established meaning\u201d). But the scien\ntifically proper appellation for C17H21NO4 is \u201ccocaine\u201d tout court, and\nthe Government cites no source that uses \u201ccocaine base\u201d to refer to\nC17H21NO4 (save lower-court opinions construing the statute at issue\nin this case). Therefore, there is no \u201csettled meaning\u201d\u2014scientific or\notherwise\u2014of \u201ccocaine base\u201d for us to apply to \u00a7841(b)(1).\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 24, 28.9\n   We agree with DePierre that using the term \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d to refer to C17H21NO4 is technically redundant; as\nnoted earlier, chemically speaking cocaine is a base. If\nCongress meant in clause (iii) to penalize more severely\noffenses involving \u201ca mixture or substance . . . which\ncontains\u201d cocaine in its base form it could have simply\n(and more correctly) used the word \u201ccocaine\u201d instead. But\nCongress had good reason to use \u201ccocaine base\u201d in the\nADAA\u2014to distinguish the substances covered by clause\n(iii) from other cocaine-related substances. For example,\nat the time Congress enacted the statute, the word \u201cco\ncaine\u201d was commonly used to refer to cocaine hydrochlo\nride, i.e., powder cocaine. See, e.g., United States v. Mon\ntoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 536, 544 (1985)\n(repeatedly referring to cocaine hydrochloride as \u201cco\ncaine\u201d); \u201cCrack\u201d Cocaine, Hearing before the Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee\non Governmental Affairs, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 94 (1986)\n(hereinafter Crack Cocaine Hearing) (prepared statement\nof David L. Westrate, Assistant Administrator, Drug\nEnforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice) (discussing produc\ntion of \u201ca white, crystalline powder, cocaine hydrochloride,\notherwise known simply as cocaine\u201d).\n   To make things more confusing, in the scientific and\nmedical literature the word \u201ccocaine\u201d is often used to refer\nto all cocaine-related substances, including powder co\ncaine. See, e.g., J. Fay, The Alcohol/Drug Abuse Diction\nary and Encyclopedia 26\u201327 (1988); Weiss et al., Cocaine,\nat 15\u201325; R. Lewis, Hawley\u2019s Condensed Chemical Dic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The statute itself gives us good reason to reject DePierre\u2019s reading.\n\nSubstituting \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d for \u201ccocaine base\u201d would mean that clause\n(iii) only applies to a \u201cmixture or substance . . . which contains [crack\ncocaine].\u201d But crack cocaine is itself a \u201csubstance\u201d involved in drug\noffenses; it is the end product that is bought, sold, and consumed. We\nare aware of no substance that \u201ccontains\u201d crack cocaine.\n10                 DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntionary 317 (15th ed. 2007). Accordingly, Congress\u2019 choice\nto use the admittedly redundant term \u201ccocaine base\u201d to\nrefer to chemically basic cocaine is best understood as an\neffort to make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to\noffenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic\ncocaine-related substances.\n                              B\n   Notwithstanding DePierre\u2019s arguments to the contrary,\nreading \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean chemically basic cocaine is\nalso consistent with \u00a7841(b)(1)\u2019s somewhat confounding\nstructure. DePierre is correct that the interpretation we\nadopt today raises the question why Congress included the\nword \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) of clause (ii). That sub\nclause lists \u201ccocaine, its salts, optical and geometric iso\nmers, and salts of isomers\u201d as elements subject to clause\n(ii)\u2019s higher quantity threshold.       \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II),\n(B)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). If, as we conclude, the terms\n\u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d both mean chemically basic\ncocaine, offenses involving a mixture or substance which\ncontains such cocaine will always be penalized according\nto the lower quantity thresholds of clause (iii), and never\nthe higher quantity thresholds clause (ii) establishes for\nmixtures and substances containing \u201ccocaine.\u201d10\n   While this much is true, we do not agree with DePierre\nthat the word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) is therefore su\nperfluous. For without the word \u201ccocaine\u201d subclause (II)\nmakes no sense: It would provide a minimum sentence for\noffenses involving a specified quantity of simply \u201cits salts,\noptical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\u201d In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 DePierre makes a similar argument with respect to coca leaves:\n\nBecause they contain chemically basic cocaine, he contends, under the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation offenses involving coca leaves will never\nbe subject to the lower quantity threshold associated with subclause (I),\nrendering that provision superfluous. For reasons discussed later, see\ninfra, at 15\u201316, we are not convinced.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of the structure of the subclause, the word \u201ccocaine\u201d\nis needed as the reference point for \u201csalts\u201d and \u201cisomers.\u201d\n   The word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) also performs an\nother critical function. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses\ninvolving \u201ca mixture or substance described in clause (ii)\nwhich contains cocaine base.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii)\n(emphasis added). In other words, clause (ii) imposes a\npenalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances\ngenerally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for\na subset of those substances\u2014the ones that \u201ccontai[n]\ncocaine base.\u201d For this structure to work, however,\n\u00a7841(b)(1) must \u201cdescrib[e] in clause (ii)\u201d substances con\ntaining chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the\nsubset described in clause (iii). If such substances were\nnot present in clause (ii), clause (iii) would only apply to\nsubstances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and\none of the other elements enumerated in clause (ii). Pre\nsumably, the result would be that clause (iii) would not\napply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca paste offenses, as\nthere is no indication that, in addition to \u201ccocaine base\u201d\n(i.e., C17H21NO4), those substances contain cocaine \u201csalts\u201d\n(e.g., cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of the other\nelements enumerated in clause (ii). In short, the exclusion\nof \u201ccocaine\u201d from clause (ii) would result in clause (iii)\neffectively describing a null set, which obviously was not\nCongress\u2019 intent.\n   Of course, this redundancy could have been avoided by\nsimply drafting clause (iii) to penalize offenses involving\n\u201ca mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,\u201d\nwithout reference to clause (ii)\u2014that is, Congress could\nhave drafted clause (iii) to specify a separate set of cocaine\nrelated substances, not a subset of those in clause (ii).\nThat we may rue inartful legislative drafting, however,\ndoes not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a\n12                  DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute as faithfully as possible to its actual text.11 And as\nnoted earlier, there is no textual support for DePierre\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d\n  We also recognize that our reading of \u201ccocaine\u201d in sub\nclause (II) and \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) to both refer to\nchemically basic cocaine is in tension with the usual rule\nthat \u201cwhen the legislature uses certain language in one\npart of the statute and different language in another, the\ncourt assumes different meanings were intended.\u201d Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, because \u201cCongress\nsometimes uses slightly different language to convey the\nsame message,\u201d Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 134\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), we must be\ncareful not to place too much emphasis on the marginal\nsemantic divergence between the terms \u201ccocaine\u201d and\n\u201ccocaine base.\u201d As we have already explained, Congress\nhad good reason to employ the latter term in clause (iii),\nand the slight inconsistency in nomenclature is insuffi\ncient reason to adopt DePierre\u2019s interpretation. Cf. Public\nLands Council v. Babbitt, 529 U. S. 728, 746\u2013747 (2000)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 At the time the ADAA was enacted, the definition of \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d\n\nin the same subchapter of the United States Code included, as relevant,\nthe following:\n\u201c(C) Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from\nwhich cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine or their salts have\nbeen removed.\n\u201c(D) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of\nisomers.\n\u201c(E) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers.\n\u201c(F) Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quan\ntity of any of the substances referred to in [the preceding] subpara\ngraphs . . . . \u201d 21 U.

As is evident from the pre\nceding discussion, this position is not supported by the\nstatutory text. To be sure, the records of the contempora\nneous congressional hearings suggest that Congress was\nmost concerned with the particular dangers posed by the\nadvent of crack cocaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing\n1 (statement of Chairman Roth) (\u201c[We] mee[t] today to\nexamine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the\ndrug abuse problem\u2014the growing availability and use of a\ncheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known\non the streets as \u2018crack\u2019 \u201d); see generally Commission Re\nport 116\u2013118; Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 95\u201396.\n  It does not necessarily follow, however, that in passing\nthe ADAA Congress meant for clause (iii)\u2019s lower quantity\nthresholds to apply exclusively to crack cocaine offenses.\nNumerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the\nprimary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was\nbecause\u2014contrary to powder cocaine\u2014cocaine in its base\nform is smoked, which was understood to produce a faster,\nmore intense, and more addictive high than powder co\ncaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 20 (statement of\nDr. Robert Byck, Yale University School of Medicine)\n14              DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(stating that the ability to inhale vapor \u201cis the reason why\ncrack, or cocaine free-base, is so dangerous\u201d). This is not,\nhowever, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase\nand coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous,\nsmokeable forms of cocaine. See, e.g., id., at 70 (prepared\nstatement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from\nsnorting powder cocaine to \u201cnewer more dangerous routes\nof administration, such as freebase smoking\u201d); id., at 19\u2013\n20 (statement of Dr. Byck) (describing the damaging ef\nfects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru).\n   Moreover, the testimony of witnesses before Congress\ndid not clearly distinguish between these base forms of\ncocaine; witnesses repeatedly used terms like \u201ccocaine\nbase,\u201d \u201cfreebase,\u201d or \u201ccocaine freebase\u201d in a manner that\ngrouped crack cocaine with other substances containing\nchemically basic forms of cocaine. See, e.g., Trafficking\nand Abuse of \u201cCrack\u201d in New York City, House Select\nCommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong.,\n2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M.

Accordingly, Con\ngress chose statutory language broad enough to meet\nthat threat. As we have noted, \u201cstatutory prohibitions\noften go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably\ncomparable evils.\u201d Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser\nvices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). In the absence of any\nindication in the statutory text that Congress intended\nonly to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal\nties, we cannot adopt DePierre\u2019s narrow construction. See\nLewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9)\n(\u201cIt is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that it covers only\nwhat we think is necessary to achieve what we think\nCongress really intended\u201d).\n                               B\n   DePierre also argues that we should read the term \u201cco\ncaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d rather than chemi\ncally basic cocaine, because the latter definition leads to\nan absurd result. Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Prod\nucts Co., 486 U. S. 107, 120 (1988) (plurality opinion). He\ncontends that, because coca leaves themselves contain\ncocaine, under the Government\u2019s approach an offense\ninvolving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the 5\nyear minimum sentence in \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though\nthose leaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable\ncocaine. See Brief for Petitioner 41\u201342. While we agree that\nit would be questionable to treat 5 grams of coca leaves as\nequivalent to 500 grams of powder cocaine for minimum\nsentence purposes, we are not persuaded that such a\nresult would actually obtain in light of our decision today.\n   To begin with, it is a matter of dispute between the\n16                 DEPIERRE v.

Even assuming that DePierre is correct as a\nmatter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its\nbase form,12 see Physicians Brief 2, 11, the Government\nhas averred that it \u201cwould not be able to make that show\ning in court,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and that \u201ccoca leaves\nshould not be treated as containing \u2018cocaine base\u2019 for\npurposes of Clause (iii),\u201d Brief for United States 45.\n   It is unsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its\nbrief disclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which\nit had sought, or the defendant had received, a statutory\nminimum sentence enhanced under clause (iii) for an of\nfense involving coca leaves. Id., at 44. And although\nthis question is not before us today, we note that Congress\u2019\ndeliberate choice to enumerate \u201ccoca leaves\u201d in clause (ii)\nstrongly indicates its intent that offenses involving such\nleaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds of that\nclause. Accordingly, there is little danger that the statute\nwill be read in the \u201cabsurd\u201d manner DePierre fears.\n                            C\n  In addition, DePierre suggests that because the Sen\ntencing Commission has, since 1993, defined \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d to mean \u201ccrack\u201d for the purposes of the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with re\nspect to \u00a7841(b)(1). We do not agree. We have never held\nthat, when interpreting a term in a criminal statute,\ndeference is warranted to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s\ndefinition of the same term in the Guidelines. Cf. Neal v.\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 284, 290\u2013296 (1996). And we\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 It appears that Congress itself is of the view that coca leaves con\ntain \u201ccocaine,\u201d as subclause (I) exempts offenses involving \u201ccoca leaves\nfrom which cocaine . . . ha[s] been removed.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I),\n(B)(ii)(I).\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nneed not decide now whether such deference would be\nappropriate, because the Guidelines do not purport to\ninterpret \u00a7841(b)(1). See USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D) (\u201c \u2018Co\ncaine base,\u2019 for the purposes of this guideline, means\n\u2018crack\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)).13\n   We recognize that, because the definition of \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d in clause (iii) differs from the Guidelines definition,\ncertain sentencing anomalies may result. For example, an\noffense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine and one involv\ning 5 grams of coca paste both trigger a minimum 5\nyear sentence under \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii). But defendants\nconvicted of offenses involving only 4 grams of each sub\nstance\u2014which do not trigger the statutory minimums\u2014\nwould likely receive different sentences, because of the\nGuidelines\u2019 differential treatment of those substances with\nrespect to offense level.14 Compare USSG \u00a72D1.1(c)(9)\n(providing an offense level of 22 for at least 4 grams of\n\u201ccocaine base,\u201d i.e., \u201ccrack\u201d) with \u00a72D1.1(c)(14) (providing\nan offense level of 12 for less than 25 grams of \u201ccocaine,\u201d\nwhich, under the Guidelines, includes coca paste). As we\nhave noted in previous opinions, however, such disparities\nare the inevitable result of the dissimilar operation of the\nfixed minimum sentences Congress has provided by stat-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 We   also disagree with DePierre\u2019s contention that Congress\u2019 failure\nto reject the Guidelines definition of \u201ccocaine base\u201d means that it has\neffectively adopted that interpretation with respect to the statute. See\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 106 (2007) (\u201cOrdinarily, we\nresist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction\u201d).\n   14 In defining \u201ccocaine base\u201d as \u201ccrack,\u201d the Commission explained\n\nthat \u201cforms of cocaine base other than crack\u201d are treated as \u201ccocaine\u201d\nfor purposes of the Guidelines. USSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov.\n1, 1993). This includes coca paste, which the Commission described as\n\u201can intermediate step in the processing of coca leaves into cocaine\nhydrochloride.\u201d Ibid. As we have explained, however, coca paste is a\nsmokeable form of cocaine in its own right, and we see no reason why,\nas a statutory matter, it should be subject to lesser penalties than crack\nor freebase.\n18              DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nute and the graduated sentencing scheme established\nby the Guidelines. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107\u2013108;\nNeal, 516 U. S., at 291\u2013292. Accordingly, we reject De-\nPierre\u2019s suggestion that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in\nclause (iii) must be given the same definition as it has\nunder the Guidelines.\n                             D\n   Finally, DePierre argues that, because \u00a7841(b)(1) is at\nthe very least ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to\ninterpret the statute in his favor. See United States v.\nSantos, 553 U. S. 507, 514 (2008) (\u201cThe rule of lenity\nrequires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in\nfavor of the defendants subjected to them\u201d). As evinced by\nthe preceding discussion, we cannot say that the statute is\ncrystalline. The rule, however, is reserved for cases\nwhere, \u201cafter seizing everything from which aid can be\nderived, the Court is left with an ambiguous statute.\u201d\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Applying the\nnormal rules of statutory construction in this case, it is\nclear that Congress used the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause\n(iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses involving\n\u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but those involving substances containing\nchemically basic cocaine more generally. There is no per\nsuasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.\nBecause the statutory text allows us to make far more\nthan \u201ca guess as to what Congress intended,\u201d Reno v.\nKoray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre\u2019s\nfavor.\n                        *   *    *\n   We hold that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in\n\u00a7841(b)(1) means not just \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but cocaine in\nits chemically basic form. We therefore affirm the judg\nment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Our holding today\nis that the statutory term \u201ccocaine base\u201d refers to cocaine\nbase, rather than, as DePierre contends, one particular\ntype of cocaine base. This holding is in my view obvious,\nand the Court does not disagree. It begins its discussion of\nthe legislative history by saying that DePierre\u2019s position\n\u201cis not supported by the statutory text,\u201d ante, at 13; and\nends the discussion by saying that \u201c[i]n the absence of any\nindication in the statutory text that Congress intended\nonly to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal\nties, we cannot adopt DePierre\u2019s narrow construction,\u201d\nante, at 15.\n   Everything in-between could and should have been\nomitted.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131533. Argued February 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 9, 2011\nIn 1986, increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugs\u2014in\n  particular, the new phenomenon of crack cocaine\u2014prompted Con\n  gress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving cocaine\n  related substances. Following several hearings, Congress enacted\n  the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA). The statute provides a\n  mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses in\n  volving \u201c(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing\n  a detectable amount of . . . (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric\n  isomers, and salts of isomers, [or] (iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture\n  or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d 21\n  U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A). The statute similarly provides a 5-year sen\n  tence for offenses involving 500 grams of a substance enumerated in\n  clause (ii) or 5 grams of one outlined in clause (iii). \u00a7841(b)(1)(B).\n     In 2005, petitioner DePierre was indicted for distribution of 50\n  grams or more of cocaine base under \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).\n  The District Court declined DePierre\u2019s request that the jury be in\n  structed that, in order to find DePierre guilty of distribution of \u201cco\n  caine base,\u201d it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.\n  DePierre was convicted, and the court sentenced him to the 120\n  months in prison mandated by the statute. The First Circuit af\n  firmed, rejecting DePierre\u2019s argument that \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) should\n  be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine. Instead, it\n  adhered to its precedent holding that \u201ccocaine base\u201d refers to all\n  forms of cocaine base.\nHeld: \u201c[C]ocaine base,\u201d as used in \u00a7841(b)(1), means not just \u201ccrack co\n caine,\u201d but cocaine in its chemically basic form. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) The most natural reading of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) is co\n caine in its chemically basic form\u2014i.e., the molecule found in crack\n2                     DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cocaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then, \u201ccocaine\n    base\u201d reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine. In arguing to the\n    contrary, DePierre urges the Court to stray far from the statute\u2019s\n    text, which nowhere contains the term \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d The Govern\n    ment\u2019s reading, on the other hand, follows the words Congress chose\n    to use. DePierre is correct that \u201ccocaine base\u201d is technically redun\n    dant\u2014chemically speaking, cocaine is a base. But Congress had good\n    reason to use \u201ccocaine base\u201d\u2014to make clear that clause (iii) does not\n    apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride (i.e., powder co\n    caine) or other nonbasic cocaine-related substances. At the time the\n    statute was enacted, \u201ccocaine\u201d was commonly used to refer to powder\n    cocaine, and the scientific and medical literature often uses \u201ccocaine\u201d\n    to refer to all cocaine-related substances, including ones that are not\n    chemically basic. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) This reading of \u201ccocaine base\u201d is also consistent with\n    \u00a7841(b)(1)\u2019s somewhat confusing structure. Subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii)(II)\n    lists \u201ccocaine,\u201d along with \u201cits salts, optical and geometric isomers,\n    and salts of isomers,\u201d as elements subject to clause (ii)\u2019s higher quan\n    tity threshold. DePierre is correct that, because \u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201cco\n    caine base\u201d both refer to chemically basic cocaine, offenses involving\n    a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized accord\n    ing to the lower quantity threshold of clause (iii), and never the\n    higher threshold clause (ii) establishes for mixtures and substances\n    containing \u201ccocaine.\u201d But the Court does not agree that the term \u201cco\n    caine\u201d in clause (ii) is therefore superfluous\u2014in light of the structure\n    of subclause (II), \u201ccocaine\u201d is needed as the reference point for \u201csalts\u201d\n    and \u201cisomers,\u201d which would otherwise be meaningless.\n       The term \u201ccocaine\u201d in clause (ii) also performs another critical func\n    tion. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance\n    \u201cdescribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d Thus, clause\n    (ii) imposes a penalty for offenses involving cocaine-related sub\n    stances generally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for a sub\n    set of those substances\u2014the ones that \u201ccontai[n] cocaine base.\u201d For\n    this structure to work, however, \u00a7841(b)(1) must \u201cdescrib[e] in clause\n    (ii)\u201d substances containing chemically basic cocaine, which then com\n    prise the subset described in clause (iii). Congress thus had good\n    reason to include the term \u201ccocaine\u201d in clause (ii), and the slight in\n    consistency created by its use of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) is insuf\n    ficient reason to adopt DePierre\u2019s interpretation. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) DePierre\u2019s additional arguments are unpersuasive. First, the\n    records of the 1986 congressional hearings do not support his conten\n    tion that Congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving\n    crack cocaine. Second, reading \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean chemically ba\n    sic cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, does not lead to an absurd re\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Third, the fact that \u201ccocaine base\u201d in the Federal Sentencing\n  Guidelines is defined as \u201ccrack\u201d does not require that the statutory\n  term be interpreted the same way.

This case requires us to decide whether\nthe term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in this statute refers\ngenerally to cocaine in its chemically basic form or exclu\nsively to what is colloquially known as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d We\nconclude that \u201ccocaine base\u201d means the former.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  As a matter of chemistry, cocaine is an alkaloid with the\nmolecular formula C17H21NO4. Webster\u2019s Third New In\nternational Dictionary 434 (2002). An alkaloid is a base\u2014\nthat is, a compound capable of reacting with an acid to\nform a salt.1 Id., at 54, 180; see also Brief for Individual\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 There   are more detailed theories of how acids and bases interact.\n2                  DEPIERRE v.

Cocaine is derived from the coca\nplant native to South America. The leaves of the coca\nplant can be processed with water, kerosene, sodium car\nbonate, and sulphuric acid to produce a paste-like sub\nstance. R. Weiss, S. Mirin, & R. Bartel, Cocaine 10 (2d\ned. 1994). When dried, the resulting \u201ccoca paste\u201d can be\nvaporized (through the application of heat) and inhaled,\ni.e., \u201csmoked.\u201d See United States Sentencing Commission,\nSpecial Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal\nSentencing Policy 11\u201312 (1995) (hereinafter Commission\nReport). Coca paste contains C17H21NO4\u2014that is, cocaine\nin its base form.\n   Dissolving coca paste in water and hydrochloric acid\nproduces (after several intermediate steps) cocaine hydro\nchloride, which is a salt with the molecular formula\nC17H22NO4+Cl-. Id., at 12; Physicians Brief 3. Cocaine\nhydrochloride, therefore, is not a base. It generally comes\nin powder form, which we will refer to as \u201cpowder cocaine.\u201d\nIt is usually insufflated (breathed in through the nose),\nthough it can also be ingested or diluted in water and\ninjected. Because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a\nmuch higher temperature than chemically basic cocaine\n(at which point the cocaine molecule tends to decompose),\nit is generally not smoked. See Commission Report 11,\nn. 15, 12\u201313.\n   Cocaine hydrochloride can be converted into cocaine in\nits base form by combining powder cocaine with water and\na base, like sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking\nsoda). Id., at 14. The chemical reaction changes the\ncocaine hydrochloride molecule into a chemically basic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFor our purposes, it is sufficient to note the fundamental proposition\nthat a base and an acid can combine to form a salt, and all three are\ndifferent types of compounds.

As with crack cocaine,\nfreebase contains cocaine in its chemically basic form.\nIbid.\n   Chemically, therefore, there is no difference between the\ncocaine in coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase\u2014all are\ncocaine in its base form. On the other hand, cocaine in its\nbase form and in its salt form (i.e., cocaine hydrochloride)\nare chemically different, though they have the same active\ningredient and produce the same physiological and psy\nchotropic effects. See id., at 14\u201322. The key difference\nbetween them is the method by which they generally enter\nthe body; smoking cocaine in its base form\u2014whether as\ncoca paste, freebase, or crack cocaine\u2014allows the body to\nabsorb the active ingredient quickly, thereby producing a\nshorter, more intense high than obtained from insufflating\ncocaine hydrochloride.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nvision for mandatory minimum sentences. See, e.g.,\n\u00a7841(b)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III). After holding several\nhearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack\ncocaine, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of\n1986 (ADAA), 100 Stat. 3207, which provided mandatory\nminimum sentences for controlled-substance offenses in\nvolving specific quantities of drugs.\n   As relevant here, the ADAA provided a mandatory 10\nyear sentence for certain drug offenses involving 5 kilo\ngrams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance containing a\ndetectable amount of \u201d various cocaine-related elements,\nincluding coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts; it also\ncalled for the same sentence for offenses involving only\n50 grams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance . . . which\ncontains cocaine base.\u201d ADAA, \u00a71002, 100 Stat. 3207\u20132\n(amending \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2013(iii)) (emphasis added). The\nADAA also stipulated a mandatory 5-year sentence for\noffenses involving 500 grams of a mixture or substance\ncontaining coca leaves, cocaine, and cocaine salts, or 5\ngrams of a mixture or substance containing \u201ccocaine base.\u201d\nId., at 3207\u20133 (amending \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(ii)\u2013(iii)).\n   Thus, the ADAA established a 100-to-1 ratio for the\nthreshold quantities of cocaine-related substances that\ntriggered the statute\u2019s mandatory minimum penalties.\nThat is, 5 grams or more of \u201ca mixture or substance . . .\nwhich contains cocaine base\u201d was penalized as severely as\n100 times that amount of the other cocaine-related ele\nments enumerated in the statute.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof drugs to a Government informant. DePierre was subse\nquently indicted on a charge of distributing 50 grams or\nmore of cocaine base under \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii).6\nAt trial, a Government chemist testified that the sub\nstance in the bags, which weighed 55.1 grams, was \u201cco\ncaine base.\u201d Tr. 488, 490. She was not able to identify any\nsodium bicarbonate. Id., at 499. A police officer testified\nthat the substance in question was \u201coff-white [and]\nchunky.\u201d Id., at 455.\n   DePierre asked the District Court to instruct the jury\nthat, in order to find him guilty of distribution of cocaine\nbase, it must find that his offense involved \u201cthe form\nof cocaine base known as crack cocaine.\u201d App. in No. 08\u2013\n2101 (CA1), p. 43. His proposed jury instruction defined\n\u201ccrack\u201d identically to the Guidelines definition. See id., at\n43\u201344; see also USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D). In addition, De-\nPierre asked the court to instruct the jury that \u201c[c]hemi\ncal analysis cannot establish a substance as crack because\ncrack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base,\nalthough it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,\nwhich is usually used in the processing of crack.\u201d App. in\nNo. 08\u20132101, at 44.\n   The court, however, instructed the jury that \u201cthe statute\nthat\u2019s relevant asks about cocaine base. Crack cocaine is a\nform of cocaine base, so you\u2019ll tell us whether or not what\nwas involved is cocaine base . . . .\u201d Tr. 585 (paragraph\nbreak omitted). The jury form asked whether the offense\ninvolved \u201cover 50 grams of cocaine base.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 17a.

S. 235, 241 (1989).\nSection 841(b)(1)(A) provides a mandatory 10-year mini\nmum sentence for certain drug offenses involving\n    \u201c(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance\n    containing a detectable amount of\u2014\n        \u201c(I) coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of\n        coca leaves from which cocaine, ecgonine, and de\n        rivatives of ecgonine or their salts have been\n        removed;\n        \u201c(II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric iso\n        mers, and salts of isomers;\n        \u201c(III) ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers,\n        and salts of isomers; or\n        \u201c(IV) any compound, mixture, or preparation which\n        contains any quantity of any of the substances re\n        ferred to in subclauses (I) through (III); [or]\n    \u201c(iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance de\n8                   DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     scribed in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base.\u201d7\n  We agree with the Government that the most natural\nreading of the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d is \u201ccocaine in its base\nform\u201d\u2014i.e., C17H21NO4, the molecule found in crack co\ncaine, freebase, and coca paste. On its plain terms, then,\n\u201ccocaine base\u201d reaches more broadly than just crack co\ncaine. In arguing to the contrary, DePierre asks us to\nstray far from the statute\u2019s text, as the term \u201ccrack co\ncaine\u201d appears nowhere in the ADAA (or the United States\nCode, for that matter). While the Government\u2019s reading is\nnot without its problems,8 that reading follows from the\nwords Congress chose to include in the text. See United\nStates v. Rodriquez, 553 U. S. 377, 384 (2008) (eschewing\nan interpretation that was \u201cnot faithful to the statutory\ntext\u201d). In short, the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d is more plausibly\nread to mean the \u201cchemically basic form of cocaine,\u201d Brief\nfor United States 15, than it is \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d Brief for\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 As noted earlier, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B) calls for a mandatory minimum 5\n\nyear sentence for offenses involving exactly the same substances; the\nonly difference in subparagraph (B) is that the threshold quantity in\nclause (ii) is 500 grams, and in clause (iii) it is 5 grams. Because the\n100-to-1 ratio is a feature of both \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A) and (B), and those\nsubparagraphs are identical in all other respects, throughout this\nopinion we use the terms \u201cclause (ii)\u201d and \u201cclause (iii)\u201d to refer to those\nclauses as present in either subparagraph.\n   8 The Government urges us to give \u201ccocaine base\u201d its \u201csettled, unam\n\nbiguous scientific meaning,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe form of cocaine classified chemi\ncally as a base, with the chemical formula C17H21NO4 and a particular\nmolecular structure.\u201d Brief for United States 20; cf. McDermott Int\u2019l,\nInc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 342 (1991) (\u201cIn the absence of contrary\nindication, we assume that when a statute uses . . . a term [of art],\nCongress intended it to have its established meaning\u201d). But the scien\ntifically proper appellation for C17H21NO4 is \u201ccocaine\u201d tout court, and\nthe Government cites no source that uses \u201ccocaine base\u201d to refer to\nC17H21NO4 (save lower-court opinions construing the statute at issue\nin this case). Therefore, there is no \u201csettled meaning\u201d\u2014scientific or\notherwise\u2014of \u201ccocaine base\u201d for us to apply to \u00a7841(b)(1).\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 24, 28.9\n   We agree with DePierre that using the term \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d to refer to C17H21NO4 is technically redundant; as\nnoted earlier, chemically speaking cocaine is a base. If\nCongress meant in clause (iii) to penalize more severely\noffenses involving \u201ca mixture or substance . . . which\ncontains\u201d cocaine in its base form it could have simply\n(and more correctly) used the word \u201ccocaine\u201d instead. But\nCongress had good reason to use \u201ccocaine base\u201d in the\nADAA\u2014to distinguish the substances covered by clause\n(iii) from other cocaine-related substances. For example,\nat the time Congress enacted the statute, the word \u201cco\ncaine\u201d was commonly used to refer to cocaine hydrochlo\nride, i.e., powder cocaine. See, e.g., United States v. Mon\ntoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 536, 544 (1985)\n(repeatedly referring to cocaine hydrochloride as \u201cco\ncaine\u201d); \u201cCrack\u201d Cocaine, Hearing before the Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee\non Governmental Affairs, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 94 (1986)\n(hereinafter Crack Cocaine Hearing) (prepared statement\nof David L. Westrate, Assistant Administrator, Drug\nEnforcement Admin., Dept. of Justice) (discussing produc\ntion of \u201ca white, crystalline powder, cocaine hydrochloride,\notherwise known simply as cocaine\u201d).\n   To make things more confusing, in the scientific and\nmedical literature the word \u201ccocaine\u201d is often used to refer\nto all cocaine-related substances, including powder co\ncaine. See, e.g., J. Fay, The Alcohol/Drug Abuse Diction\nary and Encyclopedia 26\u201327 (1988); Weiss et al., Cocaine,\nat 15\u201325; R. Lewis, Hawley\u2019s Condensed Chemical Dic\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The statute itself gives us good reason to reject DePierre\u2019s reading.\n\nSubstituting \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d for \u201ccocaine base\u201d would mean that clause\n(iii) only applies to a \u201cmixture or substance . . . which contains [crack\ncocaine].\u201d But crack cocaine is itself a \u201csubstance\u201d involved in drug\noffenses; it is the end product that is bought, sold, and consumed. We\nare aware of no substance that \u201ccontains\u201d crack cocaine.\n10                 DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntionary 317 (15th ed. 2007). Accordingly, Congress\u2019 choice\nto use the admittedly redundant term \u201ccocaine base\u201d to\nrefer to chemically basic cocaine is best understood as an\neffort to make clear that clause (iii) does not apply to\noffenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic\ncocaine-related substances.\n                              B\n   Notwithstanding DePierre\u2019s arguments to the contrary,\nreading \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean chemically basic cocaine is\nalso consistent with \u00a7841(b)(1)\u2019s somewhat confounding\nstructure. DePierre is correct that the interpretation we\nadopt today raises the question why Congress included the\nword \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) of clause (ii). That sub\nclause lists \u201ccocaine, its salts, optical and geometric iso\nmers, and salts of isomers\u201d as elements subject to clause\n(ii)\u2019s higher quantity threshold.       \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II),\n(B)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). If, as we conclude, the terms\n\u201ccocaine\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d both mean chemically basic\ncocaine, offenses involving a mixture or substance which\ncontains such cocaine will always be penalized according\nto the lower quantity thresholds of clause (iii), and never\nthe higher quantity thresholds clause (ii) establishes for\nmixtures and substances containing \u201ccocaine.\u201d10\n   While this much is true, we do not agree with DePierre\nthat the word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) is therefore su\nperfluous. For without the word \u201ccocaine\u201d subclause (II)\nmakes no sense: It would provide a minimum sentence for\noffenses involving a specified quantity of simply \u201cits salts,\noptical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers.\u201d In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 DePierre makes a similar argument with respect to coca leaves:\n\nBecause they contain chemically basic cocaine, he contends, under the\nGovernment\u2019s interpretation offenses involving coca leaves will never\nbe subject to the lower quantity threshold associated with subclause (I),\nrendering that provision superfluous. For reasons discussed later, see\ninfra, at 15\u201316, we are not convinced.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of the structure of the subclause, the word \u201ccocaine\u201d\nis needed as the reference point for \u201csalts\u201d and \u201cisomers.\u201d\n   The word \u201ccocaine\u201d in subclause (II) also performs an\nother critical function. Clause (iii) penalizes offenses\ninvolving \u201ca mixture or substance described in clause (ii)\nwhich contains cocaine base.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii)\n(emphasis added). In other words, clause (ii) imposes a\npenalty for offenses involving cocaine-related substances\ngenerally, and clause (iii) imposes a higher penalty for\na subset of those substances\u2014the ones that \u201ccontai[n]\ncocaine base.\u201d For this structure to work, however,\n\u00a7841(b)(1) must \u201cdescrib[e] in clause (ii)\u201d substances con\ntaining chemically basic cocaine, which then comprise the\nsubset described in clause (iii). If such substances were\nnot present in clause (ii), clause (iii) would only apply to\nsubstances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and\none of the other elements enumerated in clause (ii). Pre\nsumably, the result would be that clause (iii) would not\napply to crack cocaine, freebase, or coca paste offenses, as\nthere is no indication that, in addition to \u201ccocaine base\u201d\n(i.e., C17H21NO4), those substances contain cocaine \u201csalts\u201d\n(e.g., cocaine hydrochloride), ecgonine, or any of the other\nelements enumerated in clause (ii). In short, the exclusion\nof \u201ccocaine\u201d from clause (ii) would result in clause (iii)\neffectively describing a null set, which obviously was not\nCongress\u2019 intent.\n   Of course, this redundancy could have been avoided by\nsimply drafting clause (iii) to penalize offenses involving\n\u201ca mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,\u201d\nwithout reference to clause (ii)\u2014that is, Congress could\nhave drafted clause (iii) to specify a separate set of cocaine\nrelated substances, not a subset of those in clause (ii).\nThat we may rue inartful legislative drafting, however,\ndoes not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a\n12                  DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute as faithfully as possible to its actual text.11 And as\nnoted earlier, there is no textual support for DePierre\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u201ccocaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d\n  We also recognize that our reading of \u201ccocaine\u201d in sub\nclause (II) and \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) to both refer to\nchemically basic cocaine is in tension with the usual rule\nthat \u201cwhen the legislature uses certain language in one\npart of the statute and different language in another, the\ncourt assumes different meanings were intended.\u201d Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, because \u201cCongress\nsometimes uses slightly different language to convey the\nsame message,\u201d Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 134\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), we must be\ncareful not to place too much emphasis on the marginal\nsemantic divergence between the terms \u201ccocaine\u201d and\n\u201ccocaine base.\u201d As we have already explained, Congress\nhad good reason to employ the latter term in clause (iii),\nand the slight inconsistency in nomenclature is insuffi\ncient reason to adopt DePierre\u2019s interpretation.

S. 728, 746\u2013747 (2000)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 At the time the ADAA was enacted, the definition of \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d\n\nin the same subchapter of the United States Code included, as relevant,\nthe following:\n\u201c(C) Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from\nwhich cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine or their salts have\nbeen removed.\n\u201c(D) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of\nisomers.\n\u201c(E) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers.\n\u201c(F) Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quan\ntity of any of the substances referred to in [the preceding] subpara\ngraphs . . . . \u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7802(17) (1982 ed., Supp. III).\nAccordingly, the likely explanation for the ADAA\u2019s curious structure is\nthat Congress simply adopted this preexisting enumeration of cocaine\nrelated controlled substances, and then engrafted clause (iii) to provide\nenhanced penalties for the subset of offenses involving chemically basic\ncocaine.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(suggesting that a \u201cstatute\u2019s basic purpose\u201d might support\nthe conclusion that \u201ctwo sets of different words mean the\nsame thing\u201d).\n                               III\n   DePierre offers four additional arguments in support of his\nview that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause (iii) is best read\nto mean \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d We do not find them convincing.\n                               A\n  DePierre first argues that we should read \u201ccocaine base\u201d\nto mean \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d because, in passing the ADAA,\nCongress in 1986 intended to penalize crack cocaine\noffenses more severely than those involving other sub\nstances containing C17H21NO4. As is evident from the pre\nceding discussion, this position is not supported by the\nstatutory text. To be sure, the records of the contempora\nneous congressional hearings suggest that Congress was\nmost concerned with the particular dangers posed by the\nadvent of crack cocaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing\n1 (statement of Chairman Roth) (\u201c[We] mee[t] today to\nexamine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the\ndrug abuse problem\u2014the growing availability and use of a\ncheap, highly addictive, and deadly form of cocaine known\non the streets as \u2018crack\u2019 \u201d); see generally Commission Re\nport 116\u2013118; Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 95\u201396.\n  It does not necessarily follow, however, that in passing\nthe ADAA Congress meant for clause (iii)\u2019s lower quantity\nthresholds to apply exclusively to crack cocaine offenses.\nNumerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the\nprimary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was\nbecause\u2014contrary to powder cocaine\u2014cocaine in its base\nform is smoked, which was understood to produce a faster,\nmore intense, and more addictive high than powder co\ncaine. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 20 (statement of\nDr. Robert Byck, Yale University School of Medicine)\n14              DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(stating that the ability to inhale vapor \u201cis the reason why\ncrack, or cocaine free-base, is so dangerous\u201d). This is not,\nhowever, a feature unique to crack cocaine, and freebase\nand coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous,\nsmokeable forms of cocaine. See, e.g., id., at 70 (prepared\nstatement of Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Director, National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse) (reporting on the shift from\nsnorting powder cocaine to \u201cnewer more dangerous routes\nof administration, such as freebase smoking\u201d); id., at 19\u2013\n20 (statement of Dr. Byck) (describing the damaging ef\nfects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru).\n   Moreover, the testimony of witnesses before Congress\ndid not clearly distinguish between these base forms of\ncocaine; witnesses repeatedly used terms like \u201ccocaine\nbase,\u201d \u201cfreebase,\u201d or \u201ccocaine freebase\u201d in a manner that\ngrouped crack cocaine with other substances containing\nchemically basic forms of cocaine. See, e.g., Trafficking\nand Abuse of \u201cCrack\u201d in New York City, House Select\nCommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, 99th Cong.,\n2d Sess., 258 (1986) (statement of Robert M. Stutman,\nSpecial Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Admin., Dept.\nof Justice) (\u201c[C]ocaine in its alkaloid form [is] commonly\nknown on the street as crack, rock, base, or freebase\u201d);\nCrack Cocaine Hearing 71 (statement of Dr. Schuster) (\u201cIn\nother words, \u2018crack\u2019 is a street name for cocaine freebase\u201d).\nIn fact, prior to passage of the ADAA, multiple bills were\nintroduced in Congress that imposed enhanced penalties\non those who trafficked in \u201ccocaine base,\u201d e.g., S. 2787,\n99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a71 (1986), as well as \u201ccocaine free\nbase,\u201d e.g., H. R. 5394, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7101 (1986);\nH. R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7608(a) (1986).\n   Given crack cocaine\u2019s sudden emergence and the simi\nlarities it shared with other forms of cocaine, this lack of\nclarity is understandable, as is Congress\u2019 desire to adopt a\nstatutory term that would encompass all forms. Congress\nfaced what it perceived to be a new threat of massive\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nscope. See, e.g., Crack Cocaine Hearing 4 (statement of\nSen. Nunn) (\u201c[C]ocaine use, particularly in the more pure\nform known as crack, is at near epidemic proportions\u201d);\nid., at 21 (statement of Dr. Byck) (\u201cWe are dealing with\na worse drug . . . than we have ever dealt with, or that\nanybody has ever dealt with in history\u201d). Accordingly, Con\ngress chose statutory language broad enough to meet\nthat threat. As we have noted, \u201cstatutory prohibitions\noften go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably\ncomparable evils.\u201d Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser\nvices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79 (1998). In the absence of any\nindication in the statutory text that Congress intended\nonly to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal\nties, we cannot adopt DePierre\u2019s narrow construction. See\nLewis v. Chicago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9)\n(\u201cIt is not for us to rewrite [a] statute so that it covers only\nwhat we think is necessary to achieve what we think\nCongress really intended\u201d).\n                               B\n   DePierre also argues that we should read the term \u201cco\ncaine base\u201d to mean \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d rather than chemi\ncally basic cocaine, because the latter definition leads to\nan absurd result. Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Prod\nucts Co., 486 U. S. 107, 120 (1988) (plurality opinion). He\ncontends that, because coca leaves themselves contain\ncocaine, under the Government\u2019s approach an offense\ninvolving 5 grams of coca leaves will be subject to the 5\nyear minimum sentence in \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii), even though\nthose leaves would produce only .05 grams of smokeable\ncocaine. See Brief for Petitioner 41\u201342. While we agree that\nit would be questionable to treat 5 grams of coca leaves as\nequivalent to 500 grams of powder cocaine for minimum\nsentence purposes, we are not persuaded that such a\nresult would actually obtain in light of our decision today.\n   To begin with, it is a matter of dispute between the\n16                 DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nparties whether coca leaves in their natural, unprocessed\nform actually contain chemically basic cocaine. Compare\nBrief for Petitioner 15, 17, n. 10, with Brief for United\nStates 43. Even assuming that DePierre is correct as a\nmatter of chemistry that coca leaves contain cocaine in its\nbase form,12 see Physicians Brief 2, 11, the Government\nhas averred that it \u201cwould not be able to make that show\ning in court,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and that \u201ccoca leaves\nshould not be treated as containing \u2018cocaine base\u2019 for\npurposes of Clause (iii),\u201d Brief for United States 45.\n   It is unsurprising, therefore, that the Government in its\nbrief disclaimed awareness of any prosecution in which\nit had sought, or the defendant had received, a statutory\nminimum sentence enhanced under clause (iii) for an of\nfense involving coca leaves. Id., at 44. And although\nthis question is not before us today, we note that Congress\u2019\ndeliberate choice to enumerate \u201ccoca leaves\u201d in clause (ii)\nstrongly indicates its intent that offenses involving such\nleaves be subject to the higher quantity thresholds of that\nclause. Accordingly, there is little danger that the statute\nwill be read in the \u201cabsurd\u201d manner DePierre fears.\n                            C\n  In addition, DePierre suggests that because the Sen\ntencing Commission has, since 1993, defined \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d to mean \u201ccrack\u201d for the purposes of the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines, we should do the same with re\nspect to \u00a7841(b)(1). We do not agree. We have never held\nthat, when interpreting a term in a criminal statute,\ndeference is warranted to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s\ndefinition of the same term in the Guidelines. Cf. Neal v.\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 284, 290\u2013296 (1996). And we\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 It appears that Congress itself is of the view that coca leaves con\ntain \u201ccocaine,\u201d as subclause (I) exempts offenses involving \u201ccoca leaves\nfrom which cocaine . . . ha[s] been removed.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(I),\n(B)(ii)(I).\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nneed not decide now whether such deference would be\nappropriate, because the Guidelines do not purport to\ninterpret \u00a7841(b)(1). See USSG \u00a72D1.1(c), n. (D) (\u201c \u2018Co\ncaine base,\u2019 for the purposes of this guideline, means\n\u2018crack\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)).13\n   We recognize that, because the definition of \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d in clause (iii) differs from the Guidelines definition,\ncertain sentencing anomalies may result. For example, an\noffense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine and one involv\ning 5 grams of coca paste both trigger a minimum 5\nyear sentence under \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii). But defendants\nconvicted of offenses involving only 4 grams of each sub\nstance\u2014which do not trigger the statutory minimums\u2014\nwould likely receive different sentences, because of the\nGuidelines\u2019 differential treatment of those substances with\nrespect to offense level.14 Compare USSG \u00a72D1.1(c)(9)\n(providing an offense level of 22 for at least 4 grams of\n\u201ccocaine base,\u201d i.e., \u201ccrack\u201d) with \u00a72D1.1(c)(14) (providing\nan offense level of 12 for less than 25 grams of \u201ccocaine,\u201d\nwhich, under the Guidelines, includes coca paste). As we\nhave noted in previous opinions, however, such disparities\nare the inevitable result of the dissimilar operation of the\nfixed minimum sentences Congress has provided by stat-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 We   also disagree with DePierre\u2019s contention that Congress\u2019 failure\nto reject the Guidelines definition of \u201ccocaine base\u201d means that it has\neffectively adopted that interpretation with respect to the statute. See\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 106 (2007) (\u201cOrdinarily, we\nresist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction\u201d).\n   14 In defining \u201ccocaine base\u201d as \u201ccrack,\u201d the Commission explained\n\nthat \u201cforms of cocaine base other than crack\u201d are treated as \u201ccocaine\u201d\nfor purposes of the Guidelines. USSG App. C, Amdt. 487 (effective Nov.\n1, 1993). This includes coca paste, which the Commission described as\n\u201can intermediate step in the processing of coca leaves into cocaine\nhydrochloride.\u201d Ibid. As we have explained, however, coca paste is a\nsmokeable form of cocaine in its own right, and we see no reason why,\nas a statutory matter, it should be subject to lesser penalties than crack\nor freebase.\n18              DEPIERRE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nute and the graduated sentencing scheme established\nby the Guidelines. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107\u2013108;\nNeal, 516 U. S., at 291\u2013292. Accordingly, we reject De-\nPierre\u2019s suggestion that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in\nclause (iii) must be given the same definition as it has\nunder the Guidelines.\n                             D\n   Finally, DePierre argues that, because \u00a7841(b)(1) is at\nthe very least ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to\ninterpret the statute in his favor. See United States v.\nSantos, 553 U. S. 507, 514 (2008) (\u201cThe rule of lenity\nrequires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in\nfavor of the defendants subjected to them\u201d). As evinced by\nthe preceding discussion, we cannot say that the statute is\ncrystalline. The rule, however, is reserved for cases\nwhere, \u201cafter seizing everything from which aid can be\nderived, the Court is left with an ambiguous statute.\u201d\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted). Applying the\nnormal rules of statutory construction in this case, it is\nclear that Congress used the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in clause\n(iii) to penalize more severely not only offenses involving\n\u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but those involving substances containing\nchemically basic cocaine more generally. There is no per\nsuasive justification for reading the statute otherwise.\nBecause the statutory text allows us to make far more\nthan \u201ca guess as to what Congress intended,\u201d Reno v.\nKoray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), the rule of lenity does not apply in DePierre\u2019s\nfavor.\n                        *   *    *\n   We hold that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d as used in\n\u00a7841(b)(1) means not just \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but cocaine in\nits chemically basic form. We therefore affirm the judg\nment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Our holding today\nis that the statutory term \u201ccocaine base\u201d refers to cocaine\nbase, rather than, as DePierre contends, one particular\ntype of cocaine base. This holding is in my view obvious,\nand the Court does not disagree. It begins its discussion of\nthe legislative history by saying that DePierre\u2019s position\n\u201cis not supported by the statutory text,\u201d ante, at 13; and\nends the discussion by saying that \u201c[i]n the absence of any\nindication in the statutory text that Congress intended\nonly to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penal\nties, we cannot adopt DePierre\u2019s narrow construction,\u201d\nante, at 15.\n   Everything in-between could and should have been\nomitted. Even if Dr. Byck had not lectured an unde-\ntermined number of likely somnolent Congressmen on \u201cthe\ndamaging effects of cocaine smoking on people in Peru,\u201d\nante, at 14, we would still hold that the words \u201ccocaine\nbase\u201d mean cocaine base. And here, as always, the need\nless detour into legislative history is not harmless. It con\nveys the mistaken impression that legislative history\ncould modify the text of a criminal statute as clear as this.\n2              DEPIERRE v.
