I4I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP \n\n                      ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013290.      Argued April 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 9, 2011\nIn asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an\n  alleged infringer must contend with \u00a7282 of the Patent Act of 1952\n  (Act), under which \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c[t]he\n  burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the party asserting\u201d\n  it. Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read \u00a7282 to require a defen\n  dant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder\n  of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n     Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which\n  claims an improved method for editing computer documents. After\n  i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that\n  patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the\n  patent was invalid under \u00a7102(b)\u2019s on-sale bar, which precludes pat\n  ent protection for any \u201cinvention\u201d that was \u201con sale in this country\u201d\n  more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. The\n  parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent applica\n  tion, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United\n  States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the\n  invention claimed in i4i\u2019s patent. Relying on the undisputed fact that\n  the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark\n  Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Micro\n  soft objected to i4i\u2019s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity de\n  fense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The District\n  Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft\u2019s alter\n  native instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence stan\n  dard. The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent\n  and had failed to prove the patent\u2019s invalidity. The Federal Circuit\n  affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of \u00a7282.\n2          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear\n and convincing evidence. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) The Court rejects Microsoft\u2019s contention that a defendant need\n only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponder\n ance of the evidence. Where Congress has prescribed the governing\n standard of proof, its choice generally controls. Steadman v. SEC,\n 450 U. S. 91, 95. Congress has made such a choice here. While \u00a7282\n includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Con\n gress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the\n \u201cterm . . . comes with a common law meaning.\u201d Safeco Ins. Co. of\n America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58. Here, by stating that a patent is\n \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d \u00a7282, Congress used a term with a settled common\n law meaning. Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Labora\n tories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative. There, tracing nearly\n a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that \u201cthere is a\n presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except\n by clear and cogent evidence,\u201d id., at 2. Microsoft\u2019s contention that\n the Court\u2019s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing stan\n dard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the ab\n sence of those qualifications from the Court\u2019s cases. Also unpersua\n sive is Microsoft\u2019s argument that the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation\n must fail because it renders superfluous \u00a7282\u2019s additional statement\n that \u201c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the\n party asserting\u201d it. The canon against superfluity assists only where\n a competing interpretation gives effect \u201c \u2018to every clause and word of\n a statute.\u2019 \u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174. Here, no inter\n pretation of \u00a7282 avoids excess language because, under either of Mi\n crosoft\u2019s alternative theories\u2014that the presumption only allocates\n the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of produc\n tion and persuasion\u2014the presumption itself would be unnecessary in\n light of \u00a7282\u2019s additional statement as to the challenger\u2019s burden.\n Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (b) Also rejected is Microsoft\u2019s argument that a preponderance\n standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder\n was not before the PTO during the examination process. It is true\n enough that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe rationale underlying the\n presumption\u2014that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the\n claim\u2014seems much diminished,\u201d KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550\n U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the pre\n sumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified\n the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress\n did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent va\n lidity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.\n The Court\u2019s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft\u2019s fluc\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tuating standard of proof. And they do not indicate, even in dicta,\n  that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever\n  apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the con\n  trary. See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8. Finally, the Court often applied the\n  heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the rele\n  vant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in cir\n  cumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g., Smith v. Hall,\n  301 U. S. 216, 227, 233. Nothing in \u00a7282\u2019s text suggests that Con\n  gress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of\n  proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had\n  Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where\n  the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it pre\n  sumably would have said so expressly. Those pre-Act cases where\n  various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weak\n  ened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the\n  PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the\n  PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment\n  may lose significant force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. Consistent\n  with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the\n  evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact\n  when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by\n  clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 14\u201318.\n     (c) This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the\n  parties\u2019 policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and\n  convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.            Congress\n  specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the\n  common-law presumption of patent validity. During the nearly 30\n  years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted \u00a7282 as the Court does\n  today, Congress has often amended \u00a7282 and other patent laws, but\n  apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard\n  of proof. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpreta\n  tion in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal\n  Government and without. Accordingly, any recalibration of the stan\n  dard of proof remains in Congress\u2019 hands.

S. C. \u00a7282. We\nconsider whether \u00a7282 requires an invalidity defense to be\nproved by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that it\ndoes.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task\nof examining patent applications, 35 U. S. C. \u00a72(a)(1), and\nissuing patents if \u201cit appears that the applicant is entitled\nto a patent under the law,\u201d \u00a7131. Congress has set forth\nthe prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO\nmust evaluate in the examination process. To receive\npatent protection a claimed invention must, among other\nthings, fall within one of the express categories of pat\nentable subject matter, \u00a7101, and be novel, \u00a7102, and\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonobvious, \u00a7103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of\n\u00a7102(b) precludes patent protection for any \u201cinvention\u201d\nthat was \u201con sale in this country\u201d more than one year prior\nto the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.\nWells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67\u201368 (1998). In\nevaluating whether these and other statutory conditions\nhave been met, PTO examiners must make various factual\ndeterminations\u2014for instance, the state of the prior art in\nthe field and the nature of the advancement embodied in\nthe invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153\n(1999).\n   Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to\nits holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven\ntion during the patent\u2019s duration. To enforce that right, a\npatentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an\nother person \u201cwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell,\nor sells any patented invention, within the United States.\u201d\n\u00a7271(a); see also \u00a7281.\n   Among other defenses under \u00a7282 of the Patent Act of\n1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva\nlidity of the patent\u2014that is, he may attempt to prove that\nthe patent never should have issued in the first place. See\n\u00a7\u00a7282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that\nthe claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus\nthat one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.\nSee \u00a7282(2); see also \u00a7103. \u201cWhile the ultimate question of\npatent validity is one of law,\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co.\nof Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic\n& Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340\nU. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,\nat 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions\nunderlying the PTO\u2019s original examination of a patent ap\nplication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in\nfringement action. See, e.g., 383 U. S., at 17 (describing\nthe \u201cbasic factual inquiries\u201d that form the \u201cbackground\u201d\nfor evaluating obviousness); Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 67\u201369\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(same, as to the on-sale bar).\n   In asserting an invalidity defense, an alleged infringer\nmust contend with the first paragraph of \u00a7282, which\nprovides that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . rest[s] on the\nparty asserting such invalidity.\u201d1 Under the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s reading of \u00a7282, a defendant seeking to overcome\nthis presumption must persuade the factfinder of its in\nvalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence. Judge\nRich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this\nview for the court in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.\nSowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,\nthe Federal Circuit held that \u00a7282 codified \u201cthe existing\npresumption of validity of patents,\u201d id., at 1359 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014what, until that point, had\nbeen a common-law presumption based on \u201cthe basic\nproposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]\nwas presumed to do its job,\u201d ibid. Relying on this Court\u2019s\npre-1952 precedent as to the \u201cforce of the presumption,\u201d\nibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering\nLaboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (1934) (RCA)), Judge Rich\nconcluded:\n     \u201c[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is\n     valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on\n     the attacker. That burden is constant and never\n     changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by\n     clear evidence.\u201d 725 F. 2d, at 1360.\nIn the nearly 30 years since American Hoist, the Federal\nCircuit has never wavered in this interpretation of \u00a7282.\nSee, e.g., Greenwood v. Hattori Seiko Co., 900 F. 2d 238,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As originally enacted in 1952, the first paragraph of \u00a7282 read: \u201cA\n\npatent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity\nof a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\u201d 66 Stat. 812. Congress\nhas since amended \u00a7282, inserting two sentences not relevant here and\nmodifying the language of the second sentence to that in the text.\n4        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n240\u2013241 (CA Fed. 1990); Ultra-Tex Surfaces, Inc. v. Hill\nBros. Chemical Co., 204 F. 3d 1360, 1367 (CA Fed. 2000);\nALZA Corp. v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals, LLC, 603 F. 3d\n935, 940 (CA Fed. 2010).\n                                B\n   Respondents i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastruc\ntures for Information Inc. (collectively, i4i) hold the patent\nat issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved\nmethod for editing computer documents, which stores a\ndocument\u2019s content separately from the metacodes asso\nciated with the document\u2019s structure. In 2007, i4i sued\npetitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,\nclaiming that Microsoft\u2019s manufacture and sale of certain\nMicrosoft Word products infringed i4i\u2019s patent. In addi\ntion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed\nand sought a declaration that i4i\u2019s patent was invalid and\nunenforceable.\n   Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that\nthe on-sale bar of \u00a7102(b) rendered the patent invalid,\npointing to i4i\u2019s prior sale of a software program known as\nS4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to\nthe filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4\nin the United States. They presented opposing arguments\nto the jury, however, as to whether that software embod\nied the invention claimed in i4i\u2019s patent. Because the\nsoftware\u2019s source code had been destroyed years before the\ncommencement of this litigation, the factual dispute\nturned largely on trial testimony by S4\u2019s two inventors\u2014\nalso the named inventors on the i4i patent\u2014both of whom\ntestified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis\nclosed in the patent.\n   Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was\nnever presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected\nto i4i\u2019s proposed instruction that it was required to prove\nits invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

How\n     ever, Microsoft\u2019s burden of proof with regard to its\n     defense of invalidity based on prior art that the ex\n     aminer did not review during the prosecution of the\n     patent-in-suit is by preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d\n     Ibid.\nRejecting the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocated, the District Court instructed the jury that\n\u201cMicrosoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear\nand convincing evidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 195a.\n   The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i\npatent and that Microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to\nthe on-sale bar or otherwise. Denying Microsoft\u2019s post\ntrial motions, the District Court rejected Microsoft\u2019s con\ntention that the court improperly instructed the jury on\nthe standard of proof. The Court of Appeals for the Fed\neral Circuit affirmed.2 598 F. 3d 831, 848 (2010). Relying\non its settled interpretation of \u00a7282, the court explained\nthat it could \u201cdiscern [no] error\u201d in the jury instruction\nrequiring Microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear\nand convincing evidence. Ibid. We granted certiorari.\n562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                            II\n  According to Microsoft, a defendant in an infringement\naction need only persuade the jury of an invalidity defense\nby a preponderance of the evidence. In the alternative,\nMicrosoft insists that a preponderance standard must\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Although not relevant here, the Court of Appeals modified the effec\n\ntive date of the permanent injunction that the District Court entered in\nfavor of i4i. 598 F. 3d 831, 863\u2013864 (CA Fed. 2010).\n6          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napply at least when an invalidity defense rests on evidence\nthat was never considered by the PTO in the examination\nprocess. We reject both contentions.3\n                              A\n   Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard\nof proof, its choice controls absent \u201ccountervailing consti\ntutional constraints.\u201d Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 95\n(1981). The question, then, is whether Congress has made\nsuch a choice here.\n   As stated, the first paragraph of \u00a7282 provides that\n\u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof\nshall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.\u201d Thus, by\nits express terms, \u00a7282 establishes a presumption of pat\nent validity, and it provides that a challenger must over\ncome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.\nBut, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of\nproof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of\nproof.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 i4i contends that Microsoft forfeited the first argument by failing to\n\nraise it until its merits brief in this Court. The argument, however, is\nwithin the scope of the question presented, and because we reject it on\nits merits, we need not decide whether it has been preserved.\n   4 A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said,\n\n\u201c[t]he term \u2018burden of proof\u2019 is one of the \u2018the slipperiest members of\nthe family of legal terms.\u2019 \u201d Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005)\n(quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7342, p. 433 (5th ed.\n1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two\nseparate burdens: the \u201cburden of persuasion\u201d (specifying which party\nloses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the \u201cburden of production\u201d\n(specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various\nstages in the litigation). Ibid. Adding more confusion, the term \u201cbur\nden of proof\u201d has occasionally been used as a synonym for \u201cstandard of\nproof.\u201d E.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991).\n   Here we use \u201cburden of proof\u201d interchangeably with \u201cburden of per\nsuasion\u201d to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to\nprevail. We use the term \u201cstandard of proof\u201d to refer to the degree of\ncertainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclu\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

We begin, of course, with \u201cthe assumption that the\nordinary meaning of the language\u201d chosen by Congress\n\u201caccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d Engine\nMfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,\n541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a\nstatute, we assume the \u201cterm . . . comes with a common\nlaw meaning, absent anything pointing another way.\u201d\nSafeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58 (2007)\n(citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500\u2013501 (2000)).\nHere, by stating that a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d \u00a7282,\nCongress used a term with a settled meaning in the com\nmon law.\n   Our decision in RCA, 293 U. S. 1, is authoritative.\nThere, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court\nand others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court\nthat \u201cthere is a presumption of validity, a presumption not\nto be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.\u201d\nId., at 2. Although the \u201cforce\u201d of the presumption found\n\u201cvarying expression\u201d in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,\nJustice Cardozo explained, one \u201ccommon core of thought\nand truth\u201d unified the decisions:\n     \u201c[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity\n     of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of\n     persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more\n     than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nsion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See \n\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979). In other words, the term\n\n\u201cstandard of proof\u201d specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing \n\nthe burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. \n\nVarious standards of proof are familiar\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nSee generally 21B C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice & Proce\ndure \u00a75122, pp. 405\u2013411 (2d ed. 2005) (hereinafter Fed.

PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     the assailant connects himself in some way with the\n     title of the true inventor, it is so a fortiori where he is\n     a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of\n     his own. If it is true where the assailant launches his\n     attack with evidence different, at least in form, from\n     any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent,\n     it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is\n     even verbally the same.\u201d Id., at 8 (internal citation\n     omitted).5\nThe common-law presumption, in other words, reflected\nthe universal understanding that a preponderance stan\ndard of proof was too \u201cdubious\u201d a basis to deem a patent\ninvalid. Ibid.; see also id., at 7 (\u201c[A] patent . . . is pre\nsumed to be valid until the presumption has been over\ncome by convincing evidence of error\u201d).\n  Thus, by the time Congress enacted \u00a7282 and declared\nthat a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d the presumption of\npatent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.\nAccording to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an\ninvalidity defense bore \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion,\u201d\nrequiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing\nevidence. Id., at 8. That is, the presumption encompassed\nnot only an allocation of the burden of proof but also an\nimposition of a heightened standard of proof. Under the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Among other cases, Justice Cardozo cited Cantrell v. Wallick, 117\n\nU.

But given how judges, including Justice\nCardozo, repeatedly understood and explained the pre\nsumption of patent validity, we cannot accept Microsoft\u2019s\nargument that Congress used the words \u201cpresumed valid\u201d\nto adopt only a procedural device for \u201cshifting the burden\nof production,\u201d or for \u201cshifting both the burden of produc\ntion and the burden of persuasion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n21\u201322 (emphasis deleted).

First, according to Microsoft, the heightened\nstandard of proof applied in cases \u201cinvolving oral testi\nmony of prior invention,\u201d simply to account for the unreli\nability of such testimony.

Second,\nMicrosoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof ap\nplied to \u201cinvalidity challenges based on priority of inven\ntion,\u201d where that issue had previously been litigated\nbetween the parties in PTO proceedings.

In sup\nport, it relies on the \u201cunderstanding\u201d reflected in Federal Rule of\nEvidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in\nfederal civil actions. That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by\nnearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952\nunderstood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of pat\nent validity. In any event, the word \u201cpresumption\u201d has often been\nused when another term might be more accurate. See Thayer 335\n(\u201cOften . . . maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of\na presumption perversely and inaccurately\u201d). And, to the extent\nCongress used the words \u201cpresumed valid\u201d in an imprecise way, we\ncannot fault it for following our lead.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

RCA simply said, without qualifi\ncation, \u201cthat one otherwise an infringer who assails the\nvalidity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than\na dubious preponderance.\u201d 293 U.

Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express\nlimitations on the application of the heightened standard\nof proof. Cf., e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U. S. 216, 233 (1937)\n(citing RCA for the proposition that a \u201cheavy burden of\npersuasion . . . rests upon one who seeks to negative nov\nelty in a patent by showing prior use\u201d); Mumm v.

In fact, Microsoft\nitself admits that our cases \u201ccould be read as announcing a\nheightened standard applicable to all invalidity asser\ntions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).\n   Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft\u2019s proposed\nlimitations are inherent\u2014even if unexpressed\u2014in our\npre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the\nburden of proving prior inventorship \u201crests upon [the de\nfendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved\nagainst him,\u201d without tying that rule to the vagaries and\nmanipulability of oral testimony. Coffin v. Ogden, 18\nWall. 120, 124 (1874). And, more than 60 years later, we\napplied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior\nuse defense included documentary proof\u2014not just oral\ntestimony\u2014in a case presenting no priority issues at all.\nSee Smith, 301 U.

PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard of proof in our cases, it would have found none.7\n  Microsoft also argues that the Federal Circuit\u2019s inter\npretation of \u00a7282\u2019s statement that \u201c[a] patent shall be pre\nsumed valid\u201d must fail because it renders superfluous\nthe statute\u2019s additional statement that \u201c[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent . . . shall rest on the\nparty asserting such invalidity.\u201d We agree that if the\npresumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on\nthe patent challenger, then it alone suffices to establish\nthat the defendant bears the burden of persuasion. Cf.\nDirector, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v.\nGreenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 278 (1994) (\u201cA stan\ndard of proof . . . can apply only to a burden of persua\nsion\u201d). Indeed, the Federal Circuit essentially recognized\nas much in American Hoist. See 725 F. 3d, at 1359.\n  But the canon against superfluity assists only where a\ncompeting interpretation gives effect \u201c \u2018to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u2019 \u201d Duncan v.

S. 167, 174\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled\n\npresumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952. Microsoft points\nto a handful of district court decisions, which \u201cquestion[ed] whether any\npresumption of validity was warranted,\u201d or which \u201crequired the pat\nentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ginsberg v. Railway\nExpress Agency, Inc., 72 F. Supp. 43, 44 (SDNY 1947) (stating, in dicta,\nthat \u201c[i]t may now well be said that no presumption whatever arises\nfrom the grant of patent\u201d); see also post, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment). RCA makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent\nvalidity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century,\n293 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or\neven pretended it did not exist is of no moment. Microsoft may be\ncorrect that Congress enacted \u00a7282 to correct lower courts that required\nthe patentee to prove the validity of a patent. See American Hoist &\nDerrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).\nBut the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify\nthat the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that\nthe evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

That is, if the presumption\nonly \u201callocates the burden of production,\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, or if it instead \u201cshift[s] both the burden of pro\nduction and the burden of persuasion,\u201d id., at 22 (empha\nsis deleted), then it would be unnecessary in light of \u00a7282\u2019s\nstatement that the challenger bears the \u201cburden of estab\nlishing invalidity.\u201d See 21B Fed.

The accompanying House and Senate Reports both\nexplain that \u00a7282 \u201cintroduces a declaration of the presumption of va\nlidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci\nsions, but has had no expression in the statute.\u201d H.

In particular, it relies on KSR\nInt\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398 (2007), where we ob\nserved that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe rationale under\nlying the presumption\u2014that the PTO, in its expertise, has\napproved the claim\u2014seems much diminished.\u201d Id., at 426.\n  That statement is true enough, although other ration\nales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.\nSee The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275, 292 (1892)\n(explaining that because the patentee \u201cfirst published this\ndevice; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical\npurpose; and gave it to the public . . . . doubts . . . concern\ning the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor\nof the patentee\u201d); cf.

As established, Congress did just that\nby codifying the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof at\ntached to it.\n   Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind\nof fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions.\nAnd they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less\nthan a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to\nan invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To\nthe contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in\nRCA, stating that because the heightened standard of\nproof applied where the evidence before the court was\n\u201cdifferent\u201d from that considered by the PTO, it applied\neven more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293\nU. S., at 8. Likewise, the Court\u2019s statement that a \u201cdubi\nous preponderance\u201d will never suffice to sustain an inva\nlidity defense, ibid., admitted of no apparent exceptions.\nFinally, this Court often applied the heightened standard\nof proof without any mention of whether the relevant\nprior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in\ncircumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g.,\nSmith, 301 U. S., at 227, 233.9\n   Nothing in \u00a7282\u2019s text suggests that Congress meant to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Microsoft cites numerous court of appeals decisions as support for\nits claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that\nthe evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by\nthe PTO. We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocates in these cases. Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that\nthe court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened stan\ndard of proof. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley Pump Co., 191 F. 2d\n632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201cAlthough it is not expressly stated that th[e]\nconclusion [of invalidity] is based upon evidence establishing the thesis\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the Trial Court expressed no doubt. And\nthe record shows that such conclusion was supported by substantial\nevidence\u201d); Western Auto Supply Co. v. American-National Co., 114\nF. 2d 711, 713 (CA6 1940) (concluding that the patent was invalid\nwhere the court \u201centertain[ed] no doubt\u201d on the question).\n16          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndepart from that understanding to enact a standard of\nproof that would rise and fall with the facts of each\ncase. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened\nstandard of proof where the evidence before the jury var\nied from that before the PTO\u2014and thus to take the un\nusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard\nof proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf.\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 757 (1982)10\u2014we as\nsume it would have said so expressly.\n  To be sure, numerous courts of appeals in the years\npreceding the 1952 Act observed that the presumption of\nvalidity is \u201cweakened\u201d or \u201cdissipated\u201d in the circumstance\nthat the evidence in an infringement action was never\nconsidered by the PTO. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley\nPump Co., 191 F. 2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201clargely dissi\npated\u201d); H. Schindler & Co. v. C. Saladino & Sons, 81\nF. 2d 649, 651 (CA1 1936) (\u201cweakened\u201d); Gillette Safety\nRazor Co. v. Cliff Weil Cigar Co., 107 F. 2d 105, 107 (CA4\n1939) (\u201cgreatly weakened\u201d); Butler Mfg. Co. v. Enterprise\nCleaning Co., 81 F. 2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (\u201cweakened\u201d).\nBut we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest\nthat a preponderance standard would apply in such cir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from\n\nthe fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference\nwill often be a question without a clear answer. In granting a patent,\nan examiner is under no duty to cite every reference he considers. 1\nDept. of Commerce, PTO, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n\u00a7904.03, p. 900\u201351 (8th rev. ed. 2010) (\u201cThe examiner is not called upon\nto cite all references that may be available, but only the \u2018best.\u2019 Multiply\ning references, any one of which is as good as, but no better than, the\nothers, adds to the burden and cost of prosecution and should therefore\nbe avoided\u201d (emphasis deleted)); Manual of Patent Examining Proce\ndure \u00a7904.02, p. 129 (1st rev. ed. 1952) (same), http://www.uspto.gov/\nweb/offices/pac/mpep/old/E1R3_900.pdf (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 6, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); see also\nBrief for Respondents 45\u201346 (describing additional impracticalities).\nWe see no indication in \u00a7282 that Congress meant to require collateral\nlitigation on such an inherently uncertain question.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Instead, we understand these cases to reflect\nthe same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit\nhas recognized throughout its existence\u2014namely, that\nnew evidence supporting an invalidity defense may \u201ccarry\nmore weight\u201d in an infringement action than evidence\npreviously considered by the PTO, American Hoist, 725\nF. 2d, at 1360. \tAs Judge Rich explained:\n    \u201cWhen new evidence touching validity of the patent\n    not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal\n    considering it is not faced with having to disagree\n    with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or\n    with taking its expertise into account. The evidence\n    may, therefore, carry more weight and go further to\n    ward sustaining the attacker\u2019s unchanging burden.\u201d\n    Ibid. (emphasis deleted)\nSee also SIBIA Neurosciences, Inc. v.

KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. And, concomitantly, the\nchallenger\u2019s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity\ndefense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to\nsustain. In this respect, although we have no occasion to\nendorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury\ninstruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when\nrequested, most often should be given. When warranted,\nthe jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard\nevidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate\nbefore granting the patent. When it is disputed whether\nthe evidence presented to the jury differs from that evalu\n18       MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider\nthat question. In either case, the jury may be instructed\nto evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially\nnew, and if so, to consider that fact when determining\nwhether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear\nand convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap\nids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563\u20131564 (CA Fed. 1993); see\nalso Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as\nAmicus Curiae 31\u201337. Although Microsoft emphasized in\nits argument to the jury that S4 was never considered by\nthe PTO, it failed to request an instruction along these\nlines from the District Court.

Reply Brief for Petitioner 22\u201323.\nThat argument, however, comes far too late, and we there\nfore refuse to consider it. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\nJackson, 561 U.

Microsoft and\nits amici contend that the heightened standard of proof\ndampens innovation by unduly insulating \u201cbad\u201d patents\nfrom invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali\ndation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec\ntion to too many undeserving \u201cinventions.\u201d They claim\nthat inter partes reexamination proceedings before the\nPTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida\ntion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in\nsuch proceedings. They question the deference that the\nPTO\u2019s expert determinations warrant, in light of the\nagency\u2019s resources and procedures, which they deem in\nadequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard\nof proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.\n   For their part, i4i and its amici, including the United\nStates, contend that the heightened standard of proof\nproperly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury\noverturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.\nThey claim that the heightened standard of proof is an\nessential component of the patent \u201cbargain,\u201d see Bonito\nBoats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,\n150\u2013151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis\nclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent\nprotection. They disagree with the notion that the patent\nissuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that\nlimits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by\nCongress as to the appropriate degree of interference with\npatentees\u2019 reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that\njuries that are properly instructed as to the application of\nthe clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often\ndo, find an invalidity defense established.\n   We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara\ntive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,\nthe Federal Circuit has interpreted \u00a7282 as we do today.\nDuring this period, Congress has often amended \u00a7282, see,\ne.g., Pub. L. 104\u2013141, \u00a72, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98\u2013417,\n\u00a7203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)\nare aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the\nstandard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con\ngress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns\nabout \u201cbad\u201d patents, including by expanding the reexami\nnation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See\nOptional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of\n1999, 113 Stat. 1501A\u2013567, codified at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7311 et\nseq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in\n\u00a7282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7282 in place despite\nongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern\n20          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

I write separately be\ncause, given the technical but important nature of the\ninvalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in\nthis area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of\nproof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423\n(1979). Thus a factfinder must use the \u201cclear and convinc\ning\u201d standard where there are disputes about, say, when a\nproduct was first sold or whether a prior art reference had\nbeen published.\n   Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon fac\ntual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as\ngiven. Do the given facts show that the product was pre\nviously \u201cin public use\u201d? 35 U. S. C. \u00a7102(b). Do they show\nthat the invention was \u201cnove[l]\u201d and that it was \u201cnon\nobvious\u201d? \u00a7\u00a7102, 103.

See,\ne.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1,\n17 (1966); Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc.,\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

S. 370 (1996).\n   Courts can help to keep the application of today\u2019s \u201cclear\nand convincing\u201d standard within its proper legal bounds\nby separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity\nclaim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific\ncircumstances that help the jury make the distinction or\nby using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear\nwhich specific factual findings underlie the jury\u2019s conclu\nsions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating\nthe facts (determined with help of the \u201cclear and convinc\ning\u201d standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in\nterpretation or application of the correct legal standard\n(without use of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard). By\npreventing the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard from roam\ning outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase\nthe likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re\nceive legal protection where none is due.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

But I do not think that the words \u201c[a] patent shall\nbe presumed valid\u201d so clearly conveyed a particular stan\ndard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute\na term of art.

Argued April 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 9, 2011\nIn asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an\n  alleged infringer must contend with \u00a7282 of the Patent Act of 1952\n  (Act), under which \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c[t]he\n  burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the party asserting\u201d\n  it. Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read \u00a7282 to require a defen\n  dant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder\n  of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n     Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which\n  claims an improved method for editing computer documents. After\n  i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that\n  patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the\n  patent was invalid under \u00a7102(b)\u2019s on-sale bar, which precludes pat\n  ent protection for any \u201cinvention\u201d that was \u201con sale in this country\u201d\n  more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. The\n  parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent applica\n  tion, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United\n  States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the\n  invention claimed in i4i\u2019s patent. Relying on the undisputed fact that\n  the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark\n  Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Micro\n  soft objected to i4i\u2019s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity de\n  fense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The District\n  Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft\u2019s alter\n  native instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence stan\n  dard. The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent\n  and had failed to prove the patent\u2019s invalidity. The Federal Circuit\n  affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of \u00a7282.\n2          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear\n and convincing evidence. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) The Court rejects Microsoft\u2019s contention that a defendant need\n only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponder\n ance of the evidence. Where Congress has prescribed the governing\n standard of proof, its choice generally controls. Steadman v. SEC,\n 450 U. S. 91, 95. Congress has made such a choice here. While \u00a7282\n includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Con\n gress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the\n \u201cterm . . . comes with a common law meaning.\u201d Safeco Ins. Co. of\n America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58. Here, by stating that a patent is\n \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d \u00a7282, Congress used a term with a settled common\n law meaning. Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Labora\n tories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative. There, tracing nearly\n a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that \u201cthere is a\n presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except\n by clear and cogent evidence,\u201d id., at 2. Microsoft\u2019s contention that\n the Court\u2019s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing stan\n dard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the ab\n sence of those qualifications from the Court\u2019s cases. Also unpersua\n sive is Microsoft\u2019s argument that the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation\n must fail because it renders superfluous \u00a7282\u2019s additional statement\n that \u201c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the\n party asserting\u201d it. The canon against superfluity assists only where\n a competing interpretation gives effect \u201c \u2018to every clause and word of\n a statute.\u2019 \u201d Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174. Here, no inter\n pretation of \u00a7282 avoids excess language because, under either of Mi\n crosoft\u2019s alternative theories\u2014that the presumption only allocates\n the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of produc\n tion and persuasion\u2014the presumption itself would be unnecessary in\n light of \u00a7282\u2019s additional statement as to the challenger\u2019s burden.\n Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (b) Also rejected is Microsoft\u2019s argument that a preponderance\n standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder\n was not before the PTO during the examination process. It is true\n enough that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe rationale underlying the\n presumption\u2014that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the\n claim\u2014seems much diminished,\u201d KSR Int\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550\n U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the pre\n sumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified\n the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress\n did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent va\n lidity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.\n The Court\u2019s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft\u2019s fluc\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

And they do not indicate, even in dicta,\n  that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever\n  apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the con\n  trary. See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8. Finally, the Court often applied the\n  heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the rele\n  vant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in cir\n  cumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g., Smith v. Hall,\n  301 U. S. 216, 227, 233. Nothing in \u00a7282\u2019s text suggests that Con\n  gress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of\n  proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had\n  Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where\n  the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it pre\n  sumably would have said so expressly. Those pre-Act cases where\n  various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weak\n  ened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the\n  PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the\n  PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment\n  may lose significant force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. Consistent\n  with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the\n  evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact\n  when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by\n  clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 14\u201318.\n     (c) This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the\n  parties\u2019 policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and\n  convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.            Congress\n  specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the\n  common-law presumption of patent validity. During the nearly 30\n  years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted \u00a7282 as the Court does\n  today, Congress has often amended \u00a7282 and other patent laws, but\n  apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard\n  of proof. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpreta\n  tion in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal\n  Government and without. Accordingly, any recalibration of the stan\n  dard of proof remains in Congress\u2019 hands.

S. C. \u00a7282. We\nconsider whether \u00a7282 requires an invalidity defense to be\nproved by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that it\ndoes.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task\nof examining patent applications, 35 U. S. C. \u00a72(a)(1), and\nissuing patents if \u201cit appears that the applicant is entitled\nto a patent under the law,\u201d \u00a7131. Congress has set forth\nthe prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO\nmust evaluate in the examination process. To receive\npatent protection a claimed invention must, among other\nthings, fall within one of the express categories of pat\nentable subject matter, \u00a7101, and be novel, \u00a7102, and\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonobvious, \u00a7103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of\n\u00a7102(b) precludes patent protection for any \u201cinvention\u201d\nthat was \u201con sale in this country\u201d more than one year prior\nto the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.\nWells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67\u201368 (1998). In\nevaluating whether these and other statutory conditions\nhave been met, PTO examiners must make various factual\ndeterminations\u2014for instance, the state of the prior art in\nthe field and the nature of the advancement embodied in\nthe invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153\n(1999).\n   Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to\nits holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven\ntion during the patent\u2019s duration. To enforce that right, a\npatentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an\nother person \u201cwithout authority makes, uses, offers to sell,\nor sells any patented invention, within the United States.\u201d\n\u00a7271(a); see also \u00a7281.\n   Among other defenses under \u00a7282 of the Patent Act of\n1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva\nlidity of the patent\u2014that is, he may attempt to prove that\nthe patent never should have issued in the first place. See\n\u00a7\u00a7282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that\nthe claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus\nthat one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.\nSee \u00a7282(2); see also \u00a7103. \u201cWhile the ultimate question of\npatent validity is one of law,\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co.\nof Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic\n& Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340\nU. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,\nat 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions\nunderlying the PTO\u2019s original examination of a patent ap\nplication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in\nfringement action. See, e.g., 383 U. S., at 17 (describing\nthe \u201cbasic factual inquiries\u201d that form the \u201cbackground\u201d\nfor evaluating obviousness); Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 67\u201369\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(same, as to the on-sale bar).\n   In asserting an invalidity defense, an alleged infringer\nmust contend with the first paragraph of \u00a7282, which\nprovides that \u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . rest[s] on the\nparty asserting such invalidity.\u201d1 Under the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s reading of \u00a7282, a defendant seeking to overcome\nthis presumption must persuade the factfinder of its in\nvalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence. Judge\nRich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this\nview for the court in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.\nSowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,\nthe Federal Circuit held that \u00a7282 codified \u201cthe existing\npresumption of validity of patents,\u201d id., at 1359 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)\u2014what, until that point, had\nbeen a common-law presumption based on \u201cthe basic\nproposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]\nwas presumed to do its job,\u201d ibid. Relying on this Court\u2019s\npre-1952 precedent as to the \u201cforce of the presumption,\u201d\nibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering\nLaboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (1934) (RCA)), Judge Rich\nconcluded:\n     \u201c[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is\n     valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on\n     the attacker. That burden is constant and never\n     changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by\n     clear evidence.\u201d 725 F. 2d, at 1360.\nIn the nearly 30 years since American Hoist, the Federal\nCircuit has never wavered in this interpretation of \u00a7282.\nSee, e.g., Greenwood v. Hattori Seiko Co., 900 F. 2d 238,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As originally enacted in 1952, the first paragraph of \u00a7282 read: \u201cA\n\npatent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity\nof a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\u201d 66 Stat. 812. Congress\nhas since amended \u00a7282, inserting two sentences not relevant here and\nmodifying the language of the second sentence to that in the text.\n4        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

(collectively, i4i) hold the patent\nat issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved\nmethod for editing computer documents, which stores a\ndocument\u2019s content separately from the metacodes asso\nciated with the document\u2019s structure. In 2007, i4i sued\npetitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,\nclaiming that Microsoft\u2019s manufacture and sale of certain\nMicrosoft Word products infringed i4i\u2019s patent. In addi\ntion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed\nand sought a declaration that i4i\u2019s patent was invalid and\nunenforceable.\n   Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that\nthe on-sale bar of \u00a7102(b) rendered the patent invalid,\npointing to i4i\u2019s prior sale of a software program known as\nS4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to\nthe filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4\nin the United States. They presented opposing arguments\nto the jury, however, as to whether that software embod\nied the invention claimed in i4i\u2019s patent. Because the\nsoftware\u2019s source code had been destroyed years before the\ncommencement of this litigation, the factual dispute\nturned largely on trial testimony by S4\u2019s two inventors\u2014\nalso the named inventors on the i4i patent\u2014both of whom\ntestified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis\nclosed in the patent.\n   Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was\nnever presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected\nto i4i\u2019s proposed instruction that it was required to prove\nits invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

How\n     ever, Microsoft\u2019s burden of proof with regard to its\n     defense of invalidity based on prior art that the ex\n     aminer did not review during the prosecution of the\n     patent-in-suit is by preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d\n     Ibid.\nRejecting the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocated, the District Court instructed the jury that\n\u201cMicrosoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear\nand convincing evidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 195a.\n   The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i\npatent and that Microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to\nthe on-sale bar or otherwise. Denying Microsoft\u2019s post\ntrial motions, the District Court rejected Microsoft\u2019s con\ntention that the court improperly instructed the jury on\nthe standard of proof. The Court of Appeals for the Fed\neral Circuit affirmed.2 598 F. 3d 831, 848 (2010). Relying\non its settled interpretation of \u00a7282, the court explained\nthat it could \u201cdiscern [no] error\u201d in the jury instruction\nrequiring Microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear\nand convincing evidence. Ibid. We granted certiorari.\n562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                            II\n  According to Microsoft, a defendant in an infringement\naction need only persuade the jury of an invalidity defense\nby a preponderance of the evidence.

We reject both contentions.3\n                              A\n   Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard\nof proof, its choice controls absent \u201ccountervailing consti\ntutional constraints.\u201d Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 95\n(1981). The question, then, is whether Congress has made\nsuch a choice here.\n   As stated, the first paragraph of \u00a7282 provides that\n\u201c[a] patent shall be presumed valid\u201d and \u201c[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof\nshall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.\u201d Thus, by\nits express terms, \u00a7282 establishes a presumption of pat\nent validity, and it provides that a challenger must over\ncome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.\nBut, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of\nproof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of\nproof.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 i4i contends that Microsoft forfeited the first argument by failing to\n\nraise it until its merits brief in this Court. The argument, however, is\nwithin the scope of the question presented, and because we reject it on\nits merits, we need not decide whether it has been preserved.\n   4 A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said,\n\n\u201c[t]he term \u2018burden of proof\u2019 is one of the \u2018the slipperiest members of\nthe family of legal terms.\u2019 \u201d Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005)\n(quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7342, p. 433 (5th ed.\n1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two\nseparate burdens: the \u201cburden of persuasion\u201d (specifying which party\nloses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the \u201cburden of production\u201d\n(specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various\nstages in the litigation). Ibid. Adding more confusion, the term \u201cbur\nden of proof\u201d has occasionally been used as a synonym for \u201cstandard of\nproof.\u201d E.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991).\n   Here we use \u201cburden of proof\u201d interchangeably with \u201cburden of per\nsuasion\u201d to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to\nprevail. We use the term \u201cstandard of proof\u201d to refer to the degree of\ncertainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclu\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

We begin, of course, with \u201cthe assumption that the\nordinary meaning of the language\u201d chosen by Congress\n\u201caccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u201d Engine\nMfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,\n541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a\nstatute, we assume the \u201cterm . . . comes with a common\nlaw meaning, absent anything pointing another way.\u201d\nSafeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58 (2007)\n(citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500\u2013501 (2000)).\nHere, by stating that a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d \u00a7282,\nCongress used a term with a settled meaning in the com\nmon law.\n   Our decision in RCA, 293 U. S. 1, is authoritative.\nThere, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court\nand others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court\nthat \u201cthere is a presumption of validity, a presumption not\nto be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.\u201d\nId., at 2. Although the \u201cforce\u201d of the presumption found\n\u201cvarying expression\u201d in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,\nJustice Cardozo explained, one \u201ccommon core of thought\nand truth\u201d unified the decisions:\n     \u201c[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity\n     of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of\n     persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more\n     than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nsion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See \n\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979). In other words, the term\n\n\u201cstandard of proof\u201d specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing \n\nthe burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. \n\nVarious standards of proof are familiar\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nSee generally 21B C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice & Proce\ndure \u00a75122, pp. 405\u2013411 (2d ed. 2005) (hereinafter Fed. Practice)\n\n(describing these and other standards of proof). \n\n8          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     the assailant connects himself in some way with the\n     title of the true inventor, it is so a fortiori where he is\n     a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of\n     his own. If it is true where the assailant launches his\n     attack with evidence different, at least in form, from\n     any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent,\n     it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is\n     even verbally the same.\u201d Id., at 8 (internal citation\n     omitted).5\nThe common-law presumption, in other words, reflected\nthe universal understanding that a preponderance stan\ndard of proof was too \u201cdubious\u201d a basis to deem a patent\ninvalid. Ibid.; see also id., at 7 (\u201c[A] patent . . . is pre\nsumed to be valid until the presumption has been over\ncome by convincing evidence of error\u201d).\n  Thus, by the time Congress enacted \u00a7282 and declared\nthat a patent is \u201cpresumed valid,\u201d the presumption of\npatent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.\nAccording to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an\ninvalidity defense bore \u201ca heavy burden of persuasion,\u201d\nrequiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing\nevidence.

First, according to Microsoft, the heightened\nstandard of proof applied in cases \u201cinvolving oral testi\nmony of prior invention,\u201d simply to account for the unreli\nability of such testimony.

Second,\nMicrosoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof ap\nplied to \u201cinvalidity challenges based on priority of inven\ntion,\u201d where that issue had previously been litigated\nbetween the parties in PTO proceedings.

In sup\nport, it relies on the \u201cunderstanding\u201d reflected in Federal Rule of\nEvidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in\nfederal civil actions. That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by\nnearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952\nunderstood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of pat\nent validity. In any event, the word \u201cpresumption\u201d has often been\nused when another term might be more accurate. See Thayer 335\n(\u201cOften . . . maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of\na presumption perversely and inaccurately\u201d). And, to the extent\nCongress used the words \u201cpresumed valid\u201d in an imprecise way, we\ncannot fault it for following our lead.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

RCA simply said, without qualifi\ncation, \u201cthat one otherwise an infringer who assails the\nvalidity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than\na dubious preponderance.\u201d 293 U.

Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express\nlimitations on the application of the heightened standard\nof proof. Cf., e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U.

In fact, Microsoft\nitself admits that our cases \u201ccould be read as announcing a\nheightened standard applicable to all invalidity asser\ntions.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).\n   Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft\u2019s proposed\nlimitations are inherent\u2014even if unexpressed\u2014in our\npre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the\nburden of proving prior inventorship \u201crests upon [the de\nfendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved\nagainst him,\u201d without tying that rule to the vagaries and\nmanipulability of oral testimony.

Cf.\nDirector, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v.\nGreenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 278 (1994) (\u201cA stan\ndard of proof . . . can apply only to a burden of persua\nsion\u201d). Indeed, the Federal Circuit essentially recognized\nas much in American Hoist. See 725 F. 3d, at 1359.\n  But the canon against superfluity assists only where a\ncompeting interpretation gives effect \u201c \u2018to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u2019 \u201d Duncan v.

Microsoft points\nto a handful of district court decisions, which \u201cquestion[ed] whether any\npresumption of validity was warranted,\u201d or which \u201crequired the pat\nentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the\nevidence.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ginsberg v.

RCA makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent\nvalidity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century,\n293 U. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or\neven pretended it did not exist is of no moment.

Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).\nBut the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify\nthat the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that\nthe evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

That is, if the presumption\nonly \u201callocates the burden of production,\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, or if it instead \u201cshift[s] both the burden of pro\nduction and the burden of persuasion,\u201d id., at 22 (empha\nsis deleted), then it would be unnecessary in light of \u00a7282\u2019s\nstatement that the challenger bears the \u201cburden of estab\nlishing invalidity.\u201d See 21B Fed.

Cf., e.g., 28 U. S.

The accompanying House and Senate Reports both\nexplain that \u00a7282 \u201cintroduces a declaration of the presumption of va\nlidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci\nsions, but has had no expression in the statute.\u201d H.

To the same\neffect, the Reviser\u2019s Note indicates that \u00a7282\u2019s \u201cfirst paragraph declares\nthe existing presumption of validity of patents.\u201d Note following 35\nU. S. C. \u00a7282 (1952 ed.).\n   Prior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum\nand substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it\u2014that is,\nthey \u201cassign[ed] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused in\nfringer,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted). See 35 U. S. C. \u00a769\n(1946 ed.) (providing that a defendant in an infringement action \u201cmay\nplead\u201d and \u201cprove on trial\u201d the invalidity of the patent as a defense); see\n14          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

In particular, it relies on KSR\nInt\u2019l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398 (2007), where we ob\nserved that, in these circumstances, \u201cthe rationale under\nlying the presumption\u2014that the PTO, in its expertise, has\napproved the claim\u2014seems much diminished.\u201d Id., at 426.\n  That statement is true enough, although other ration\nales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.\nSee The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275, 292 (1892)\n(explaining that because the patentee \u201cfirst published this\ndevice; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical\npurpose; and gave it to the public . . . . doubts . . . concern\ning the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor\nof the patentee\u201d); cf. Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33 (arguing that even when the administrative cor\nrectness rationale has no relevance, the heightened stan\ndard of proof \u201cserves to protect the patent holder\u2019s reliance\ninterests\u201d in disclosing an invention to the public in\nexchange for patent protection). The question remains,\nhowever, whether Congress has specified the applicable\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalso Patent Act of 1870, ch. 230, \u00a761, 16 Stat. 208 (same); Patent Act of\n1836, ch. 357, \u00a715, 5 Stat. 123 (similar); Patent Act of 1793, ch.

The House and\nSenate Reports state, however, that \u00a7282 established a principle that\npreviously \u201chad no expression in the statute.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 10; S. Rep.,\nat 9. Thus, because the only thing missing from \u00a7282\u2019s predecessor was\nthe heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood\nthe presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard\nof proof attached to it.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard of proof. As established, Congress did just that\nby codifying the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof at\ntached to it.\n   Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind\nof fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions.\nAnd they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less\nthan a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to\nan invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To\nthe contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in\nRCA, stating that because the heightened standard of\nproof applied where the evidence before the court was\n\u201cdifferent\u201d from that considered by the PTO, it applied\neven more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293\nU. S., at 8. Likewise, the Court\u2019s statement that a \u201cdubi\nous preponderance\u201d will never suffice to sustain an inva\nlidity defense, ibid., admitted of no apparent exceptions.\nFinally, this Court often applied the heightened standard\nof proof without any mention of whether the relevant\nprior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in\ncircumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g.,\nSmith, 301 U. S., at 227, 233.9\n   Nothing in \u00a7282\u2019s text suggests that Congress meant to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Microsoft cites numerous court of appeals decisions as support for\nits claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that\nthe evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by\nthe PTO. We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocates in these cases. Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that\nthe court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened stan\ndard of proof. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley Pump Co., 191 F. 2d\n632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201cAlthough it is not expressly stated that th[e]\nconclusion [of invalidity] is based upon evidence establishing the thesis\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the Trial Court expressed no doubt. And\nthe record shows that such conclusion was supported by substantial\nevidence\u201d); Western Auto Supply Co. v. American-National Co., 114\nF. 2d 711, 713 (CA6 1940) (concluding that the patent was invalid\nwhere the court \u201centertain[ed] no doubt\u201d on the question).\n16          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndepart from that understanding to enact a standard of\nproof that would rise and fall with the facts of each\ncase. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened\nstandard of proof where the evidence before the jury var\nied from that before the PTO\u2014and thus to take the un\nusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard\nof proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf.\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 757 (1982)10\u2014we as\nsume it would have said so expressly.\n  To be sure, numerous courts of appeals in the years\npreceding the 1952 Act observed that the presumption of\nvalidity is \u201cweakened\u201d or \u201cdissipated\u201d in the circumstance\nthat the evidence in an infringement action was never\nconsidered by the PTO. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley\nPump Co., 191 F. 2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (\u201clargely dissi\npated\u201d); H. Schindler & Co. v. C.

Enterprise\nCleaning Co., 81 F. 2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (\u201cweakened\u201d).\nBut we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest\nthat a preponderance standard would apply in such cir\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from\n\nthe fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference\nwill often be a question without a clear answer.

In this respect, although we have no occasion to\nendorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury\ninstruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when\nrequested, most often should be given.

In either case, the jury may be instructed\nto evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially\nnew, and if so, to consider that fact when determining\nwhether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear\nand convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap\nids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563\u20131564 (CA Fed. 1993); see\nalso Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as\nAmicus Curiae 31\u201337.

Microsoft and\nits amici contend that the heightened standard of proof\ndampens innovation by unduly insulating \u201cbad\u201d patents\nfrom invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali\ndation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec\ntion to too many undeserving \u201cinventions.\u201d They claim\nthat inter partes reexamination proceedings before the\nPTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida\ntion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in\nsuch proceedings. They question the deference that the\nPTO\u2019s expert determinations warrant, in light of the\nagency\u2019s resources and procedures, which they deem in\nadequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard\nof proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.\n   For their part, i4i and its amici, including the United\nStates, contend that the heightened standard of proof\nproperly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury\noverturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.\nThey claim that the heightened standard of proof is an\nessential component of the patent \u201cbargain,\u201d see Bonito\nBoats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,\n150\u2013151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis\nclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent\nprotection. They disagree with the notion that the patent\nissuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that\nlimits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by\nCongress as to the appropriate degree of interference with\npatentees\u2019 reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that\njuries that are properly instructed as to the application of\nthe clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often\ndo, find an invalidity defense established.\n   We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara\ntive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,\nthe Federal Circuit has interpreted \u00a7282 as we do today.\nDuring this period, Congress has often amended \u00a7282, see,\ne.g., Pub. L. 104\u2013141, \u00a72, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98\u2013417,\n\u00a7203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)\nare aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the\nstandard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con\ngress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns\nabout \u201cbad\u201d patents, including by expanding the reexami\nnation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See\nOptional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of\n1999, 113 Stat. 1501A\u2013567, codified at 35 U. S. C. \u00a7311 et\nseq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in\n\u00a7282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7282 in place despite\nongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern\n20          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

Since then, it has allowed the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s correct interpretation of \u00a7282 to stand.

I write separately be\ncause, given the technical but important nature of the\ninvalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in\nthis area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of\nproof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423\n(1979). Thus a factfinder must use the \u201cclear and convinc\ning\u201d standard where there are disputes about, say, when a\nproduct was first sold or whether a prior art reference had\nbeen published.\n   Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon fac\ntual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as\ngiven. Do the given facts show that the product was pre\nviously \u201cin public use\u201d? 35 U. S. C. \u00a7102(b). Do they show\nthat the invention was \u201cnove[l]\u201d and that it was \u201cnon\nobvious\u201d? \u00a7\u00a7102, 103.

See,\ne.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1,\n17 (1966); Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc.,\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

S. 370 (1996).\n   Courts can help to keep the application of today\u2019s \u201cclear\nand convincing\u201d standard within its proper legal bounds\nby separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity\nclaim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific\ncircumstances that help the jury make the distinction or\nby using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear\nwhich specific factual findings underlie the jury\u2019s conclu\nsions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating\nthe facts (determined with help of the \u201cclear and convinc\ning\u201d standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in\nterpretation or application of the correct legal standard\n(without use of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard). By\npreventing the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard from roam\ning outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase\nthe likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re\nceive legal protection where none is due.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. C. \u00a7282; see\nante, at 7. \u201c[W]here Congress borrows terms of art,\u201d this\nCourt presumes that Congress \u201cknows and adopts the\ncluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word\n. . . and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\nmind.\u201d Morissette v.

But I do not think that the words \u201c[a] patent shall\nbe presumed valid\u201d so clearly conveyed a particular stan\ndard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute\na term of art. See, e.g., ante, at 12, n. 7 (\u201c[S]ome lower\ncourts doubted [the presumption\u2019s] wisdom or even pre\ntended it did not exist\u201d); Philip A. Hunt Co. v.

Therefore, I would not\nconclude that Congress\u2019 use of that phrase codified a stan\ndard of proof.\n  Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the Court.\nBecause \u00a7282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did\nnot alter the common-law rule. See ante, at 6 (\u201c[\u00a7282]\nincludes no express articulation of the standard of proof\u201d).\nFor that reason, I agree with the Court that the height\nened standard of proof set forth in Radio Corp. of Amer-\nica v.
