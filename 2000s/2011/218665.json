JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013382.      Argued April 20, 2011\u2014Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent Jicarilla Apache Nation\u2019s (Tribe) reservation contains\n  natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes adminis\n  tered by the Interior Department. Proceeds from these resources are\n  held by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe filed a\n  breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking\n  monetary damages for the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of\n  the Tribe\u2019s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161\u2013162a and\n  other laws. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production\n  of certain documents. The Government agreed to release some of the\n  documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the\n  attorney-client privilege. The CFC granted the motion in part, hold\n  ing that departmental communications relating to the management\n  of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d to the attorney-client\n  privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied to com\n  mon-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust\n  administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privi\n  lege against trust beneficiaries.\n     Denying the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus direct\n  ing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit\n  agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United\n  States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust\n  to justify applying the fiduciary exception. The appeals court held\n  that the United States cannot deny a tribe\u2019s request to discover com\n  munications between the Government and its attorneys based on the\n  attorney-client privilege when those communications concern man\n  agement of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that\n  it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those\n  communications.\n2        UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not\n apply to the general trust relationship between the United States\n and the Indian tribes. Pp. 5\u201324.\n    (a) The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and\n the nature of the Indian trust relationship. Pp. 5\u201314.\n      (1) Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal\n advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense\n in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of\n documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was\n sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust\n funds were used to pay the attorney. In the leading American case,\n Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, the\n Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that\n trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memo\n randum related to the trust\u2019s administration because: (1) the trustees\n had obtained the legal advice as \u201cmere representative[s]\u201d of the bene\n ficiaries, who were the \u201creal clients\u201d of the attorney, id., at 711\u2013712,\n and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the\n beneficiaries outweighed the trustees\u2019 interest in the attorney-client\n privilege, id., at 714. The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduci\n ary exception based on the same two criteria. Pp. 6\u20139.\n      (2) The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private\n trustee. While the United States\u2019 responsibilities with respect to the\n management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a pri\n vate trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The Government\u2019s\n trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by stat\n ute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation,\n 537 U. S. 488, 506 (Navajo I), and in fulfilling its statutory duties,\n the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its\n sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman\n v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437. Once federal law imposes fidu\n ciary obligations on the Government, the common law \u201ccould play a\n role,\u201d United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II);\n e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v.\n White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475\u2013476. But the ap\n plicable statutes and regulations control. When \u201cthe Tribe cannot\n identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\n that the Government violated . . . neither the Government\u2019s \u2018control\u2019\n over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.\u201d Na\n vajo II, supra, at ___. Pp. 9\u201314.\n    (b) The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in\n the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\n Pp. 14\u201323.\n      (1) In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711\u2013712. Applying these factors, the Court concludes\nthat the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere repre\nsentative\u201d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d for whom\nthat advice is intended. See id., at 711. Here, the Government at\ntorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the\nTribe. The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capac\nity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Because its\nsovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries\u2019 private interests,\nthe Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, ca\npacity. Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal\nconcerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication\u2019s\npurpose. In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may\nneed to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental\nand conservation obligations. It may also face conflicting duties to\ndifferent tribes or individual Indians. It may seek the advice of coun\nsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help de\ntermine whether there are conflicting interests at all. For the attor\nney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See, e.g.,\nJaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18. The Government will not always\nbe able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests,\nespecially before receiving counsel\u2019s advice. If the Government were\nrequired to identify the specific interests it considered in each com\nmunication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be\nsubstantially compromised. See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 393. Pp. 15\u201320.\n     (2) The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception\nproperly applied here because of the fiduciary\u2019s duty to disclose all\ntrust-management-related information to the beneficiary. The Gov\nernment, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure\nobligations as a private trustee. In this case, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7162a(d) de\nlineates the Government\u2019s \u201ctrust responsibilities.\u201d It identifies the\nInterior Secretary\u2019s obligation to supply tribal account holders \u201cwith\nperiodic statements of their account performance\u201d and to make\n\u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d their account balances, \u00a7162a(d)(5). The\nSecretary has complied with these requirements in regulations man\ndating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly state\nment of performance. 25 CFR pt. 115.8. The common law of trusts\ndoes not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regula\ntions. A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibili\nties as nonexhaustive, see \u00a7162a(d), cannot be read to include a gen\n4          UNITED STATES v.

Lanier Collection Riggs Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S.\n    825, 837. By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue\n    are classed \u201cthe property of the United States\u201d while other records\n    are \u201cthe property of the tribe.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a7115.1000.

The common law, however, has recognized an excep\ntion to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice\nrelated to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases,\ncourts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney\nclient communications from the beneficiary of the trust.\n   In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception\napplies to the general trust relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does\nnot. Although the Government\u2019s responsibilities with re\nspect to the management of funds belonging to Indian\ntribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee,\nthis analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations\nof the United States to the Indian tribes are established\nand governed by statute rather than the common law, and\nin fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not\nas a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest\nin the execution of federal law.

JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nest in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject\nto a general common-law duty of disclosure\u2014do not apply\nin this context.\n                               I\n   The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000\nacre reservation in northern New Mexico that was estab\nlished by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains\ntimber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are devel\noped pursuant to statutes administered by the Depart\nment of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural\nresources are held by the United States in trust for the\nTribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other\nstatutes.\n   In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act,\n\u00a71505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the Government that are founded on the Constitu\ntion, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The\ncomplaint seeks monetary damages for the Government\u2019s\nalleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the\nTribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated\nvarious laws, including 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161a and 162a, that\ngovern the management of funds held in trust for Indian\ntribes. See 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 3 (2009).\n   From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government\nand the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu\ntion in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the\nGovernment turned over thousands of documents but\nwithheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected\nby the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product\ndoctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.\n   In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was re\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the\ncase into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.\nThe first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government\u2019s\nmanagement of the Tribe\u2019s trust accounts from 1972 to\n1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Gov\nernment failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among\nother things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to\nmaximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily\nin short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust\nfunds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe\nmoved to compel the Government to produce the 226\nwithheld documents. In response, the Government agreed\nto withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege\nand, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the\nGovernment continued to assert the attorney-client privi\nlege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to\nthe remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those\ndocuments in camera and classified them into five cate\ngories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust ad\nministration sent by personnel at the Department of the\nInterior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal\naffairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the\nSolicitor\u2019s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treas-\nury Departments, (3) documents generated under con\ntracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Inte\nrior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and\n(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other\ncategories.\n  The CFC granted the Tribe\u2019s motion to compel in part.\nThe CFC held that communications relating to the man\nagement of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d\nto the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception,\nwhich courts have applied in the context of common-law\ntrusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the\nexecution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from assert\ning the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of\n4           UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes is suffi\nciently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that\nthe exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held,\nthe United States may not shield from the Tribe commu\nnications with attorneys relating to trust matters.\n   The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in\nthe first two categories because those documents \u201cinvolve\nmatters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,\neither directly or indirectly implicating the investments\nthat benefit Jicarilla\u201d and contain \u201clegal advice relating to\ntrust administration.\u201d Id., at 14\u201315. The CFC allowed\nthe Government to withhold most of the documents in the\nremaining categories as attorney work product,1 but the\ncourt identified some individual documents that it deter\nmined were also subject to the fiduciary exception. Id., at\n18\u201319.\n   The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the\ndocuments by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC\nto vacate its production order. The Court of Appeals de\nnied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly\napplied the fiduciary exception. The court held that \u201cthe\nUnited States cannot deny an Indian tribe\u2019s request to\ndiscover communications between the United States and\nits attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when\nthose communications concern management of an Indian\ntrust and the United States has not claimed that the\ngovernment or its attorneys considered a specific com\npeting interest in those communications.\u201d In re United\nStates, 590 F. 3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009). In qualifying\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        CFC held that there is no fiduciary exception to the work\nproduct doctrine. 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 12 (2009). The Court of Appeals did not\naddress that issue, In re United States, 590 F. 3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed.\n2009), and it is not before us.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

But because\nthe Government had not alleged that the legal advice in\nthis case related to such conflicting interests, the court\nreserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might\napply in that situation. The court rejected the Govern\nment\u2019s argument that, because its duties to the Indian\ntribes were governed by statute rather than the common\nlaw, it had no general duty of disclosure that would over\nride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed\nwith the Government\u2019s contention that a case-by-case\napproach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredict\nable and would impair the Government\u2019s ability to obtain\nconfidential legal advice.\n   We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2011),2 and now\nreverse and remand for further proceedings.\n                              II\n   The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that evidentiary\nprivileges \u201cshall be governed by the principles of the com\nmon law . . . in the light of reason and experience.\u201d Fed.\nRule Evid. 501.

Our decision\nmay still provide effective relief by preventing further disclosure and by\nexcluding the evidence from trial. See Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.\nCarpenter, 558 U.

S., at\n389; Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U. S. 464, 470 (1888).\n   The objectives of the attorney-client privilege apply to\ngovernmental clients. \u201cThe privilege aids government en\ntities and employees in obtaining legal advice founded on\na complete and accurate factual picture.\u201d 1 Restatement\n(Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a774, Comment b,\npp. 573\u2013574 (1998). Unless applicable law provides other\nwise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client\nprivilege in civil litigation to protect confidential commu\nnications between Government officials and Government\nattorneys. Id., at 574 (\u201c[G]overnmental agencies and\nemployees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental\ncounterparts\u201d). The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust\nrelationship between the Government and the Tribe,\ndocuments that would otherwise be privileged must be\ndisclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds\nof the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\ntribes.\n                              A\n  English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as\na principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was\nthat when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the\nadministration of the trust, and not for the trustee\u2019s own\ndefense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the\nproduction of documents related to that advice.

D. 609 (1883), but it did not appear in this country\nuntil the following century. American courts seem first\nto have expressed skepticism. See In re Prudence-Bonds\nCorp., 76 F. Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948) (declining to\napply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a bondhold\ning corporation because of the \u201cimportant right of such a\ncorporate trustee . . . to seek legal advice and nevertheless\nact in accordance with its own judgment\u201d). By the 1970\u2019s,\nhowever, American courts began to adopt the English\ncommon-law rule. See Garner v. Wolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d\n1093, 1103\u20131104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon\na showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d to discover legal advice given to\ncorporate management).3\n  The leading American case on the fiduciary exception is\nRiggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d\n709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case, the beneficiaries of a\ntrust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the\nestate for alleged breaches of trust. The beneficiaries\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Today, \u201c[c]ourts differ on whether the [attorney-client] privilege is\n\navailable for communications between the trustee and counsel regard\ning the administration of the trust.\u201d A. Newman, G. Bogert &\nG. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7962, p. 68 (3d ed. 2010) (here\ninafter Bogert). Some state courts have altogether rejected the notion\nthat the attorney-client privilege is subject to a fiduciary exception.\nSee, e.g., Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S. W. 2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (\u201cThe\nattorney-client privilege serves the same important purpose in the\ntrustee-attorney relationship as it does in other attorney-client rela\ntionships\u201d); Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Ct., 22 Cal. 4th 201, 208\u2013209,\n990 P. 2d 591, 595 (2000) (\u201c[T]he attorney for the trustee of a trust is\nnot, by virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the beneficiaries\nof the trust\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Neither party before\nthis Court disputes the existence of a common-law fiduciary exception,\nhowever, so in deciding this case we assume such an exception exists.\n8       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memoran\ndum related to the administration of the trust that the\ntrustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege.\nThe Delaware Chancery Court, observing that \u201cAmerican\ncase law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee\nin this context,\u201d looked to the English cases. Id., at 712.\nApplying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court\nheld that the memorandum was discoverable. It identified\ntwo reasons for applying the exception.\n   First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the\nlegal advice as \u201cmere representative[s]\u201d of the beneficiar\nies because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in\nthe beneficiaries\u2019 interest when administering the trust.\nIbid. For that reason, the beneficiaries were the \u201creal\nclients\u201d of the attorney who had advised the trustee on\ntrust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client\nprivilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather\nthan the trustees. Id., at 711\u2013712. The court based its\n\u201creal client\u201d determination on several factors: (1) when the\nadvice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the\ntrustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore\nthere was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in\na personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court\nsaw no indication that the memorandum was intended for\nany purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the\nlaw firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the ad\nvice was obtained at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense was not\nonly a \u201csignificant factor\u201d entitling the beneficiaries to see\nthe document but also \u201ca strong indication of precisely\nwho the real clients were.\u201d Id., at 712. The court distin\nguished between \u201clegal advice procured at the trustee\u2019s\nown expense and for his own protection,\u201d which would\nremain privileged, \u201cand the situation where the trust itself\nis assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where inter\nests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.\u201d Ibid. In\nthe latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu\nnications from the beneficiaries.\n  Second, the court concluded that the trustees\u2019 fiduciary\nduty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi\nciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client\nprivilege. \u201cThe policy of preserving the full disclosure\nnecessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,\u201d the court\nexplained, \u201cis here ultimately more important than the\nprotection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for\nthe trust.\u201d Id., at 714. Because more information helped\nthe beneficiaries to police the trustees\u2019 management of the\ntrust, disclosure was, in the court\u2019s judgment, \u201ca weight\nier public policy than the preservation of confidential\nattorney-client communications.\u201d Ibid.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex\nception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re\nLong Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);\nWachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233\u2013234 (CA3\n2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,\n2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);\nWildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5\n1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265\u2013266\n(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had\na federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the\nUnited States as trustee for the Indian tribes.\n                               B\n  In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the\nCourt of Appeals analogized the Government to a private\ntrustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy\nin limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean\nthe Government resembles a private trustee in every\nrespect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted\nthat the relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes is distinctive, \u201cdifferent from that existing\n10       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween individuals whether dealing at arm\u2019s length, as\ntrustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise.\u201d Klamath and\nMoadoc Tribes v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254 (1935)\n(emphasis added). \u201cThe general relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a\nprivate trust relationship.\u201d Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.\nUnited States, 21 Cl. Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (emphasis added).\n   The Government, of course, is not a private trustee.\nThough the relevant statutes denominate the relationship\nbetween the Government and the Indians a \u201ctrust,\u201d see,\ne.g., 25 U. S. C. \u00a7162a, that trust is defined and governed\nby statutes rather than the common law. See United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (2003)\n(Navajo I) (\u201c[T]he analysis must train on specific rights\ncreating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre\nscriptions\u201d). As we have recognized in prior cases, Con\ngress may style its relations with the Indians a \u201ctrust\u201d\nwithout assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private\ntrustee, creating a trust relationship that is \u201climited\u201d or\n\u201cbare\u201d compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law. United States v. Mitchell, 445\nU. S. 535, 542 (1980) (Mitchell I); Mitchell II, supra, at\n224.4\n   The difference between a private common-law trust and\nthe statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position\nof the Government as sovereign. The distinction between\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d against the Government and \u201cprivate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 \u201cThere are a number of widely varying relationships which more or\n\nless closely resemble trusts, but which are not trusts, although the term\n\u2018trust\u2019 is sometimes used loosely to cover such relationships. It is\nimportant to differentiate trusts from these other relationships, since\nmany of the rules applicable to trusts are not applicable to them.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a74, Introductory Note, p. 15 (1957)\n(hereinafter Restatement 2d); see also Begay v. United States, 16 Cl. Ct.\n107, 127, n. 17 (1987) (\u201c[T]he provisions relating to private trustees and\nfiduciaries, while useful as analogies, cannot be regarded as finally\ndispositive in a government-Indian trustee-fiduciary relationship\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The\nGovernment consents to be liable to private parties \u201cand\nmay yield this consent upon such terms and under such\nrestrictions as it may think just.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v.\nHoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 283\n(1856). This creates an important distinction \u201cbetween\ncases of private right and those which arise between the\nGovernment and persons subject to its authority in con\nnection with the performance of the constitutional func\ntions of the executive or legislative departments.\u201d Crowell\nv. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).\n   Throughout the history of the Indian trust relationship,\nwe have recognized that the organization and manage\nment of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the\nplenary authority of Congress. See Merrion v. Jicarilla\nApache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 169, n. 18 (1982) (\u201cThe\nUnited States retains plenary authority to divest the\ntribes of any attributes of sovereignty\u201d); United States v.\nWheeler, 435 U.

S. 373, 391 (1921) (\u201cCongress has plenary authority\nover the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full\npower to legislate concerning their tribal property\u201d); Lone\nWolf v.

Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294, 308 (1902)\n(\u201cThe power existing in Congress to administer upon and\nguard the tribal property, and the power being political\nand administrative in its nature, the manner of its exer\ncise is a question within the province of the legislative\nbranch to determine, and is not one for the courts\u201d); see\nalso United States v. Candelaria, 271 U. S. 432, 439\n12     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1926); Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315\n(1911).\n  Because the Indian trust relationship represents an\nexercise of that authority, we have explained that the\nGovernment \u201chas a real and direct interest\u201d in the guardi\nanship it exercises over the Indian tribes; \u201cthe interest is\none which is vested in it as a sovereign.\u201d United States v.\nMinnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so\nbecause the Government has often structured the trust\nrelationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while\ntrust administration \u201crelat[es] to the welfare of the Indi\nans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress\nhas prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis\ntinctly an interest of the United States.\u201d Heckman v.\nUnited States, 224 U. S. 413, 437 (1912); see also Cande\nlaria, supra, at 443\u2013444.\n  In Heckman, the Government brought suit to cancel\ncertain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an\nIndian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions\non alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained\nthat the Government brought suit as the representative of\nthe very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to\ncancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the\njudgment. 224 U. S., at 445\u2013446. But while it was for\nmally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact\nasserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of\nIndian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter\nvening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to\nthat of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was\npossible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role\nover the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the\ngoverning authority enforcing statutory law.\n  We do not question \u201cthe undisputed existence of a gen\neral trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian people.\u201d Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The Gov\nernment, following \u201ca humane and self imposed policy . . .\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

United\nStates, 316 U. S. 286, 296\u2013297 (1942), obligations \u201cto the\nfulfillment of which the national honor has been commit\nted,\u201d Heckman, supra, at 437. Congress has expressed\nthis policy in a series of statutes that have defined and\nredefined the trust relationship between the United States\nand the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab\nlished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow\npurpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress in\ntended the United States to hold land \u201c \u2018in trust\u2019 \u201d under\nthe General Allotment Act \u201csimply because it wished to\nprevent alienation of the land and to ensure that allottees\nwould be immune from state taxation\u201d); Navajo I, 537\nU.

Mitchell II, supra, at\n226; see also United States v. White Mountain Apache\nTribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475 (2003). Once federal law imposes\nsuch duties, the common law \u201ccould play a role.\u201d United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Navajo\nII) (slip op., at 14). We have looked to common-law princi\nples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to deter\nmine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed. See\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe, supra, at 475\u2013476. But the\napplicable statutes and regulations \u201cestablish [the] fiduci\nary relationship and define the contours of the United\nStates\u2019 fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Mitchell II, supra, at\n224. When \u201cthe Tribe cannot identify a specific, applica\nble, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Govern\nment violated, . . . neither the Government\u2019s \u2018control\u2019 over\n[Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.\u201d\n14       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nNavajo II, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).5 The Government\nassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.6\n   Over the years, we have described the federal relation\nship with the Indian tribes using various formulations.\nThe Indian tribes have been called \u201cdomestic dependent\nnations,\u201d Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831),\nunder the \u201ctutelage\u201d of the United States, Heckman, su\npra, at 444, and subject to \u201cthe exercise of the Govern\nment\u2019s guardianship over . . . their affairs,\u201d United States\nv. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 48 (1913). These concepts do\nnot necessarily correspond to a common-law trust rela\ntionship. See, e.g., Restatement 2d, \u00a77 (\u201cA guardianship is\nnot a trust\u201d). That is because Congress has chosen to\nstructure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.\nWe will apply common-law trust principles where Con\ngress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that\nreason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by stat\nute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged\ninformation from the Government against its wishes.\n                             III\n  In this case, the Tribe\u2019s claim arises from 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7161\u2013162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, \u00a74001 et seq. These pro\nvisions define \u201cthe trust responsibilities of the United\nStates\u201d with respect to tribal funds. \u00a7162a(d). The Court\nof Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between\nthe United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these\nand other statutes, is \u201csufficiently similar to a private\ntrust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.\u201d 590\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Thus, the dissent\u2019s reliance on the Government\u2019s \u201cmanagerial con\n\ntrol,\u201d post, at 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), is misplaced.\n  6 Cf. Restatement 2d, \u00a725, Comment a (\u201c[A]lthough the settlor has\n\ncalled the transaction a trust[,] no trust is created unless he manifests\nan intention to impose duties which are enforceable in the courts\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

We disagree.\n  As we have discussed, the Government exercises its\ncarefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign\ncapacity to implement national policy respecting the In\ndian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary\nexception\u2014the beneficiary\u2019s status as the \u201creal client\u201d and\nthe trustee\u2019s common-law duty to disclose information\nabout the trust\u2014are notably absent in the trust relation\nship Congress has established between the United States\nand the Tribe.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception\nbased on its determination that the Tribe rather than\nthe Government was the \u201creal client\u201d with respect to the\nGovernment attorneys\u2019 advice. Ibid. In cases applying the\nfiduciary exception, courts identify the \u201creal client\u201d based\non whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,\nwhether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per\nsonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the\nadvice could have been intended for any purpose other\nthan to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711\u2013712.\nApplying these factors, we conclude that the United States\ndoes not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere representative\u201d of\nthe Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d for whom that\nadvice is intended. See ibid.\n   Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con\ngressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts\nlook to the source of funds as a \u201cstrong indicator of pre\ncisely who the real clients were\u201d and a \u201csignificant factor\u201d\nin determining who ought to have access to the legal\nadvice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that\nthe attorneys were paid by the Government for advice\nregarding the Government\u2019s statutory obligations.\n   The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov\nernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthan as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt\nedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from\nthe Government\u2019s management of tribal trusts. That\nintention represents \u201ca humane and self imposed policy\u201d\nbased on felt \u201cmoral obligations.\u201d Seminole Nation, 316\nU. S., at 296\u2013297. This statutory purpose does not imply a\nfull common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, \u00a725,\nComment b (\u201cNo trust is created if the settlor manifests an\nintention to impose merely a moral obligation\u201d). Congress\nmakes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign\ngoverning authority, and the implementation of federal\npolicy remains \u201cdistinctly an interest of the United\nStates.\u201d Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that\n\u201cthe United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active\ninterest\u201d in the disposition of Indian assets because the\nterms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the\nUnited States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469\n(1907).\n   In some prior cases, we have found that the Government\nhad established the trust relationship in order to impose\nits own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,\nat 544 (Congress \u201cintended that the United States \u2018hold\nthe land . . . in trust\u2019 . . . because it wished to prevent\nalienation of the land\u201d). In other cases, the Government\nhas invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter\nference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min\nnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande\nlaria, 271 U. S., at 442\u2013444; United States v. Kagama, 118\nU. S. 375, 382\u2013384 (1886).

In this way, Con\ngress has designed the trust relationship to serve the\ninterests of the United States as well as to benefit the\nIndian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432,\n443 (1903) (trust relationship \u201c \u2018authorizes the adoption on\nthe part of the United States of such policy as their own\npublic interests may dictate\u2019 \u201d (quoting Choctaw Nation v.\nUnited States, 119 U. S. 1, 28 (1886))).8\n  We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that \u201c[t]he\ngovernment and its officials who obtained the advice have\nno stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their\ntrustee role,\u201d Brief for Respondent 9, or that \u201cthe United\nStates\u2019 interests in trust administration were identical to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid\n\nered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For\nexample, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was\n\u201ca comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in\nAmerican society.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a71.04,\np. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the\nassimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually\nowned allotments. The federal policy aimed \u201cto substitute a new in\ndividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.\u201d Id., at 79.\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift\naway \u201cfrom assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect\nfor traditional aspects of Indian culture.\u201d Cohen \u00a71.05, at 84. The Act\nprohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,\n88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.\n4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,\nand social programs for themselves. Cohen \u00a71.07, at 103. This\nstrengthened self-government supported Congress\u2019 decision to author\nize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control\nand place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund\nManagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242\u20134244; see 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74021\u20134029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the\nIndian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to\nthe trust relationship\u2014forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining\nalienation\u2014does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common\nlaw trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and\nadministered as an instrument of federal policy.\n18     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,\u201d Brief\nfor National Congress of American Indians et al. as Amici\nCuriae 5. The United States has a sovereign interest in\nthe administration of Indian trusts distinct from the pri\nvate interests of those who may benefit from its admini\nstration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the\nground that \u201cmanagement does not manage for itself.\u201d\nGarner, 430 F. 2d, at 1101; Wachtel, 482 F. 3d, at 232\n(\u201c[O]f central importance in both Garner and Riggs was\nthe fiduciary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the\nlegal advice obtained\u201d). But the Government is never in\nthat position. While one purpose of the Indian trust rela\ntionship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its\nown independent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy. For that reason, when the Government\nseeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal\ntrusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship re\nlated to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal\nlaw. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in\na \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than a fiduciary capacity. See Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711.\n   Moreover, the Government has too many competing\nlegal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the\npurpose of each communication. When \u201cmultiple inter\nests\u201d are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence\nbetween the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee\nbreaks down. Id., at 714. That principle applies with\nparticular force to the Government. Because of the multi\nple interests it must represent, \u201cthe Government cannot\nfollow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who\nwould breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by\nrepresenting potentially conflicting interests without the\nbeneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.\n110, 128 (1983).\n   As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Government\nmay be obliged \u201cto balance competing interests\u201d when it\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadministers a tribal trust. 590 F. 3d, at 1315. The Gov\nernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,\nsuch as the environmental and conservation obligations\nthat the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314\u2013\n1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga\ntions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,\nNance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal\nGovernment has \u201cconflicting fiduciary responsibilities\u201d to\nthe Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley\nTribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (\u201cNo\ntrust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain\ntiff here at the expense of other Indians\u201d). Within the\nbounds of its \u201cgeneral trust relationship\u201d with the Indian\npeople, we have recognized that the Government has\n\u201cdiscretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub\ngroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all\nIndians nationwide.\u201d Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195\n(1993); see also ibid. (\u201cFederal Government \u2018does have a\nfiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary\nobligation that is owed to all Indian tribes\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nHoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we\nhave seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes\nto dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of\nthose for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov\nernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in\nbalancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of\nconsulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict\ning interests are at stake.\n   The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov\nernment\u2019s multiple obligations by suggesting that the\nGovernment may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it\nidentifies \u201ca specific competing interest\u201d that was consid\nered in the particular communications it seeks to with\nhold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the\nGovernment must consider are too pervasive for such a\ncase-by-case approach to be workable.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be\neffective, it must be predictable. See Jaffee v. Redmond,\n518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996); Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the\nGovernment were required to identify the specific inter\nests it considered in each communication, its ability to\nreceive confidential legal advice would be substantially\ncompromised. The Government will not always be able to\npredict what considerations qualify as a \u201cspecific compet\ning interest,\u201d especially in advance of receiving counsel\u2019s\nadvice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the consid\nerations contained in each communication with counsel\nwould render its attorney-client privilege \u201clittle better\nthan no privilege at all.\u201d Ibid.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary excep\ntion properly applied to the Government because \u201cthe\nfiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to\ntrust management to the beneficiary.\u201d 590 F. 3d, at 1312.\nIn general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust\nmust produce trust-related information to the beneficiary\non a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes\nlimited and may be modified by the settlor. Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts \u00a782 (2005) (hereinafter Restatement 3d);\nBogert \u00a7\u00a7962, 965.9 The fiduciary exception applies where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly\n\nanalogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust. A\nrevocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to\nthe beneficiary. \u201c[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may\nrevoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.\u201d\nBogert \u00a7962, at 25, \u00a7964; Restatement 3d, \u00a774, Comment e, at 31\n(\u201c[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or account\nings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the\ntrust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor\nor in the terms of the trust or a statute\u201d). In many respects, Indian\ntrusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has\nacted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthis duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privi\nlege. United States v. Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9\n1999) (\u201c[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle\u201d).\n  The United States, however, does not have the same\ncommon-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.\nAs we have previously said, common-law principles are\nrelevant only when applied to a \u201cspecific, applicable, trust\ncreating statute or regulation.\u201d Navajo II, 556 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7162a(d), which delineates \u201ctrust responsibilities\nof the United States\u201d that the Secretary of the Interior\nmust discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include\na provision identifying the Secretary\u2019s obligation to pro\nvide specific information to tribal account holders: The\nSecretary must \u201csuppl[y] account holders with periodic\nstatements of their account performance\u201d and must make\n\u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d the \u201cbalances of their account.\u201d\n\u00a7162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re\nquirements by adopting regulations that instruct the\nOffice of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe\nwith a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR\n\u00a7115.801 (2010), that identifies \u201cthe source, type, and\nstatus of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust\naccount; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;\nreceipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal\nance of the quarterly statement period,\u201d \u00a7115.803. Tribes\nmay request more frequent statements or further \u201cinfor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal\nproperty interests. See Winton v. Amos, 255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (\u201cIt is\nthoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the\nIndians . . . and full power to legislate concerning their tribal prop\nerty\u201d); Cohen \u00a75.02[4], at 401\u2013403. The Government has not advanced\nthe argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust,\nand the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.\n22       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmation about account transactions and balances.\u201d\n\u00a7115.802.\n   The common law of trusts does not override the specific\ntrust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\nThose provisions define the Government\u2019s disclosure ob\nligation to the Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for\nRespondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust\nresponsibilities as nonexhaustive. See \u00a7162a(d) (trust\nresponsibilities \u201care not limited to\u201d those enumerated).\nThe Government replies that this clause \u201cis best read to\nrefer to other statutory and regulatory requirements\u201d\nrather than to common-law duties. Brief for United States\n38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the\nclause to include a general common-law duty to disclose\nall information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts. When Congress provides specific statutory obliga\ntions, we will not read a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision to impose\ngeneral obligations that would include those specifically\nenumerated. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n473 U. S. 134, 141\u2013142 (1985). \u201cAs our cases have noted\nin the past, we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a\ncongressional enactment which renders superfluous an\nother portion of that same law.\u201d Mackey v. Lanier Collec\ntion Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988).\nReading the statute to incorporate the full duties of a\nprivate, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress\u2019\nspecification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Our reading of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7162a(d) receives additional support from\n\nanother statute in which Congress expressed its understanding that\nthe Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold\ninformation related to trust property from Indian tribes. The Indian\nClaims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims\nthat the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States. If the\nSecretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was\nrequired to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon\ntheir request, to provide \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or\nevidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at\nissue in this case are classed \u201cthe property of the United\nStates\u201d while other records are \u201cthe property of the tribe.\u201d\n25 CFR \u00a7115.1000 (2010); see also \u00a7\u00a715.502, 162.111,\n166.1000. Just as the source of the funds used to pay for\nlegal advice is highly relevant in identifying the \u201creal\nclient\u201d for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider\nownership of the resulting records to be a significant\nfactor in deciding who \u201cought to have access to the docu\nment.\u201d See Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. In this case, that\nprivilege belongs to the United States.11\n\n                         *    *     *\n   Courts and commentators have long recognized that\n\u201c[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can properly govern\nthe unique relationship of tribes and the federal govern\nment.\u201d Cohen \u00a75.02[2], at 434\u2013435. The fiduciary excep\ntion to the attorney-client privilege ranks among those\naspects inapplicable to the Government\u2019s administration\nof Indian trusts. The Court of Appeals denied the Gov\nernment\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus based on its\nerroneous view to the contrary. We leave it for that court\nto determine whether the standards for granting the writ\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nclaim.\u201d Id., at 1978. That Congress authorized the withholding of\ninformation on grounds of privilege makes us doubt that Congress\nunderstood the Government\u2019s trust obligations to override so basic a\nprivilege as that between attorney and client.\n  11 The dissent tells us that applying the fiduciary exception is even\n\nmore important against the Government than against a private trustee\nbecause of a \u201chistory of governmental mismanagement.\u201d Post, at 21.\nWhile it is not necessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes\nare not required to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a74022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the United\nStates); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B). If the Tribe wishes to have its funds\nmanaged by a \u201cconventional fiduciary,\u201d post, at 10, it may seek to do so.\n24       UNITED STATES v.

The interests of the Federal Government as\ntrustee and the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Nation) as bene\nficiary are thus entirely aligned in the context of Indian\ntrust fund management. Where, as here, the governing\nstatutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary\nrelationship, the Government\u2019s duties include fiduciary\nobligations derived from common-law trust principles.\nBecause the common-law rationales for the fiduciary\nexception fully support its application in this context, I\nwould hold that the Government may not rely on the\nattorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation\ncommunications between the Government and its attor\nneys relating to trust fund management.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to the contrary rests on false fac\ntual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other\nIndian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pend\ning cases seeking relief for the Government\u2019s alleged\nmismanagement of their trust funds. But perhaps more\ntroubling is the majority\u2019s disregard of our settled prece\ndent that looks to common-law trust principles to define\nthe scope of the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nIndian tribes. Indeed, aspects of the majority\u2019s opinion\nsuggest that common-law principles have little or no re\nlevance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court\nrejected long ago. Although today\u2019s holding pertains only\nto a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the\nmajority\u2019s opinion may well be a further dilution of the\nGovernment\u2019s fiduciary obligations that will have broader\nnegative repercussions for the relationship between the\nUnited States and Indian tribes.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part\nthat \u201cthe privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be gov\nerned by the principles of the common law as they may be\ninterpreted by the courts of the United States in the light\nof reason and experience.\u201d Rule 501 \u201cwas adopted pre\ncisely because Congress wished to leave privilege ques\ntions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.\u201d\nUnited States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792, 804,\nn. 25 (1984).\n   As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege \u201cis to encourage full and frank communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote\nbroader public interests in the observance of law and\nadministration of justice.\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States,\n449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981).

(collecting cases). The fiduciary excep\ntion is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both\nfederal and state courts,1 and has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts, including in litigation involving com\nmon-law trusts, see, e.g., Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington,\nD. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes\nbetween corporations and shareholders, see, e.g., Garner v.\nWolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d 1093 (CA5 1970), and ERISA\nenforcement actions, see, e.g., United States v. Doe, 162\nF. 3d 554 (CA9 1999).\n   The majority correctly identifies the two rationales\ncourts have articulated for applying the fiduciary excep\ntion, ante, at 8\u20139, but its description of those rationales\nomits a number of important points. With regard to the\nfirst rationale, courts have characterized the trust benefi\nciary as the \u201creal client\u201d of legal advice relating to trust\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Solis v.

See, e.g., United States v.\nMett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (\u201c \u2018[A]s a represen\ntative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is admin\nistering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that\nhe is personally being served\u2019 \u201d (quoting United States v.\nEvans, 796 F. 2d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) (per curiam)));\nRiggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713 (same). The majority places\nheavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal\nadvice, see ante, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who\npays for the legal advice, although \u201cpotentially relevant,\u201d\n\u201cis not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a782, Comment f, p. 188\n(2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Instead, the\nlynchpin of the \u201creal client\u201d inquiry is the identity of the\nultimate beneficiary of the legal advice. See Wachtel, 482\nF. 3d, at 232 (\u201c[O]f central importance . . . [i]s the fiduci\nary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal\nadvice obtained\u201d). If the advice was rendered for the\nbenefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any\npersonal capacity, the \u201creal client\u201d of the advice is the\nbeneficiary.\n   As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception\u2014\nrooted in the trustee\u2019s fiduciary duty to disclose all infor\nmation related to trust management\u2014the majority glosses\nover the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed \u201cto\nenable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of\ntrust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the\ntrust.\u201d Third Restatement \u00a782, Comment a(2), at 184. As\nthe leading American case on the fiduciary exception\nexplains, \u201c[i]n order for the beneficiaries to hold the trus\ntee to the proper standards of care and honesty and pro\ncure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled,\ntheir knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Courts\njustifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale\nhave thus concluded that \u201c[t]he policy of preserving the\nfull disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary rela\ntionship is . . . ultimately more important than the pro\ntection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for the\ntrust.\u201d Id., at 714; see Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063 (under this\nrationale, \u201cthe fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle\u201d). The majority fails to\nappreciate the important oversight and accountability\ninterests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex\nception, or explain why they operate with any less force in\nthe Indian trust context.\n                              B\n   The question in this case is whether the fiduciary excep\ntion applies in the Indian trust context such that the\nGovernment may not rely on the attorney-client privilege\nto withhold from the Nation communications between the\nGovernment and its attorneys relating to the administra\ntion of the Nation\u2019s trust fund accounts. Answering that\nquestion requires a proper understanding of the nature of\nthe Government\u2019s trust relationship with Indian tribes,\nparticularly with regard to its management of Indian trust\nfunds.\n   Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a\ngeneral trust relationship between the United States and\nIndian tribes. See Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17\n(1831) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions over the past cen\ntury have repeatedly reaffirmed this \u201cdistinctive obliga\ntion of trust incumbent upon the Government\u201d in its deal\nings with Indians. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316\nU. S. 286, 296 (1942); see United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU.

Congress, too, has recognized the general trust\nrelationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\nIndeed, \u201c[n]early every piece of modern legislation dealing\nwith Indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the\ntrust relationship between tribes and the federal govern\nment.\u201d F.

Mitchell\nII, 463 U. S., at 224. The Nation\u2019s claims as relevant in\nthis case concern the Government\u2019s alleged mismanage\nment of its tribal trust fund accounts. See ante, at 3.\n   The system of trusteeship and federal management of\nIndian funds originated with congressional enactments in\nthe 19th century directing the Government to hold and\nmanage Indian tribal funds in trust. See, e.g., Act of June\n9, 1837, 5 Stat. 135; see also Misplaced Trust: The Bureau\nof Indian Affairs\u2019 Mismanagement of the Indian Trust\nFund, H. R. Rep.

The\nmajority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed fac\ntual and legal premises.\n                             A\n   When the Government seeks legal advice from a gov\nernment attorney on matters relating to the management\nof the Nation\u2019s trust funds, the \u201creal client\u201d of that advice\nfor purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not\nthe Government. The majority\u2019s rejection of that conclu\nsion is premised on its erroneous view that the Govern\nment, in managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds, \u201chas its own\nindependent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy\u201d that diverges from the interest of the Na\ntion as beneficiary. Ante, at 18; see also ante, at 1\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter,\nthe Government has sovereign interests in managing\nIndian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194\n(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern\nment\u2019s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered\nand administered the trust relationship \u201cas an instrument\nof federal policy.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in\n10      UNITED STATES v.

As explained above, Congress has enacted an\nextensive network of statutes regulating the Government\u2019s\nmanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu\ntory framework establishes a \u201cconventional fiduciary re\nlationship\u201d in the context of Indian trust fund admini\nstration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U.

In other words, any\nuniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in\nother contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes\ndoes not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund\nadministration. It naturally follows, then, that when the\nGovernment seeks legal advice from government attorneys\nrelating to the management of the Nation\u2019s trust funds,\nthe \u201creal client\u201d of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary\nexception is the Nation, not the Government.\n  This conclusion holds true even though government\nattorneys are \u201cpaid out of congressional appropriations\nat no cost to the [Nation].\u201d Ante, at 15. As noted above,\nalthough the source of funding for legal advice may be\nrelevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the\nlegal advice was rendered. See supra, at 4. And, for all\nthe emphasis the majority places on the funding source\nhere, see ante, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that\nthe fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended\nfederal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government\nattorneys out of their own trust funds.6\n  The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of\nthe United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in\nsome contexts, that \u201cequivalence\u201d \u201cbreaks down\u201d when\nthere are \u201cmultiple interests\u201d involved in a trust relation\nship.

In such circumstances, \u201ca trustee\u2014and\nultimately a court\u2014may need to provide some response\nthat offers a compromise between the confidentiality or\nprivacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 In Nevada, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation\n\ninvolving water rights even though it was also required by statute to\nrepresent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U. S., at\n128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior\n\u201cboth the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the\ncommencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation\nlands\u201d). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that \u201cit\nis simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform\nits obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has\nobliged it to represent other interests as well.\u201d Ibid. We thus observed\nin the context of that case that \u201cthe Government cannot follow the\nfastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties\nto his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting\ninterests without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d Ibid. We expressly distin\nguished the context \u201cwhere only a relationship between the Govern\nment and the tribe is involved.\u201d Id., at 142. In that context, we ac\nknowledged that \u201cthe law respecting obligations between a trustee and\na beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects\nadequately describe the duty of the United States.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The majority\nprovides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduci\nary exception in the Indian trust context could not simi\nlarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes\ninto account any unique governmental interests that bear\non the application of the fiduciary exception in any given\ncircumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (au\nthorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equita\nble concerns).\n   The majority\u2019s categorical rejection of the fiduciary\nexception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader\nthan necessary. This case involves only the Government\u2019s\nalleged mismanagement of the Nation\u2019s trust fund ac\ncounts, and the Government did not claim below that the\nattorney-client communications at issue relate to any\ncompeting governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 18a\u201319a. To the extent the United States in other\ncontexts has competing interests, the Government and its\nattorneys already have to identify those interests in de\ntermining how to balance them against their obligations to\nIndian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating\nto those interests may properly be withheld or redacted\nconsistent with application of the fiduciary exception. See\n88 Fed. Cl. 1, 13 (2009) (observing that redactions \u201callo[w]\nthe privilege and exception to reign supreme within their\nrespective spheres\u201d).\n   The majority\u2019s categorical approach fails to appreciate\nthat privilege determinations are by their very nature\nmade on a case-by-case\u2014indeed, document-by-document\u2014\nbasis. Government attorneys, like private counsel, must\nreview each requested document and make an individual\nized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privi\nlege logs and challenges must do the same. \u201cWhile such a\n\u2018case-by-case\u2019 basis may to some slight extent undermine\ndesirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client\nprivilege, it obeys the spirit of\u201d of Rule 501, Upjohn, 449\n14     UNITED STATES v.

Because\nthe statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a\nconventional fiduciary in managing the Nation\u2019s trust\nfunds, the Government\u2019s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation\ninformed of matters relating to trust administration in\ncludes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client\ncommunications relating to trust fund management.

In\nparticular, the majority states that the Government \u201cas\nsumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,\u201d and\nthus the Nation \u201cmust point to a right conferred by statute\nor regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged in\nformation from the Government against its wishes.\u201d Ante,\nat 14.

We have never held that all of the\nGovernment\u2019s trust responsibilities to Indians must be set\nforth expressly in a specific statute or regulation.

Id., at 475 (quoting 74\nStat. 8). Even though the statute did not \u201cexpressly sub\nject the Government to duties of management and conser\nvation,\u201d we construed the Government\u2019s obligations under\nthe statute by reference to \u201celementary trust law,\u201d which\n\u201cconfirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary\nactually administering trust property may not allow it to\nfall into ruin on his watch.\u201d 537 U.

Similarly,\nin Seminole Nation, we relied on general trust principles\nto conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to\nprevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt\nmembers of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or\ntreaty provision expressly imposed such a duty. See 316\nU.

But even assuming arguendo that those jurisdictional decisions\nhave relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the\nGovernment\u2019s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express\nstatutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on\ngeneral trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory\nscheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction\nunder the Tucker Act.

Instead of \u201coverrid[ing]\u201d the specific\ndisclosure duty set forth in \u00a7162a(d)(5) and its implement\ning regulations, general trust principles flesh out the\nGovernment\u2019s disclosure obligations under the broader\nstatutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional\nfiduciary in this context.\n   This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text\nof the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d),\nwhich was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust\nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108\nStat. 4239, sets forth eight \u201ctrust responsibilities of the\nUnited States.\u201d But that provision also specifically states\nthat the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s \u201cproper discharge of the\ntrust responsibilities of the United States shall include\n(but are not limited to)\u201d those specified duties. 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7162a(d) (emphasis added). By expressly including the\nitalicized language, Congress recognized that the Govern\nment has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out\nof the broader statutory scheme governing the manage\nment of Indian trust funds.9 Indeed, Title I of the 1994\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that\nthe \u201ccatchall\u201d phrase (by which it means the \u201cshall include (but are not\nlimited to)\u201d language) cannot be read to \u201cinclude a general common-law\nduty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts\u201d because doing so would \u201cimpose general obligations that would\ninclude those specifically enumerated.\u201d Ante, at 22.

That conclusion accords with\ncommon sense as not even the Government argues that it\nhad no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust\nfunds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.10\n   The majority requires the Nation to \u201cpoint to a right\nconferred by statute\u201d to the attorney-client communica\ntions at issue, ante, at 14, and finding none, denies the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntively \u201cincorporate[s]\u201d common-law trust duties into \u00a7162a(d), ante, at\n22, that language simply makes clear that \u00a7162a(d) does not set forth\nan exhaustive list of the Government\u2019s trust responsibilities in manag\ning Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any\nsubstantive obligations into the statute.\n   10 The majority also contends that its reading of \u00a7162a(d) is supported\n\nby a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96\nStat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected\na claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide\nupon request \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gath\nered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.\u201d \u00a75(b),\nid., at 1978.

But this provision cannot bear the\nweight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed\nfact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the major\nity\u2019s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents\nsubject to the fiduciary exception are, under the \u201creal client\u201d rationale,\nper se nonprivileged. See, e.g., Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if\nanything, the ICLA\u2019s requirement that the Government disclose \u201cnon\nprivileged\u201d materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that\nCongress intended communications related to trust fund management\nto be disclosed to Indian tribes.\n20       UNITED STATES v.

The upshot of\nthat decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the\nposition of the dissenting Justices in White Mountain\nApache and Mitchell II, who rejected the use of common\nlaw principles to inform the scope of the Government\u2019s\nfiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. See White Mountain\nApache, 537 U. S., at 486\u2013487 (THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nMitchell II, 463 U.

Under our\ngoverning precedents, common-law trust principles play\nan important role in defining the Government\u2019s fiduciary\nduties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a\nconventional fiduciary relationship.

The\nsad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Gov\nernment has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in\nmanaging Indian trust fund accounts. See, e.g., Cobell,\n240 F. 3d, at 1089 (\u201cThe General Accounting Office, Inte\nrior Department Inspector General, and Office of Man\nagement and Budget, among others, have all condemned\nthe mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the\npast twenty years\u201d); Misplaced Trust 8 (\u201c[T]he [Govern\nment\u2019s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian\ntrust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exer\ncise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expec\ntations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Con\ngress, and taxpayers\u201d); id., at 56 (\u201c[H]ad this type of\nmismanagement taken place in any other trust arrange\nments such as Social Security, there would be war\u201d).\n   As Congress has recognized, \u201c[t]he Indian trust fund is\nmore than balance sheets and accounting procedures.\nThese moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native\nAmerican tribes and a source of income to tens of thou\nsands of native Americans.\u201d Id., at 5.

By rejecting the Nation\u2019s claim on the ground that\nit fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu\nnications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an\napproach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of\ncommon-law principles altogether in the Indian trust\ncontext. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a\nnarrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse\nyet, risks further diluting the Government\u2019s fiduciary\nobligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not\nintend and that would inflict serious harm on the already\nfrayed relationship between the United States and Indian\ntribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason\nfor reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.\n",

JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013382.      Argued April 20, 2011\u2014Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent Jicarilla Apache Nation\u2019s (Tribe) reservation contains\n  natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes adminis\n  tered by the Interior Department. Proceeds from these resources are\n  held by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe filed a\n  breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking\n  monetary damages for the Government\u2019s alleged mismanagement of\n  the Tribe\u2019s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161\u2013162a and\n  other laws. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production\n  of certain documents. The Government agreed to release some of the\n  documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the\n  attorney-client privilege. The CFC granted the motion in part, hold\n  ing that departmental communications relating to the management\n  of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d to the attorney-client\n  privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied to com\n  mon-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust\n  administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privi\n  lege against trust beneficiaries.\n     Denying the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus direct\n  ing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit\n  agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United\n  States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust\n  to justify applying the fiduciary exception. The appeals court held\n  that the United States cannot deny a tribe\u2019s request to discover com\n  munications between the Government and its attorneys based on the\n  attorney-client privilege when those communications concern man\n  agement of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that\n  it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those\n  communications.\n2        UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not\n apply to the general trust relationship between the United States\n and the Indian tribes. Pp. 5\u201324.\n    (a) The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and\n the nature of the Indian trust relationship. Pp. 5\u201314.\n      (1) Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal\n advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense\n in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of\n documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was\n sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust\n funds were used to pay the attorney. In the leading American case,\n Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, the\n Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that\n trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memo\n randum related to the trust\u2019s administration because: (1) the trustees\n had obtained the legal advice as \u201cmere representative[s]\u201d of the bene\n ficiaries, who were the \u201creal clients\u201d of the attorney, id., at 711\u2013712,\n and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the\n beneficiaries outweighed the trustees\u2019 interest in the attorney-client\n privilege, id., at 714. The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduci\n ary exception based on the same two criteria. Pp. 6\u20139.\n      (2) The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private\n trustee. While the United States\u2019 responsibilities with respect to the\n management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a pri\n vate trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The Government\u2019s\n trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by stat\n ute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation,\n 537 U. S. 488, 506 (Navajo I), and in fulfilling its statutory duties,\n the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its\n sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman\n v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437. Once federal law imposes fidu\n ciary obligations on the Government, the common law \u201ccould play a\n role,\u201d United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II);\n e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v.\n White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475\u2013476. But the ap\n plicable statutes and regulations control. When \u201cthe Tribe cannot\n identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\n that the Government violated . . . neither the Government\u2019s \u2018control\u2019\n over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.\u201d Na\n vajo II, supra, at ___. Pp. 9\u201314.\n    (b) The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in\n the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\n Pp. 14\u201323.\n      (1) In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711\u2013712. Applying these factors, the Court concludes\nthat the United States does not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere repre\nsentative\u201d of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d for whom\nthat advice is intended. See id., at 711. Here, the Government at\ntorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the\nTribe. The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capac\nity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Because its\nsovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries\u2019 private interests,\nthe Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, ca\npacity. Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal\nconcerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication\u2019s\npurpose. In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may\nneed to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental\nand conservation obligations. It may also face conflicting duties to\ndifferent tribes or individual Indians. It may seek the advice of coun\nsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help de\ntermine whether there are conflicting interests at all. For the attor\nney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See, e.g.,\nJaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18. The Government will not always\nbe able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests,\nespecially before receiving counsel\u2019s advice. If the Government were\nrequired to identify the specific interests it considered in each com\nmunication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be\nsubstantially compromised. See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 393. Pp. 15\u201320.\n     (2) The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception\nproperly applied here because of the fiduciary\u2019s duty to disclose all\ntrust-management-related information to the beneficiary. The Gov\nernment, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure\nobligations as a private trustee. In this case, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7162a(d) de\nlineates the Government\u2019s \u201ctrust responsibilities.\u201d It identifies the\nInterior Secretary\u2019s obligation to supply tribal account holders \u201cwith\nperiodic statements of their account performance\u201d and to make\n\u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d their account balances, \u00a7162a(d)(5). The\nSecretary has complied with these requirements in regulations man\ndating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly state\nment of performance. 25 CFR pt. 115.8. The common law of trusts\ndoes not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regula\ntions. A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibili\nties as nonexhaustive, see \u00a7162a(d), cannot be read to include a gen\n4          UNITED STATES v.

The common law, however, has recognized an excep\ntion to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice\nrelated to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases,\ncourts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney\nclient communications from the beneficiary of the trust.\n   In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception\napplies to the general trust relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does\nnot. Although the Government\u2019s responsibilities with re\nspect to the management of funds belonging to Indian\ntribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee,\nthis analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations\nof the United States to the Indian tribes are established\nand governed by statute rather than the common law, and\nin fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not\nas a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest\nin the execution of federal law.

The land contains\ntimber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are devel\noped pursuant to statutes administered by the Depart\nment of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural\nresources are held by the United States in trust for the\nTribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other\nstatutes.\n   In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act,\n\u00a71505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the Government that are founded on the Constitu\ntion, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The\ncomplaint seeks monetary damages for the Government\u2019s\nalleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the\nTribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated\nvarious laws, including 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161a and 162a, that\ngovern the management of funds held in trust for Indian\ntribes. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (2009).\n   From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government\nand the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu\ntion in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the\nGovernment turned over thousands of documents but\nwithheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected\nby the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product\ndoctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.\n   In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was re\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the\ncase into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.\nThe first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government\u2019s\nmanagement of the Tribe\u2019s trust accounts from 1972 to\n1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Gov\nernment failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among\nother things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to\nmaximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily\nin short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust\nfunds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe\nmoved to compel the Government to produce the 226\nwithheld documents. In response, the Government agreed\nto withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege\nand, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the\nGovernment continued to assert the attorney-client privi\nlege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to\nthe remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those\ndocuments in camera and classified them into five cate\ngories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust ad\nministration sent by personnel at the Department of the\nInterior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal\naffairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the\nSolicitor\u2019s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treas-\nury Departments, (3) documents generated under con\ntracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Inte\nrior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and\n(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other\ncategories.\n  The CFC granted the Tribe\u2019s motion to compel in part.\nThe CFC held that communications relating to the man\nagement of trust funds fall within a \u201cfiduciary exception\u201d\nto the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception,\nwhich courts have applied in the context of common-law\ntrusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the\nexecution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from assert\ning the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of\n4           UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes is suffi\nciently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that\nthe exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held,\nthe United States may not shield from the Tribe commu\nnications with attorneys relating to trust matters.\n   The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in\nthe first two categories because those documents \u201cinvolve\nmatters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,\neither directly or indirectly implicating the investments\nthat benefit Jicarilla\u201d and contain \u201clegal advice relating to\ntrust administration.\u201d Id., at 14\u201315. The CFC allowed\nthe Government to withhold most of the documents in the\nremaining categories as attorney work product,1 but the\ncourt identified some individual documents that it deter\nmined were also subject to the fiduciary exception. Id., at\n18\u201319.\n   The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the\ndocuments by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC\nto vacate its production order. The Court of Appeals de\nnied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly\napplied the fiduciary exception. The court held that \u201cthe\nUnited States cannot deny an Indian tribe\u2019s request to\ndiscover communications between the United States and\nits attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when\nthose communications concern management of an Indian\ntrust and the United States has not claimed that the\ngovernment or its attorneys considered a specific com\npeting interest in those communications.\u201d In re United\nStates, 590 F. 3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009).

But because\nthe Government had not alleged that the legal advice in\nthis case related to such conflicting interests, the court\nreserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might\napply in that situation. The court rejected the Govern\nment\u2019s argument that, because its duties to the Indian\ntribes were governed by statute rather than the common\nlaw, it had no general duty of disclosure that would over\nride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed\nwith the Government\u2019s contention that a case-by-case\napproach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredict\nable and would impair the Government\u2019s ability to obtain\nconfidential legal advice.\n   We granted certiorari, 562 U.

Unless applicable law provides other\nwise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client\nprivilege in civil litigation to protect confidential commu\nnications between Government officials and Government\nattorneys. Id., at 574 (\u201c[G]overnmental agencies and\nemployees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental\ncounterparts\u201d). The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust\nrelationship between the Government and the Tribe,\ndocuments that would otherwise be privileged must be\ndisclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds\nof the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\ntribes.\n                              A\n  English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as\na principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was\nthat when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the\nadministration of the trust, and not for the trustee\u2019s own\ndefense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the\nproduction of documents related to that advice.

Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d\n709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case, the beneficiaries of a\ntrust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the\nestate for alleged breaches of trust.

Newman, G. Bogert &\nG. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7962, p. 68 (3d ed. 2010) (here\ninafter Bogert). Some state courts have altogether rejected the notion\nthat the attorney-client privilege is subject to a fiduciary exception.\nSee, e.g., Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S. W. 2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (\u201cThe\nattorney-client privilege serves the same important purpose in the\ntrustee-attorney relationship as it does in other attorney-client rela\ntionships\u201d); Wells Fargo Bank v.

Neither party before\nthis Court disputes the existence of a common-law fiduciary exception,\nhowever, so in deciding this case we assume such an exception exists.\n8       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memoran\ndum related to the administration of the trust that the\ntrustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege.\nThe Delaware Chancery Court, observing that \u201cAmerican\ncase law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee\nin this context,\u201d looked to the English cases. Id., at 712.\nApplying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court\nheld that the memorandum was discoverable. It identified\ntwo reasons for applying the exception.\n   First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the\nlegal advice as \u201cmere representative[s]\u201d of the beneficiar\nies because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in\nthe beneficiaries\u2019 interest when administering the trust.\nIbid. For that reason, the beneficiaries were the \u201creal\nclients\u201d of the attorney who had advised the trustee on\ntrust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client\nprivilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather\nthan the trustees. Id., at 711\u2013712. The court based its\n\u201creal client\u201d determination on several factors: (1) when the\nadvice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the\ntrustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore\nthere was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in\na personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court\nsaw no indication that the memorandum was intended for\nany purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the\nlaw firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the ad\nvice was obtained at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense was not\nonly a \u201csignificant factor\u201d entitling the beneficiaries to see\nthe document but also \u201ca strong indication of precisely\nwho the real clients were.\u201d Id., at 712. The court distin\nguished between \u201clegal advice procured at the trustee\u2019s\nown expense and for his own protection,\u201d which would\nremain privileged, \u201cand the situation where the trust itself\nis assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where inter\nests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.\u201d Ibid. In\nthe latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu\nnications from the beneficiaries.\n  Second, the court concluded that the trustees\u2019 fiduciary\nduty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi\nciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client\nprivilege. \u201cThe policy of preserving the full disclosure\nnecessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,\u201d the court\nexplained, \u201cis here ultimately more important than the\nprotection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for\nthe trust.\u201d Id., at 714. Because more information helped\nthe beneficiaries to police the trustees\u2019 management of the\ntrust, disclosure was, in the court\u2019s judgment, \u201ca weight\nier public policy than the preservation of confidential\nattorney-client communications.\u201d Ibid.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex\nception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re\nLong Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);\nWachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233\u2013234 (CA3\n2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,\n2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);\nWildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5\n1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265\u2013266\n(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had\na federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the\nUnited States as trustee for the Indian tribes.\n                               B\n  In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the\nCourt of Appeals analogized the Government to a private\ntrustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy\nin limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean\nthe Government resembles a private trustee in every\nrespect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted\nthat the relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes is distinctive, \u201cdifferent from that existing\n10       UNITED STATES v.

As we have recognized in prior cases, Con\ngress may style its relations with the Indians a \u201ctrust\u201d\nwithout assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private\ntrustee, creating a trust relationship that is \u201climited\u201d or\n\u201cbare\u201d compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law.

S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so\nbecause the Government has often structured the trust\nrelationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while\ntrust administration \u201crelat[es] to the welfare of the Indi\nans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress\nhas prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis\ntinctly an interest of the United States.\u201d Heckman v.\nUnited States, 224 U.

This Court explained\nthat the Government brought suit as the representative of\nthe very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to\ncancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the\njudgment. 224 U. S., at 445\u2013446. But while it was for\nmally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact\nasserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of\nIndian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter\nvening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to\nthat of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was\npossible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role\nover the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the\ngoverning authority enforcing statutory law.\n  We do not question \u201cthe undisputed existence of a gen\neral trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian people.\u201d Mitchell II, 463 U.

Congress has expressed\nthis policy in a series of statutes that have defined and\nredefined the trust relationship between the United States\nand the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab\nlished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow\npurpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U.

That is because Congress has chosen to\nstructure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.\nWe will apply common-law trust principles where Con\ngress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that\nreason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by stat\nute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged\ninformation from the Government against its wishes.\n                             III\n  In this case, the Tribe\u2019s claim arises from 25 U.

We disagree.\n  As we have discussed, the Government exercises its\ncarefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign\ncapacity to implement national policy respecting the In\ndian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary\nexception\u2014the beneficiary\u2019s status as the \u201creal client\u201d and\nthe trustee\u2019s common-law duty to disclose information\nabout the trust\u2014are notably absent in the trust relation\nship Congress has established between the United States\nand the Tribe.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception\nbased on its determination that the Tribe rather than\nthe Government was the \u201creal client\u201d with respect to the\nGovernment attorneys\u2019 advice. Ibid. In cases applying the\nfiduciary exception, courts identify the \u201creal client\u201d based\non whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,\nwhether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per\nsonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the\nadvice could have been intended for any purpose other\nthan to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711\u2013712.\nApplying these factors, we conclude that the United States\ndoes not obtain legal advice as a \u201cmere representative\u201d of\nthe Tribe; nor is the Tribe the \u201creal client\u201d for whom that\nadvice is intended. See ibid.\n   Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con\ngressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts\nlook to the source of funds as a \u201cstrong indicator of pre\ncisely who the real clients were\u201d and a \u201csignificant factor\u201d\nin determining who ought to have access to the legal\nadvice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that\nthe attorneys were paid by the Government for advice\nregarding the Government\u2019s statutory obligations.\n   The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov\nernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthan as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt\nedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from\nthe Government\u2019s management of tribal trusts. That\nintention represents \u201ca humane and self imposed policy\u201d\nbased on felt \u201cmoral obligations.\u201d Seminole Nation, 316\nU. S., at 296\u2013297. This statutory purpose does not imply a\nfull common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, \u00a725,\nComment b (\u201cNo trust is created if the settlor manifests an\nintention to impose merely a moral obligation\u201d). Congress\nmakes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign\ngoverning authority, and the implementation of federal\npolicy remains \u201cdistinctly an interest of the United\nStates.\u201d Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that\n\u201cthe United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active\ninterest\u201d in the disposition of Indian assets because the\nterms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the\nUnited States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469\n(1907).\n   In some prior cases, we have found that the Government\nhad established the trust relationship in order to impose\nits own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,\nat 544 (Congress \u201cintended that the United States \u2018hold\nthe land . . . in trust\u2019 . . . because it wished to prevent\nalienation of the land\u201d). In other cases, the Government\nhas invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter\nference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min\nnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande\nlaria, 271 U. S., at 442\u2013444; United States v. Kagama, 118\nU. S. 375, 382\u2013384 (1886).

In this way, Con\ngress has designed the trust relationship to serve the\ninterests of the United States as well as to benefit the\nIndian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U.

S. 1, 28 (1886))).8\n  We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that \u201c[t]he\ngovernment and its officials who obtained the advice have\nno stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their\ntrustee role,\u201d Brief for Respondent 9, or that \u201cthe United\nStates\u2019 interests in trust administration were identical to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid\n\nered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For\nexample, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was\n\u201ca comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in\nAmerican society.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law \u00a71.04,\np. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the\nassimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually\nowned allotments. The federal policy aimed \u201cto substitute a new in\ndividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.\u201d Id., at 79.\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift\naway \u201cfrom assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect\nfor traditional aspects of Indian culture.\u201d Cohen \u00a71.05, at 84. The Act\nprohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,\n88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.\n4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,\nand social programs for themselves. Cohen \u00a71.07, at 103. This\nstrengthened self-government supported Congress\u2019 decision to author\nize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control\nand place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund\nManagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242\u20134244; see 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74021\u20134029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the\nIndian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to\nthe trust relationship\u2014forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining\nalienation\u2014does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common\nlaw trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and\nadministered as an instrument of federal policy.\n18     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,\u201d Brief\nfor National Congress of American Indians et al. as Amici\nCuriae 5. The United States has a sovereign interest in\nthe administration of Indian trusts distinct from the pri\nvate interests of those who may benefit from its admini\nstration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the\nground that \u201cmanagement does not manage for itself.\u201d\nGarner, 430 F. 2d, at 1101; Wachtel, 482 F. 3d, at 232\n(\u201c[O]f central importance in both Garner and Riggs was\nthe fiduciary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the\nlegal advice obtained\u201d). But the Government is never in\nthat position. While one purpose of the Indian trust rela\ntionship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its\nown independent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy. For that reason, when the Government\nseeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal\ntrusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship re\nlated to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal\nlaw. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in\na \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than a fiduciary capacity. See Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711.\n   Moreover, the Government has too many competing\nlegal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the\npurpose of each communication. When \u201cmultiple inter\nests\u201d are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence\nbetween the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee\nbreaks down. Id., at 714. That principle applies with\nparticular force to the Government. Because of the multi\nple interests it must represent, \u201cthe Government cannot\nfollow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who\nwould breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by\nrepresenting potentially conflicting interests without the\nbeneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.\n110, 128 (1983).\n   As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Government\nmay be obliged \u201cto balance competing interests\u201d when it\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadministers a tribal trust. 590 F. 3d, at 1315. The Gov\nernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,\nsuch as the environmental and conservation obligations\nthat the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314\u2013\n1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga\ntions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,\nNance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal\nGovernment has \u201cconflicting fiduciary responsibilities\u201d to\nthe Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley\nTribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (\u201cNo\ntrust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain\ntiff here at the expense of other Indians\u201d). Within the\nbounds of its \u201cgeneral trust relationship\u201d with the Indian\npeople, we have recognized that the Government has\n\u201cdiscretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub\ngroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all\nIndians nationwide.\u201d Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195\n(1993); see also ibid. (\u201cFederal Government \u2018does have a\nfiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary\nobligation that is owed to all Indian tribes\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nHoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we\nhave seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes\nto dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of\nthose for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov\nernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in\nbalancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of\nconsulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict\ning interests are at stake.\n   The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov\nernment\u2019s multiple obligations by suggesting that the\nGovernment may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it\nidentifies \u201ca specific competing interest\u201d that was consid\nered in the particular communications it seeks to with\nhold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the\nGovernment must consider are too pervasive for such a\ncase-by-case approach to be workable.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be\neffective, it must be predictable. See Jaffee v. Redmond,\n518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996); Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the\nGovernment were required to identify the specific inter\nests it considered in each communication, its ability to\nreceive confidential legal advice would be substantially\ncompromised. The Government will not always be able to\npredict what considerations qualify as a \u201cspecific compet\ning interest,\u201d especially in advance of receiving counsel\u2019s\nadvice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the consid\nerations contained in each communication with counsel\nwould render its attorney-client privilege \u201clittle better\nthan no privilege at all.\u201d Ibid.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary excep\ntion properly applied to the Government because \u201cthe\nfiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to\ntrust management to the beneficiary.\u201d 590 F. 3d, at 1312.\nIn general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust\nmust produce trust-related information to the beneficiary\non a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes\nlimited and may be modified by the settlor. Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts \u00a782 (2005) (hereinafter Restatement 3d);\nBogert \u00a7\u00a7962, 965.9 The fiduciary exception applies where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly\n\nanalogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust. A\nrevocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to\nthe beneficiary. \u201c[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may\nrevoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.\u201d\nBogert \u00a7962, at 25, \u00a7964; Restatement 3d, \u00a774, Comment e, at 31\n(\u201c[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or account\nings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the\ntrust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor\nor in the terms of the trust or a statute\u201d). In many respects, Indian\ntrusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has\nacted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthis duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privi\nlege. United States v. Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9\n1999) (\u201c[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle\u201d).\n  The United States, however, does not have the same\ncommon-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.\nAs we have previously said, common-law principles are\nrelevant only when applied to a \u201cspecific, applicable, trust\ncreating statute or regulation.\u201d Navajo II, 556 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7162a(d), which delineates \u201ctrust responsibilities\nof the United States\u201d that the Secretary of the Interior\nmust discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include\na provision identifying the Secretary\u2019s obligation to pro\nvide specific information to tribal account holders: The\nSecretary must \u201csuppl[y] account holders with periodic\nstatements of their account performance\u201d and must make\n\u201cavailable on a daily basis\u201d the \u201cbalances of their account.\u201d\n\u00a7162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re\nquirements by adopting regulations that instruct the\nOffice of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe\nwith a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR\n\u00a7115.801 (2010), that identifies \u201cthe source, type, and\nstatus of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust\naccount; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;\nreceipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal\nance of the quarterly statement period,\u201d \u00a7115.803. Tribes\nmay request more frequent statements or further \u201cinfor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nalter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal\nproperty interests. See Winton v. Amos, 255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (\u201cIt is\nthoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the\nIndians . . . and full power to legislate concerning their tribal prop\nerty\u201d); Cohen \u00a75.02[4], at 401\u2013403. The Government has not advanced\nthe argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust,\nand the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.\n22       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmation about account transactions and balances.\u201d\n\u00a7115.802.\n   The common law of trusts does not override the specific\ntrust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\nThose provisions define the Government\u2019s disclosure ob\nligation to the Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for\nRespondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust\nresponsibilities as nonexhaustive. See \u00a7162a(d) (trust\nresponsibilities \u201care not limited to\u201d those enumerated).\nThe Government replies that this clause \u201cis best read to\nrefer to other statutory and regulatory requirements\u201d\nrather than to common-law duties. Brief for United States\n38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the\nclause to include a general common-law duty to disclose\nall information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts. When Congress provides specific statutory obliga\ntions, we will not read a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision to impose\ngeneral obligations that would include those specifically\nenumerated. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n473 U. S. 134, 141\u2013142 (1985). \u201cAs our cases have noted\nin the past, we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a\ncongressional enactment which renders superfluous an\nother portion of that same law.\u201d Mackey v. Lanier Collec\ntion Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988).\nReading the statute to incorporate the full duties of a\nprivate, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress\u2019\nspecification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Our reading of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7162a(d) receives additional support from\n\nanother statute in which Congress expressed its understanding that\nthe Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold\ninformation related to trust property from Indian tribes. The Indian\nClaims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims\nthat the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States. If the\nSecretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was\nrequired to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon\ntheir request, to provide \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or\nevidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at\nissue in this case are classed \u201cthe property of the United\nStates\u201d while other records are \u201cthe property of the tribe.\u201d\n25 CFR \u00a7115.1000 (2010); see also \u00a7\u00a715.502, 162.111,\n166.1000. Just as the source of the funds used to pay for\nlegal advice is highly relevant in identifying the \u201creal\nclient\u201d for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider\nownership of the resulting records to be a significant\nfactor in deciding who \u201cought to have access to the docu\nment.\u201d See Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. In this case, that\nprivilege belongs to the United States.11\n\n                         *    *     *\n   Courts and commentators have long recognized that\n\u201c[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can properly govern\nthe unique relationship of tribes and the federal govern\nment.\u201d Cohen \u00a75.02[2], at 434\u2013435. The fiduciary excep\ntion to the attorney-client privilege ranks among those\naspects inapplicable to the Government\u2019s administration\nof Indian trusts. The Court of Appeals denied the Gov\nernment\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus based on its\nerroneous view to the contrary. We leave it for that court\nto determine whether the standards for granting the writ\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nclaim.\u201d Id., at 1978. That Congress authorized the withholding of\ninformation on grounds of privilege makes us doubt that Congress\nunderstood the Government\u2019s trust obligations to override so basic a\nprivilege as that between attorney and client.\n  11 The dissent tells us that applying the fiduciary exception is even\n\nmore important against the Government than against a private trustee\nbecause of a \u201chistory of governmental mismanagement.\u201d Post, at 21.\nWhile it is not necessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes\nare not required to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a74022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the United\nStates); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B). If the Tribe wishes to have its funds\nmanaged by a \u201cconventional fiduciary,\u201d post, at 10, it may seek to do so.\n24       UNITED STATES v.

The interests of the Federal Government as\ntrustee and the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Nation) as bene\nficiary are thus entirely aligned in the context of Indian\ntrust fund management. Where, as here, the governing\nstatutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary\nrelationship, the Government\u2019s duties include fiduciary\nobligations derived from common-law trust principles.\nBecause the common-law rationales for the fiduciary\nexception fully support its application in this context, I\nwould hold that the Government may not rely on the\nattorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation\ncommunications between the Government and its attor\nneys relating to trust fund management.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to the contrary rests on false fac\ntual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other\nIndian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pend\ning cases seeking relief for the Government\u2019s alleged\nmismanagement of their trust funds. But perhaps more\ntroubling is the majority\u2019s disregard of our settled prece\ndent that looks to common-law trust principles to define\nthe scope of the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nIndian tribes. Indeed, aspects of the majority\u2019s opinion\nsuggest that common-law principles have little or no re\nlevance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court\nrejected long ago. Although today\u2019s holding pertains only\nto a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the\nmajority\u2019s opinion may well be a further dilution of the\nGovernment\u2019s fiduciary obligations that will have broader\nnegative repercussions for the relationship between the\nUnited States and Indian tribes.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part\nthat \u201cthe privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be gov\nerned by the principles of the common law as they may be\ninterpreted by the courts of the United States in the light\nof reason and experience.\u201d Rule 501 \u201cwas adopted pre\ncisely because Congress wished to leave privilege ques\ntions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.\u201d\nUnited States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792, 804,\nn. 25 (1984).\n   As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege \u201cis to encourage full and frank communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote\nbroader public interests in the observance of law and\nadministration of justice.\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States,\n449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981).

The fiduciary excep\ntion is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both\nfederal and state courts,1 and has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts, including in litigation involving com\nmon-law trusts, see, e.g., Riggs Nat.

The majority places\nheavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal\nadvice, see ante, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who\npays for the legal advice, although \u201cpotentially relevant,\u201d\n\u201cis not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a782, Comment f, p. 188\n(2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Instead, the\nlynchpin of the \u201creal client\u201d inquiry is the identity of the\nultimate beneficiary of the legal advice. See Wachtel, 482\nF. 3d, at 232 (\u201c[O]f central importance . . . [i]s the fiduci\nary\u2019s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal\nadvice obtained\u201d). If the advice was rendered for the\nbenefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any\npersonal capacity, the \u201creal client\u201d of the advice is the\nbeneficiary.\n   As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception\u2014\nrooted in the trustee\u2019s fiduciary duty to disclose all infor\nmation related to trust management\u2014the majority glosses\nover the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed \u201cto\nenable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of\ntrust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the\ntrust.\u201d Third Restatement \u00a782, Comment a(2), at 184.

Courts\njustifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale\nhave thus concluded that \u201c[t]he policy of preserving the\nfull disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary rela\ntionship is . . . ultimately more important than the pro\ntection of the trustees\u2019 confidence in the attorney for the\ntrust.\u201d Id., at 714; see Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063 (under this\nrationale, \u201cthe fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle\u201d). The majority fails to\nappreciate the important oversight and accountability\ninterests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex\nception, or explain why they operate with any less force in\nthe Indian trust context.\n                              B\n   The question in this case is whether the fiduciary excep\ntion applies in the Indian trust context such that the\nGovernment may not rely on the attorney-client privilege\nto withhold from the Nation communications between the\nGovernment and its attorneys relating to the administra\ntion of the Nation\u2019s trust fund accounts. Answering that\nquestion requires a proper understanding of the nature of\nthe Government\u2019s trust relationship with Indian tribes,\nparticularly with regard to its management of Indian trust\nfunds.\n   Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a\ngeneral trust relationship between the United States and\nIndian tribes.

The\nmajority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed fac\ntual and legal premises.\n                             A\n   When the Government seeks legal advice from a gov\nernment attorney on matters relating to the management\nof the Nation\u2019s trust funds, the \u201creal client\u201d of that advice\nfor purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not\nthe Government. The majority\u2019s rejection of that conclu\nsion is premised on its erroneous view that the Govern\nment, in managing the Nation\u2019s trust funds, \u201chas its own\nindependent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy\u201d that diverges from the interest of the Na\ntion as beneficiary. Ante, at 18; see also ante, at 1\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter,\nthe Government has sovereign interests in managing\nIndian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194\n(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern\nment\u2019s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered\nand administered the trust relationship \u201cas an instrument\nof federal policy.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in\n10      UNITED STATES v.

As explained above, Congress has enacted an\nextensive network of statutes regulating the Government\u2019s\nmanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu\ntory framework establishes a \u201cconventional fiduciary re\nlationship\u201d in the context of Indian trust fund admini\nstration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U.

In other words, any\nuniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in\nother contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes\ndoes not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund\nadministration. It naturally follows, then, that when the\nGovernment seeks legal advice from government attorneys\nrelating to the management of the Nation\u2019s trust funds,\nthe \u201creal client\u201d of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary\nexception is the Nation, not the Government.\n  This conclusion holds true even though government\nattorneys are \u201cpaid out of congressional appropriations\nat no cost to the [Nation].\u201d Ante, at 15. As noted above,\nalthough the source of funding for legal advice may be\nrelevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the\nlegal advice was rendered. See supra, at 4. And, for all\nthe emphasis the majority places on the funding source\nhere, see ante, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that\nthe fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended\nfederal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government\nattorneys out of their own trust funds.6\n  The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of\nthe United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in\nsome contexts, that \u201cequivalence\u201d \u201cbreaks down\u201d when\nthere are \u201cmultiple interests\u201d involved in a trust relation\nship.

As a result, the majority concludes that the\nfiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the\nIndian trust context.

Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises\nfrequently in the private trust context. See, e.g., Third\nRestatement \u00a778, Comment c, at 97\u2013103 (describing duties\nof trustee with respect to \u201ctransactions that involve con\nflicting fiduciary and personal interests\u201d); id., \u00a779,\nComment b, at 128\u2013129 (describing trustee\u2019s duty of impar\ntiality in \u201cbalancing . . . competing interests\u201d of multiple\nbeneficiaries). In such circumstances, \u201ca trustee\u2014and\nultimately a court\u2014may need to provide some response\nthat offers a compromise between the confidentiality or\nprivacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 In Nevada, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation\n\ninvolving water rights even though it was also required by statute to\nrepresent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U. S., at\n128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior\n\u201cboth the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the\ncommencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation\nlands\u201d). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that \u201cit\nis simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform\nits obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has\nobliged it to represent other interests as well.\u201d Ibid. We thus observed\nin the context of that case that \u201cthe Government cannot follow the\nfastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties\nto his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting\ninterests without the beneficiary\u2019s consent.\u201d Ibid. We expressly distin\nguished the context \u201cwhere only a relationship between the Govern\nment and the tribe is involved.\u201d Id., at 142. In that context, we ac\nknowledged that \u201cthe law respecting obligations between a trustee and\na beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects\nadequately describe the duty of the United States.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The majority\nprovides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduci\nary exception in the Indian trust context could not simi\nlarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes\ninto account any unique governmental interests that bear\non the application of the fiduciary exception in any given\ncircumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (au\nthorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equita\nble concerns).\n   The majority\u2019s categorical rejection of the fiduciary\nexception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader\nthan necessary. This case involves only the Government\u2019s\nalleged mismanagement of the Nation\u2019s trust fund ac\ncounts, and the Government did not claim below that the\nattorney-client communications at issue relate to any\ncompeting governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 18a\u201319a. To the extent the United States in other\ncontexts has competing interests, the Government and its\nattorneys already have to identify those interests in de\ntermining how to balance them against their obligations to\nIndian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating\nto those interests may properly be withheld or redacted\nconsistent with application of the fiduciary exception.

Because\nthe statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a\nconventional fiduciary in managing the Nation\u2019s trust\nfunds, the Government\u2019s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation\ninformed of matters relating to trust administration in\ncludes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client\ncommunications relating to trust fund management.

In\nparticular, the majority states that the Government \u201cas\nsumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,\u201d and\nthus the Nation \u201cmust point to a right conferred by statute\nor regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged in\nformation from the Government against its wishes.\u201d Ante,\nat 14.

Id., at 475 (quoting 74\nStat. 8). Even though the statute did not \u201cexpressly sub\nject the Government to duties of management and conser\nvation,\u201d we construed the Government\u2019s obligations under\nthe statute by reference to \u201celementary trust law,\u201d which\n\u201cconfirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary\nactually administering trust property may not allow it to\nfall into ruin on his watch.\u201d 537 U.

Similarly,\nin Seminole Nation, we relied on general trust principles\nto conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to\nprevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt\nmembers of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or\ntreaty provision expressly imposed such a duty.

But even assuming arguendo that those jurisdictional decisions\nhave relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the\nGovernment\u2019s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express\nstatutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on\ngeneral trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory\nscheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction\nunder the Tucker Act.

Instead of \u201coverrid[ing]\u201d the specific\ndisclosure duty set forth in \u00a7162a(d)(5) and its implement\ning regulations, general trust principles flesh out the\nGovernment\u2019s disclosure obligations under the broader\nstatutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional\nfiduciary in this context.\n   This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text\nof the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d),\nwhich was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust\nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108\nStat. 4239, sets forth eight \u201ctrust responsibilities of the\nUnited States.\u201d But that provision also specifically states\nthat the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s \u201cproper discharge of the\ntrust responsibilities of the United States shall include\n(but are not limited to)\u201d those specified duties. 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7162a(d) (emphasis added). By expressly including the\nitalicized language, Congress recognized that the Govern\nment has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out\nof the broader statutory scheme governing the manage\nment of Indian trust funds.9 Indeed, Title I of the 1994\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that\nthe \u201ccatchall\u201d phrase (by which it means the \u201cshall include (but are not\nlimited to)\u201d language) cannot be read to \u201cinclude a general common-law\nduty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts\u201d because doing so would \u201cimpose general obligations that would\ninclude those specifically enumerated.\u201d Ante, at 22.

That conclusion accords with\ncommon sense as not even the Government argues that it\nhad no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust\nfunds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.10\n   The majority requires the Nation to \u201cpoint to a right\nconferred by statute\u201d to the attorney-client communica\ntions at issue, ante, at 14, and finding none, denies the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntively \u201cincorporate[s]\u201d common-law trust duties into \u00a7162a(d), ante, at\n22, that language simply makes clear that \u00a7162a(d) does not set forth\nan exhaustive list of the Government\u2019s trust responsibilities in manag\ning Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any\nsubstantive obligations into the statute.\n   10 The majority also contends that its reading of \u00a7162a(d) is supported\n\nby a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96\nStat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected\na claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide\nupon request \u201cany nonprivileged research materials or evidence gath\nered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.\u201d \u00a75(b),\nid., at 1978.

But this provision cannot bear the\nweight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed\nfact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the major\nity\u2019s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents\nsubject to the fiduciary exception are, under the \u201creal client\u201d rationale,\nper se nonprivileged. See, e.g., Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if\nanything, the ICLA\u2019s requirement that the Government disclose \u201cnon\nprivileged\u201d materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that\nCongress intended communications related to trust fund management\nto be disclosed to Indian tribes.\n20       UNITED STATES v.

The\nsad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Gov\nernment has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in\nmanaging Indian trust fund accounts. See, e.g., Cobell,\n240 F. 3d, at 1089 (\u201cThe General Accounting Office, Inte\nrior Department Inspector General, and Office of Man\nagement and Budget, among others, have all condemned\nthe mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the\npast twenty years\u201d); Misplaced Trust 8 (\u201c[T]he [Govern\nment\u2019s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian\ntrust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exer\ncise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expec\ntations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Con\ngress, and taxpayers\u201d); id., at 56 (\u201c[H]ad this type of\nmismanagement taken place in any other trust arrange\nments such as Social Security, there would be war\u201d).\n   As Congress has recognized, \u201c[t]he Indian trust fund is\nmore than balance sheets and accounting procedures.\nThese moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native\nAmerican tribes and a source of income to tens of thou\nsands of native Americans.\u201d Id., at 5.

Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns\nexpressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight\nand accountability that has marked the Government\u2019s\nhandling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.\n   But perhaps even more troubling than the majority\u2019s\nrefusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its\ndisregard of our established precedents that affirm the\ncentral role that common-law trust principles play in\ndefining the Government\u2019s fiduciary obligations to Indian\ntribes. By rejecting the Nation\u2019s claim on the ground that\nit fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu\nnications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an\napproach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of\ncommon-law principles altogether in the Indian trust\ncontext. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a\nnarrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse\nyet, risks further diluting the Government\u2019s fiduciary\nobligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not\nintend and that would inflict serious harm on the already\nfrayed relationship between the United States and Indian\ntribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason\nfor reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
