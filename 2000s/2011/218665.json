JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10–382.      Argued April 20, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent Jicarilla Apache Nation’s (Tribe) reservation contains\n  natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes adminis\n  tered by the Interior Department. Proceeds from these resources are\n  held by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe filed a\n  breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking\n  monetary damages for the Government’s alleged mismanagement of\n  the Tribe’s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S. C. §§161–162a and\n  other laws. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production\n  of certain documents. The Government agreed to release some of the\n  documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the\n  attorney-client privilege. The CFC granted the motion in part, hold\n  ing that departmental communications relating to the management\n  of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception” to the attorney-client\n  privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied to com\n  mon-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust\n  administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privi\n  lege against trust beneficiaries.\n     Denying the Government’s petition for a writ of mandamus direct\n  ing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit\n  agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United\n  States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust\n  to justify applying the fiduciary exception. The appeals court held\n  that the United States cannot deny a tribe’s request to discover com\n  munications between the Government and its attorneys based on the\n  attorney-client privilege when those communications concern man\n  agement of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that\n  it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those\n  communications.\n2        UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not\n apply to the general trust relationship between the United States\n and the Indian tribes. Pp. 5–24.\n    (a) The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and\n the nature of the Indian trust relationship. Pp. 5–14.\n      (1) Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal\n advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense\n in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of\n documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was\n sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust\n funds were used to pay the attorney. In the leading American case,\n Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, the\n Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that\n trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memo\n randum related to the trust’s administration because: (1) the trustees\n had obtained the legal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the bene\n ficiaries, who were the “real clients” of the attorney, id., at 711–712,\n and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the\n beneficiaries outweighed the trustees’ interest in the attorney-client\n privilege, id., at 714. The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduci\n ary exception based on the same two criteria. Pp. 6–9.\n      (2) The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private\n trustee. While the United States’ responsibilities with respect to the\n management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a pri\n vate trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The Government’s\n trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by stat\n ute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation,\n 537 U. S. 488, 506 (Navajo I), and in fulfilling its statutory duties,\n the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its\n sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman\n v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437. Once federal law imposes fidu\n ciary obligations on the Government, the common law “could play a\n role,” United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II);\n e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v.\n White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475–476. But the ap\n plicable statutes and regulations control. When “the Tribe cannot\n identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\n that the Government violated . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’\n over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.” Na\n vajo II, supra, at ___. Pp. 9–14.\n    (b) The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in\n the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\n Pp. 14–23.\n      (1) In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“real client” based on whether the advice was bought by the trust\ncorpus, whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal\nrather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have\nbeen intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust. Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711–712. Applying these factors, the Court concludes\nthat the United States does not obtain legal advice as a “mere repre\nsentative” of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom\nthat advice is intended. See id., at 711. Here, the Government at\ntorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the\nTribe. The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capac\nity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Because its\nsovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries’ private interests,\nthe Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, ca\npacity. Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal\nconcerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication’s\npurpose. In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may\nneed to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental\nand conservation obligations. It may also face conflicting duties to\ndifferent tribes or individual Indians. It may seek the advice of coun\nsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help de\ntermine whether there are conflicting interests at all. For the attor\nney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See, e.g.,\nJaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18. The Government will not always\nbe able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests,\nespecially before receiving counsel’s advice. If the Government were\nrequired to identify the specific interests it considered in each com\nmunication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be\nsubstantially compromised. See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 393. Pp. 15–20.\n     (2) The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception\nproperly applied here because of the fiduciary’s duty to disclose all\ntrust-management-related information to the beneficiary. The Gov\nernment, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure\nobligations as a private trustee. In this case, 25 U. S. C. §162a(d) de\nlineates the Government’s “trust responsibilities.” It identifies the\nInterior Secretary’s obligation to supply tribal account holders “with\nperiodic statements of their account performance” and to make\n“available on a daily basis” their account balances, §162a(d)(5). The\nSecretary has complied with these requirements in regulations man\ndating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly state\nment of performance. 25 CFR pt. 115.8. The common law of trusts\ndoes not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regula\ntions. A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibili\nties as nonexhaustive, see §162a(d), cannot be read to include a gen\n4          UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral common-law duty to disclose all information related to the ad\n    ministration of Indian trusts, since that would vitiate Congress’\n    specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations, see, e.g.,\n    Mackey v. Lanier Collection Riggs Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S.\n    825, 837. By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue\n    are classed “the property of the United States” while other records\n    are “the property of the tribe.” 25 CFR §115.1000. This Court con\n    siders ownership of records to be a significant factor in deciding who\n    “ought to have access to the document,” Riggs, supra, at 712. Here,\n    that privilege belongs to the United States. Pp. 20–23.\n590 F. 3d 1305, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

JICARILLA \n\n                APACHE NATION \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 13, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The attorney-client privilege ranks among the oldest\nand most established evidentiary privileges known to our\nlaw. The common law, however, has recognized an excep\ntion to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice\nrelated to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases,\ncourts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney\nclient communications from the beneficiary of the trust.\n   In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception\napplies to the general trust relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does\nnot. Although the Government’s responsibilities with re\nspect to the management of funds belonging to Indian\ntribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee,\nthis analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations\nof the United States to the Indian tribes are established\nand governed by statute rather than the common law, and\nin fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not\nas a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest\nin the execution of federal law. The reasons for the fiduci\nary exception—that the trustee has no independent inter\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nest in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject\nto a general common-law duty of disclosure—do not apply\nin this context.\n                               I\n   The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000\nacre reservation in northern New Mexico that was estab\nlished by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains\ntimber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are devel\noped pursuant to statutes administered by the Depart\nment of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural\nresources are held by the United States in trust for the\nTribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other\nstatutes.\n   In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n§1491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act,\n§1505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the Government that are founded on the Constitu\ntion, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The\ncomplaint seeks monetary damages for the Government’s\nalleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the\nTribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated\nvarious laws, including 25 U. S. C. §§161a and 162a, that\ngovern the management of funds held in trust for Indian\ntribes. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (2009).\n   From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government\nand the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu\ntion in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the\nGovernment turned over thousands of documents but\nwithheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected\nby the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product\ndoctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.\n   In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was re\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the\ncase into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.\nThe first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government’s\nmanagement of the Tribe’s trust accounts from 1972 to\n1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Gov\nernment failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among\nother things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to\nmaximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily\nin short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust\nfunds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe\nmoved to compel the Government to produce the 226\nwithheld documents. In response, the Government agreed\nto withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege\nand, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the\nGovernment continued to assert the attorney-client privi\nlege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to\nthe remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those\ndocuments in camera and classified them into five cate\ngories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust ad\nministration sent by personnel at the Department of the\nInterior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal\naffairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the\nSolicitor’s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treas-\nury Departments, (3) documents generated under con\ntracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Inte\nrior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and\n(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other\ncategories.\n  The CFC granted the Tribe’s motion to compel in part.\nThe CFC held that communications relating to the man\nagement of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception”\nto the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception,\nwhich courts have applied in the context of common-law\ntrusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the\nexecution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from assert\ning the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of\n4           UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes is suffi\nciently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that\nthe exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held,\nthe United States may not shield from the Tribe commu\nnications with attorneys relating to trust matters.\n   The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in\nthe first two categories because those documents “involve\nmatters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,\neither directly or indirectly implicating the investments\nthat benefit Jicarilla” and contain “legal advice relating to\ntrust administration.” Id., at 14–15. The CFC allowed\nthe Government to withhold most of the documents in the\nremaining categories as attorney work product,1 but the\ncourt identified some individual documents that it deter\nmined were also subject to the fiduciary exception. Id., at\n18–19.\n   The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the\ndocuments by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC\nto vacate its production order. The Court of Appeals de\nnied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly\napplied the fiduciary exception. The court held that “the\nUnited States cannot deny an Indian tribe’s request to\ndiscover communications between the United States and\nits attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when\nthose communications concern management of an Indian\ntrust and the United States has not claimed that the\ngovernment or its attorneys considered a specific com\npeting interest in those communications.” In re United\nStates, 590 F. 3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009).

But because\nthe Government had not alleged that the legal advice in\nthis case related to such conflicting interests, the court\nreserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might\napply in that situation. The court rejected the Govern\nment’s argument that, because its duties to the Indian\ntribes were governed by statute rather than the common\nlaw, it had no general duty of disclosure that would over\nride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed\nwith the Government’s contention that a case-by-case\napproach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredict\nable and would impair the Government’s ability to obtain\nconfidential legal advice.\n   We granted certiorari, 562 U.

S., at\n389; Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.

Unless applicable law provides other\nwise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client\nprivilege in civil litigation to protect confidential commu\nnications between Government officials and Government\nattorneys. Id., at 574 (“[G]overnmental agencies and\nemployees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental\ncounterparts”). The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust\nrelationship between the Government and the Tribe,\ndocuments that would otherwise be privileged must be\ndisclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds\nof the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\ntribes.\n                              A\n  English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as\na principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was\nthat when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the\nadministration of the trust, and not for the trustee’s own\ndefense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the\nproduction of documents related to that advice.

Neither party before\nthis Court disputes the existence of a common-law fiduciary exception,\nhowever, so in deciding this case we assume such an exception exists.\n8       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memoran\ndum related to the administration of the trust that the\ntrustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege.\nThe Delaware Chancery Court, observing that “American\ncase law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee\nin this context,” looked to the English cases. Id., at 712.\nApplying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court\nheld that the memorandum was discoverable. It identified\ntwo reasons for applying the exception.\n   First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the\nlegal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the beneficiar\nies because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in\nthe beneficiaries’ interest when administering the trust.\nIbid. For that reason, the beneficiaries were the “real\nclients” of the attorney who had advised the trustee on\ntrust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client\nprivilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather\nthan the trustees. Id., at 711–712. The court based its\n“real client” determination on several factors: (1) when the\nadvice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the\ntrustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore\nthere was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in\na personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court\nsaw no indication that the memorandum was intended for\nany purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the\nlaw firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the ad\nvice was obtained at the beneficiaries’ expense was not\nonly a “significant factor” entitling the beneficiaries to see\nthe document but also “a strong indication of precisely\nwho the real clients were.” Id., at 712. The court distin\nguished between “legal advice procured at the trustee’s\nown expense and for his own protection,” which would\nremain privileged, “and the situation where the trust itself\nis assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where inter\nests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.” Ibid. In\nthe latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu\nnications from the beneficiaries.\n  Second, the court concluded that the trustees’ fiduciary\nduty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi\nciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client\nprivilege. “The policy of preserving the full disclosure\nnecessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,” the court\nexplained, “is here ultimately more important than the\nprotection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for\nthe trust.” Id., at 714. Because more information helped\nthe beneficiaries to police the trustees’ management of the\ntrust, disclosure was, in the court’s judgment, “a weight\nier public policy than the preservation of confidential\nattorney-client communications.” Ibid.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex\nception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re\nLong Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);\nWachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233–234 (CA3\n2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,\n2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);\nWildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5\n1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265–266\n(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had\na federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the\nUnited States as trustee for the Indian tribes.\n                               B\n  In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the\nCourt of Appeals analogized the Government to a private\ntrustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy\nin limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean\nthe Government resembles a private trustee in every\nrespect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted\nthat the relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes is distinctive, “different from that existing\n10       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween individuals whether dealing at arm’s length, as\ntrustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise.” Klamath and\nMoadoc Tribes v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254 (1935)\n(emphasis added). “The general relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a\nprivate trust relationship.” Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl.

S. C. §162a, that trust is defined and governed\nby statutes rather than the common law. See United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (2003)\n(Navajo I) (“[T]he analysis must train on specific rights\ncreating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre\nscriptions”). As we have recognized in prior cases, Con\ngress may style its relations with the Indians a “trust”\nwithout assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private\ntrustee, creating a trust relationship that is “limited” or\n“bare” compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law. United States v. Mitchell, 445\nU. S. 535, 542 (1980) (Mitchell I); Mitchell II, supra, at\n224.4\n   The difference between a private common-law trust and\nthe statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position\nof the Government as sovereign.

This creates an important distinction “between\ncases of private right and those which arise between the\nGovernment and persons subject to its authority in con\nnection with the performance of the constitutional func\ntions of the executive or legislative departments.” Crowell\nv. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).\n   Throughout the history of the Indian trust relationship,\nwe have recognized that the organization and manage\nment of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the\nplenary authority of Congress. See Merrion v. Jicarilla\nApache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 169, n. 18 (1982) (“The\nUnited States retains plenary authority to divest the\ntribes of any attributes of sovereignty”); United States v.\nWheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 319 (1978) (“Congress has plenary\nauthority to legislate for the Indian tribes in all matters,\nincluding their form of government”); Winton v. Amos, 255\nU. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“Congress has plenary authority\nover the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full\npower to legislate concerning their tribal property”); Lone\nWolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553, 565 (1903) (“Plenary\nauthority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been\nexercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power\nhas always been deemed a political one, not subject to be\ncontrolled by the judicial department of the government”);\nCherokee Nation v.

S. 294, 308 (1902)\n(“The power existing in Congress to administer upon and\nguard the tribal property, and the power being political\nand administrative in its nature, the manner of its exer\ncise is a question within the province of the legislative\nbranch to determine, and is not one for the courts”); see\nalso United States v. Candelaria, 271 U. S. 432, 439\n12     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1926); Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315\n(1911).\n  Because the Indian trust relationship represents an\nexercise of that authority, we have explained that the\nGovernment “has a real and direct interest” in the guardi\nanship it exercises over the Indian tribes; “the interest is\none which is vested in it as a sovereign.” United States v.\nMinnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so\nbecause the Government has often structured the trust\nrelationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while\ntrust administration “relat[es] to the welfare of the Indi\nans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress\nhas prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis\ntinctly an interest of the United States.” Heckman v.\nUnited States, 224 U. S. 413, 437 (1912); see also Cande\nlaria, supra, at 443–444.\n  In Heckman, the Government brought suit to cancel\ncertain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an\nIndian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions\non alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained\nthat the Government brought suit as the representative of\nthe very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to\ncancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the\njudgment. 224 U. S., at 445–446. But while it was for\nmally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact\nasserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of\nIndian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter\nvening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to\nthat of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was\npossible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role\nover the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the\ngoverning authority enforcing statutory law.\n  We do not question “the undisputed existence of a gen\neral trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian people.” Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The Gov\nernment, following “a humane and self imposed policy . . .\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

United\nStates, 316 U. S. 286, 296–297 (1942), obligations “to the\nfulfillment of which the national honor has been commit\nted,” Heckman, supra, at 437. Congress has expressed\nthis policy in a series of statutes that have defined and\nredefined the trust relationship between the United States\nand the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab\nlished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow\npurpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress in\ntended the United States to hold land “ ‘in trust’ ” under\nthe General Allotment Act “simply because it wished to\nprevent alienation of the land and to ensure that allottees\nwould be immune from state taxation”); Navajo I, 537\nU. S., at 507–508 (Indian Mineral Leasing Act imposes no\n“detailed fiduciary responsibilities” nor is the Government\n“expressly invested with responsibility to secure ‘the needs\nand best interests of the Indian owner’ ”).\n   In other cases, we have found that particular “statutes\nand regulations . . . clearly establish fiduciary obligations\nof the Government” in some areas. Mitchell II, supra, at\n226; see also United States v. White Mountain Apache\nTribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475 (2003). Once federal law imposes\nsuch duties, the common law “could play a role.” United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Navajo\nII) (slip op., at 14). We have looked to common-law princi\nples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to deter\nmine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed. See\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe, supra, at 475–476. But the\napplicable statutes and regulations “establish [the] fiduci\nary relationship and define the contours of the United\nStates’ fiduciary responsibilities.” Mitchell II, supra, at\n224. When “the Tribe cannot identify a specific, applica\nble, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Govern\nment violated, . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’ over\n[Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.”\n14       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nNavajo II, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).5 The Government\nassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.6\n   Over the years, we have described the federal relation\nship with the Indian tribes using various formulations.\nThe Indian tribes have been called “domestic dependent\nnations,” Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1831),\nunder the “tutelage” of the United States, Heckman, su\npra, at 444, and subject to “the exercise of the Govern\nment’s guardianship over . . . their affairs,” United States\nv. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 48 (1913). These concepts do\nnot necessarily correspond to a common-law trust rela\ntionship. See, e.g., Restatement 2d, §7 (“A guardianship is\nnot a trust”). That is because Congress has chosen to\nstructure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.\nWe will apply common-law trust principles where Con\ngress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that\nreason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by stat\nute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged\ninformation from the Government against its wishes.\n                             III\n  In this case, the Tribe’s claim arises from 25 U. S. C.\n§§161–162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, §4001 et seq. These pro\nvisions define “the trust responsibilities of the United\nStates” with respect to tribal funds. §162a(d). The Court\nof Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between\nthe United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these\nand other statutes, is “sufficiently similar to a private\ntrust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.” 590\n——————\n  5 Thus, the dissent’s reliance on the Government’s “managerial con\n\ntrol,” post, at 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), is misplaced.\n  6 Cf. Restatement 2d, §25, Comment a (“[A]lthough the settlor has\n\ncalled the transaction a trust[,] no trust is created unless he manifests\nan intention to impose duties which are enforceable in the courts”).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 3d, at 1313. We disagree.\n  As we have discussed, the Government exercises its\ncarefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign\ncapacity to implement national policy respecting the In\ndian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary\nexception—the beneficiary’s status as the “real client” and\nthe trustee’s common-law duty to disclose information\nabout the trust—are notably absent in the trust relation\nship Congress has established between the United States\nand the Tribe.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception\nbased on its determination that the Tribe rather than\nthe Government was the “real client” with respect to the\nGovernment attorneys’ advice. Ibid. In cases applying the\nfiduciary exception, courts identify the “real client” based\non whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,\nwhether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per\nsonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the\nadvice could have been intended for any purpose other\nthan to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711–712.\nApplying these factors, we conclude that the United States\ndoes not obtain legal advice as a “mere representative” of\nthe Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom that\nadvice is intended. See ibid.\n   Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con\ngressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts\nlook to the source of funds as a “strong indicator of pre\ncisely who the real clients were” and a “significant factor”\nin determining who ought to have access to the legal\nadvice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that\nthe attorneys were paid by the Government for advice\nregarding the Government’s statutory obligations.\n   The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov\nernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthan as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt\nedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from\nthe Government’s management of tribal trusts. That\nintention represents “a humane and self imposed policy”\nbased on felt “moral obligations.” Seminole Nation, 316\nU. S., at 296–297. This statutory purpose does not imply a\nfull common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, §25,\nComment b (“No trust is created if the settlor manifests an\nintention to impose merely a moral obligation”). Congress\nmakes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign\ngoverning authority, and the implementation of federal\npolicy remains “distinctly an interest of the United\nStates.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that\n“the United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active\ninterest” in the disposition of Indian assets because the\nterms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the\nUnited States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469\n(1907).\n   In some prior cases, we have found that the Government\nhad established the trust relationship in order to impose\nits own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,\nat 544 (Congress “intended that the United States ‘hold\nthe land . . . in trust’ . . . because it wished to prevent\nalienation of the land”). In other cases, the Government\nhas invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter\nference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min\nnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande\nlaria, 271 U. S., at 442–444; United States v. Kagama, 118\nU. S. 375, 382–384 (1886). And the exercise of federal\nauthority thereby established has often been “left under\nthe acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive\n——————\n   7 Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous Court, insisted that\n\nthe “national interest” in the management of Indian affairs “is not to be\nexpressed in terms of property, or to be limited to the assertion of rights\nincident to the ownership of a reversion or to the holding of a technical\ntitle in trust.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nDepartment.” Heckman, supra, at 446. In this way, Con\ngress has designed the trust relationship to serve the\ninterests of the United States as well as to benefit the\nIndian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432,\n443 (1903) (trust relationship “ ‘authorizes the adoption on\nthe part of the United States of such policy as their own\npublic interests may dictate’ ” (quoting Choctaw Nation v.\nUnited States, 119 U. S. 1, 28 (1886))).8\n  We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that “[t]he\ngovernment and its officials who obtained the advice have\nno stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their\ntrustee role,” Brief for Respondent 9, or that “the United\nStates’ interests in trust administration were identical to\n——————\n  8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid\n\nered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For\nexample, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was\n“a comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in\nAmerican society.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §1.04,\np. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the\nassimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually\nowned allotments. The federal policy aimed “to substitute a new in\ndividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.” Id., at 79.\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift\naway “from assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect\nfor traditional aspects of Indian culture.” Cohen §1.05, at 84. The Act\nprohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,\n88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.\n4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,\nand social programs for themselves. Cohen §1.07, at 103. This\nstrengthened self-government supported Congress’ decision to author\nize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control\nand place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund\nManagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242–4244; see 25\nU. S. C. §§4021–4029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the\nIndian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to\nthe trust relationship—forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining\nalienation—does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common\nlaw trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and\nadministered as an instrument of federal policy.\n18     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,” Brief\nfor National Congress of American Indians et al. as Amici\nCuriae 5. The United States has a sovereign interest in\nthe administration of Indian trusts distinct from the pri\nvate interests of those who may benefit from its admini\nstration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the\nground that “management does not manage for itself.”\nGarner, 430 F. 2d, at 1101; Wachtel, 482 F. 3d, at 232\n(“[O]f central importance in both Garner and Riggs was\nthe fiduciary’s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the\nlegal advice obtained”). But the Government is never in\nthat position. While one purpose of the Indian trust rela\ntionship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its\nown independent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy. For that reason, when the Government\nseeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal\ntrusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship re\nlated to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal\nlaw. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in\na “personal” rather than a fiduciary capacity. See Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711.\n   Moreover, the Government has too many competing\nlegal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the\npurpose of each communication. When “multiple inter\nests” are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence\nbetween the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee\nbreaks down. Id., at 714. That principle applies with\nparticular force to the Government. Because of the multi\nple interests it must represent, “the Government cannot\nfollow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who\nwould breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by\nrepresenting potentially conflicting interests without the\nbeneficiary’s consent.” Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.\n110, 128 (1983).\n   As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Government\nmay be obliged “to balance competing interests” when it\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The Gov\nernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,\nsuch as the environmental and conservation obligations\nthat the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314–\n1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga\ntions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,\nNance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal\nGovernment has “conflicting fiduciary responsibilities” to\nthe Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley\nTribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (“No\ntrust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain\ntiff here at the expense of other Indians”). Within the\nbounds of its “general trust relationship” with the Indian\npeople, we have recognized that the Government has\n“discretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub\ngroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all\nIndians nationwide.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195\n(1993); see also ibid. (“Federal Government ‘does have a\nfiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary\nobligation that is owed to all Indian tribes’ ” (quoting\nHoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we\nhave seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes\nto dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of\nthose for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov\nernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in\nbalancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of\nconsulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict\ning interests are at stake.\n   The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov\nernment’s multiple obligations by suggesting that the\nGovernment may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it\nidentifies “a specific competing interest” that was consid\nered in the particular communications it seeks to with\nhold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the\nGovernment must consider are too pervasive for such a\ncase-by-case approach to be workable.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be\neffective, it must be predictable. See Jaffee v. Redmond,\n518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996); Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the\nGovernment were required to identify the specific inter\nests it considered in each communication, its ability to\nreceive confidential legal advice would be substantially\ncompromised. The Government will not always be able to\npredict what considerations qualify as a “specific compet\ning interest,” especially in advance of receiving counsel’s\nadvice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the consid\nerations contained in each communication with counsel\nwould render its attorney-client privilege “little better\nthan no privilege at all.” Ibid.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary excep\ntion properly applied to the Government because “the\nfiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to\ntrust management to the beneficiary.” 590 F. 3d, at 1312.\nIn general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust\nmust produce trust-related information to the beneficiary\non a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes\nlimited and may be modified by the settlor. Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts §82 (2005) (hereinafter Restatement 3d);\nBogert §§962, 965.9 The fiduciary exception applies where\n——————\n   9 We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly\n\nanalogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust. A\nrevocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to\nthe beneficiary. “[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may\nrevoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.”\nBogert §962, at 25, §964; Restatement 3d, §74, Comment e, at 31\n(“[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or account\nings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the\ntrust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor\nor in the terms of the trust or a statute”). In many respects, Indian\ntrusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has\nacted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthis duty of disclosure overrides the attorney-client privi\nlege. United States v. Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9\n1999) (“[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle”).\n  The United States, however, does not have the same\ncommon-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.\nAs we have previously said, common-law principles are\nrelevant only when applied to a “specific, applicable, trust\ncreating statute or regulation.” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25\nU. S. C. §162a(d), which delineates “trust responsibilities\nof the United States” that the Secretary of the Interior\nmust discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include\na provision identifying the Secretary’s obligation to pro\nvide specific information to tribal account holders: The\nSecretary must “suppl[y] account holders with periodic\nstatements of their account performance” and must make\n“available on a daily basis” the “balances of their account.”\n§162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re\nquirements by adopting regulations that instruct the\nOffice of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe\nwith a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR\n§115.801 (2010), that identifies “the source, type, and\nstatus of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust\naccount; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;\nreceipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal\nance of the quarterly statement period,” §115.803. Tribes\nmay request more frequent statements or further “infor\n——————\nalter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal\nproperty interests. See Winton v. Amos, 255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“It is\nthoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the\nIndians . . . and full power to legislate concerning their tribal prop\nerty”); Cohen §5.02[4], at 401–403. The Government has not advanced\nthe argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust,\nand the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.\n22       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmation about account transactions and balances.”\n§115.802.\n   The common law of trusts does not override the specific\ntrust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\nThose provisions define the Government’s disclosure ob\nligation to the Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for\nRespondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust\nresponsibilities as nonexhaustive. See §162a(d) (trust\nresponsibilities “are not limited to” those enumerated).\nThe Government replies that this clause “is best read to\nrefer to other statutory and regulatory requirements”\nrather than to common-law duties. Brief for United States\n38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the\nclause to include a general common-law duty to disclose\nall information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts. When Congress provides specific statutory obliga\ntions, we will not read a “catchall” provision to impose\ngeneral obligations that would include those specifically\nenumerated. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n473 U. S. 134, 141–142 (1985). “As our cases have noted\nin the past, we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a\ncongressional enactment which renders superfluous an\nother portion of that same law.” Mackey v. Lanier Collec\ntion Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988).\nReading the statute to incorporate the full duties of a\nprivate, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress’\nspecification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations.10\n——————\n  10 Our reading of 25 U. S. C. §162a(d) receives additional support from\n\nanother statute in which Congress expressed its understanding that\nthe Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold\ninformation related to trust property from Indian tribes. The Indian\nClaims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims\nthat the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States. If the\nSecretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was\nrequired to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon\ntheir request, to provide “any nonprivileged research materials or\nevidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Just as the source of the funds used to pay for\nlegal advice is highly relevant in identifying the “real\nclient” for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider\nownership of the resulting records to be a significant\nfactor in deciding who “ought to have access to the docu\nment.” See Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. In this case, that\nprivilege belongs to the United States.11\n\n                         *    *     *\n   Courts and commentators have long recognized that\n“[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can properly govern\nthe unique relationship of tribes and the federal govern\nment.” Cohen §5.02[2], at 434–435. The fiduciary excep\ntion to the attorney-client privilege ranks among those\naspects inapplicable to the Government’s administration\nof Indian trusts. The Court of Appeals denied the Gov\nernment’s petition for a writ of mandamus based on its\nerroneous view to the contrary. We leave it for that court\nto determine whether the standards for granting the writ\n\n\n——————\nclaim.” Id., at 1978. That Congress authorized the withholding of\ninformation on grounds of privilege makes us doubt that Congress\nunderstood the Government’s trust obligations to override so basic a\nprivilege as that between attorney and client.\n  11 The dissent tells us that applying the fiduciary exception is even\n\nmore important against the Government than against a private trustee\nbecause of a “history of governmental mismanagement.” Post, at 21.\nWhile it is not necessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes\nare not required to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S. C.\n§4022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the United\nStates); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B). If the Tribe wishes to have its funds\nmanaged by a “conventional fiduciary,” post, at 10, it may seek to do so.\n24       UNITED STATES v.

United States, 224 U. S. 413,\n437 (1912). This unique “national interest,” ibid., obli\ngates Government attorneys, in rendering advice, to make\ntheir own “independent evaluation of the law and facts” in\nan effort “to arrive at a single position of the United\nStates,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a (Letter from Attorney\nGeneral Griffin B. Bell to Secretary of the Interior Cecil D.\nAndrus (May 31, 1979)). “For that reason,” as the Court\nexplains, “the Government seeks legal advice in a ‘per\nsonal’ rather than a fiduciary capacity.” Ante, at 18. The\nattorney-client privilege thus protects the Government’s\ncommunications with its attorneys from disclosure.\n   Going beyond attorney-client communications, the Court\nholds that the Government “assumes Indian trust respon\nsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those\nresponsibilities by statute.” Ante, at 14. The Court there\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n              GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfore concludes that the trust relationship described by 25\nU. S.

The interests of the Federal Government as\ntrustee and the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Nation) as bene\nficiary are thus entirely aligned in the context of Indian\ntrust fund management. Where, as here, the governing\nstatutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary\nrelationship, the Government’s duties include fiduciary\nobligations derived from common-law trust principles.\nBecause the common-law rationales for the fiduciary\nexception fully support its application in this context, I\nwould hold that the Government may not rely on the\nattorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation\ncommunications between the Government and its attor\nneys relating to trust fund management.\n   The Court’s decision to the contrary rests on false fac\ntual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other\nIndian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pend\ning cases seeking relief for the Government’s alleged\nmismanagement of their trust funds. But perhaps more\ntroubling is the majority’s disregard of our settled prece\ndent that looks to common-law trust principles to define\nthe scope of the Government’s fiduciary obligations to\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nIndian tribes. Indeed, aspects of the majority’s opinion\nsuggest that common-law principles have little or no re\nlevance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court\nrejected long ago. Although today’s holding pertains only\nto a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the\nmajority’s opinion may well be a further dilution of the\nGovernment’s fiduciary obligations that will have broader\nnegative repercussions for the relationship between the\nUnited States and Indian tribes.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part\nthat “the privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be gov\nerned by the principles of the common law as they may be\ninterpreted by the courts of the United States in the light\nof reason and experience.” Rule 501 “was adopted pre\ncisely because Congress wished to leave privilege ques\ntions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.”\nUnited States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792, 804,\nn. 25 (1984).\n   As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege “is to encourage full and frank communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote\nbroader public interests in the observance of law and\nadministration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States,\n449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981). But the majority neglects to\nexplain that the privilege is a limited exception to the\nusual rules of evidence requiring full disclosure of relevant\ninformation. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2192, p. 64 (3d\ned. 1940) (common law recognizes “fundamental maxim\nthat the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence”\nand that “any exemptions which may exist are distinctly\nexceptional, being so many derogations from a positive\ngeneral rule”). Because it “has the effect of withholding\nrelevant information from the factfinder,” courts construe\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

It applies “only where necessary to\nachieve its purpose,” ibid.; “[w]here this purpose ends, so\ntoo does the protection of the privilege,” Wachtel v. Health\nNet, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 231 (CA3 2007).\n   The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege\nhas its roots in 19th-century English common-law cases\nholding that, “when a trustee obtained legal advice relat\ning to his administration of the trust, and not in antici\npation of adversarial legal proceedings against him, the\nbeneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of\nthat advice.” Ibid. (collecting cases). The fiduciary excep\ntion is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both\nfederal and state courts,1 and has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts, including in litigation involving com\nmon-law trusts, see, e.g., Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington,\nD. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes\nbetween corporations and shareholders, see, e.g., Garner v.\nWolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d 1093 (CA5 1970), and ERISA\nenforcement actions, see, e.g., United States v. Doe, 162\nF. 3d 554 (CA9 1999).\n   The majority correctly identifies the two rationales\ncourts have articulated for applying the fiduciary excep\ntion, ante, at 8–9, but its description of those rationales\nomits a number of important points. With regard to the\nfirst rationale, courts have characterized the trust benefi\nciary as the “real client” of legal advice relating to trust\n——————\n  1 See, e.g., Solis v.

JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nadministration because such advice, provided to a trustee\nto assist in his management of the trust, is ultimately for\nthe benefit of the trust beneficiary, rather than for the\ntrustee in his personal capacity. See, e.g., United States v.\nMett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (“ ‘[A]s a represen\ntative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is admin\nistering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that\nhe is personally being served’ ” (quoting United States v.\nEvans, 796 F. 2d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) (per curiam)));\nRiggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713 (same). The majority places\nheavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal\nadvice, see ante, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who\npays for the legal advice, although “potentially relevant,”\n“is not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.”\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts §82, Comment f, p. 188\n(2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Instead, the\nlynchpin of the “real client” inquiry is the identity of the\nultimate beneficiary of the legal advice. See Wachtel, 482\nF. 3d, at 232 (“[O]f central importance . . . [i]s the fiduci\nary’s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal\nadvice obtained”). If the advice was rendered for the\nbenefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any\npersonal capacity, the “real client” of the advice is the\nbeneficiary.\n   As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception—\nrooted in the trustee’s fiduciary duty to disclose all infor\nmation related to trust management—the majority glosses\nover the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed “to\nenable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of\ntrust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the\ntrust.” Third Restatement §82, Comment a(2), at 184. As\nthe leading American case on the fiduciary exception\nexplains, “[i]n order for the beneficiaries to hold the trus\ntee to the proper standards of care and honesty and pro\ncure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled,\ntheir knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmanagement is crucial.” Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. Courts\njustifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale\nhave thus concluded that “[t]he policy of preserving the\nfull disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary rela\ntionship is . . . ultimately more important than the pro\ntection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for the\ntrust.” Id., at 714; see Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063 (under this\nrationale, “the fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle”). The majority fails to\nappreciate the important oversight and accountability\ninterests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex\nception, or explain why they operate with any less force in\nthe Indian trust context.\n                              B\n   The question in this case is whether the fiduciary excep\ntion applies in the Indian trust context such that the\nGovernment may not rely on the attorney-client privilege\nto withhold from the Nation communications between the\nGovernment and its attorneys relating to the administra\ntion of the Nation’s trust fund accounts. Answering that\nquestion requires a proper understanding of the nature of\nthe Government’s trust relationship with Indian tribes,\nparticularly with regard to its management of Indian trust\nfunds.\n   Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a\ngeneral trust relationship between the United States and\nIndian tribes. See Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17\n(1831) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions over the past cen\ntury have repeatedly reaffirmed this “distinctive obliga\ntion of trust incumbent upon the Government” in its deal\nings with Indians. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316\nU. S. 286, 296 (1942); see United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 225–226 (1983) (Mitchell II) (collecting cases\nand noting “the undisputed existence of a general trust\n6            UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\npeople”). Congress, too, has recognized the general trust\nrelationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\nIndeed, “[n]early every piece of modern legislation dealing\nwith Indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the\ntrust relationship between tribes and the federal govern\nment.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law\n§5.04[4][a], pp. 420–421 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).2\n   Against this backdrop, Congress has enacted federal\nstatutes that “define the contours of the United States’\nfiduciary responsibilities” with regard to its management\nof Indian tribal property and other trust assets. Mitchell\nII, 463 U. S., at 224. The Nation’s claims as relevant in\nthis case concern the Government’s alleged mismanage\nment of its tribal trust fund accounts.

In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury, at the\nrequest of the Secretary of the Interior, must invest “[a]ll\nfunds held in trust by the United States . . . to the credit of\nIndian tribes” in certain securities “suitable to the needs\nof the fund involved.” 25 U.

The Secretary\nof the Interior may deposit in the Treasury and pay manda\ntory interest on Indian trust funds when “the best inter\nests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits, in\nlieu of investments.” §161. Similarly, the Secretary of the\nInterior may invest tribal trust funds in certain public\ndebt instruments “if he deems it advisable and for the best\ninterest of the Indians.” §162a(a). And Congress has set\nforth a nonexhaustive list of the Secretary of the Interior’s\n“trust responsibilities” with respect to Indian trust funds,\nwhich include a series of accounting, auditing, manage\nment, and disclosure obligations. §162a(d). These and\nother statutory provisions4 give the United States “full\nresponsibility to manage Indian [trust fund accounts] for\nthe benefit of the Indians.” Mitchell II, 463 U.

The\nmajority’s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed fac\ntual and legal premises.\n                             A\n   When the Government seeks legal advice from a gov\nernment attorney on matters relating to the management\nof the Nation’s trust funds, the “real client” of that advice\nfor purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not\nthe Government. The majority’s rejection of that conclu\nsion is premised on its erroneous view that the Govern\nment, in managing the Nation’s trust funds, “has its own\nindependent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy” that diverges from the interest of the Na\ntion as beneficiary. Ante, at 18; see also ante, at 1\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter,\nthe Government has sovereign interests in managing\nIndian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194\n(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern\nment’s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered\nand administered the trust relationship “as an instrument\nof federal policy.” Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in\n10      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npolicy); see generally Cobell v. Norton, 240 F. 3d 1081,\n1086–1088 (CADC 2001) (same, and describing that his\ntory as “contentious and tragic”).\n  In the specific context of Indian trust fund management,\nhowever, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests\nof the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as\nbeneficiary. As explained above, Congress has enacted an\nextensive network of statutes regulating the Government’s\nmanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu\ntory framework establishes a “conventional fiduciary re\nlationship” in the context of Indian trust fund admini\nstration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n14) (internal quotation marks omitted); see supra, at 7–9.\n  As a conventional fiduciary, the Government’s manage\nment of Indian trust funds must “be judged by the most\nexacting fiduciary standards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S.,\nat 296–297. Among the most fundamental fiduciary obli\ngations of a trustee is “to administer the trust solely in the\ninterest of the beneficiaries.” 2A A. Scott & W. Fratcher,\nLaw of Trusts §170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see Meinhard v.\nSalmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 464, 164 N. E. 545, 546 (1928)\n(Cardozo, C. J.) (“Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of\nan honor the most sensitive,” is “the standard of behavior”\nfor trustees “bound by fiduciary ties”). Although Indian\ntrust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury,\n“they are not part of the federal government’s general\nfunds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.”\nCohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 140 (citing Quick Bear v.\nLeupp, 210 U. S. 50, 80–81 (1908)).\n  Because federal Indian policy requires the Government\nto act strictly as a conventional fiduciary in managing the\nNation’s trust funds, the Government acts in a “represen\ntative” rather than “persona[l]” capacity when managing\nthe Nation’s trust funds.

See Cohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 141 (“Federal\nstatutes forbid use of Indian tribal funds in any man\nner not authorized by treaty or express provisions of\nlaw” (citing 25 U. S. C. §§122, 123)). In other words, any\nuniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in\nother contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes\ndoes not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund\nadministration. It naturally follows, then, that when the\nGovernment seeks legal advice from government attorneys\nrelating to the management of the Nation’s trust funds,\nthe “real client” of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary\nexception is the Nation, not the Government.\n  This conclusion holds true even though government\nattorneys are “paid out of congressional appropriations\nat no cost to the [Nation].” Ante, at 15. As noted above,\nalthough the source of funding for legal advice may be\nrelevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the\nlegal advice was rendered. See supra, at 4. And, for all\nthe emphasis the majority places on the funding source\nhere, see ante, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that\nthe fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended\nfederal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government\nattorneys out of their own trust funds.6\n  The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of\nthe United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in\nsome contexts, that “equivalence” “breaks down” when\nthere are “multiple interests” involved in a trust relation\nship. Ante, at 18. According to the majority, “the Gov\nernment has too many competing legal concerns to allow a\ncase-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communica\n——————\n  6 The majority also states that ownership of the requested documents\n\nis “a significant factor” in deciding whether the fiduciary exception\napplies, ante, at 23, but the only case it cites as support deals with the\nsource of payment for the legal advice, not the ownership of the docu\nments. See ibid. (citing Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v.\nZimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, 712 (Del. Ch. 1976)).\n12       UNITED STATES v.

As a result, the majority concludes that the\nfiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the\nIndian trust context. Ibid.\n   Preliminarily, while the Government in certain circum\nstances may have sovereign obligations that conflict with\nits duties as a fiduciary for Indian tribes, see, e.g., Nevada\nv. United States, 463 U. S. 110 (1983),7 the existence of\ncompeting interests is not unique to the Government as\ntrustee. Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises\nfrequently in the private trust context. See, e.g., Third\nRestatement §78, Comment c, at 97–103 (describing duties\nof trustee with respect to “transactions that involve con\nflicting fiduciary and personal interests”); id., §79,\nComment b, at 128–129 (describing trustee’s duty of impar\ntiality in “balancing . . . competing interests” of multiple\nbeneficiaries). In such circumstances, “a trustee—and\nultimately a court—may need to provide some response\nthat offers a compromise between the confidentiality or\nprivacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs\n——————\n   7 In Nevada, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation\n\ninvolving water rights even though it was also required by statute to\nrepresent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U. S., at\n128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior\n“both the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the\ncommencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation\nlands”). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that “it\nis simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform\nits obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has\nobliged it to represent other interests as well.” Ibid. We thus observed\nin the context of that case that “the Government cannot follow the\nfastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties\nto his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting\ninterests without the beneficiary’s consent.” Ibid. We expressly distin\nguished the context “where only a relationship between the Govern\nment and the tribe is involved.” Id., at 142. In that context, we ac\nknowledged that “the law respecting obligations between a trustee and\na beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects\nadequately describe the duty of the United States.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nof others.” Id., §82, Comment f, at 188. The majority\nprovides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduci\nary exception in the Indian trust context could not simi\nlarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes\ninto account any unique governmental interests that bear\non the application of the fiduciary exception in any given\ncircumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (au\nthorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equita\nble concerns).\n   The majority’s categorical rejection of the fiduciary\nexception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader\nthan necessary. This case involves only the Government’s\nalleged mismanagement of the Nation’s trust fund ac\ncounts, and the Government did not claim below that the\nattorney-client communications at issue relate to any\ncompeting governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 18a–19a. To the extent the United States in other\ncontexts has competing interests, the Government and its\nattorneys already have to identify those interests in de\ntermining how to balance them against their obligations to\nIndian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating\nto those interests may properly be withheld or redacted\nconsistent with application of the fiduciary exception. See\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

Government attorneys, like private counsel, must\nreview each requested document and make an individual\nized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privi\nlege logs and challenges must do the same. “While such a\n‘case-by-case’ basis may to some slight extent undermine\ndesirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client\nprivilege, it obeys the spirit of” of Rule 501, Upjohn, 449\n14     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU.

Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of Rep.\nHungate)); see S. Rep. No. 93–1277, p. 13 (1974) (“[T]he\nrecognition of a privilege based on a confidential relation\nship . . . should be determined on a case-by-case basis”).\n   Rather than fashioning a blanket rule against applica\ntion of the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context,\nI would, consistent with Rule 501 and principles of judicial\nrestraint, decide the question solely on the facts before us.\nSee Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 386 (noting that “we sit to decide\nconcrete cases and not abstract propositions of law” and\n“declin[ing] to lay down a broad rule or series of rules to\ngovern all conceivable future questions in this area”). On\nthose facts, the fiduciary exception applies to the commu\nnications in this case.\n                              B\n  Like the “real client” rationale, the second rationale for\nthe fiduciary exception, rooted in a trustee’s fiduciary duty\nto disclose all matters relevant to trust administration to\nthe beneficiary, fully supports disclosure of the communi\ncations in this case. As explained above, courts relying on\nthis second rationale have recognized that “[t]he policy of\npreserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee\nbeneficiary relationship is . . . ultimately more important\nthan the protection of the trustees’ confidence in the at\ntorney for the trust.” Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 714. Because\nthe statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a\nconventional fiduciary in managing the Nation’s trust\nfunds, the Government’s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation\ninformed of matters relating to trust administration in\ncludes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client\ncommunications relating to trust fund management.

In\nparticular, the majority states that the Government “as\nsumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,” and\nthus the Nation “must point to a right conferred by statute\nor regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged in\nformation from the Government against its wishes.” Ante,\nat 14. The majority cites a single statutory provision and\nits implementing regulations as “defin[ing] the Govern\nment’s disclosure obligation to the [Nation].” Ante, at 22;\nsee ante, at 21–22 (citing 25 U. S. C. §162a(d)(5) and 25\nCFR §§115.801–115.803 (2010)). Because those “narrowly\ndefined disclosure obligations” do not provide Indian tribes\nwith a specific statutory right to disclosure of attorney\nclient communications relating to trust administration,\nante, at 22, the majority concludes that the Government\nhas no duty to disclose those communications to the\nNation.\n   The majority’s conclusion employs a fundamentally\nflawed legal premise. We have never held that all of the\nGovernment’s trust responsibilities to Indians must be set\nforth expressly in a specific statute or regulation. To the\ncontrary, where, as here, the statutory framework estab\nlishes that the relationship between the Government and\nan Indian tribe “bears the hallmarks of a conventional\nfiduciary relationship,” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at __ (slip op.,\nat 14) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have consis\ntently looked to general trust principles to flesh out the\nGovernment’s fiduciary obligations.\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  For example, in United States v. White Mountain\nApache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465 (2003), we construed a statute\nthat vested the Government with discretionary authority\nto “use” trust property for certain purposes as imposing a\nconcomitant duty to preserve improvements that had\npreviously been made to the land. Id., at 475 (quoting 74\nStat. 8). Even though the statute did not “expressly sub\nject the Government to duties of management and conser\nvation,” we construed the Government’s obligations under\nthe statute by reference to “elementary trust law,” which\n“confirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary\nactually administering trust property may not allow it to\nfall into ruin on his watch.” 537 U. S., at 475. Similarly,\nin Seminole Nation, we relied on general trust principles\nto conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to\nprevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt\nmembers of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or\ntreaty provision expressly imposed such a duty. See 316\nU. S., at 296.8\n——————\n   8 To be sure, in decisions involving the jurisdiction of the Court of\n\nFederal Claims under the Tucker Act, we have explained that the\njurisdictional analysis “must train on specific rights-creating or duty\nimposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at\n506. But even assuming arguendo that those jurisdictional decisions\nhave relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the\nGovernment’s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express\nstatutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on\ngeneral trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory\nscheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction\nunder the Tucker Act. See, e.g., Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 226 (noting\nthat common-law trust sources establish that “a trustee is accountable\nin damages for breaches of trust” and that, “[g]iven the existence of a\ntrust relationship, it naturally follows that the Government should be\nliable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties”); see also\nNavajo II, 556 U.

This approach accords with our recog\nnition in other trust contexts that “the primary function of\nthe fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discre\ntionary powers which are controlled by no other specific\nduty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.”\nVarity Corp. v.

But despite its assurance that it “will apply\ncommon-law trust principles where Congress has indi\ncated it is appropriate to do so,” ante, at 14, the majority\ninexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust\nprinciples in this case. In doing so, the majority states\nthat “[t]he common law of trusts does not override the\nspecific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply\nhere.” Ante, at 21–22 (referring to §162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR\n§§115.801–115.803).

Instead of “overrid[ing]” the specific\ndisclosure duty set forth in §162a(d)(5) and its implement\ning regulations, general trust principles flesh out the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations under the broader\nstatutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional\nfiduciary in this context.\n   This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text\nof the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d),\nwhich was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust\nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108\nStat. 4239, sets forth eight “trust responsibilities of the\nUnited States.” But that provision also specifically states\nthat the Secretary of the Interior’s “proper discharge of the\ntrust responsibilities of the United States shall include\n(but are not limited to)” those specified duties. 25 U.

By expressly including the\nitalicized language, Congress recognized that the Govern\nment has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out\nof the broader statutory scheme governing the manage\nment of Indian trust funds.9 Indeed, Title I of the 1994\n——————\n  9 The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that\nthe “catchall” phrase (by which it means the “shall include (but are not\nlimited to)” language) cannot be read to “include a general common-law\nduty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts” because doing so would “impose general obligations that would\ninclude those specifically enumerated.” Ante, at 22. But the flaw in the\nmajority’s argument is that it misperceives the function of the relevant\nlanguage. Rather than serving as a “catchall” provision that affirma\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

R. Rep. No. 103–778, p. 9 (1994) (“The responsibility for\nmanagement of Indian Trust Funds by the [Government]\nhas been determined through a series of court decisions,\ntreaties, and statutes”). That conclusion accords with\ncommon sense as not even the Government argues that it\nhad no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust\nfunds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.10\n   The majority requires the Nation to “point to a right\nconferred by statute” to the attorney-client communica\ntions at issue, ante, at 14, and finding none, denies the\n——————\ntively “incorporate[s]” common-law trust duties into §162a(d), ante, at\n22, that language simply makes clear that §162a(d) does not set forth\nan exhaustive list of the Government’s trust responsibilities in manag\ning Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any\nsubstantive obligations into the statute.\n   10 The majority also contends that its reading of §162a(d) is supported\n\nby a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96\nStat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected\na claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide\nupon request “any nonprivileged research materials or evidence gath\nered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.” §5(b),\nid., at 1978. According to the majority, this provision reflected Con\ngress’ understanding that “the Government retains evidentiary privi\nleges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from\nIndian tribes.” Ante, at 22, n. 11. But this provision cannot bear the\nweight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed\nfact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the major\nity’s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents\nsubject to the fiduciary exception are, under the “real client” rationale,\nper se nonprivileged. See, e.g., Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if\nanything, the ICLA’s requirement that the Government disclose “non\nprivileged” materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that\nCongress intended communications related to trust fund management\nto be disclosed to Indian tribes.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nNation access to those communications. The upshot of\nthat decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the\nposition of the dissenting Justices in White Mountain\nApache and Mitchell II, who rejected the use of common\nlaw principles to inform the scope of the Government’s\nfiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. See White Mountain\nApache, 537 U. S., at 486–487 (THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nMitchell II, 463 U. S., at 234–235 (Powell, J., dissenting).\nThat approach was wrong when Mitchell II was decided\nnearly 30 years ago, and it is wrong today. Under our\ngoverning precedents, common-law trust principles play\nan important role in defining the Government’s fiduciary\nduties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a\nconventional fiduciary relationship. Applying those prin\nciples in this context, I would hold that the fiduciary ex\nception is fully applicable to the communications in this\ncase.11\n——————\n   11 The majority’s errors are further compounded by its failure to ac\n\ncord proper consideration to the mandamus posture of this case. “This\nCourt repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an ex\ntraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.”\nGulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 289\n(1988). “As the writ is one of the most potent weapons in the judicial\narsenal, three conditions must be satisfied before it may issue,” Cheney\nv. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (inter\nnal quotation marks and citation omitted):\n   “First, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other\nadequate means to attain the relief he desires—a condition designed to\nensure that the writ will not be used as a substitute for the regular\nappeals process. Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of\nshowing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.\nThird, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing\ncourt, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is\nappropriate under the circumstances.” Id., at 380–381 (internal quota\ntion marks and citations omitted; alterations deleted).\n   The majority purports to leave the decision whether to grant man\ndamus relief to the Federal Circuit, but simultaneously drops a footnote\nstating that it “assume[s]” that the Court of Federal Claims on remand\nwill “follow [its] holding” that the fiduciary exception is inapplicable\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   We have described the Federal Government’s fiduciary\nduties toward Indian tribes as consisting of “moral obliga\ntions of the highest responsibility and trust,” to be fulfilled\nthrough conduct “judged by the most exacting fiduciary\nstandards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S., at 297; see also\nMitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225–226 (collecting cases). The\nsad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Gov\nernment has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in\nmanaging Indian trust fund accounts. See, e.g., Cobell,\n240 F. 3d, at 1089 (“The General Accounting Office, Inte\nrior Department Inspector General, and Office of Man\nagement and Budget, among others, have all condemned\nthe mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the\npast twenty years”); Misplaced Trust 8 (“[T]he [Govern\nment’s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian\ntrust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exer\ncise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expec\ntations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Con\ngress, and taxpayers”); id., at 56 (“[H]ad this type of\nmismanagement taken place in any other trust arrange\nments such as Social Security, there would be war”).\n   As Congress has recognized, “[t]he Indian trust fund is\nmore than balance sheets and accounting procedures.\nThese moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native\nAmerican tribes and a source of income to tens of thou\nsands of native Americans.” Id., at 5. Given the history of\ngovernmental mismanagement of Indian trust funds,\napplication of the fiduciary exception is, if anything, even\nmore important in this context than in the private trustee\n\n——————\nhere. Ante, at 24, and n. 13. By doing so, the majority virtually assures\nthat the Nation will not be able to use the communications at issue in\nthis litigation, thereby effectively granting extraordinary relief to the\nGovernment upon no showing whatsoever that the stringent conditions\nfor mandamus have been met.\n22     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontext. The majority’s refusal to apply the fiduciary\nexception in this case deprives the Nation—as well as the\nIndian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending\nin the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mis\nmanagement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a–138a—of highly\nrelevant information going directly to the merits of\nwhether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary\nduties. Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns\nexpressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight\nand accountability that has marked the Government’s\nhandling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.\n   But perhaps even more troubling than the majority’s\nrefusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its\ndisregard of our established precedents that affirm the\ncentral role that common-law trust principles play in\ndefining the Government’s fiduciary obligations to Indian\ntribes. By rejecting the Nation’s claim on the ground that\nit fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu\nnications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an\napproach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of\ncommon-law principles altogether in the Indian trust\ncontext. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a\nnarrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse\nyet, risks further diluting the Government’s fiduciary\nobligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not\nintend and that would inflict serious harm on the already\nfrayed relationship between the United States and Indian\ntribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason\nfor reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 218665, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/06/13/United_States_v._Jicarilla_Apache_Nation.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 20, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent Jicarilla Apache Nation’s (Tribe) reservation contains\n  natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes adminis\n  tered by the Interior Department. Proceeds from these resources are\n  held by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe filed a\n  breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking\n  monetary damages for the Government’s alleged mismanagement of\n  the Tribe’s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S. C. §§161–162a and\n  other laws. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production\n  of certain documents. The Government agreed to release some of the\n  documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the\n  attorney-client privilege. The CFC granted the motion in part, hold\n  ing that departmental communications relating to the management\n  of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception” to the attorney-client\n  privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied to com\n  mon-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust\n  administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privi\n  lege against trust beneficiaries.\n     Denying the Government’s petition for a writ of mandamus direct\n  ing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit\n  agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United\n  States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust\n  to justify applying the fiduciary exception. The appeals court held\n  that the United States cannot deny a tribe’s request to discover com\n  munications between the Government and its attorneys based on the\n  attorney-client privilege when those communications concern man\n  agement of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that\n  it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those\n  communications.\n2        UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not\n apply to the general trust relationship between the United States\n and the Indian tribes. Pp. 5–24.\n    (a) The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and\n the nature of the Indian trust relationship. Pp. 5–14.\n      (1) Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal\n advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense\n in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of\n documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was\n sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust\n funds were used to pay the attorney. In the leading American case,\n Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, the\n Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that\n trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memo\n randum related to the trust’s administration because: (1) the trustees\n had obtained the legal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the bene\n ficiaries, who were the “real clients” of the attorney, id., at 711–712,\n and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the\n beneficiaries outweighed the trustees’ interest in the attorney-client\n privilege, id., at 714. The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduci\n ary exception based on the same two criteria. Pp. 6–9.\n      (2) The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private\n trustee. While the United States’ responsibilities with respect to the\n management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a pri\n vate trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The Government’s\n trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by stat\n ute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation,\n 537 U. S. 488, 506 (Navajo I), and in fulfilling its statutory duties,\n the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its\n sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman\n v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437. Once federal law imposes fidu\n ciary obligations on the Government, the common law “could play a\n role,” United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II);\n e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v.\n White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475–476. But the ap\n plicable statutes and regulations control. When “the Tribe cannot\n identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\n that the Government violated . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’\n over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.” Na\n vajo II, supra, at ___.

Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711–712. Applying these factors, the Court concludes\nthat the United States does not obtain legal advice as a “mere repre\nsentative” of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom\nthat advice is intended. See id., at 711. Here, the Government at\ntorneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the\nTribe. The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capac\nity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Because its\nsovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries’ private interests,\nthe Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, ca\npacity. Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal\nconcerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication’s\npurpose. In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may\nneed to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental\nand conservation obligations. It may also face conflicting duties to\ndifferent tribes or individual Indians. It may seek the advice of coun\nsel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help de\ntermine whether there are conflicting interests at all. For the attor\nney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See, e.g.,\nJaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18. The Government will not always\nbe able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests,\nespecially before receiving counsel’s advice. If the Government were\nrequired to identify the specific interests it considered in each com\nmunication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be\nsubstantially compromised. See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 393. Pp. 15–20.\n     (2) The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception\nproperly applied here because of the fiduciary’s duty to disclose all\ntrust-management-related information to the beneficiary. The Gov\nernment, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure\nobligations as a private trustee. In this case, 25 U. S. C. §162a(d) de\nlineates the Government’s “trust responsibilities.” It identifies the\nInterior Secretary’s obligation to supply tribal account holders “with\nperiodic statements of their account performance” and to make\n“available on a daily basis” their account balances, §162a(d)(5). The\nSecretary has complied with these requirements in regulations man\ndating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly state\nment of performance. 25 CFR pt. 115.8. The common law of trusts\ndoes not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regula\ntions. A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibili\nties as nonexhaustive, see §162a(d), cannot be read to include a gen\n4          UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral common-law duty to disclose all information related to the ad\n    ministration of Indian trusts, since that would vitiate Congress’\n    specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations, see, e.g.,\n    Mackey v. Lanier Collection Riggs Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S.\n    825, 837. By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue\n    are classed “the property of the United States” while other records\n    are “the property of the tribe.” 25 CFR §115.1000. This Court con\n    siders ownership of records to be a significant factor in deciding who\n    “ought to have access to the document,” Riggs, supra, at 712.

The common law, however, has recognized an excep\ntion to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice\nrelated to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases,\ncourts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney\nclient communications from the beneficiary of the trust.\n   In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception\napplies to the general trust relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does\nnot. Although the Government’s responsibilities with re\nspect to the management of funds belonging to Indian\ntribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee,\nthis analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations\nof the United States to the Indian tribes are established\nand governed by statute rather than the common law, and\nin fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not\nas a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest\nin the execution of federal law. The reasons for the fiduci\nary exception—that the trustee has no independent inter\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nest in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject\nto a general common-law duty of disclosure—do not apply\nin this context.\n                               I\n   The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000\nacre reservation in northern New Mexico that was estab\nlished by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains\ntimber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are devel\noped pursuant to statutes administered by the Depart\nment of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural\nresources are held by the United States in trust for the\nTribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other\nstatutes.\n   In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n§1491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act,\n§1505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the Government that are founded on the Constitu\ntion, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The\ncomplaint seeks monetary damages for the Government’s\nalleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the\nTribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated\nvarious laws, including 25 U. S. C. §§161a and 162a, that\ngovern the management of funds held in trust for Indian\ntribes. See 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 3 (2009).\n   From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government\nand the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu\ntion in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the\nGovernment turned over thousands of documents but\nwithheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected\nby the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product\ndoctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.\n   In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was re\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the\ncase into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.\nThe first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government’s\nmanagement of the Tribe’s trust accounts from 1972 to\n1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Gov\nernment failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among\nother things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to\nmaximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily\nin short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust\nfunds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe\nmoved to compel the Government to produce the 226\nwithheld documents. In response, the Government agreed\nto withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege\nand, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the\nGovernment continued to assert the attorney-client privi\nlege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to\nthe remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those\ndocuments in camera and classified them into five cate\ngories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust ad\nministration sent by personnel at the Department of the\nInterior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal\naffairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the\nSolicitor’s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treas-\nury Departments, (3) documents generated under con\ntracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Inte\nrior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and\n(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other\ncategories.\n  The CFC granted the Tribe’s motion to compel in part.\nThe CFC held that communications relating to the man\nagement of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception”\nto the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception,\nwhich courts have applied in the context of common-law\ntrusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the\nexecution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from assert\ning the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of\n4           UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the Indian tribes is suffi\nciently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that\nthe exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held,\nthe United States may not shield from the Tribe commu\nnications with attorneys relating to trust matters.\n   The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in\nthe first two categories because those documents “involve\nmatters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,\neither directly or indirectly implicating the investments\nthat benefit Jicarilla” and contain “legal advice relating to\ntrust administration.” Id., at 14–15. The CFC allowed\nthe Government to withhold most of the documents in the\nremaining categories as attorney work product,1 but the\ncourt identified some individual documents that it deter\nmined were also subject to the fiduciary exception.

But because\nthe Government had not alleged that the legal advice in\nthis case related to such conflicting interests, the court\nreserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might\napply in that situation. The court rejected the Govern\nment’s argument that, because its duties to the Indian\ntribes were governed by statute rather than the common\nlaw, it had no general duty of disclosure that would over\nride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed\nwith the Government’s contention that a case-by-case\napproach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredict\nable and would impair the Government’s ability to obtain\nconfidential legal advice.\n   We granted certiorari, 562 U.

S., at\n389; Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U. S. 464, 470 (1888).\n   The objectives of the attorney-client privilege apply to\ngovernmental clients. “The privilege aids government en\ntities and employees in obtaining legal advice founded on\na complete and accurate factual picture.” 1 Restatement\n(Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers §74, Comment b,\npp. 573–574 (1998). Unless applicable law provides other\nwise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client\nprivilege in civil litigation to protect confidential commu\nnications between Government officials and Government\nattorneys. Id., at 574 (“[G]overnmental agencies and\nemployees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental\ncounterparts”). The Tribe argues, however, that the\ncommon law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the\nattorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust\nrelationship between the Government and the Tribe,\ndocuments that would otherwise be privileged must be\ndisclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds\nof the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\ntribes.\n                              A\n  English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as\na principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was\nthat when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the\nadministration of the trust, and not for the trustee’s own\ndefense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the\nproduction of documents related to that advice. Wynne v.\nHumberston, 27 Beav. 421, 423–424, 54 Eng. Rep. 165,\n166 (1858); Talbot v. Marshfield 2 Dr. & Sm. 549, 550–\n551, 62 Eng. Rep. 728, 729 (1865).

Rep., at 166.\n  The fiduciary exception quickly became an established\nfeature of English common law, see, e.g., In re Mason, 22\nCh. D. 609 (1883), but it did not appear in this country\nuntil the following century. American courts seem first\nto have expressed skepticism. See In re Prudence-Bonds\nCorp., 76 F. Supp. 643, 647 (EDNY 1948) (declining to\napply the fiduciary exception to the trustee of a bondhold\ning corporation because of the “important right of such a\ncorporate trustee . . . to seek legal advice and nevertheless\nact in accordance with its own judgment”). By the 1970’s,\nhowever, American courts began to adopt the English\ncommon-law rule. See Garner v. Wolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d\n1093, 1103–1104 (CA5 1970) (allowing shareholders, upon\na showing of “good cause,” to discover legal advice given to\ncorporate management).3\n  The leading American case on the fiduciary exception is\nRiggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d\n709 (Del. Ch. 1976). In that case, the beneficiaries of a\ntrust estate sought to compel the trustees to reimburse the\nestate for alleged breaches of trust. The beneficiaries\n\n——————\n   3 Today, “[c]ourts differ on whether the [attorney-client] privilege is\n\navailable for communications between the trustee and counsel regard\ning the administration of the trust.” A. Newman, G. Bogert &\nG. Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees §962, p. 68 (3d ed. 2010) (here\ninafter Bogert). Some state courts have altogether rejected the notion\nthat the attorney-client privilege is subject to a fiduciary exception.\nSee, e.g., Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S. W. 2d 920, 924 (Tex. 1996) (“The\nattorney-client privilege serves the same important purpose in the\ntrustee-attorney relationship as it does in other attorney-client rela\ntionships”); Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Ct., 22 Cal. 4th 201, 208–209,\n990 P. 2d 591, 595 (2000) (“[T]he attorney for the trustee of a trust is\nnot, by virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the beneficiaries\nof the trust” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Neither party before\nthis Court disputes the existence of a common-law fiduciary exception,\nhowever, so in deciding this case we assume such an exception exists.\n8       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to compel the trustees to produce a legal memoran\ndum related to the administration of the trust that the\ntrustees withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege.\nThe Delaware Chancery Court, observing that “American\ncase law is practically nonexistent on the duty of a trustee\nin this context,” looked to the English cases. Id., at 712.\nApplying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court\nheld that the memorandum was discoverable. It identified\ntwo reasons for applying the exception.\n   First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the\nlegal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the beneficiar\nies because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in\nthe beneficiaries’ interest when administering the trust.\nIbid. For that reason, the beneficiaries were the “real\nclients” of the attorney who had advised the trustee on\ntrust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client\nprivilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather\nthan the trustees. Id., at 711–712. The court based its\n“real client” determination on several factors: (1) when the\nadvice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the\ntrustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore\nthere was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in\na personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court\nsaw no indication that the memorandum was intended for\nany purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the\nlaw firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the ad\nvice was obtained at the beneficiaries’ expense was not\nonly a “significant factor” entitling the beneficiaries to see\nthe document but also “a strong indication of precisely\nwho the real clients were.” Id., at 712. The court distin\nguished between “legal advice procured at the trustee’s\nown expense and for his own protection,” which would\nremain privileged, “and the situation where the trust itself\nis assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where inter\nests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.” Ibid. In\nthe latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu\nnications from the beneficiaries.\n  Second, the court concluded that the trustees’ fiduciary\nduty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi\nciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client\nprivilege. “The policy of preserving the full disclosure\nnecessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,” the court\nexplained, “is here ultimately more important than the\nprotection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for\nthe trust.” Id., at 714. Because more information helped\nthe beneficiaries to police the trustees’ management of the\ntrust, disclosure was, in the court’s judgment, “a weight\nier public policy than the preservation of confidential\nattorney-client communications.” Ibid.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex\nception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re\nLong Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);\nWachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233–234 (CA3\n2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,\n2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);\nWildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5\n1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265–266\n(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had\na federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the\nUnited States as trustee for the Indian tribes.\n                               B\n  In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the\nCourt of Appeals analogized the Government to a private\ntrustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy\nin limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean\nthe Government resembles a private trustee in every\nrespect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted\nthat the relationship between the United States and the\nIndian tribes is distinctive, “different from that existing\n10       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween individuals whether dealing at arm’s length, as\ntrustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise.” Klamath and\nMoadoc Tribes v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254 (1935)\n(emphasis added). “The general relationship between the\nUnited States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a\nprivate trust relationship.” Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.\nUnited States, 21 Cl. Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (emphasis added).\n   The Government, of course, is not a private trustee.\nThough the relevant statutes denominate the relationship\nbetween the Government and the Indians a “trust,” see,\ne.g., 25 U. S. C. §162a, that trust is defined and governed\nby statutes rather than the common law. See United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (2003)\n(Navajo I) (“[T]he analysis must train on specific rights\ncreating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre\nscriptions”). As we have recognized in prior cases, Con\ngress may style its relations with the Indians a “trust”\nwithout assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private\ntrustee, creating a trust relationship that is “limited” or\n“bare” compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law. United States v. Mitchell, 445\nU. S. 535, 542 (1980) (Mitchell I); Mitchell II, supra, at\n224.4\n   The difference between a private common-law trust and\nthe statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position\nof the Government as sovereign.

United States, 16 Cl.

This creates an important distinction “between\ncases of private right and those which arise between the\nGovernment and persons subject to its authority in con\nnection with the performance of the constitutional func\ntions of the executive or legislative departments.” Crowell\nv. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).\n   Throughout the history of the Indian trust relationship,\nwe have recognized that the organization and manage\nment of the trust is a sovereign function subject to the\nplenary authority of Congress. See Merrion v. Jicarilla\nApache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 169, n. 18 (1982) (“The\nUnited States retains plenary authority to divest the\ntribes of any attributes of sovereignty”); United States v.\nWheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 319 (1978) (“Congress has plenary\nauthority to legislate for the Indian tribes in all matters,\nincluding their form of government”); Winton v. Amos, 255\nU. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“Congress has plenary authority\nover the Indians and all their tribal relations, and full\npower to legislate concerning their tribal property”); Lone\nWolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553, 565 (1903) (“Plenary\nauthority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been\nexercised by Congress from the beginning, and the power\nhas always been deemed a political one, not subject to be\ncontrolled by the judicial department of the government”);\nCherokee Nation v.

S. 286, 315\n(1911).\n  Because the Indian trust relationship represents an\nexercise of that authority, we have explained that the\nGovernment “has a real and direct interest” in the guardi\nanship it exercises over the Indian tribes; “the interest is\none which is vested in it as a sovereign.” United States v.\nMinnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so\nbecause the Government has often structured the trust\nrelationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while\ntrust administration “relat[es] to the welfare of the Indi\nans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress\nhas prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis\ntinctly an interest of the United States.” Heckman v.\nUnited States, 224 U. S. 413, 437 (1912); see also Cande\nlaria, supra, at 443–444.\n  In Heckman, the Government brought suit to cancel\ncertain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an\nIndian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions\non alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained\nthat the Government brought suit as the representative of\nthe very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to\ncancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the\njudgment. 224 U. S., at 445–446. But while it was for\nmally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact\nasserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of\nIndian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter\nvening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to\nthat of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was\npossible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role\nover the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the\ngoverning authority enforcing statutory law.\n  We do not question “the undisputed existence of a gen\neral trust relationship between the United States and the\nIndian people.” Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The Gov\nernment, following “a humane and self imposed policy . . .\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

United\nStates, 316 U. S. 286, 296–297 (1942), obligations “to the\nfulfillment of which the national honor has been commit\nted,” Heckman, supra, at 437. Congress has expressed\nthis policy in a series of statutes that have defined and\nredefined the trust relationship between the United States\nand the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab\nlished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow\npurpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress in\ntended the United States to hold land “ ‘in trust’ ” under\nthe General Allotment Act “simply because it wished to\nprevent alienation of the land and to ensure that allottees\nwould be immune from state taxation”); Navajo I, 537\nU. S., at 507–508 (Indian Mineral Leasing Act imposes no\n“detailed fiduciary responsibilities” nor is the Government\n“expressly invested with responsibility to secure ‘the needs\nand best interests of the Indian owner’ ”).\n   In other cases, we have found that particular “statutes\nand regulations . . . clearly establish fiduciary obligations\nof the Government” in some areas. Mitchell II, supra, at\n226; see also United States v. White Mountain Apache\nTribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475 (2003). Once federal law imposes\nsuch duties, the common law “could play a role.” United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Navajo\nII) (slip op., at 14). We have looked to common-law princi\nples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to deter\nmine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed. See\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe, supra, at 475–476. But the\napplicable statutes and regulations “establish [the] fiduci\nary relationship and define the contours of the United\nStates’ fiduciary responsibilities.” Mitchell II, supra, at\n224. When “the Tribe cannot identify a specific, applica\nble, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Govern\nment violated, . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’ over\n[Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.”\n14       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nNavajo II, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).5 The Government\nassumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.6\n   Over the years, we have described the federal relation\nship with the Indian tribes using various formulations.\nThe Indian tribes have been called “domestic dependent\nnations,” Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831),\nunder the “tutelage” of the United States, Heckman, su\npra, at 444, and subject to “the exercise of the Govern\nment’s guardianship over . . . their affairs,” United States\nv. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 48 (1913). These concepts do\nnot necessarily correspond to a common-law trust rela\ntionship. See, e.g., Restatement 2d, §7 (“A guardianship is\nnot a trust”). That is because Congress has chosen to\nstructure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.\nWe will apply common-law trust principles where Con\ngress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that\nreason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by stat\nute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged\ninformation from the Government against its wishes.\n                             III\n  In this case, the Tribe’s claim arises from 25 U. S. C.\n§§161–162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Man\nagement Reform Act of 1994, §4001 et seq. These pro\nvisions define “the trust responsibilities of the United\nStates” with respect to tribal funds. §162a(d). The Court\nof Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between\nthe United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these\nand other statutes, is “sufficiently similar to a private\ntrust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.” 590\n——————\n  5 Thus, the dissent’s reliance on the Government’s “managerial con\n\ntrol,” post, at 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), is misplaced.\n  6 Cf. Restatement 2d, §25, Comment a (“[A]lthough the settlor has\n\ncalled the transaction a trust[,] no trust is created unless he manifests\nan intention to impose duties which are enforceable in the courts”).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

We disagree.\n  As we have discussed, the Government exercises its\ncarefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign\ncapacity to implement national policy respecting the In\ndian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary\nexception—the beneficiary’s status as the “real client” and\nthe trustee’s common-law duty to disclose information\nabout the trust—are notably absent in the trust relation\nship Congress has established between the United States\nand the Tribe.\n                              A\n   The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception\nbased on its determination that the Tribe rather than\nthe Government was the “real client” with respect to the\nGovernment attorneys’ advice. Ibid. In cases applying the\nfiduciary exception, courts identify the “real client” based\non whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,\nwhether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per\nsonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the\nadvice could have been intended for any purpose other\nthan to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711–712.\nApplying these factors, we conclude that the United States\ndoes not obtain legal advice as a “mere representative” of\nthe Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom that\nadvice is intended. See ibid.\n   Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con\ngressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts\nlook to the source of funds as a “strong indicator of pre\ncisely who the real clients were” and a “significant factor”\nin determining who ought to have access to the legal\nadvice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that\nthe attorneys were paid by the Government for advice\nregarding the Government’s statutory obligations.\n   The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov\nernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthan as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt\nedly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from\nthe Government’s management of tribal trusts. That\nintention represents “a humane and self imposed policy”\nbased on felt “moral obligations.” Seminole Nation, 316\nU. S., at 296–297. This statutory purpose does not imply a\nfull common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, §25,\nComment b (“No trust is created if the settlor manifests an\nintention to impose merely a moral obligation”). Congress\nmakes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign\ngoverning authority, and the implementation of federal\npolicy remains “distinctly an interest of the United\nStates.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that\n“the United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active\ninterest” in the disposition of Indian assets because the\nterms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the\nUnited States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469\n(1907).\n   In some prior cases, we have found that the Government\nhad established the trust relationship in order to impose\nits own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,\nat 544 (Congress “intended that the United States ‘hold\nthe land . . . in trust’ . . . because it wished to prevent\nalienation of the land”). In other cases, the Government\nhas invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter\nference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min\nnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande\nlaria, 271 U. S., at 442–444; United States v. Kagama, 118\nU. S. 375, 382–384 (1886). And the exercise of federal\nauthority thereby established has often been “left under\nthe acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive\n——————\n   7 Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous Court, insisted that\n\nthe “national interest” in the management of Indian affairs “is not to be\nexpressed in terms of property, or to be limited to the assertion of rights\nincident to the ownership of a reversion or to the holding of a technical\ntitle in trust.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nDepartment.” Heckman, supra, at 446. In this way, Con\ngress has designed the trust relationship to serve the\ninterests of the United States as well as to benefit the\nIndian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432,\n443 (1903) (trust relationship “ ‘authorizes the adoption on\nthe part of the United States of such policy as their own\npublic interests may dictate’ ” (quoting Choctaw Nation v.\nUnited States, 119 U. S. 1, 28 (1886))).8\n  We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that “[t]he\ngovernment and its officials who obtained the advice have\nno stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their\ntrustee role,” Brief for Respondent 9, or that “the United\nStates’ interests in trust administration were identical to\n——————\n  8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid\n\nered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For\nexample, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was\n“a comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in\nAmerican society.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §1.04,\np. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the\nassimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually\nowned allotments. The federal policy aimed “to substitute a new in\ndividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.” Id., at 79.\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift\naway “from assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect\nfor traditional aspects of Indian culture.” Cohen §1.05, at 84. The Act\nprohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,\n88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.\n4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,\nand social programs for themselves. Cohen §1.07, at 103. This\nstrengthened self-government supported Congress’ decision to author\nize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control\nand place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund\nManagement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242–4244; see 25\nU. S. C. §§4021–4029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the\nIndian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to\nthe trust relationship—forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining\nalienation—does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common\nlaw trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and\nadministered as an instrument of federal policy.\n18     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,” Brief\nfor National Congress of American Indians et al. as Amici\nCuriae 5. The United States has a sovereign interest in\nthe administration of Indian trusts distinct from the pri\nvate interests of those who may benefit from its admini\nstration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the\nground that “management does not manage for itself.”\nGarner, 430 F. 2d, at 1101; Wachtel, 482 F. 3d, at 232\n(“[O]f central importance in both Garner and Riggs was\nthe fiduciary’s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the\nlegal advice obtained”). But the Government is never in\nthat position. While one purpose of the Indian trust rela\ntionship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its\nown independent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy. For that reason, when the Government\nseeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal\ntrusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship re\nlated to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal\nlaw. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in\na “personal” rather than a fiduciary capacity. See Riggs,\n355 A. 2d, at 711.\n   Moreover, the Government has too many competing\nlegal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the\npurpose of each communication. When “multiple inter\nests” are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence\nbetween the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee\nbreaks down. Id., at 714. That principle applies with\nparticular force to the Government. Because of the multi\nple interests it must represent, “the Government cannot\nfollow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who\nwould breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by\nrepresenting potentially conflicting interests without the\nbeneficiary’s consent.” Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S.\n110, 128 (1983).\n   As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Government\nmay be obliged “to balance competing interests” when it\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadministers a tribal trust. 590 F. 3d, at 1315. The Gov\nernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,\nsuch as the environmental and conservation obligations\nthat the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314–\n1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga\ntions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,\nNance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal\nGovernment has “conflicting fiduciary responsibilities” to\nthe Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley\nTribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (“No\ntrust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain\ntiff here at the expense of other Indians”). Within the\nbounds of its “general trust relationship” with the Indian\npeople, we have recognized that the Government has\n“discretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub\ngroup of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all\nIndians nationwide.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195\n(1993); see also ibid. (“Federal Government ‘does have a\nfiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary\nobligation that is owed to all Indian tribes’ ” (quoting\nHoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we\nhave seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes\nto dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of\nthose for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov\nernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in\nbalancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of\nconsulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict\ning interests are at stake.\n   The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov\nernment’s multiple obligations by suggesting that the\nGovernment may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it\nidentifies “a specific competing interest” that was consid\nered in the particular communications it seeks to with\nhold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the\nGovernment must consider are too pervasive for such a\ncase-by-case approach to be workable.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be\neffective, it must be predictable. See Jaffee v. Redmond,\n518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996); Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the\nGovernment were required to identify the specific inter\nests it considered in each communication, its ability to\nreceive confidential legal advice would be substantially\ncompromised. The Government will not always be able to\npredict what considerations qualify as a “specific compet\ning interest,” especially in advance of receiving counsel’s\nadvice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the consid\nerations contained in each communication with counsel\nwould render its attorney-client privilege “little better\nthan no privilege at all.” Ibid.\n                             B\n   The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary excep\ntion properly applied to the Government because “the\nfiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to\ntrust management to the beneficiary.” 590 F. 3d, at 1312.\nIn general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust\nmust produce trust-related information to the beneficiary\non a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes\nlimited and may be modified by the settlor. Restatement\n(Third) of Trusts §82 (2005) (hereinafter Restatement 3d);\nBogert §§962, 965.9 The fiduciary exception applies where\n——————\n   9 We assume for the sake of argument that an Indian trust is properly\n\nanalogized to an irrevocable trust rather than to a revocable trust. A\nrevocable trust imposes no duty of the trustee to disclose information to\nthe beneficiary. “[W]hile a trust is revocable, only the person who may\nrevoke it is entitled to receive information about it from the trustee.”\nBogert §962, at 25, §964; Restatement 3d, §74, Comment e, at 31\n(“[T]he trustee of a revocable trust is not to provide reports or account\nings or other information concerning the terms or administration of the\ntrust to other beneficiaries without authorization either by the settlor\nor in the terms of the trust or a statute”). In many respects, Indian\ntrusts resemble revocable trusts at common law because Congress has\nacted as the settlor in establishing the trust and retains the right to\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9\n1999) (“[T]he fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle”).\n  The United States, however, does not have the same\ncommon-law disclosure obligations as a private trustee.\nAs we have previously said, common-law principles are\nrelevant only when applied to a “specific, applicable, trust\ncreating statute or regulation.” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14). The relevant statute in this case is 25\nU. S. C. §162a(d), which delineates “trust responsibilities\nof the United States” that the Secretary of the Interior\nmust discharge. The enumerated responsibilities include\na provision identifying the Secretary’s obligation to pro\nvide specific information to tribal account holders: The\nSecretary must “suppl[y] account holders with periodic\nstatements of their account performance” and must make\n“available on a daily basis” the “balances of their account.”\n§162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re\nquirements by adopting regulations that instruct the\nOffice of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe\nwith a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR\n§115.801 (2010), that identifies “the source, type, and\nstatus of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust\naccount; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;\nreceipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal\nance of the quarterly statement period,” §115.803. Tribes\nmay request more frequent statements or further “infor\n——————\nalter the terms of the trust by statute, even in derogation of tribal\nproperty interests. See Winton v. Amos, 255 U. S. 373, 391 (1921) (“It is\nthoroughly established that Congress has plenary authority over the\nIndians . . . and full power to legislate concerning their tribal prop\nerty”); Cohen §5.02[4], at 401–403. The Government has not advanced\nthe argument that the relationship here is similar to a revocable trust,\nand the point need not be addressed to resolve this case.\n22       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmation about account transactions and balances.”\n§115.802.\n   The common law of trusts does not override the specific\ntrust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.\nThose provisions define the Government’s disclosure ob\nligation to the Tribe. The Tribe emphasizes, Brief for\nRespondent 34, that the statute identifies the list of trust\nresponsibilities as nonexhaustive. See §162a(d) (trust\nresponsibilities “are not limited to” those enumerated).\nThe Government replies that this clause “is best read to\nrefer to other statutory and regulatory requirements”\nrather than to common-law duties. Brief for United States\n38. Whatever Congress intended, we cannot read the\nclause to include a general common-law duty to disclose\nall information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts. When Congress provides specific statutory obliga\ntions, we will not read a “catchall” provision to impose\ngeneral obligations that would include those specifically\nenumerated. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,\n473 U. S. 134, 141–142 (1985). “As our cases have noted\nin the past, we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a\ncongressional enactment which renders superfluous an\nother portion of that same law.” Mackey v. Lanier Collec\ntion Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825, 837 (1988).\nReading the statute to incorporate the full duties of a\nprivate, common-law fiduciary would vitiate Congress’\nspecification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations.10\n——————\n  10 Our reading of 25 U. S. C. §162a(d) receives additional support from\n\nanother statute in which Congress expressed its understanding that\nthe Government retains evidentiary privileges allowing it to withhold\ninformation related to trust property from Indian tribes. The Indian\nClaims Limitation Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 1976, addressed Indian claims\nthat the claimants desired to have litigated by the United States. If the\nSecretary of the Interior decided to reject a claim for litigation, he was\nrequired to furnish a report to the affected Indian claimants and, upon\ntheir request, to provide “any nonprivileged research materials or\nevidence gathered by the United States in the documentation of such\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Just as the source of the funds used to pay for\nlegal advice is highly relevant in identifying the “real\nclient” for purposes of the fiduciary exception, we consider\nownership of the resulting records to be a significant\nfactor in deciding who “ought to have access to the docu\nment.” See Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 712. In this case, that\nprivilege belongs to the United States.11\n\n                         *    *     *\n   Courts and commentators have long recognized that\n“[n]ot every aspect of private trust law can properly govern\nthe unique relationship of tribes and the federal govern\nment.” Cohen §5.02[2], at 434–435. The fiduciary excep\ntion to the attorney-client privilege ranks among those\naspects inapplicable to the Government’s administration\nof Indian trusts. The Court of Appeals denied the Gov\nernment’s petition for a writ of mandamus based on its\nerroneous view to the contrary. We leave it for that court\nto determine whether the standards for granting the writ\n\n\n——————\nclaim.” Id., at 1978. That Congress authorized the withholding of\ninformation on grounds of privilege makes us doubt that Congress\nunderstood the Government’s trust obligations to override so basic a\nprivilege as that between attorney and client.\n  11 The dissent tells us that applying the fiduciary exception is even\n\nmore important against the Government than against a private trustee\nbecause of a “history of governmental mismanagement.” Post, at 21.\nWhile it is not necessary to our decision, we note that the Indian tribes\nare not required to keep their funds in federal trust. See 25 U. S. C.\n§4022 (authorizing tribes to withdraw funds held in trust by the United\nStates); 25 CFR pt. 1200(B).

United States, 224 U. S. 413,\n437 (1912). This unique “national interest,” ibid., obli\ngates Government attorneys, in rendering advice, to make\ntheir own “independent evaluation of the law and facts” in\nan effort “to arrive at a single position of the United\nStates,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a (Letter from Attorney\nGeneral Griffin B. Bell to Secretary of the Interior Cecil D.\nAndrus (May 31, 1979)). “For that reason,” as the Court\nexplains, “the Government seeks legal advice in a ‘per\nsonal’ rather than a fiduciary capacity.” Ante, at 18. The\nattorney-client privilege thus protects the Government’s\ncommunications with its attorneys from disclosure.\n   Going beyond attorney-client communications, the Court\nholds that the Government “assumes Indian trust respon\nsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts those\nresponsibilities by statute.” Ante, at 14.

The interests of the Federal Government as\ntrustee and the Jicarilla Apache Nation (Nation) as bene\nficiary are thus entirely aligned in the context of Indian\ntrust fund management. Where, as here, the governing\nstatutory scheme establishes a conventional fiduciary\nrelationship, the Government’s duties include fiduciary\nobligations derived from common-law trust principles.\nBecause the common-law rationales for the fiduciary\nexception fully support its application in this context, I\nwould hold that the Government may not rely on the\nattorney-client privilege to withhold from the Nation\ncommunications between the Government and its attor\nneys relating to trust fund management.\n   The Court’s decision to the contrary rests on false fac\ntual and legal premises and deprives the Nation and other\nIndian tribes of highly relevant evidence in scores of pend\ning cases seeking relief for the Government’s alleged\nmismanagement of their trust funds. But perhaps more\ntroubling is the majority’s disregard of our settled prece\ndent that looks to common-law trust principles to define\nthe scope of the Government’s fiduciary obligations to\n2      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nIndian tribes. Indeed, aspects of the majority’s opinion\nsuggest that common-law principles have little or no re\nlevance in the Indian trust context, a position this Court\nrejected long ago. Although today’s holding pertains only\nto a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the\nmajority’s opinion may well be a further dilution of the\nGovernment’s fiduciary obligations that will have broader\nnegative repercussions for the relationship between the\nUnited States and Indian tribes.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part\nthat “the privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be gov\nerned by the principles of the common law as they may be\ninterpreted by the courts of the United States in the light\nof reason and experience.” Rule 501 “was adopted pre\ncisely because Congress wished to leave privilege ques\ntions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.”\nUnited States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U. S. 792, 804,\nn. 25 (1984).\n   As the majority notes, the purpose of the attorney-client\nprivilege “is to encourage full and frank communication\nbetween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote\nbroader public interests in the observance of law and\nadministration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States,\n449 U. S. 383, 389 (1981). But the majority neglects to\nexplain that the privilege is a limited exception to the\nusual rules of evidence requiring full disclosure of relevant\ninformation. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2192, p. 64 (3d\ned. 1940) (common law recognizes “fundamental maxim\nthat the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence”\nand that “any exemptions which may exist are distinctly\nexceptional, being so many derogations from a positive\ngeneral rule”).

It applies “only where necessary to\nachieve its purpose,” ibid.; “[w]here this purpose ends, so\ntoo does the protection of the privilege,” Wachtel v. Health\nNet, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 231 (CA3 2007).\n   The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege\nhas its roots in 19th-century English common-law cases\nholding that, “when a trustee obtained legal advice relat\ning to his administration of the trust, and not in antici\npation of adversarial legal proceedings against him, the\nbeneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of\nthat advice.” Ibid. (collecting cases). The fiduciary excep\ntion is now well recognized in the jurisprudence of both\nfederal and state courts,1 and has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts, including in litigation involving com\nmon-law trusts, see, e.g., Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington,\nD. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709 (Del. Ch. 1976), disputes\nbetween corporations and shareholders, see, e.g., Garner v.\nWolfinbarger, 430 F. 2d 1093 (CA5 1970), and ERISA\nenforcement actions, see, e.g., United States v. Doe, 162\nF. 3d 554 (CA9 1999).\n   The majority correctly identifies the two rationales\ncourts have articulated for applying the fiduciary excep\ntion, ante, at 8–9, but its description of those rationales\nomits a number of important points. With regard to the\nfirst rationale, courts have characterized the trust benefi\nciary as the “real client” of legal advice relating to trust\n——————\n  1 See, e.g., Solis v.

See, e.g., United States v.\nMett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (“ ‘[A]s a represen\ntative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is admin\nistering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that\nhe is personally being served’ ” (quoting United States v.\nEvans, 796 F. 2d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) (per curiam)));\nRiggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713 (same). The majority places\nheavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal\nadvice, see ante, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who\npays for the legal advice, although “potentially relevant,”\n“is not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.”\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts §82, Comment f, p. 188\n(2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Instead, the\nlynchpin of the “real client” inquiry is the identity of the\nultimate beneficiary of the legal advice. See Wachtel, 482\nF. 3d, at 232 (“[O]f central importance . . . [i]s the fiduci\nary’s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the legal\nadvice obtained”). If the advice was rendered for the\nbenefit of the beneficiary and not for the trustee in any\npersonal capacity, the “real client” of the advice is the\nbeneficiary.\n   As to the second rationale for the fiduciary exception—\nrooted in the trustee’s fiduciary duty to disclose all infor\nmation related to trust management—the majority glosses\nover the fact that this duty of disclosure is designed “to\nenable the beneficiary to prevent or redress a breach of\ntrust and otherwise to enforce his or her rights under the\ntrust.” Third Restatement §82, Comment a(2), at 184. As\nthe leading American case on the fiduciary exception\nexplains, “[i]n order for the beneficiaries to hold the trus\ntee to the proper standards of care and honesty and pro\ncure for themselves the benefits to which they are entitled,\ntheir knowledge of the affairs and mechanics of the trust\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Courts\njustifying the fiduciary exception under this rationale\nhave thus concluded that “[t]he policy of preserving the\nfull disclosure necessary in the trustee-beneficiary rela\ntionship is . . . ultimately more important than the pro\ntection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for the\ntrust.” Id., at 714; see Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063 (under this\nrationale, “the fiduciary exception can be understood as an\ninstance of the attorney-client privilege giving way in the\nface of a competing legal principle”). The majority fails to\nappreciate the important oversight and accountability\ninterests that underlie this rationale for the fiduciary ex\nception, or explain why they operate with any less force in\nthe Indian trust context.\n                              B\n   The question in this case is whether the fiduciary excep\ntion applies in the Indian trust context such that the\nGovernment may not rely on the attorney-client privilege\nto withhold from the Nation communications between the\nGovernment and its attorneys relating to the administra\ntion of the Nation’s trust fund accounts. Answering that\nquestion requires a proper understanding of the nature of\nthe Government’s trust relationship with Indian tribes,\nparticularly with regard to its management of Indian trust\nfunds.\n   Since 1831, this Court has recognized the existence of a\ngeneral trust relationship between the United States and\nIndian tribes. See Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17\n(1831) (Marshall, C. J.). Our decisions over the past cen\ntury have repeatedly reaffirmed this “distinctive obliga\ntion of trust incumbent upon the Government” in its deal\nings with Indians. Seminole Nation v. United States, 316\nU. S. 286, 296 (1942); see United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 225–226 (1983) (Mitchell II) (collecting cases\nand noting “the undisputed existence of a general trust\n6            UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrelationship between the United States and the Indian\npeople”). Congress, too, has recognized the general trust\nrelationship between the United States and Indian tribes.\nIndeed, “[n]early every piece of modern legislation dealing\nwith Indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the\ntrust relationship between tribes and the federal govern\nment.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law\n§5.04[4][a], pp. 420–421 (2005 ed.) (hereinafter Cohen).2\n   Against this backdrop, Congress has enacted federal\nstatutes that “define the contours of the United States’\nfiduciary responsibilities” with regard to its management\nof Indian tribal property and other trust assets. Mitchell\nII, 463 U. S., at 224. The Nation’s claims as relevant in\nthis case concern the Government’s alleged mismanage\nment of its tribal trust fund accounts. See ante, at 3.\n   The system of trusteeship and federal management of\nIndian funds originated with congressional enactments in\nthe 19th century directing the Government to hold and\nmanage Indian tribal funds in trust. See, e.g., Act of June\n9, 1837, 5 Stat. 135; see also Misplaced Trust: The Bureau\nof Indian Affairs’ Mismanagement of the Indian Trust\nFund, H. R. Rep. No. 102–449, p. 6 (1992) (hereinafter\nMisplaced Trust). Through these and later congressional\nenactments, the United States has come to manage almost\n$3 billion in tribal funds and collects close to $380 million\nper year on behalf of tribes. Cohen §5.03[3][b], at 407.3\n——————\n    2 See,e.g., 25 U. S. C. §458cc(a) (directing Secretary of the Interior to\nenter into funding agreements with Indian tribes “in a manner consis\ntent with the Federal Government’s laws and trust relationship to and\nresponsibility for the Indian people”); §3701 (finding that the Govern\nment “has a trust responsibility to protect, conserve, utilize, and\nmanage Indian agricultural lands consistent with its fiduciary obliga\ntion and its unique relationship with Indian tribes”); 20 U.

In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury, at the\nrequest of the Secretary of the Interior, must invest “[a]ll\nfunds held in trust by the United States . . . to the credit of\nIndian tribes” in certain securities “suitable to the needs\nof the fund involved.” 25 U. S. C. §161a(a). The Secretary\nof the Interior may deposit in the Treasury and pay manda\ntory interest on Indian trust funds when “the best inter\nests of the Indians will be promoted by such deposits, in\nlieu of investments.” §161. Similarly, the Secretary of the\nInterior may invest tribal trust funds in certain public\ndebt instruments “if he deems it advisable and for the best\ninterest of the Indians.” §162a(a). And Congress has set\nforth a nonexhaustive list of the Secretary of the Interior’s\n“trust responsibilities” with respect to Indian trust funds,\nwhich include a series of accounting, auditing, manage\nment, and disclosure obligations. §162a(d). These and\nother statutory provisions4 give the United States “full\nresponsibility to manage Indian [trust fund accounts] for\nthe benefit of the Indians.” Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 224.\n   “[A] fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the\nGovernment assumes such elaborate control over [trust\nassets] belonging to Indians.” Id., at 225. Under the\n——————\nthrough the sale or lease of trust lands and include timber stumpage,\noil and gas royalties, and agriculture fees,” as well as “judgment funds\nawarded to tribes.” H. R. Rep. No. 103–778, p. 9 (1994). The Nation’s\nclaims involve proceeds derived from the Government’s management of\nthe Nation’s timber, gravel, and other resources and leases of reserva\ntion lands. The Government has held these funds in trust for the\nNation since the late 1880’s. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a–100a, 105a.\n   4 See, e.g., 25 U. S.

Mitchell, 445 U.

Under the statute, “the Indian allottee, and\nnot a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the\nland for agricultural or grazing purposes.” Id., at 542–543. Accord\ningly, we concluded that Congress did not intend to “impose upon the\nGovernment all fiduciary duties ordinarily placed by equity upon a\ntrustee” because the statute “created only a limited trust relationship\nbetween the United States and the allottee.” Id., at 542; see also\nNavajo I, 537 U.

S.\n700, 707 (1987)).\n                             II\n  In light of Federal Rule of Evidence 501 and the Gov\nernment’s role as a conventional fiduciary in managing\nIndian trust fund accounts, I would hold as a matter of\nfederal common law that the fiduciary exception is appli\ncable in the Indian trust context, and thus the Govern\nment may not rely on the attorney-client privilege to\nwithhold communications related to trust management.\nAs explained below, the twin rationales for the fiduciary\nexception fully support its application in this context. The\nmajority’s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed fac\ntual and legal premises.\n                             A\n   When the Government seeks legal advice from a gov\nernment attorney on matters relating to the management\nof the Nation’s trust funds, the “real client” of that advice\nfor purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not\nthe Government. The majority’s rejection of that conclu\nsion is premised on its erroneous view that the Govern\nment, in managing the Nation’s trust funds, “has its own\nindependent interest in the implementation of federal\nIndian policy” that diverges from the interest of the Na\ntion as beneficiary. Ante, at 18; see also ante, at 1\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter,\nthe Government has sovereign interests in managing\nIndian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194\n(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern\nment’s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered\nand administered the trust relationship “as an instrument\nof federal policy.” Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in\n10      UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npolicy); see generally Cobell v. Norton, 240 F. 3d 1081,\n1086–1088 (CADC 2001) (same, and describing that his\ntory as “contentious and tragic”).\n  In the specific context of Indian trust fund management,\nhowever, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests\nof the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as\nbeneficiary. As explained above, Congress has enacted an\nextensive network of statutes regulating the Government’s\nmanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu\ntory framework establishes a “conventional fiduciary re\nlationship” in the context of Indian trust fund admini\nstration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n14) (internal quotation marks omitted); see supra, at 7–9.\n  As a conventional fiduciary, the Government’s manage\nment of Indian trust funds must “be judged by the most\nexacting fiduciary standards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S.,\nat 296–297. Among the most fundamental fiduciary obli\ngations of a trustee is “to administer the trust solely in the\ninterest of the beneficiaries.” 2A A. Scott & W. Fratcher,\nLaw of Trusts §170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see Meinhard v.\nSalmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 464, 164 N. E. 545, 546 (1928)\n(Cardozo, C. J.) (“Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of\nan honor the most sensitive,” is “the standard of behavior”\nfor trustees “bound by fiduciary ties”). Although Indian\ntrust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury,\n“they are not part of the federal government’s general\nfunds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.”\nCohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 140 (citing Quick Bear v.\nLeupp, 210 U. S. 50, 80–81 (1908)).\n  Because federal Indian policy requires the Government\nto act strictly as a conventional fiduciary in managing the\nNation’s trust funds, the Government acts in a “represen\ntative” rather than “persona[l]” capacity when managing\nthe Nation’s trust funds. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713. By law,\nthe Government cannot pursue any “independent” inter\nest, ante, at 18, distinct from its responsibilities as a fidu\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

See Cohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 141 (“Federal\nstatutes forbid use of Indian tribal funds in any man\nner not authorized by treaty or express provisions of\nlaw” (citing 25 U. S. C. §§122, 123)). In other words, any\nuniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in\nother contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes\ndoes not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund\nadministration. It naturally follows, then, that when the\nGovernment seeks legal advice from government attorneys\nrelating to the management of the Nation’s trust funds,\nthe “real client” of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary\nexception is the Nation, not the Government.\n  This conclusion holds true even though government\nattorneys are “paid out of congressional appropriations\nat no cost to the [Nation].” Ante, at 15. As noted above,\nalthough the source of funding for legal advice may be\nrelevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the\nlegal advice was rendered. See supra, at 4. And, for all\nthe emphasis the majority places on the funding source\nhere, see ante, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that\nthe fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended\nfederal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government\nattorneys out of their own trust funds.6\n  The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of\nthe United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in\nsome contexts, that “equivalence” “breaks down” when\nthere are “multiple interests” involved in a trust relation\nship. Ante, at 18. According to the majority, “the Gov\nernment has too many competing legal concerns to allow a\ncase-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communica\n——————\n  6 The majority also states that ownership of the requested documents\n\nis “a significant factor” in deciding whether the fiduciary exception\napplies, ante, at 23, but the only case it cites as support deals with the\nsource of payment for the legal advice, not the ownership of the docu\nments. See ibid. (citing Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v.\nZimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, 712 (Del. Ch. 1976)).\n12       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion.” Ibid. As a result, the majority concludes that the\nfiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the\nIndian trust context. Ibid.\n   Preliminarily, while the Government in certain circum\nstances may have sovereign obligations that conflict with\nits duties as a fiduciary for Indian tribes, see, e.g., Nevada\nv. United States, 463 U. S. 110 (1983),7 the existence of\ncompeting interests is not unique to the Government as\ntrustee. Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises\nfrequently in the private trust context. See, e.g., Third\nRestatement §78, Comment c, at 97–103 (describing duties\nof trustee with respect to “transactions that involve con\nflicting fiduciary and personal interests”); id., §79,\nComment b, at 128–129 (describing trustee’s duty of impar\ntiality in “balancing . . . competing interests” of multiple\nbeneficiaries). In such circumstances, “a trustee—and\nultimately a court—may need to provide some response\nthat offers a compromise between the confidentiality or\nprivacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs\n——————\n   7 In Nevada, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation\n\ninvolving water rights even though it was also required by statute to\nrepresent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U. S., at\n128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior\n“both the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the\ncommencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation\nlands”). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that “it\nis simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform\nits obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has\nobliged it to represent other interests as well.” Ibid. We thus observed\nin the context of that case that “the Government cannot follow the\nfastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties\nto his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting\ninterests without the beneficiary’s consent.” Ibid. We expressly distin\nguished the context “where only a relationship between the Govern\nment and the tribe is involved.” Id., at 142. In that context, we ac\nknowledged that “the law respecting obligations between a trustee and\na beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects\nadequately describe the duty of the United States.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nof others.” Id., §82, Comment f, at 188. The majority\nprovides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduci\nary exception in the Indian trust context could not simi\nlarly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes\ninto account any unique governmental interests that bear\non the application of the fiduciary exception in any given\ncircumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (au\nthorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equita\nble concerns).\n   The majority’s categorical rejection of the fiduciary\nexception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader\nthan necessary. This case involves only the Government’s\nalleged mismanagement of the Nation’s trust fund ac\ncounts, and the Government did not claim below that the\nattorney-client communications at issue relate to any\ncompeting governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 18a–19a. To the extent the United States in other\ncontexts has competing interests, the Government and its\nattorneys already have to identify those interests in de\ntermining how to balance them against their obligations to\nIndian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating\nto those interests may properly be withheld or redacted\nconsistent with application of the fiduciary exception. See\n88 Fed. Cl. 1, 13 (2009) (observing that redactions “allo[w]\nthe privilege and exception to reign supreme within their\nrespective spheres”).\n   The majority’s categorical approach fails to appreciate\nthat privilege determinations are by their very nature\nmade on a case-by-case—indeed, document-by-document—\nbasis. Government attorneys, like private counsel, must\nreview each requested document and make an individual\nized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privi\nlege logs and challenges must do the same. “While such a\n‘case-by-case’ basis may to some slight extent undermine\ndesirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client\nprivilege, it obeys the spirit of” of Rule 501, Upjohn, 449\n14     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 396–397, which “ ‘provide[s] the courts with the\nflexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case\nbasis,’ ” Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S. 40, 47 (1980)\n(quoting 120 Cong. Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of Rep.\nHungate)); see S. Rep. No. 93–1277, p. 13 (1974) (“[T]he\nrecognition of a privilege based on a confidential relation\nship . . . should be determined on a case-by-case basis”).\n   Rather than fashioning a blanket rule against applica\ntion of the fiduciary exception in the Indian trust context,\nI would, consistent with Rule 501 and principles of judicial\nrestraint, decide the question solely on the facts before us.\nSee Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 386 (noting that “we sit to decide\nconcrete cases and not abstract propositions of law” and\n“declin[ing] to lay down a broad rule or series of rules to\ngovern all conceivable future questions in this area”). On\nthose facts, the fiduciary exception applies to the commu\nnications in this case.\n                              B\n  Like the “real client” rationale, the second rationale for\nthe fiduciary exception, rooted in a trustee’s fiduciary duty\nto disclose all matters relevant to trust administration to\nthe beneficiary, fully supports disclosure of the communi\ncations in this case. As explained above, courts relying on\nthis second rationale have recognized that “[t]he policy of\npreserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee\nbeneficiary relationship is . . . ultimately more important\nthan the protection of the trustees’ confidence in the at\ntorney for the trust.” Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 714. Because\nthe statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a\nconventional fiduciary in managing the Nation’s trust\nfunds, the Government’s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation\ninformed of matters relating to trust administration in\ncludes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client\ncommunications relating to trust fund management.

In\nparticular, the majority states that the Government “as\nsumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,” and\nthus the Nation “must point to a right conferred by statute\nor regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged in\nformation from the Government against its wishes.” Ante,\nat 14.

S. C. §162a(d)(5) and 25\nCFR §§115.801–115.803 (2010)). Because those “narrowly\ndefined disclosure obligations” do not provide Indian tribes\nwith a specific statutory right to disclosure of attorney\nclient communications relating to trust administration,\nante, at 22, the majority concludes that the Government\nhas no duty to disclose those communications to the\nNation.\n   The majority’s conclusion employs a fundamentally\nflawed legal premise. We have never held that all of the\nGovernment’s trust responsibilities to Indians must be set\nforth expressly in a specific statute or regulation. To the\ncontrary, where, as here, the statutory framework estab\nlishes that the relationship between the Government and\nan Indian tribe “bears the hallmarks of a conventional\nfiduciary relationship,” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at __ (slip op.,\nat 14) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have consis\ntently looked to general trust principles to flesh out the\nGovernment’s fiduciary obligations.\n16       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  For example, in United States v. White Mountain\nApache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465 (2003), we construed a statute\nthat vested the Government with discretionary authority\nto “use” trust property for certain purposes as imposing a\nconcomitant duty to preserve improvements that had\npreviously been made to the land. Id., at 475 (quoting 74\nStat. 8). Even though the statute did not “expressly sub\nject the Government to duties of management and conser\nvation,” we construed the Government’s obligations under\nthe statute by reference to “elementary trust law,” which\n“confirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary\nactually administering trust property may not allow it to\nfall into ruin on his watch.” 537 U. S., at 475. Similarly,\nin Seminole Nation, we relied on general trust principles\nto conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to\nprevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt\nmembers of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or\ntreaty provision expressly imposed such a duty. See 316\nU. S., at 296.8\n——————\n   8 To be sure, in decisions involving the jurisdiction of the Court of\n\nFederal Claims under the Tucker Act, we have explained that the\njurisdictional analysis “must train on specific rights-creating or duty\nimposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at\n506. But even assuming arguendo that those jurisdictional decisions\nhave relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the\nGovernment’s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express\nstatutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on\ngeneral trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory\nscheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction\nunder the Tucker Act. See, e.g., Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 226 (noting\nthat common-law trust sources establish that “a trustee is accountable\nin damages for breaches of trust” and that, “[g]iven the existence of a\ntrust relationship, it naturally follows that the Government should be\nliable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties”); see also\nNavajo II, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (affirming that general\n“trust principles . . . could play a role in inferring that the trust obliga\ntion is enforceable by damages” (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Accordingly, although the “general ‘contours’ of the\ngovernment’s obligations” are defined by statute, the “in\nterstices must be filled in through reference to general\ntrust law.” Cobell, 240 F. 3d, at 1101 (quoting Mitchell II,\n463 U. S., at 224). This approach accords with our recog\nnition in other trust contexts that “the primary function of\nthe fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discre\ntionary powers which are controlled by no other specific\nduty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.”\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 504 (1996) (emphasis\ndeleted); cf. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas\nPension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,\n570 (1985) (“[R]ather than explicitly enumerating all of\nthe powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries,\nCongress invoked the common law of trusts to define the\ngeneral scope of their authority and responsibility”).\nIndeed, “[i]f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more\nthan activities already controlled by other specific legal\nduties, it would serve no purpose.” Howe, 516 U. S., at\n504.\n   The majority pays lip service to these precedents, ac\nknowledging that “[w]e have looked to common-law prin\nciples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to de\ntermine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed.”\nAnte, at 13. But despite its assurance that it “will apply\ncommon-law trust principles where Congress has indi\ncated it is appropriate to do so,” ante, at 14, the majority\ninexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust\nprinciples in this case. In doing so, the majority states\nthat “[t]he common law of trusts does not override the\nspecific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply\nhere.” Ante, at 21–22 (referring to §162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR\n§§115.801–115.803). That statement evidences the major\nity’s fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which\ncommon-law principles operate in the context of a conven\ntional fiduciary relationship.\n18        UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Contrary to the majority’s view, the Government’s dis\nclosure obligations are not limited solely to the “narrowly\ndefined disclosure obligations” set forth in §162a(d)(5) and\nits implementing regulations, ante, at 22; rather, given\nthat the statutory regime requires the Government to act\nas a conventional fiduciary in managing Indian trust\nfunds, the Government’s disclosure obligations include\nthose of a fiduciary under common-law trust principles.\nSee supra, at 15–17. Instead of “overrid[ing]” the specific\ndisclosure duty set forth in §162a(d)(5) and its implement\ning regulations, general trust principles flesh out the\nGovernment’s disclosure obligations under the broader\nstatutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional\nfiduciary in this context.\n   This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text\nof the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d),\nwhich was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust\nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108\nStat. 4239, sets forth eight “trust responsibilities of the\nUnited States.” But that provision also specifically states\nthat the Secretary of the Interior’s “proper discharge of the\ntrust responsibilities of the United States shall include\n(but are not limited to)” those specified duties. 25 U. S. C.\n§162a(d) (emphasis added). By expressly including the\nitalicized language, Congress recognized that the Govern\nment has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out\nof the broader statutory scheme governing the manage\nment of Indian trust funds.9 Indeed, Title I of the 1994\n——————\n  9 The majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that\nthe “catchall” phrase (by which it means the “shall include (but are not\nlimited to)” language) cannot be read to “include a general common-law\nduty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian\ntrusts” because doing so would “impose general obligations that would\ninclude those specifically enumerated.” Ante, at 22. But the flaw in the\nmajority’s argument is that it misperceives the function of the relevant\nlanguage. Rather than serving as a “catchall” provision that affirma\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    19\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAct is entitled “Recognition of Trust Responsibility,” 108\nStat. 4240 (emphasis added), and courts have similarly\nobserved that the Act “recognized and reaffirmed . . . that\nthe government has longstanding and substantial trust\nobligations to Indians.” Cobell, 240 F. 3d, at 1098; see also\nH. R. Rep. No. 103–778, p. 9 (1994) (“The responsibility for\nmanagement of Indian Trust Funds by the [Government]\nhas been determined through a series of court decisions,\ntreaties, and statutes”). That conclusion accords with\ncommon sense as not even the Government argues that it\nhad no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust\nfunds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.10\n   The majority requires the Nation to “point to a right\nconferred by statute” to the attorney-client communica\ntions at issue, ante, at 14, and finding none, denies the\n——————\ntively “incorporate[s]” common-law trust duties into §162a(d), ante, at\n22, that language simply makes clear that §162a(d) does not set forth\nan exhaustive list of the Government’s trust responsibilities in manag\ning Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any\nsubstantive obligations into the statute.\n   10 The majority also contends that its reading of §162a(d) is supported\n\nby a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96\nStat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected\na claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide\nupon request “any nonprivileged research materials or evidence gath\nered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.” §5(b),\nid., at 1978. According to the majority, this provision reflected Con\ngress’ understanding that “the Government retains evidentiary privi\nleges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from\nIndian tribes.” Ante, at 22, n. 11. But this provision cannot bear the\nweight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed\nfact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the major\nity’s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents\nsubject to the fiduciary exception are, under the “real client” rationale,\nper se nonprivileged. See, e.g., Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if\nanything, the ICLA’s requirement that the Government disclose “non\nprivileged” materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that\nCongress intended communications related to trust fund management\nto be disclosed to Indian tribes.\n20       UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nNation access to those communications. The upshot of\nthat decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the\nposition of the dissenting Justices in White Mountain\nApache and Mitchell II, who rejected the use of common\nlaw principles to inform the scope of the Government’s\nfiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. See White Mountain\nApache, 537 U. S., at 486–487 (THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nMitchell II, 463 U. S., at 234–235 (Powell, J., dissenting).\nThat approach was wrong when Mitchell II was decided\nnearly 30 years ago, and it is wrong today. Under our\ngoverning precedents, common-law trust principles play\nan important role in defining the Government’s fiduciary\nduties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a\nconventional fiduciary relationship. Applying those prin\nciples in this context, I would hold that the fiduciary ex\nception is fully applicable to the communications in this\ncase.11\n——————\n   11 The majority’s errors are further compounded by its failure to ac\n\ncord proper consideration to the mandamus posture of this case. “This\nCourt repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an ex\ntraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.”\nGulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 289\n(1988). “As the writ is one of the most potent weapons in the judicial\narsenal, three conditions must be satisfied before it may issue,” Cheney\nv. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (inter\nnal quotation marks and citation omitted):\n   “First, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other\nadequate means to attain the relief he desires—a condition designed to\nensure that the writ will not be used as a substitute for the regular\nappeals process. Second, the petitioner must satisfy the burden of\nshowing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.\nThird, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing\ncourt, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is\nappropriate under the circumstances.” Id., at 380–381 (internal quota\ntion marks and citations omitted; alterations deleted).\n   The majority purports to leave the decision whether to grant man\ndamus relief to the Federal Circuit, but simultaneously drops a footnote\nstating that it “assume[s]” that the Court of Federal Claims on remand\nwill “follow [its] holding” that the fiduciary exception is inapplicable\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   We have described the Federal Government’s fiduciary\nduties toward Indian tribes as consisting of “moral obliga\ntions of the highest responsibility and trust,” to be fulfilled\nthrough conduct “judged by the most exacting fiduciary\nstandards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S., at 297; see also\nMitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225–226 (collecting cases). The\nsad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Gov\nernment has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in\nmanaging Indian trust fund accounts. See, e.g., Cobell,\n240 F. 3d, at 1089 (“The General Accounting Office, Inte\nrior Department Inspector General, and Office of Man\nagement and Budget, among others, have all condemned\nthe mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the\npast twenty years”); Misplaced Trust 8 (“[T]he [Govern\nment’s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian\ntrust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exer\ncise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expec\ntations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Con\ngress, and taxpayers”); id., at 56 (“[H]ad this type of\nmismanagement taken place in any other trust arrange\nments such as Social Security, there would be war”).\n   As Congress has recognized, “[t]he Indian trust fund is\nmore than balance sheets and accounting procedures.\nThese moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native\nAmerican tribes and a source of income to tens of thou\nsands of native Americans.” Id., at 5. Given the history of\ngovernmental mismanagement of Indian trust funds,\napplication of the fiduciary exception is, if anything, even\nmore important in this context than in the private trustee\n\n——————\nhere. Ante, at 24, and n. 13. By doing so, the majority virtually assures\nthat the Nation will not be able to use the communications at issue in\nthis litigation, thereby effectively granting extraordinary relief to the\nGovernment upon no showing whatsoever that the stringent conditions\nfor mandamus have been met.\n22     UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontext. The majority’s refusal to apply the fiduciary\nexception in this case deprives the Nation—as well as the\nIndian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending\nin the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mis\nmanagement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a–138a—of highly\nrelevant information going directly to the merits of\nwhether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary\nduties. Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns\nexpressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight\nand accountability that has marked the Government’s\nhandling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.\n   But perhaps even more troubling than the majority’s\nrefusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its\ndisregard of our established precedents that affirm the\ncentral role that common-law trust principles play in\ndefining the Government’s fiduciary obligations to Indian\ntribes. By rejecting the Nation’s claim on the ground that\nit fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu\nnications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an\napproach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of\ncommon-law principles altogether in the Indian trust\ncontext. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a\nnarrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse\nyet, risks further diluting the Government’s fiduciary\nobligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not\nintend and that would inflict serious harm on the already\nfrayed relationship between the United States and Indian\ntribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason\nfor reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/218665/", "sha1": "9aa2add8a32fe789f0215ab986a9b9d87ec8451c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-13T07:13:17"}
