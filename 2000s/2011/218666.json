Argued December 7, 2010\u2014Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a\n  class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),\n  filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission\n  (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135, which forbids \u201cany person . . . [t]o make any un\n  true statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the purchase or\n  sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its\n  wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC\n  (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by\n  Janus Investment Fund\u2014for which JCM was the investment adviser\n  and administrator\u2014and that those statements affected the price of\n  JCG\u2019s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a\n  separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The\n  District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi\n  ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing\n  and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state\n  ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva\n  tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to\n  hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under \u00a720(a).\nHeld: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were\n made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot\n be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b\u20135. Pp. 5\u201312.\n    (a) Although neither Rule 10b\u20135 nor the statute it interprets,\n \u00a710(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an\n \u201caction is implied under \u00a710(b).\u201d Superintendent of Ins. of N.

FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                          TRADERS                                          \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at is\n    sue, the Court is mindful that it must give \u201cnarrow dimensions . . . to\n    a right . . . Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the stat\n    ute and did not expand when it revisited\u201d it, id., at 167. Pp. 5\u201310.\n         (1) For Rule 10b\u20135 purposes, the maker of a statement is the\n    person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ\n    ing its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without\n    control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not\n    \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its own right. This rule follows from Central\n    Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\n    U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b\u20135\u2019s private right of action\n    does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute\n    \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement but do not ac\n    tually make it. Reading \u201cmake\u201d more broadly, to include persons or\n    entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substan\n    tially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors al\n    most nonexistent. The Court\u2019s interpretation is also suggested by\n    Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that\n    must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167. Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (2) The Court rejects the Government\u2019s contention that \u201cmake\u201d\n    should be defined as \u201ccreate,\u201d thereby allowing private plaintiffs to\n    sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that\n    another person puts into a statement. Adopting that definition would\n    be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a pri\n    vate Rule 10b\u20135 suit against companies involved in deceptive trans\n    actions, even when information about those transactions was later\n    incorporated into false public statements. First Derivative notes the\n    uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its invest\n    ment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reap\n    portionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly\n    the responsibility of Congress, not the courts. Furthermore, First\n    Derivative\u2019s rule would read into Rule 10b\u20135 a theory of liability\n    similar to\u2014but broader than\u2014control-person liability under \u00a720(a).\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) Although JCM may have been significantly involved in prepar\n    ing the prospectuses, it did not itself \u201cmake\u201d the statements at issue\n    for Rule 10b\u20135 purposes. Its assistance in crafting what was said\n    was subject to Janus Investment Fund\u2019s ultimate control.

FIRST DERIVATIVE TRADERS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 13, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case requires us to determine whether Janus Capi\ntal Management LLC (JCM), a mutual fund investment\nadviser, can be held liable in a private action under Secu\nrities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135 for\nfalse statements included in its client mutual funds\u2019 pro\nspectuses. Rule 10b\u20135 prohibits \u201cmak[ing] any untrue\nstatement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the pur\nchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2010). We\nconclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not\nmake the statements in the prospectuses.\n                            I\n  Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded\ncompany that created the Janus family of mutual funds.\nThese mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus In\nvestment Fund retained JCG\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary,\nJCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator. JCG\nand JCM are the petitioners here.\n  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus\nInvestment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely\n2      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nby mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no\nassets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM\nprovides Janus Investment Fund with investment advi\nsory services, which include \u201cthe management and admin\nistrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus]\nFun[d],\u201d App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal\nindependence. At all times relevant to this case, all of\nthe officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of\nJCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund\u2019s\nboard of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more\nindependence than is required: By statute, up to 60 per\ncent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of\n\u201cinterested persons.\u201d See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a780a\u201310(a); see also 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19)\n(2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d).\n   As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund\nissued prospectuses describing the investment strategy\nand operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a777b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a\u20138(b), 80a\u20132(a)(31),\n80a\u201329(a)\u2013(b). The prospectuses for several funds repre\nsented that the funds were not suitable for market timing\nand can be read to suggest that JCM would implement\npolicies to curb the practice.1 For example, the Janus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mu\n\ntual funds\u2019 daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling\nshares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset\nvalue (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation\nusually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.\nBecause of certain time delays, however, the values used in these\ncalculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the\nunderlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities\nbased on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have\noccurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have\ntaken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected\nto affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the price of\nthe foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nMercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002, stated\nthat the fund was \u201cnot intended for market timing or\nexcessive trading\u201d and represented that it \u201cmay reject any\npurchase request . . . if it believes that any combination of\ntrading activity is attributable to market timing or is\notherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the Fund.\u201d\nApp. 141a. Although market timing is legal, it harms\nother investors in the mutual fund.\n   In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of\nNew York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging\nthat JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit\nmarket timing in several funds run by JCM. After the\ncomplaint\u2019s allegations became public, investors withdrew\nsignificant amounts of money from the Janus Investment\nFund mutual funds.2 Because Janus Investment Fund\ncompensated JCM based on the total value of the funds\nand JCM\u2019s management fees comprised a significant\npercentage of JCG\u2019s income, Janus Investment Fund\u2019s loss\nof value affected JCG\u2019s value as well. JCG\u2019s stock price\nfell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to\n$13.50 on September 26.\n   Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative)\nrepresents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of\nSeptember 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against\nJCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b\u20135 and \u00a710(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as\namended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b). First Derivative alleges that\nJCG and JCM \u201ccaused mutual fund prospectuses to be\nissued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the\nNAV corrects itself upward. See Disclosure Regarding Market Timing\nand Selective Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings, 68 Fed. Reg. 70402\n(proposed Dec. 17, 2003).\n  2 In 2004, JCG and JCM settled these allegations and agreed to re\n\nduce their fees by $125 million and pay $50 million in civil penalties\nand $50 million in disgorgement to the mutual fund investors.\n4      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                            \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe investing public, which created the misleading impres\nsion that [JCG and JCM] would implement measures to\ncurb market timing in the Janus [mutual funds].\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 60a. \u201cHad the truth been known, Janus\n[mutual funds] would have been less attractive to inves\ntors, and consequently, [JCG] would have realized lower\nrevenues, so [JCG\u2019s] stock would have traded at lower\nprices.\u201d Id., at 72a.\n   First Derivative contends that JCG and JCM \u201cmateri\nally misled the investing public\u201d and that class members\nrelied \u201cupon the integrity of the market price of [JCG]\nsecurities and market information relating to [JCG and\nJCM].\u201d Id., at 109a. The complaint also alleges that JCG\nshould be held liable for the acts of JCM as a \u201ccontrolling\nperson\u201d under 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)\n(\u00a720(a) of the Act).\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim.3 In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 487\nF. Supp. 2d 618, 620 (D Md. 2007). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Deriva\ntive had sufficiently alleged that \u201cJCG and JCM, by par\nticipating in the writing and dissemination of the prospec\ntuses, made the misleading statements contained in the\ndocuments.\u201d In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 566 F. 3d\n111, 121 (2009) (emphasis in original). With respect to the\nelement of reliance, the court found that investors would\ninfer that JCM \u201cplayed a role in preparing or approving\nthe content of the Janus fund prospectuses,\u201d id., at 127,\nbut that investors would not infer the same about JCG,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The elements of a private action under Rule 10b\u20135 are \u201c(1) a mate\n\nrial misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a\nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the pur\nchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or\nomission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u201d Stoneridge Invest\nment Partners, LLC v.

Id., at 128, 129\u2013130.\n                             II\n   We granted certiorari to address whether JCM can be\nheld liable in a private action under Rule 10b\u20135 for false\nstatements included in Janus Investment Fund\u2019s pro\nspectuses. 561 U.

Although neither Rule 10b\u20135\nnor \u00a710(b) expressly creates a private right of action, this\nCourt has held that \u201ca private right of action is implied\nunder \u00a710(b).\u201d Superintendent of Ins. of N.

The\nonly question we must answer, therefore, is whether JCM made the\nmisstatements. Whether First Derivative has stated a claim against\nJCG as a control person depends on whether it has stated a claim\nagainst JCM.\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

When \u201cmake\u201d is\npaired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the\nresulting phrase is \u201capproximately equivalent in sense\u201d to\nthat verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933)\n(hereinafter OED); accord, Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (\u201cMake followed by\na noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equiva\nlent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun\u201d).\nFor instance, \u201cto make a proclamation\u201d is the approximate\nequivalent of \u201cto proclaim,\u201d and \u201cto make a promise\u201d ap\nproximates \u201cto promise.\u201d See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The\nphrase at issue in Rule 10b\u20135, \u201c[t]o make any . . . state\nment,\u201d is thus the approximate equivalent of \u201cto state.\u201d\n  For purposes of Rule 10b\u20135, the maker of a statement is\nthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the\nstatement, including its content and whether and how to\ncommunicate it. Without control, a person or entity can\nmerely suggest what to say, not \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its\nown right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on\nbehalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary\ncase, attribution within a statement or implicit from sur\nrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a state\nment was made by\u2014and only by\u2014the party to whom it is\nattributed.

And\nit is the speaker who takes credit\u2014or blame\u2014for what is\nultimately said.\n   This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164\n(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b\u20135\u2019s private right of\naction does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\nSee id., at 180. Such suits\u2014against entities that contrib\nute \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement\nbut do not actually make it\u2014may be brought by the SEC,\nsee 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778t(e), but not by private parties. A\nbroader reading of \u201cmake,\u201d including persons or entities\nwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement,\nwould substantially undermine Central Bank. If persons\nor entities without control over the content of a statement\ncould be considered primary violators who \u201cmade\u201d the\nstatement, then aiders and abettors would be almost\nnonexistent.6\n   This interpretation is further supported by our recent\ndecision in Stoneridge. There, investors sued \u201centities\nwho, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to\narrangements that allowed the investors\u2019 company to\nmislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial\nstatement.\u201d 552 U.

Post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But for Cen\ntral Bank to have any meaning, there must be some distinction be\ntween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in\nprivate suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may not\nbe pursued in private suits).\n  We draw a clean line between the two\u2014the maker is the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over a statement and others are not. In\ncontrast, the dissent\u2019s only limit on primary liability is not much of a\nlimit at all. It would allow for primary liability whenever \u201c[t]he specific\nrelationships alleged . . . warrant [that] conclusion\u201d\u2014whatever that\nmay mean.

See JIF Group1 Standalone Prospectuses (Feb. 25,\n2002), online at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/\n277751 / 000027775102000049 / 0000277751-02-000049.txt\n(as visited June 10, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file) (recording the \u201cFiler\u201d of the Janus Mercury Fund\nprospectus as \u201cJanus Investment Fund\u201d). There is no\nallegation that JCM in fact filed the prospectuses and\nfalsely attributed them to Janus Investment Fund. Nor\ndid anything on the face of the prospectuses indicate that\nany statements therein came from JCM rather than Janus\nInvestment Fund\u2014a legally independent entity with its\nown board of trustees.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 First Derivative suggests that \u201cindirectly\u201d in Rule 10b\u20135 may\n\nbroaden the meaning of \u201cmake.\u201d We disagree. The phrase \u201cdirectly or\nindirectly\u201d is set off by itself in Rule 10b\u20135 and modifies not just \u201cto\nmake,\u201d but also \u201cto employ\u201d and \u201cto engage.\u201d We think the phrase\nmerely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter\nwhether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the\nrecipient. A different understanding of \u201cindirectly\u201d would, like a broad\ndefinition of \u201cmake,\u201d threaten to erase the line between primary viola\ntors and aiders and abettors established by Central Bank.\n  In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communi\ncate a \u201cmade\u201d statement indirectly because none of the statements in\nthe prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM.\nWithout attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund\nwas quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally \u201cmade\u201d by\nJCM. Cf. Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1220, and\nn. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed \u201c \u2018Auditor\u2019s Report\u2019 \u201d included in a pro\nspectus); Basic, supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item reporting a state\nment by Basic\u2019s president). More may be required to find that a person\nor entity made a statement indirectly, but attribution is necessary.\n12     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

But this assistance, subject to the ultimate control\nof Janus Investment Fund, does not mean that JCM\n\u201cmade\u201d any statements in the prospectuses. Although\nJCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted Janus In\nvestment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment\nFund said in the prospectuses, JCM itself did not \u201cmake\u201d\nthose statements for purposes of Rule 10b\u20135.12\n                      *    *    *\n  The statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospec\ntuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM.\nAccordingly, First Derivative has not stated a claim\nagainst JCM under Rule 10b\u20135. The judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is\nreversed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 That JCM provided access to Janus Investment Fund\u2019s prospec\n\ntuses on its Web site is also not a basis for liability.

They say that\nthey relied upon those statements, and that they suffered\nresulting economic harm.\n  Janus Management and the Janus Fund are closely\nrelated. Each of the Fund\u2019s officers is a Janus Manage\u00ad\nment employee. Janus Management, acting through those\nemployees (and other of its employees), manages the\npurchase, sale, redemption, and distribution of the Fund\u2019s\ninvestments.

See also 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b) (\u00a710(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The specific legal\nquestion before us is whether Janus Management can be\nheld responsible under the Rule for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d cer\u00ad\ntain false statements about the Janus Fund\u2019s activities.\nThe statements in question appear in the Janus Fund\u2019s\nprospectuses.\n  The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus\nManagement, could have \u201cma[d]e\u201d those statements. The\nmajority points out that the Janus Fund\u2019s board of trus\u00ad\ntees has \u201cultimate authority\u201d over the content of the\nstatements in a Fund prospectus. And in the majority\u2019s\nview, only \u201cthe person or entity with ultimate authority\nover the statement, including its content and whether and\nhow to communicate it\u201d can \u201cmake\u201d a statement within the\nterms of Rule 10b\u20135.

To the contrary, both language and case law\nindicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man\u00ad\nagement company, a board of trustees, individual company\nofficers, or others, separately or together, might \u201cmake\u201d\nstatements contained in a firm\u2019s prospectus\u2014even if a\nboard of directors has ultimate content-related responsi\u00ad\nbility.

But\nCentral Bank concerns a different matter. And it no more\nrequires the majority\u2019s rule than free air travel for small\nchildren requires free air travel for adults.\n  Central Bank is a case about secondary liability, liability\nattaching, not to an individual making a false statement,\nbut to an individual helping someone else do so. Central\nBank involved a bond issuer accused of having made\nmaterially false statements, which overstated the values\nof property that backed the bonds. Central Bank also\ninvolved a defendant that was a bank, serving as inden\u00ad\nture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond is\u00ad\nsuer\u2019s valuations. The plaintiffs claimed that the bank\ndelayed its valuation checks and thereby helped the issuer\nmake its false statements credible. The question before\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court concerned the bank\u2019s liability\u2014a secondary\nliability for \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the bond issuer, who (on\nthe theory set forth) was primarily liable.\n   The Court made this clear. The question presented was\n\u201cwhether private civil liability under \u00a710(b) extends . . . to\nthose who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive\npractice, but who aid and abet the violation.\u201d 511 U. S., at\n167 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that \u201caiding and\nabetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the\nproscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to\nthose who do.\u201d Id., at 176 (emphasis added). The Court\ndescribed civil law \u201caiding and abetting\u201d as \u201c \u2018know[ing]\nthat the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and\ngiv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the\nother . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a\nCourt of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of\naiding and abetting as \u201c(1) a primary violation of \u00a710(b);\n(2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the exis\u00ad\ntence of the primary violation; and (3) substantial assis\ntance given to the primary violator by the aider and abet\u00ad\ntor.\u201d 511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added). Faced with this\nquestion, the Court answered that \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135\ndo not provide for this kind of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liabil\u00ad\nity in private suits.\n   By way of contrast, the present case is about primary\nliability\u2014about individuals who allegedly themselves\n\u201cmake\u201d materially false statements, not about those who\nhelp others to do so. The question is whether Janus Man\u00ad\nagement is primarily liable for violating the Act, not\nwhether it simply helped others violate the Act. The\nCentral Bank defendant concededly did not make the false\nstatements in question (others did), while here the defen\u00ad\ndants allegedly did make those statements. And a rule\n(the majority\u2019s rule) absolving those who allegedly did\nmake false statements does not \u201cfollow from\u201d a rule (Cen\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                    \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntral Bank\u2019s rule) absolving those who concededly did not\ndo so.\n  The majority adds that to interpret the word \u201cmake\u201d as\nincluding those \u201cwithout ultimate control over the content\nof a statement\u201d would \u201csubstantially undermine\u201d Central\nBank\u2019s holding. Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen\ntral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did\n    \u201cnot mean that secondary actors in the securities\n    markets are always free from liability under the secu\u00ad\n    rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,\n    accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de\u00ad\n    vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)\n    on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may\n    be liable as a primary violator under 10b\u20135, assuming\n    all of the requirements for primary liability under\n    Rule 10b\u20135 are met.\u201d 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha\u00ad\n    sis added).\nThus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon\nthe circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,\nofficials tasked to develop a marketing document, large\ninvestors, or others (taken together or separately) all\nmight \u201cmake\u201d materially false statements subjecting\nthemselves to primary liability. The majority\u2019s rule does\nnot protect, it extends, Central Bank\u2019s holding of no\u00ad\nliability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly\nplaced outside that holding. And by ignoring the language\nin which Central Bank did so, the majority\u2019s rule itself\nundermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cdraw[ing] a clean line,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 6, that\nso seriously conflicts with Central Bank?

In Stoneridge, firms that supplied\nelectronic equipment to a cable television company agreed\nwith the cable television company to enter into a series of\nfraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an\nunusually high price, thereby providing funds which the\nsuppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable\ntelevision company. These arrangements enabled the\ncable television company to fool its accountants (and\nultimately the public) into believing that it had more\nrevenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really\nhad. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged\nletters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.\nInvestors subsequently sued the cable television company,\nsome of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment\nsuppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged\nin a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to\nmost of the defendants, investors identified allegedly\nmaterially false statements contained in the cable\ntelevision company\u2019s financial statements or similar docu-\nments. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in\u00ad\nvestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was\nin the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral\nconversations about the scheme. The investors argued\nthat the equipment suppliers, \u201cby participating in the\ntransactions,\u201d violated \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135. Stoneridge,\n552 U. S., at 155.\n  The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not\nbe found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under\n\u00a710(b). But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment\nsuppliers had made the false statements contained in the\nletters, contracts, and conversations. See id., at 158\u2013159.\nRather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether\n\u201cany deceptive statement or act respondents made was not\nactionable because it did not have the requisite proximate\nrelation to the investors\u2019 harm.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n8     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nAnd it held that these deceptive statements or actions\ncould not provide a basis for liability because the investors\ncould not prove sufficient reliance upon the particular\nfalse statements that the equipment suppliers had made.\n  The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers\n\u201chad no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not\ncommunicated to the public.\u201d Id., at 159. And the Court\nwent on to say that \u201cas a result,\u201d the investors \u201ccannot\nshow reliance upon any\u201d of the equipment suppliers\u2019\nactions, \u201cexcept in an indirect chain that we find too\nremote for liability.\u201d Ibid. The Court concluded,\n    \u201c[the equipment suppliers\u2019] deceptive acts, which were\n    not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to\n    satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable\n    company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled\n    its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;\n    nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it\n    necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to\n    record the transactions as it did.\u201d Id., at 161.\nInsofar as the equipment suppliers\u2019 conduct was at issue,\nthe fraudulent \u201carrangement . . . took place in the\nmarketplace for goods and services, not in the investment\nsphere.\u201d Id., at 166.\n  It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge \u201csupport[s]\u201d\nthe majority\u2019s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge\ndisputed the making of the relevant statements, the\nfraudulent contracts and the like.        And no one in\nStoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,\nin fact, the makers of the cable company\u2019s misstatements.\nRather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the\nequipment suppliers\u2019 separate statements were sufficiently\ndisclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the\nbasis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a\ndifferent inquiry than whether statements acknowledged\nto have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nripe for reliance can be said to have been \u201cma[d]e\u201d by one\nor another actor. How then does Stoneridge support the\nmajority\u2019s new rule?\n  The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid \u201ca\ntheory of liability similar to\u2014but broader in application\nthan\u201d\u2014\u00a720(a)\u2019s liability, for \u201c \u2018[e]very person who, directly\nor indirectly, controls any person liable\u2019 \u201d for violations of\nthe securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court\nhas explained that the possibility of an express remedy\nunder the securities laws does not preclude a claim under\n\u00a710(b). Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,\n388 (1983).\n  More importantly, a person who is liable under \u00a720(a)\ncontrols another \u201cperson\u201d who is \u201cliable\u201d for a securities\nviolation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (\u201cLiability\nunder \u00a720(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act\u201d). We here examine\nwhether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or\nthey do not, control another person who is liable. That is\nto say, here, the liability of some \u201cother person\u201d is not at\nissue.\n  And there is at least one significant category of cases\nthat \u00a710(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,\nsuch as under \u00a720(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one\nactor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its\nmisstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund\u2019s\nboard of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the\nprospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,\n93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management\nwas aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later\nthan 2002, but \u201c[t]his knowledge was never shared with\nthe Board\u201d). And if so, \u00a720(a) would not apply.\n  The possibility of guilty management and innocent\nboard is the 13th stroke of the new rule\u2019s clock. What is to\n10    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nhappen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for\nthe board) containing materially false statements and\nfools both board and public into believing they are true?\nApparently under the majority\u2019s rule, in such circum\u00ad\nstances no one could be found to have \u201cma[d]e\u201d a ma-\nterially false statement\u2014even though under the common\nlaw the managers would likely have been guilty or liable\n(in analogous circumstances) for doing so as principals\n(and not as aiders and abettors). See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law \u00a713.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.\nHale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to\nCrime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a\nprincipal when one uses an innocent third party to commit\na crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7533 (1976). Cf.\nUnited States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48\u201349 (1937).\n   Indeed, under the majority\u2019s rule it seems unlikely that\nthe SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the\nauthority Congress has granted it to pursue primary\nviolators who \u201cmake\u201d false statements or the authority\nthat Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders\nand abettors to securities violations. See \u00a7104, 109 Stat.\n757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))\n(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).\nThat is because the managers, not having \u201cma[d]e\u201d the\nstatement, would not be liable as principals and there\nwould be no other primary violator they might have\ntried to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet.\u201d Ibid.; SEC v. DiBella, 587 F. 3d\n553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abet-\nting requires primary violation to which offender gave\n\u201csubstantial assistance\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that \u00a720(b)\ncould provide a basis for liability in this case, ante, at 10,\nn. 10, then it should remand the case for possible amend\u00ad\nment of the complaint. \u201cThere is a dearth of authority\nconstruing Section 20(b),\u201d which has been thought largely\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Jacobs, Disclosure\nand Remedies Under the Securities Law \u00a711\u20138, p. 11\u201372\n(2011). Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it\nreferred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless\nfor failing to mention \u00a720(b) as well.\n  In sum, I can find nothing in \u00a710(b) or in Rule 10b\u20135, its\nlanguage, its history, or in precedent suggesting that\nCongress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a\nloophole of the kind that the majority\u2019s rule may well\ncreate.\n                              II\n  Rejecting the majority\u2019s rule, of course, does not decide\nthe question before us. We must still determine whether,\nin light of the complaint\u2019s allegations, Janus Management\ncould have \u201cma[d]e\u201d the false statements in the\nprospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this\nquestion is \u201cYes.\u201d      The specific relationships alleged\namong Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the\nprospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus\nManagement did \u201cmake\u201d those statements.\n  In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court\nand lower courts have made clear that at least sometimes\ncorporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule\n10b\u20135 for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d a materially false statement\neven when that statement appears in a document (or is\nmade by a third person) that the officials do not legally\ncontrol. In Herman & MacLean, for example, this Court\npointed out that \u201ccertain individuals who play a part in\npreparing the registration statement,\u201d including corporate\nofficers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable\neven where \u201cthey are not named as having prepared or\ncertified\u201d the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.\n22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in\nCentral Bank that a \u201clawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .\nmakes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a\n12    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

S., at 191 (some emphasis added).\n   Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris\u00ad\ning that lower courts have found primary liability for\nactors without \u201cultimate authority\u201d over issued state\u00ad\nments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac\u00ad\ncountant could be primarily liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d\nfalse statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and\ncertification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual\nreports, and other corporate materials for which he was\nnot ultimately responsible.        Anixter v. Home-Stake\nProduction Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225\u20131227 (CA10 1996). In\na later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed\nthat an outside consultant could be primarily liable for\nhaving \u201cma[d]e\u201d false statements, where he drafted\nfraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later\nreviewed and certified by the firm\u2019s auditor, officers, and\ncounsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10\n2008). And another court found that a corporation\u2019s chief\nfinancial officer could be held primarily liable as having\n\u201cma[d]e\u201d misstatements that appeared in a form 10\u2013K\nthat she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.\nSEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).\n   One can also easily find lower court cases explaining\nthat corporate officials may be liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d\nfalse statements where those officials use innocent\npersons as conduits through which the false statements\nreach the public (without necessarily attributing the false\nstatements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.\nSecurities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil\u00ad\nity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to\ncommunicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron\nSystems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test\nrequiring legal \u201ccontrol\u201d over third parties making state\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Argued December 7, 2010\u2014Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a\n  class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),\n  filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission\n  (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135, which forbids \u201cany person . . . [t]o make any un\n  true statement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the purchase or\n  sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its\n  wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC\n  (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by\n  Janus Investment Fund\u2014for which JCM was the investment adviser\n  and administrator\u2014and that those statements affected the price of\n  JCG\u2019s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a\n  separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The\n  District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi\n  ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing\n  and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state\n  ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva\n  tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to\n  hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under \u00a720(a).\nHeld: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were\n made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot\n be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b\u20135. Pp. 5\u201312.\n    (a) Although neither Rule 10b\u20135 nor the statute it interprets,\n \u00a710(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an\n \u201caction is implied under \u00a710(b).\u201d Superintendent of Ins. of N.

FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                          TRADERS                                          \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at is\n    sue, the Court is mindful that it must give \u201cnarrow dimensions . . . to\n    a right . . . Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the stat\n    ute and did not expand when it revisited\u201d it, id., at 167. Pp. 5\u201310.\n         (1) For Rule 10b\u20135 purposes, the maker of a statement is the\n    person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ\n    ing its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without\n    control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not\n    \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its own right. This rule follows from Central\n    Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\n    U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b\u20135\u2019s private right of action\n    does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute\n    \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement but do not ac\n    tually make it. Reading \u201cmake\u201d more broadly, to include persons or\n    entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substan\n    tially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors al\n    most nonexistent. The Court\u2019s interpretation is also suggested by\n    Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that\n    must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167. Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (2) The Court rejects the Government\u2019s contention that \u201cmake\u201d\n    should be defined as \u201ccreate,\u201d thereby allowing private plaintiffs to\n    sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that\n    another person puts into a statement. Adopting that definition would\n    be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a pri\n    vate Rule 10b\u20135 suit against companies involved in deceptive trans\n    actions, even when information about those transactions was later\n    incorporated into false public statements. First Derivative notes the\n    uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its invest\n    ment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reap\n    portionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly\n    the responsibility of Congress, not the courts. Furthermore, First\n    Derivative\u2019s rule would read into Rule 10b\u20135 a theory of liability\n    similar to\u2014but broader than\u2014control-person liability under \u00a720(a).\n    Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) Although JCM may have been significantly involved in prepar\n    ing the prospectuses, it did not itself \u201cmake\u201d the statements at issue\n    for Rule 10b\u20135 purposes. Its assistance in crafting what was said\n    was subject to Janus Investment Fund\u2019s ultimate control.

FIRST DERIVATIVE TRADERS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 13, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case requires us to determine whether Janus Capi\ntal Management LLC (JCM), a mutual fund investment\nadviser, can be held liable in a private action under Secu\nrities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135 for\nfalse statements included in its client mutual funds\u2019 pro\nspectuses. Rule 10b\u20135 prohibits \u201cmak[ing] any untrue\nstatement of a material fact\u201d in connection with the pur\nchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2010). We\nconclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not\nmake the statements in the prospectuses.\n                            I\n  Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded\ncompany that created the Janus family of mutual funds.\nThese mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus In\nvestment Fund retained JCG\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary,\nJCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator. JCG\nand JCM are the petitioners here.\n  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus\nInvestment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely\n2      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nby mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no\nassets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM\nprovides Janus Investment Fund with investment advi\nsory services, which include \u201cthe management and admin\nistrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus]\nFun[d],\u201d App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal\nindependence. At all times relevant to this case, all of\nthe officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of\nJCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund\u2019s\nboard of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more\nindependence than is required: By statute, up to 60 per\ncent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of\n\u201cinterested persons.\u201d See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a780a\u201310(a); see also 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a780a\u20132(a)(19)\n(2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining \u201cinterested\nperson\u201d).\n   As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund\nissued prospectuses describing the investment strategy\nand operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a777b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a\u20138(b), 80a\u20132(a)(31),\n80a\u201329(a)\u2013(b). The prospectuses for several funds repre\nsented that the funds were not suitable for market timing\nand can be read to suggest that JCM would implement\npolicies to curb the practice.1 For example, the Janus\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mu\n\ntual funds\u2019 daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling\nshares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset\nvalue (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation\nusually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.\nBecause of certain time delays, however, the values used in these\ncalculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the\nunderlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities\nbased on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have\noccurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have\ntaken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected\nto affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the price of\nthe foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nMercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002, stated\nthat the fund was \u201cnot intended for market timing or\nexcessive trading\u201d and represented that it \u201cmay reject any\npurchase request . . . if it believes that any combination of\ntrading activity is attributable to market timing or is\notherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the Fund.\u201d\nApp. 141a. Although market timing is legal, it harms\nother investors in the mutual fund.\n   In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of\nNew York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging\nthat JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit\nmarket timing in several funds run by JCM. After the\ncomplaint\u2019s allegations became public, investors withdrew\nsignificant amounts of money from the Janus Investment\nFund mutual funds.2 Because Janus Investment Fund\ncompensated JCM based on the total value of the funds\nand JCM\u2019s management fees comprised a significant\npercentage of JCG\u2019s income, Janus Investment Fund\u2019s loss\nof value affected JCG\u2019s value as well. JCG\u2019s stock price\nfell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to\n$13.50 on September 26.\n   Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative)\nrepresents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of\nSeptember 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against\nJCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b\u20135 and \u00a710(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as\namended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b). First Derivative alleges that\nJCG and JCM \u201ccaused mutual fund prospectuses to be\nissued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the\nNAV corrects itself upward. See Disclosure Regarding Market Timing\nand Selective Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings, 68 Fed. Reg. 70402\n(proposed Dec. 17, 2003).\n  2 In 2004, JCG and JCM settled these allegations and agreed to re\n\nduce their fees by $125 million and pay $50 million in civil penalties\nand $50 million in disgorgement to the mutual fund investors.\n4      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

A. \u00a778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)\n(\u00a720(a) of the Act).\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim.3 In re Mutual Funds Inv.

The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Deriva\ntive had sufficiently alleged that \u201cJCG and JCM, by par\nticipating in the writing and dissemination of the prospec\ntuses, made the misleading statements contained in the\ndocuments.\u201d In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 566 F. 3d\n111, 121 (2009) (emphasis in original). With respect to the\nelement of reliance, the court found that investors would\ninfer that JCM \u201cplayed a role in preparing or approving\nthe content of the Janus fund prospectuses,\u201d id., at 127,\nbut that investors would not infer the same about JCG,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The elements of a private action under Rule 10b\u20135 are \u201c(1) a mate\n\nrial misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a\nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the pur\nchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or\nomission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u201d Stoneridge Invest\nment Partners, LLC v.

Although neither Rule 10b\u20135\nnor \u00a710(b) expressly creates a private right of action, this\nCourt has held that \u201ca private right of action is implied\nunder \u00a710(b).\u201d Superintendent of Ins. of N.

The\nonly question we must answer, therefore, is whether JCM made the\nmisstatements. Whether First Derivative has stated a claim against\nJCG as a control person depends on whether it has stated a claim\nagainst JCM.\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165\n(2008), but \u201c[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a pri\nvate cause of action caution against its expansion,\u201d ibid.\nThus, in analyzing whether JCM \u201cmade\u201d the statements\nfor purposes of Rule 10b\u20135, we are mindful that we must\ngive \u201cnarrow dimensions . . . to a right of action Congress\ndid not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did\nnot expand when it revisited the law.\u201d Id., at 167.\n                              1\n  One \u201cmakes\u201d a statement by stating it. When \u201cmake\u201d is\npaired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the\nresulting phrase is \u201capproximately equivalent in sense\u201d to\nthat verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933)\n(hereinafter OED); accord, Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (\u201cMake followed by\na noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equiva\nlent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun\u201d).\nFor instance, \u201cto make a proclamation\u201d is the approximate\nequivalent of \u201cto proclaim,\u201d and \u201cto make a promise\u201d ap\nproximates \u201cto promise.\u201d See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The\nphrase at issue in Rule 10b\u20135, \u201c[t]o make any . . . state\nment,\u201d is thus the approximate equivalent of \u201cto state.\u201d\n  For purposes of Rule 10b\u20135, the maker of a statement is\nthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the\nstatement, including its content and whether and how to\ncommunicate it. Without control, a person or entity can\nmerely suggest what to say, not \u201cmake\u201d a statement in its\nown right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on\nbehalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary\ncase, attribution within a statement or implicit from sur\nrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a state\nment was made by\u2014and only by\u2014the party to whom it is\nattributed. This rule might best be exemplified by the\nrelationship between a speechwriter and a speaker. Even\nwhen a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is en\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

And\nit is the speaker who takes credit\u2014or blame\u2014for what is\nultimately said.\n   This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164\n(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b\u20135\u2019s private right of\naction does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\nSee id., at 180. Such suits\u2014against entities that contrib\nute \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the making of a statement\nbut do not actually make it\u2014may be brought by the SEC,\nsee 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778t(e), but not by private parties. A\nbroader reading of \u201cmake,\u201d including persons or entities\nwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement,\nwould substantially undermine Central Bank. If persons\nor entities without control over the content of a statement\ncould be considered primary violators who \u201cmade\u201d the\nstatement, then aiders and abettors would be almost\nnonexistent.6\n   This interpretation is further supported by our recent\ndecision in Stoneridge. There, investors sued \u201centities\nwho, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to\narrangements that allowed the investors\u2019 company to\nmislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial\nstatement.\u201d 552 U.

But for Cen\ntral Bank to have any meaning, there must be some distinction be\ntween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in\nprivate suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may not\nbe pursued in private suits).\n  We draw a clean line between the two\u2014the maker is the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over a statement and others are not. In\ncontrast, the dissent\u2019s only limit on primary liability is not much of a\nlimit at all.

The phrase \u201cdirectly or\nindirectly\u201d is set off by itself in Rule 10b\u20135 and modifies not just \u201cto\nmake,\u201d but also \u201cto employ\u201d and \u201cto engage.\u201d We think the phrase\nmerely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter\nwhether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the\nrecipient. A different understanding of \u201cindirectly\u201d would, like a broad\ndefinition of \u201cmake,\u201d threaten to erase the line between primary viola\ntors and aiders and abettors established by Central Bank.\n  In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communi\ncate a \u201cmade\u201d statement indirectly because none of the statements in\nthe prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM.\nWithout attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund\nwas quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally \u201cmade\u201d by\nJCM. Cf. Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1220, and\nn. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed \u201c \u2018Auditor\u2019s Report\u2019 \u201d included in a pro\nspectus); Basic, supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item reporting a state\nment by Basic\u2019s president).

But this assistance, subject to the ultimate control\nof Janus Investment Fund, does not mean that JCM\n\u201cmade\u201d any statements in the prospectuses. Although\nJCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted Janus In\nvestment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment\nFund said in the prospectuses, JCM itself did not \u201cmake\u201d\nthose statements for purposes of Rule 10b\u20135.12\n                      *    *    *\n  The statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospec\ntuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM.\nAccordingly, First Derivative has not stated a claim\nagainst JCM under Rule 10b\u20135.

They say that\nthey relied upon those statements, and that they suffered\nresulting economic harm.\n  Janus Management and the Janus Fund are closely\nrelated. Each of the Fund\u2019s officers is a Janus Manage\u00ad\nment employee.

The specific legal\nquestion before us is whether Janus Management can be\nheld responsible under the Rule for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d cer\u00ad\ntain false statements about the Janus Fund\u2019s activities.\nThe statements in question appear in the Janus Fund\u2019s\nprospectuses.\n  The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus\nManagement, could have \u201cma[d]e\u201d those statements. The\nmajority points out that the Janus Fund\u2019s board of trus\u00ad\ntees has \u201cultimate authority\u201d over the content of the\nstatements in a Fund prospectus.

To the contrary, both language and case law\nindicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man\u00ad\nagement company, a board of trustees, individual company\nofficers, or others, separately or together, might \u201cmake\u201d\nstatements contained in a firm\u2019s prospectus\u2014even if a\nboard of directors has ultimate content-related responsi\u00ad\nbility.

The question presented was\n\u201cwhether private civil liability under \u00a710(b) extends . . . to\nthose who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive\npractice, but who aid and abet the violation.\u201d 511 U. S., at\n167 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that \u201caiding and\nabetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the\nproscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to\nthose who do.\u201d Id., at 176 (emphasis added). The Court\ndescribed civil law \u201caiding and abetting\u201d as \u201c \u2018know[ing]\nthat the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and\ngiv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the\nother . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a\nCourt of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of\naiding and abetting as \u201c(1) a primary violation of \u00a710(b);\n(2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the exis\u00ad\ntence of the primary violation; and (3) substantial assis\ntance given to the primary violator by the aider and abet\u00ad\ntor.\u201d 511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added). Faced with this\nquestion, the Court answered that \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135\ndo not provide for this kind of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liabil\u00ad\nity in private suits.\n   By way of contrast, the present case is about primary\nliability\u2014about individuals who allegedly themselves\n\u201cmake\u201d materially false statements, not about those who\nhelp others to do so. The question is whether Janus Man\u00ad\nagement is primarily liable for violating the Act, not\nwhether it simply helped others violate the Act. The\nCentral Bank defendant concededly did not make the false\nstatements in question (others did), while here the defen\u00ad\ndants allegedly did make those statements. And a rule\n(the majority\u2019s rule) absolving those who allegedly did\nmake false statements does not \u201cfollow from\u201d a rule (Cen\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                    \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntral Bank\u2019s rule) absolving those who concededly did not\ndo so.\n  The majority adds that to interpret the word \u201cmake\u201d as\nincluding those \u201cwithout ultimate control over the content\nof a statement\u201d would \u201csubstantially undermine\u201d Central\nBank\u2019s holding. Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen\ntral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did\n    \u201cnot mean that secondary actors in the securities\n    markets are always free from liability under the secu\u00ad\n    rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,\n    accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de\u00ad\n    vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)\n    on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may\n    be liable as a primary violator under 10b\u20135, assuming\n    all of the requirements for primary liability under\n    Rule 10b\u20135 are met.\u201d 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha\u00ad\n    sis added).\nThus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon\nthe circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,\nofficials tasked to develop a marketing document, large\ninvestors, or others (taken together or separately) all\nmight \u201cmake\u201d materially false statements subjecting\nthemselves to primary liability. The majority\u2019s rule does\nnot protect, it extends, Central Bank\u2019s holding of no\u00ad\nliability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly\nplaced outside that holding. And by ignoring the language\nin which Central Bank did so, the majority\u2019s rule itself\nundermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for\nthe majority\u2019s \u201cdraw[ing] a clean line,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 6, that\nso seriously conflicts with Central Bank? Indeed, where is\nthe legal support for the majority\u2019s suggestion that plain\u00ad\ntiffs must show some kind of \u201cattribution\u201d of a statement\nto a defendant, ante, at 11, n. 11\u2014if it means plaintiffs\nmust show, not only that the defendant \u201cma[d]e\u201d the\nstatement, but something more?\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority also refers to Stoneridge, but that case\noffers it no help. In Stoneridge, firms that supplied\nelectronic equipment to a cable television company agreed\nwith the cable television company to enter into a series of\nfraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an\nunusually high price, thereby providing funds which the\nsuppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable\ntelevision company. These arrangements enabled the\ncable television company to fool its accountants (and\nultimately the public) into believing that it had more\nrevenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really\nhad. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged\nletters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.\nInvestors subsequently sued the cable television company,\nsome of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment\nsuppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged\nin a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to\nmost of the defendants, investors identified allegedly\nmaterially false statements contained in the cable\ntelevision company\u2019s financial statements or similar docu-\nments. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in\u00ad\nvestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was\nin the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral\nconversations about the scheme. The investors argued\nthat the equipment suppliers, \u201cby participating in the\ntransactions,\u201d violated \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135. Stoneridge,\n552 U. S., at 155.\n  The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not\nbe found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under\n\u00a710(b). But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment\nsuppliers had made the false statements contained in the\nletters, contracts, and conversations. See id., at 158\u2013159.\nRather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether\n\u201cany deceptive statement or act respondents made was not\nactionable because it did not have the requisite proximate\nrelation to the investors\u2019 harm.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n8     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nAnd it held that these deceptive statements or actions\ncould not provide a basis for liability because the investors\ncould not prove sufficient reliance upon the particular\nfalse statements that the equipment suppliers had made.\n  The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers\n\u201chad no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not\ncommunicated to the public.\u201d Id., at 159. And the Court\nwent on to say that \u201cas a result,\u201d the investors \u201ccannot\nshow reliance upon any\u201d of the equipment suppliers\u2019\nactions, \u201cexcept in an indirect chain that we find too\nremote for liability.\u201d Ibid. The Court concluded,\n    \u201c[the equipment suppliers\u2019] deceptive acts, which were\n    not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to\n    satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable\n    company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled\n    its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;\n    nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it\n    necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to\n    record the transactions as it did.\u201d Id., at 161.\nInsofar as the equipment suppliers\u2019 conduct was at issue,\nthe fraudulent \u201carrangement . . . took place in the\nmarketplace for goods and services, not in the investment\nsphere.\u201d Id., at 166.\n  It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge \u201csupport[s]\u201d\nthe majority\u2019s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge\ndisputed the making of the relevant statements, the\nfraudulent contracts and the like.        And no one in\nStoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,\nin fact, the makers of the cable company\u2019s misstatements.\nRather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the\nequipment suppliers\u2019 separate statements were sufficiently\ndisclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the\nbasis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a\ndifferent inquiry than whether statements acknowledged\nto have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nripe for reliance can be said to have been \u201cma[d]e\u201d by one\nor another actor. How then does Stoneridge support the\nmajority\u2019s new rule?\n  The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid \u201ca\ntheory of liability similar to\u2014but broader in application\nthan\u201d\u2014\u00a720(a)\u2019s liability, for \u201c \u2018[e]very person who, directly\nor indirectly, controls any person liable\u2019 \u201d for violations of\nthe securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a778t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court\nhas explained that the possibility of an express remedy\nunder the securities laws does not preclude a claim under\n\u00a710(b). Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,\n388 (1983).\n  More importantly, a person who is liable under \u00a720(a)\ncontrols another \u201cperson\u201d who is \u201cliable\u201d for a securities\nviolation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (\u201cLiability\nunder \u00a720(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act\u201d). We here examine\nwhether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or\nthey do not, control another person who is liable. That is\nto say, here, the liability of some \u201cother person\u201d is not at\nissue.\n  And there is at least one significant category of cases\nthat \u00a710(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,\nsuch as under \u00a720(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one\nactor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its\nmisstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund\u2019s\nboard of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the\nprospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,\n93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management\nwas aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later\nthan 2002, but \u201c[t]his knowledge was never shared with\nthe Board\u201d). And if so, \u00a720(a) would not apply.\n  The possibility of guilty management and innocent\nboard is the 13th stroke of the new rule\u2019s clock. What is to\n10    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nhappen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for\nthe board) containing materially false statements and\nfools both board and public into believing they are true?\nApparently under the majority\u2019s rule, in such circum\u00ad\nstances no one could be found to have \u201cma[d]e\u201d a ma-\nterially false statement\u2014even though under the common\nlaw the managers would likely have been guilty or liable\n(in analogous circumstances) for doing so as principals\n(and not as aiders and abettors). See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law \u00a713.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.\nHale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to\nCrime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a\nprincipal when one uses an innocent third party to commit\na crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7533 (1976). Cf.\nUnited States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48\u201349 (1937).\n   Indeed, under the majority\u2019s rule it seems unlikely that\nthe SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the\nauthority Congress has granted it to pursue primary\nviolators who \u201cmake\u201d false statements or the authority\nthat Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders\nand abettors to securities violations. See \u00a7104, 109 Stat.\n757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a778t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))\n(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).\nThat is because the managers, not having \u201cma[d]e\u201d the\nstatement, would not be liable as principals and there\nwould be no other primary violator they might have\ntried to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet.\u201d Ibid.; SEC v. DiBella, 587 F. 3d\n553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abet-\nting requires primary violation to which offender gave\n\u201csubstantial assistance\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that \u00a720(b)\ncould provide a basis for liability in this case, ante, at 10,\nn. 10, then it should remand the case for possible amend\u00ad\nment of the complaint. \u201cThere is a dearth of authority\nconstruing Section 20(b),\u201d which has been thought largely\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201csuperfluous in 10b\u20135 cases.\u201d 5B A. Jacobs, Disclosure\nand Remedies Under the Securities Law \u00a711\u20138, p. 11\u201372\n(2011). Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it\nreferred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless\nfor failing to mention \u00a720(b) as well.\n  In sum, I can find nothing in \u00a710(b) or in Rule 10b\u20135, its\nlanguage, its history, or in precedent suggesting that\nCongress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a\nloophole of the kind that the majority\u2019s rule may well\ncreate.\n                              II\n  Rejecting the majority\u2019s rule, of course, does not decide\nthe question before us. We must still determine whether,\nin light of the complaint\u2019s allegations, Janus Management\ncould have \u201cma[d]e\u201d the false statements in the\nprospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this\nquestion is \u201cYes.\u201d      The specific relationships alleged\namong Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the\nprospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus\nManagement did \u201cmake\u201d those statements.\n  In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court\nand lower courts have made clear that at least sometimes\ncorporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule\n10b\u20135 for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d a materially false statement\neven when that statement appears in a document (or is\nmade by a third person) that the officials do not legally\ncontrol. In Herman & MacLean, for example, this Court\npointed out that \u201ccertain individuals who play a part in\npreparing the registration statement,\u201d including corporate\nofficers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable\neven where \u201cthey are not named as having prepared or\ncertified\u201d the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.\n22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in\nCentral Bank that a \u201clawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .\nmakes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a\n12    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npurchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a\nprimary violator under 10b\u20135, assuming all of the re\u00ad\nquirements for primary liability under Rule 10b\u20135 are\nmet.\u201d 511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).\n   Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris\u00ad\ning that lower courts have found primary liability for\nactors without \u201cultimate authority\u201d over issued state\u00ad\nments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac\u00ad\ncountant could be primarily liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d\nfalse statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and\ncertification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual\nreports, and other corporate materials for which he was\nnot ultimately responsible.        Anixter v. Home-Stake\nProduction Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225\u20131227 (CA10 1996). In\na later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed\nthat an outside consultant could be primarily liable for\nhaving \u201cma[d]e\u201d false statements, where he drafted\nfraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later\nreviewed and certified by the firm\u2019s auditor, officers, and\ncounsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10\n2008). And another court found that a corporation\u2019s chief\nfinancial officer could be held primarily liable as having\n\u201cma[d]e\u201d misstatements that appeared in a form 10\u2013K\nthat she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.\nSEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).\n   One can also easily find lower court cases explaining\nthat corporate officials may be liable for having \u201cma[d]e\u201d\nfalse statements where those officials use innocent\npersons as conduits through which the false statements\nreach the public (without necessarily attributing the false\nstatements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.\nSecurities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil\u00ad\nity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to\ncommunicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron\nSystems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test\nrequiring legal \u201ccontrol\u201d over third parties making state\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
