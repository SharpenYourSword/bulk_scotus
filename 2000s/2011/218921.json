UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u20135400. Argued April 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nPetitioner Tapia was convicted of, inter alia, smuggling unauthorized\n  aliens into the United States. The District Court imposed a 51\n  month prison term, reasoning that Tapia should serve that long in\n  order to qualify for and complete the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Residential\n  Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). On appeal, Tapia argued that length\n  ening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to \u201crecogniz[e]\n  that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc\n  tion and rehabilitation.\u201d The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Relying on\n  Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a\n  prison term to assist a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, but once impris\n  onment is chosen, the court may consider the defendant\u2019s rehabilita\n  tion needs in setting the sentence\u2019s length.\nHeld: Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or\n lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\n Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) For nearly a century, the Federal Government used an inde\n terminate sentencing system premised on faith in rehabilitation.\n Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363. Because that system\n produced \u201cserious disparities in [the] sentences\u201d imposed on similarly\n situated defendants, id., at 365, and failed to \u201cachieve rehabilitation,\u201d\n id., at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\n (SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines\n would provide courts with \u201ca range of determinate sentences,\u201d id., at\n 368. Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least im\n prisonment, probation, or a fine. See \u00a73551(b). In determining the\n appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence,\n incapacitation, and rehabilitation, \u00a73553(a)(2), but a particular pur\n2                       TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of\n    sentence under consideration. As relevant here, a court ordering im\n    prisonment must \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropri\n    ate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a73582(a). A\n    similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sen\n    tencing Guidelines\u2019 author, to \u201cinsure that the guidelines reflect the\n    inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment\n    for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(k).\n    Pp. 3\u20136.\n        (b) Consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim starts with \u00a73582(a)\u2019s clear text.\n    Putting together the most natural definitions of \u201crecognize\u201d\u2014\u201cto ac\n    knowledge or treat as valid\u201d\u2014and not \u201cappropriate\u201d\u2014not \u201csuitable or\n    fitting for a particular purpose\u201d\u2014\u00a73582(a) tells courts to acknowledge\n    that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting reha\n    bilitation. It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment\n    when \u201cdetermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and\n    . . . [when] determining the length of the term.\u201d Amicus, appointed to\n    defend the judgment below, argues that the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause is\n    merely a caution for judges not to put too much faith in the capacity\n    of prisons to rehabilitate. But his alternative interpretation is un\n    persuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in \u00a73582(a). Amicus\n    also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning that \u00a73582\u2019s term\n    \u201cimprisonment\u201d relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the\n    determination of the sentence\u2019s length. Because \u201cimprisonment\u201d\n    most naturally means \u201cthe state of being confined\u201d or \u201ca period of con\n    finement,\u201d it does not distinguish between the defendant\u2019s initial\n    placement behind bars and his continued stay there.\n        Section 3582(a)\u2019s context supports this textual conclusion. By re\n    stating \u00a73582(a)\u2019s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress\n    ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to imple\n    ment the statutory determination to \u201creject imprisonment as a means\n    of promoting rehabilitation.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. Equally il\n    luminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to en\n    sure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.\n    When Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabili\n    tative needs, it gave them authority to do so. See, e.g., \u00a73563(b)(9).\n    In fact, although a sentencing court can recommend that an offender\n    be placed in a particular facility or program, see \u00a73582(a), the author\n    ity to make the placement rests with the Bureau of Prisons, see, e.g.,\n    \u00a73621(e). The point is well illustrated here, where the District\n    Court\u2019s strong recommendations that Tapia participate in RDAP and\n    be placed in a particular facility went unfulfilled. Finally, for those\n    who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report on the\n    SRA provides corroborating evidence. Pp. 6\u201312.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Pp. 12\u201314.\n     (d) Here, the sentencing transcript suggests that Tapia\u2019s sentence\n  may have been lengthened in light of her rehabilitative needs. A\n  court does not err by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation\n  within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training pro\n  grams. But the record indicates that the District Court may have in\n  creased the length of Tapia\u2019s sentence to ensure her completion of\n  RDAP, something a court may not do. The Ninth Circuit is left to\n  consider on remand the effect of Tapia\u2019s failure to object to the sen\n  tence when imposed. Pp. 14\u201315.\n376 Fed.

We hold that it does.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Alejandra Tapia was convicted of, inter alia,\nsmuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States, in\nviolation of 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii). At sen\ntencing, the District Court determined that the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term\nof between 41 and 51 months for Tapia\u2019s offenses. The\ncourt decided to impose a 51-month term, followed by\nthree years of supervised release. In explaining its rea\nsons, the court referred several times to Tapia\u2019s need for\ndrug treatment, citing in particular the Bureau of Prison\u2019s\nResidential Drug Abuse Program (known as RDAP or the\n500 Hour Drug Program). The court indicated that Tapia\nshould serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and\ncomplete that program:\n      \u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed\n    correctional treatment, and here I think the needed\n2                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    correctional treatment is the 500 Hour Drug Program.\n      .           .          .          .         .\n\n    \u201cHere I have to say that one of the factors that\u2014I am\n    going to impose a 51-month sentence, . . . and one of\n    the factors that affects this is the need to provide\n    treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to\n    get the 500 Hour Drug Program, number one.\u201d App.\n    27.\n(\u201cNumber two\u201d was \u201cto deter her from committing other\ncriminal offenses.\u201d Ibid.)

App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. In Tapia\u2019s\nview, this action violated 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(a), which\ninstructs sentencing courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprison\nment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction\nand rehabilitation.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit disagreed, 376 Fed. Appx. 707 (2010),\nrelying on its prior decision in United States v. Duran, 37\nF. 3d 557 (1994). The Ninth Circuit had held there that\n\u00a73582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term\nof imprisonment and determining its length. See id., at\n561. According to Duran, a sentencing court cannot im\npose a prison term to assist a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\nBut \u201c[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,\u201d the\ncourt may consider the defendant\u2019s need for rehabilitation\nin setting the length of the sentence.

S. ___ (2010). That question has divided the Courts of\nAppeals.1 Because the United States agrees with Tapia\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute, we appointed an amicus\ncuriae to defend the judgment below.2 We now reverse.\n                             II\n   We begin with statutory background\u2014how the relevant\nsentencing provisions came about and what they say.\nAficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize\nmuch of the story line.\n   \u201cFor almost a century, the Federal Government em\nployed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sen\ntencing.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363\n(1989). Within \u201ccustomarily wide\u201d outer boundaries set by\nCongress, trial judges exercised \u201calmost unfettered discre\ntion\u201d to select prison sentences for federal offenders. Id.,\nat 364. In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison\ntime altogether, by imposing a \u201csuspended\u201d sentence. If\nthe judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary\nauthority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant\nhad spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order\nhis release. See K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging:\nSentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18\u201320 (1998).\n   This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Three Circuits have held that \u00a73582(a) allows a court to lengthen,\nalthough not to impose, a prison term based on the need for rehabilita\ntion. See United States v. Duran, 37 F. 3d 557 (CA9 1994); United\nStates v. Hawk Wing, 433 F. 3d 622 (CA8 2006); United States v.\nJimenez, 605 F. 3d 415 (CA6 2010). Two Courts of Appeals have ruled\nthat \u00a73582(a) bars a court from either imposing or increasing a period\nof confinement for rehabilitative reasons. See United States v. Man\nzella, 475 F. 3d 152 (CA3 2007); In re Sealed Case, 573 F. 3d 844\n(CADC 2009).\n   2 We appointed Stephanos Bibas to brief and argue the case, 562 U. S.\n\n___ (2011), and he has ably discharged his responsibilities.\n4                      TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nDiscretion allowed \u201cthe judge and the parole officer to\n[base] their respective sentencing and release decisions\nupon their own assessments of the offender\u2019s amenability\nto rehabilitation.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 363. A convict,\nthe theory went, should generally remain in prison only\nuntil he was able to reenter society safely. His release\ntherefore often coincided with \u201cthe successful completion\nof certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro\ngrams within the prisons.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 40\n(1983) (hereinafter S. Rep.). At that point, parole officials\ncould \u201cdetermin[e] that [the] prisoner had become reha\nbilitated and should be released from confinement.\u201d Stith\n& Cabranes, supra, at 18.3\n   But this model of indeterminate sentencing eventually\nfell into disfavor. One concern was that it produced \u201c[s]eri\nous disparities in [the] sentences\u201d imposed on simi-\nlarly situated defendants. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 365.\nAnother was that the system\u2019s attempt to \u201cachieve reha\nbilitation of offenders had failed.\u201d Id., at 366. Lawmakers\nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs\ncould \u201crehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u201d\u2014or that\nparole officers could \u201cdetermine accurately whether or\nwhen a particular prisoner ha[d] been rehabilitated.\u201d\nS. Rep., at 40.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The statutes governing punishment of drug-addicted offenders (like\n\nTapia) provide an example of this system at work. If a court concluded\nthat such an offender was \u201clikely to be rehabilitated through treat\nment,\u201d it could order confinement \u201cfor treatment . . . for an indetermi\nnate period of time\u201d not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the statutory\nmaximum for the offender\u2019s crime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a74253(a) (1982 ed.); see\nalso \u00a74251(c) (\u201c \u2018Treatment\u2019 includes confinement and treatment in an\ninstitution . . . and includes, but is not limited to, medical, educational,\nsocial, psychological, and vocational services, corrective and preventive\nguidance and training, and other rehabilitative services\u201d). Once the\noffender had undergone treatment for six months, the Attorney General\ncould recommend that the Board of Parole release him from custody,\nand the Board could then order release \u201cin its discretion.\u201d \u00a74254.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform\nAct of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul fed\neral sentencing practices. The Act abandoned indetermi\nnate sentencing and parole in favor of a system in which\nSentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing\nCommission, would provide courts with \u201ca range of deter\nminate sentences for categories of offenses and defen\ndants.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 368. And the Act further\nchanneled judges\u2019 discretion by establishing a framework\nto govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.\n   Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender\nmust impose at least one of the following sanctions: im\nprisonment (often followed by supervised release), proba\ntion, or a fine. See \u00a73551(b). In determining the appro\npriate sentence from among these options, \u00a73553(a)(2)\nrequires the judge to consider specified factors, including:\n    \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n              \u201c(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\n              to promote respect for the law, and to pro\n              vide just punishment for the offense;\n              \u201c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to crimi\n              nal conduct;\n              \u201c(C) to protect the public from further\n              crimes of the defendant; and\n              \u201c(D) to provide the defendant with needed\n              educational or vocational training, medical\n              care, or other correctional treatment in the\n              most effective manner.\u201d\nThese four considerations\u2014retribution, deterrence, inca\npacitation, and rehabilitation\u2014are the four purposes of\nsentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence\n\u201cto achieve the[se] purposes . . . to the extent that they are\napplicable\u201d in a given case. \u00a73551(a).\n  The SRA then provides additional guidance about how\nthe considerations listed in \u00a73553(a)(2) pertain to each of\n6                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Act\u2019s main sentencing options\u2014imprisonment, super\nvised release, probation, and fines. See \u00a73582(a); \u00a73583;\n\u00a73562(a); \u00a73572(a). These provisions make clear that a\nparticular purpose may apply differently, or even not at\nall, depending on the kind of sentence under considera\ntion. For example, a court may not take account of retri\nbution (the first purpose listed in \u00a73553(a)(2)) when impos\ning a term of supervised release. See \u00a73583(c).\n   Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the\n\u201cfactors to be considered\u201d when a court orders imprison\nment. That section provides:\n    \u201cThe court, in determining whether to impose a term\n    of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is\n    to be imposed, in determining the length of the term,\n    shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n    to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing\n    that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\n    promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d\nA similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission\nin its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines.\nThe SRA instructs the Commission to:\n    \u201cinsure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriate\n    ness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment\n    for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or pro\n    viding the defendant with needed educational or voca\n    tional training, medical care, or other correctional\n    treatment.\u201d 28 U.

As just noted,\nthat section instructs courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that impris\nonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc\ntion and rehabilitation.\u201d A common\u2014and in context the\nmost natural\u2014definition of the word \u201crecognize\u201d is \u201cto ac\nknowledge or treat as valid.\u201d Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1611 (2d ed. 1987). And a thing\nthat is not \u201cappropriate\u201d is not \u201csuitable or fitting for a\nparticular purpose.\u201d Id., at 103. Putting these two defini\ntions together, \u00a73582(a) tells courts that they should ac\nknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the pur\npose of promoting rehabilitation. And when should courts\nacknowledge this? Section \u00a73582(a) answers: when \u201cde\ntermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and,\nif a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [when] deter\nmining the length of the term.\u201d So a court making these\ndecisions should consider the specified rationales of\npunishment except for rehabilitation, which it should ac\nknowledge as an unsuitable justification for a prison term.\n   As against this understanding, amicus argues that\n\u00a73582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause is not a flat prohibition\nbut only a \u201creminder\u201d or a \u201cguide [for] sentencing judges\u2019\ncognitive processes.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus\nCuriae in Support of Judgment Below 23\u201324 (hereinafter\nAmicus Brief) (emphasis deleted). Amicus supports this\nview by offering a string of other definitions of the\nword \u201crecognize\u201d: \u201c \u2018recall to mind,\u2019 \u2018realize,\u2019 or \u2018perceive\nclearly.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 24 (quoting dictionary definitions). Once\nthese are plugged in, amicus suggests, \u00a73582(a) reveals\nitself as a kind of loosey-goosey caution not to put too\nmuch faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.\n   But we do not see how these alternative meanings of\n\u201crecognize\u201d help amicus\u2019s cause. A judge who \u201cperceives\nclearly\u201d that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\npromoting rehabilitation would hardly incarcerate some\none for that purpose. Ditto for a judge who \u201crealizes\u201d or\n8                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crecalls\u201d that imprisonment is not a way to rehabilitate an\noffender. To be sure, the drafters of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause could have used still more commanding language:\nCongress could have inserted a \u201cthou shalt not\u201d or equiva\nlent phrase to convey that a sentencing judge may never,\never, under any circumstances consider rehabilitation in\nimposing a prison term. But when we interpret a statute,\nwe cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the merely\nexcellent. Congress expressed itself clearly in \u00a73582(a),\neven if armchair legislators might come up with some\nthing even better. And what Congress said was that when\nsentencing an offender to prison, the court shall consider\nall the purposes of punishment except rehabilitation\u2014\nbecause imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\npursuing that goal.\n   Amicus also claims, echoing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reason\ning in Duran, that \u00a73582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause bars\ncourts from considering rehabilitation only when imposing\na prison term, and not when deciding on its length. The\nargument goes as follows. Section 3582(a) refers to two\ndecisions: \u201cThe court, [1] in determining whether to im\npose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprison\nment is to be imposed, [2] in determining the length of the\nterm\u201d must consider the purposes of punishment listed\nin \u00a73553(a)(2), subject to the caveat of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause. But that clause says only that \u201cimprisonment\u201d is\nnot an appropriate means of rehabilitation. Because the\n\u201cprimary meaning of \u2018imprisonment\u2019 is \u2018the act of confining\na person,\u2019 \u201d amicus argues, the clause relates only to\n[1] the decision to incarcerate, and not to [2] the separate\ndetermination of the sentence\u2019s length. Amicus Brief 52.\n   We again disagree. Under standard rules of grammar,\n\u00a73582(a) says: A sentencing judge shall recognize that\nimprisonment is not appropriate to promote rehabilita\ntion when the court considers the applicable factors of\n\u00a73553(a)(2); and a court considers these factors when\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining both whether to imprison an offender and\nwhat length of term to give him.          The use of the\nword \u201cimprisonment\u201d in the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause does not\ndestroy\u2014but instead fits neatly into\u2014this construction.\n\u201cImprisonment\u201d as used in the clause most naturally\nmeans \u201c[t]he state of being confined\u201d or \u201ca period of con\nfinement.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed. 2009); see\nalso Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1137\n(1993) (the \u201cstate of being imprisoned\u201d). So the word does\nnot distinguish between the defendant\u2019s initial placement\nbehind bars and his continued stay there. As the D. C.\nCircuit noted in rejecting an identical argument, \u201c[a]\nsentencing court deciding to keep a defendant locked up\nfor an additional month is, as to that month, in fact choos\ning imprisonment over release.\u201d In re Sealed Case, 573\nF. 3d 844, 850 (2009).4 Accordingly, the word \u201cimprison\nment\u201d does not change the function of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause\u2014to constrain a sentencing court\u2019s decision both to\nimpose and to lengthen a prison term.5\n   The context of \u00a73582(a) puts an exclamation point on\nthis textual conclusion. As noted earlier, supra, at 6,\nanother provision of the SRA restates \u00a73582(a)\u2019s message,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Indeed, we can scarcely imagine a reason why Congress would have\n\nwanted to draw the distinction that amicus urges on us. That distinc\ntion would prevent a court from considering rehabilitative needs in\nimposing a 1-month sentence rather than probation, but not in choosing\na 60-month sentence over a 1-month term. The only policy argument\namicus can offer in favor of this result is that \u201c[t]he effects of impris\nonment plateau a short while after the incarceration\u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]he dif\nference in harm between longer and shorter prison terms is smaller\nthan typically assumed.\u2019 \u201d Amicus Brief 56. But nothing in the SRA\nindicates that Congress is so indifferent to the length of prison terms.\n   5 The Government argues that \u201cCongress did not intend to prohibit\n\ncourts from imposing less imprisonment in order to promote a defen\ndant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d Brief for United States 40 (emphasis added).\nThis case does not require us to address that question, and nothing in\nour decision expresses any views on it.\n10                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut to a different audience. That provision, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(k), directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that\nthe Guidelines \u201creflect the inappropriateness of imposing a\nsentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of\nrehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant\nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical\ncare, or other correctional treatment.\u201d In this way, Con\ngress ensured that all sentencing officials would work\nin tandem to implement the statutory determination to\n\u201crejec[t] imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilita\ntion.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367 (citing 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(k)). Section 994(k) bars the Commission from rec\nommending a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\u2014a phrase that\nagain refers both to the fact and to the length of incarcera\ntion\u2014based on a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs. And\n\u00a73582(a) prohibits a court from considering those needs to\nimpose or lengthen a period of confinement when selecting\na sentence from within, or choosing to depart from, the\nGuidelines range. Each actor at each stage in the sentenc\ning process receives the same message: Do not think about\nprison as a way to rehabilitate an offender.\n   Equally illuminating here is a statutory silence\u2014the\nabsence of any provision granting courts the power to\nensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation\nprograms. For when Congress wanted sentencing courts\nto take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave courts\nthe authority to direct appropriate treatment for offend\ners. Thus, the SRA instructs courts, in deciding whether\nto impose probation or supervised release, to consider\nwhether an offender could benefit from training and treat\nment programs. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73562(a); \u00a73583(c). And\nso the SRA also authorizes courts, when imposing those\nsentences, to order an offender\u2019s participation in cer\ntain programs and facilities. \u00a73563(b)(9); \u00a73563(b)(11);\n\u00a73563(a)(4); \u00a73583(d). As a condition of probation, for\nexample, the court may require the offender to \u201cundergo\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\navailable medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment,\nincluding treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as\nspecified by the court, and [to] remain in a specified insti\ntution if required for that purpose.\u201d \u00a73563(b)(9).\n   If Congress had similarly meant to allow courts to base\nprison terms on offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs, it would\nhave given courts the capacity to ensure that offenders\nparticipate in prison correctional programs. But in fact,\ncourts do not have this authority. When a court sentences\na federal offender, the BOP has plenary control, subject to\nstatutory constraints, over \u201cthe place of the prisoner\u2019s\nimprisonment,\u201d \u00a73621(b), and the treatment programs (if\nany) in which he may participate, \u00a7\u00a73621(e), (f ); \u00a73624(f ).\nSee also 28 CFR pt. 544 (2010) (BOP regulations for ad\nministering inmate educational, recreational, and voca\ntional programs); 28 CFR pt. 550, subpart F (drug abuse\ntreatment programs). A sentencing court can recommend\nthat the BOP place an offender in a particular facility\nor program. See \u00a73582(a). But decisionmaking authority\nrests with the BOP.\n   This case well illustrates the point. As noted earlier,\nthe District Court \u201cstrongly recommend[ed]\u201d that Tapia\nparticipate in RDAP, App. 29, and serve her sentence at\nFCI Dublin, \u201cwhere they have the facilities to really help\nher,\u201d id., at 28. But the court\u2019s recommendations were\nonly recommendations\u2014and in the end they had no effect.\nSee Amicus Brief 42 (\u201c[Tapia] was not admitted to RDAP,\nnor even placed in the prison recommended by the district\ncourt\u201d); Reply Brief for United States 8, n. 1 (\u201cAccording to\nBOP records, [Tapia] was encouraged to enroll [in RDAP]\nduring her psychology intake screening at [the federal\nprison], but she stated that she was not interested, and\nshe has not volunteered for the program\u201d). The sentencing\ncourt may have had plans for Tapia\u2019s rehabilitation, but it\nlacked the power to implement them. That incapacity\nspeaks volumes. It indicates that Congress did not intend\n12                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat courts consider offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs when\nimposing prison sentences.\n   Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful,\nthe key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one\nlast piece of corroborating evidence. According to that\nReport, decades of experience with indeterminate sentenc\ning, resulting in the release of many inmates after they\ncompleted correctional programs, had left Congress skep\ntical that \u201crehabilitation can be induced reliably in a\nprison setting.\u201d S. Rep., at 38. Although some critics\nargued that \u201crehabilitation should be eliminated com\npletely as a purpose of sentencing,\u201d Congress declined to\nadopt that categorical position. Id., at 76. Instead, the\nReport explains, Congress barred courts from considering\nrehabilitation in imposing prison terms, ibid., and n. 165,\nbut not in ordering other kinds of sentences, ibid., and\nn. 164. \u201c[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,\u201d the Report\nstated, \u201cis still important in determining whether a sanc\ntion other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in a\nparticular case.\u201d See id., at 76\u201377 (emphasis added).\n   And so this is a case in which text, context, and history\npoint to the same bottom line: Section 3582(a) precludes\nsentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison\nterm to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\n                              B\n  With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked\nagainst him, amicus understandably tries to put the SRA\u2019s\nview of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame. Amicus\nbegins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA,\nrejected the old \u201c[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.\u201d Amicus Brief 1.\nBut according to amicus, that model had a very limited\nfocus: It was the belief that \u201cisolation and prison routine\u201d\ncould alone produce \u201cpenitence and spiritual renewal.\u201d\nId., at 1, 11. What the rehabilitation model did not in\nclude\u2014and the SRA therefore did not reject\u2014was prison\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment programs (including for drug addiction) tar\ngeted to offenders\u2019 particular needs. See id., at 21, 25, 27\u2013\n28. So even after the passage of \u00a73582(a), amicus argues,\na court may impose or lengthen a prison sentence to pro\nmote an offender\u2019s participation in a targeted treatment\nprogram. The only thing the court may not do is to impose\na prison term on the ground that confinement itself\u2014its\ninherent solitude and routine\u2014will lead to rehabilitation.\n    We think this reading of the SRA is too narrow. For one\nthing, the relevant history shows that at the time of\nthe SRA\u2019s enactment, prison rehabilitation efforts focused\non treatment, counseling, and training programs, not on\nseclusion and regimentation. See Rotman, The Failure of\nReform: United States, 1865\u20131965, in Oxford History of\nthe Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society\n169, 189\u2013190 (N. Morris & D. Rothman eds. 1995) (de\nscribing the pre-SRA \u201ctherapeutic model of rehabilitation\u201d\nas characterized by \u201cindividualized treatment\u201d and \u201cvoca\ntional training and group counseling programs\u201d); see also\nn. 3, supra (noting pre-SRA statutes linking the confine\nment of drug addicts to the completion of treatment pro\ngrams). Indeed, Congress had in mind precisely these\nprograms when it prohibited consideration of rehabilita\ntion in imposing a prison term. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(k)\n(instructing the Sentencing Commission to prevent the\nuse of imprisonment to \u201cprovid[e] the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training . . . or other\ncorrectional treatment\u201d); S. Rep., at 40 (rejecting the\n\u201cmodel of \u2018coercive\u2019 rehabilitation\u2014the theory of correction\nthat ties prison release dates to the successful completion\nof certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro\ngrams within the prisons\u201d). Far from falling outside the\n\u201crehabilitation model,\u201d these programs practically defined\nit.\n    It is hardly surprising, then, that amicus\u2019s argument\nfinds little support in the statutory text. Read most natu\n14                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrally, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(a)\u2019s prohibition on \u201cpromoting\ncorrection and rehabilitation\u201d covers efforts to place of\nfenders in rehabilitation programs. Indeed, \u00a73582(a)\u2019s lan\nguage recalls the SRA\u2019s description of the rehabilitative\npurpose of sentencing\u2014\u201cprovid[ing] the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or\nother correctional treatment.\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(D). That de\nscription makes clear that, under the SRA, treatment,\ntraining, and like programs are rehabilitation\u2019s sum and\nsubstance. So amicus\u2019s efforts to exclude rehabilitation\nprograms from the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause\u2019s reach do not\nsucceed. That section prevents a sentencing court from\nimposing or lengthening a prison term because the court\nthinks an offender will benefit from a prison treatment\nprogram.\n                             IV\n   In this case, the sentencing transcript suggests the\npossibility that Tapia\u2019s sentence was based on her reha\nbilitative needs.\n   We note first what we do not disapprove about Tapia\u2019s\nsentencing. A court commits no error by discussing the\nopportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the bene\nfits of specific treatment or training programs. To the\ncontrary, a court properly may address a person who is\nabout to begin a prison term about these important mat\nters. And as noted earlier, a court may urge the BOP to\nplace an offender in a prison treatment program. See\nsupra, at 11. Section 3582(a) itself provides, just after the\nclause at issue here, that a court may \u201cmake a recommen\ndation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate\nfor the defendant\u201d; and in this calculus, the presence of a\nrehabilitation program may make one facility more appro\npriate than another. So the sentencing court here did\nnothing wrong\u2014and probably something very right\u2014in\ntrying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                 15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprogram.\n  But the record indicates that the court may have done\nmore\u2014that it may have selected the length of the sentence\nto ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug\nProgram. \u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient,\u201d the court\nexplained, \u201cto provide needed correctional treatment, and\nhere I think the needed correctional treatment is the\n500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see supra, at 1\u20132. Or\nagain: The \u201cnumber one\u201d thing \u201cis the need to provide\ntreatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get\nthe 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see supra, at 2.\nThese statements suggest that the court may have calcu\nlated the length of Tapia\u2019s sentence to ensure that she\nreceive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentenc\ning court may not do. As we have held, a court may not\nimpose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender\nto complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote\nrehabilitation.\n  For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion. Consistent with our\npractice, see, e.g., United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 8), we leave it to the Court of Ap\npeals to consider the effect of Tapia\u2019s failure to object to\nthe sentence when imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731 (1993).\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

I write separately\nto note my skepticism that the District Judge violated this\nproscription in this case.\n  At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge carefully\nreviewed the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a73553(a).\nFirst, he considered \u201c[t]he nature and circumstances of the\noffense\u201d committed by petitioner Alejandra Tapia\u2014in this\ncase, alien smuggling. App. 25\u201326; see \u00a73553(a)(1). He\nemphasized that Tapia\u2019s criminal conduct \u201ccreated a sub\nstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\u201d to the\nsmuggled aliens. App. 26; see also id., at 20 (noting that\nthe aliens were secreted in the vehicle\u2019s gas tank com\npartment). Second, he reviewed Tapia\u2019s \u201chistory and\ncharacteristics,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(1), including her history of being\nabused and her associations \u201cwith the wrong people,\u201d id.,\nat 26. He noted his particular concern about Tapia\u2019s\ncriminal conduct while released on bail, when she failed to\nappear and was found in an apartment with meth\namphetamine, a sawed-off shotgun, and stolen mail.\nId., at 25\u201326. Third, he noted that the offense was\n\u201cserious,\u201d warranting a \u201csufficient\u201d sentence. Id., at 26; see\n2                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A). Fourth, he considered the need \u201cto deter\ncriminal conduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further\ncrimes of the defendant,\u201d which he characterized as a \u201cbig\nfactor here, given [Tapia\u2019s] failure to appear and what she\ndid out on bail.\u201d App. 26; see \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C). Fifth,\nhe took account of the need \u201cto provide needed correctional\ntreatment,\u201d in this case, the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) \u201c500\nHour Drug Program,\u201d more officially called the Residential\nDrug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). App. 27; see\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(D). And, finally, he noted the need \u201cto avoid\nunwarranted sentencing disparities\u201d and the need for the\nsentence \u201cto be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a)\nbut not greater.\u201d App. 27; see \u00a7\u00a73553(a), (a)(6).\n   Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36\nmonths\u2019 incarceration, App. 18, but her Guidelines range\nwas 41 to 51 months, id., at 13. After reviewing the\n\u00a73553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51\nmonths, the top of the Guidelines range. He offered two\nreasons for choosing this sentence: \u201cnumber one,\u201d the need\nfor drug treatment; and \u201c[n]umber two,\u201d deterrence. Id.,\nat 27. With respect to the latter reason, the judge high\nlighted Tapia\u2019s criminal history and her criminal conduct\nwhile released on bail\u2014which, he said, was \u201csomething\nthat motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the\nhigh end of the guideline range.\u201d Id., at 27\u201328. He con\ncluded, \u201cI think that a sentence less than what I am im\nposing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time\nso she could begin to address these problems.\u201d Id., at 28.\n   The District Judge\u2019s comments at sentencing suggest\nthat he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in\nfurther criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51\nmonths\u2019 incarceration. Granted, the judge also mentioned\nthe need to provide drug treatment through the RDAP.\nThe 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to\nhave had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP. See\nBOP Program Statement No. P5330.11, \u00a72.5.1(b) (Mar. 16,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an\ninmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining\non her sentence). Even the 36-month mandatory mini\nmum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the\nRDAP. I thus find it questionable that the judge length\nened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for\ndeterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was\nnecessary for rehabilitation. Cf. S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225,\np. 176 (1983) (\u201cA term imposed for another purpose of\nsentencing may . . . have a rehabilitative focus if rehabil\nitation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose\nof the sentence\u201d).\n   Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District\nJudge imposed or lengthened Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote\nrehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sen\ntencing were not perfectly clear. Given that Ninth Circuit\nprecedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to con\nsider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see\nante, at 2, and that the judge stated that the sentence\nneeded to be \u201clong enough to get the 500 Hour Drug\nProgram,\u201d App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not\nlengthen Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote rehabilitation in\nviolation of \u00a73582(a). I therefore agree with the Court\u2019s\ndisposition of this case and join the Court\u2019s opinion in full.\n",

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u20135400. Argued April 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nPetitioner Tapia was convicted of, inter alia, smuggling unauthorized\n  aliens into the United States. The District Court imposed a 51\n  month prison term, reasoning that Tapia should serve that long in\n  order to qualify for and complete the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Residential\n  Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). On appeal, Tapia argued that length\n  ening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to \u201crecogniz[e]\n  that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc\n  tion and rehabilitation.\u201d The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Relying on\n  Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a\n  prison term to assist a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, but once impris\n  onment is chosen, the court may consider the defendant\u2019s rehabilita\n  tion needs in setting the sentence\u2019s length.\nHeld: Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or\n lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\n Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) For nearly a century, the Federal Government used an inde\n terminate sentencing system premised on faith in rehabilitation.\n Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363. Because that system\n produced \u201cserious disparities in [the] sentences\u201d imposed on similarly\n situated defendants, id., at 365, and failed to \u201cachieve rehabilitation,\u201d\n id., at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984\n (SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines\n would provide courts with \u201ca range of determinate sentences,\u201d id., at\n 368. Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least im\n prisonment, probation, or a fine. See \u00a73551(b). In determining the\n appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence,\n incapacitation, and rehabilitation, \u00a73553(a)(2), but a particular pur\n2                       TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of\n    sentence under consideration. As relevant here, a court ordering im\n    prisonment must \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropri\n    ate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d \u00a73582(a). A\n    similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sen\n    tencing Guidelines\u2019 author, to \u201cinsure that the guidelines reflect the\n    inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment\n    for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(k).\n    Pp. 3\u20136.\n        (b) Consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim starts with \u00a73582(a)\u2019s clear text.\n    Putting together the most natural definitions of \u201crecognize\u201d\u2014\u201cto ac\n    knowledge or treat as valid\u201d\u2014and not \u201cappropriate\u201d\u2014not \u201csuitable or\n    fitting for a particular purpose\u201d\u2014\u00a73582(a) tells courts to acknowledge\n    that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting reha\n    bilitation. It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment\n    when \u201cdetermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and\n    . . . [when] determining the length of the term.\u201d Amicus, appointed to\n    defend the judgment below, argues that the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause is\n    merely a caution for judges not to put too much faith in the capacity\n    of prisons to rehabilitate. But his alternative interpretation is un\n    persuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in \u00a73582(a). Amicus\n    also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning that \u00a73582\u2019s term\n    \u201cimprisonment\u201d relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the\n    determination of the sentence\u2019s length. Because \u201cimprisonment\u201d\n    most naturally means \u201cthe state of being confined\u201d or \u201ca period of con\n    finement,\u201d it does not distinguish between the defendant\u2019s initial\n    placement behind bars and his continued stay there.\n        Section 3582(a)\u2019s context supports this textual conclusion. By re\n    stating \u00a73582(a)\u2019s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress\n    ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to imple\n    ment the statutory determination to \u201creject imprisonment as a means\n    of promoting rehabilitation.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. Equally il\n    luminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to en\n    sure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.\n    When Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabili\n    tative needs, it gave them authority to do so. See, e.g., \u00a73563(b)(9).\n    In fact, although a sentencing court can recommend that an offender\n    be placed in a particular facility or program, see \u00a73582(a), the author\n    ity to make the placement rests with the Bureau of Prisons, see, e.g.,\n    \u00a73621(e). The point is well illustrated here, where the District\n    Court\u2019s strong recommendations that Tapia participate in RDAP and\n    be placed in a particular facility went unfulfilled. Finally, for those\n    who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report on the\n    SRA provides corroborating evidence. Pp. 6\u201312.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

But the record indicates that the District Court may have in\n  creased the length of Tapia\u2019s sentence to ensure her completion of\n  RDAP, something a court may not do.

We hold that it does.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Alejandra Tapia was convicted of, inter alia,\nsmuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States, in\nviolation of 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii). At sen\ntencing, the District Court determined that the United\nStates Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term\nof between 41 and 51 months for Tapia\u2019s offenses. The\ncourt decided to impose a 51-month term, followed by\nthree years of supervised release. In explaining its rea\nsons, the court referred several times to Tapia\u2019s need for\ndrug treatment, citing in particular the Bureau of Prison\u2019s\nResidential Drug Abuse Program (known as RDAP or the\n500 Hour Drug Program). The court indicated that Tapia\nshould serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and\ncomplete that program:\n      \u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed\n    correctional treatment, and here I think the needed\n2                 TAPIA v.

C. \u00a73582(a), which\ninstructs sentencing courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprison\nment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction\nand rehabilitation.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit disagreed, 376 Fed. Appx. 707 (2010),\nrelying on its prior decision in United States v. Duran, 37\nF. 3d 557 (1994). The Ninth Circuit had held there that\n\u00a73582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term\nof imprisonment and determining its length. See id., at\n561. According to Duran, a sentencing court cannot im\npose a prison term to assist a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\nBut \u201c[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,\u201d the\ncourt may consider the defendant\u2019s need for rehabilitation\nin setting the length of the sentence.

That question has divided the Courts of\nAppeals.1 Because the United States agrees with Tapia\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute, we appointed an amicus\ncuriae to defend the judgment below.2 We now reverse.\n                             II\n   We begin with statutory background\u2014how the relevant\nsentencing provisions came about and what they say.\nAficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize\nmuch of the story line.\n   \u201cFor almost a century, the Federal Government em\nployed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sen\ntencing.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363\n(1989). Within \u201ccustomarily wide\u201d outer boundaries set by\nCongress, trial judges exercised \u201calmost unfettered discre\ntion\u201d to select prison sentences for federal offenders. Id.,\nat 364. In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison\ntime altogether, by imposing a \u201csuspended\u201d sentence. If\nthe judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary\nauthority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant\nhad spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order\nhis release. See K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging:\nSentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18\u201320 (1998).\n   This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Three Circuits have held that \u00a73582(a) allows a court to lengthen,\nalthough not to impose, a prison term based on the need for rehabilita\ntion. See United States v. Duran, 37 F. 3d 557 (CA9 1994); United\nStates v. Hawk Wing, 433 F. 3d 622 (CA8 2006); United States v.\nJimenez, 605 F. 3d 415 (CA6 2010). Two Courts of Appeals have ruled\nthat \u00a73582(a) bars a court from either imposing or increasing a period\nof confinement for rehabilitative reasons. See United States v. Man\nzella, 475 F. 3d 152 (CA3 2007); In re Sealed Case, 573 F. 3d 844\n(CADC 2009).\n   2 We appointed Stephanos Bibas to brief and argue the case, 562 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nDiscretion allowed \u201cthe judge and the parole officer to\n[base] their respective sentencing and release decisions\nupon their own assessments of the offender\u2019s amenability\nto rehabilitation.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 363. A convict,\nthe theory went, should generally remain in prison only\nuntil he was able to reenter society safely. His release\ntherefore often coincided with \u201cthe successful completion\nof certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro\ngrams within the prisons.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 40\n(1983) (hereinafter S. Rep.). At that point, parole officials\ncould \u201cdetermin[e] that [the] prisoner had become reha\nbilitated and should be released from confinement.\u201d Stith\n& Cabranes, supra, at 18.3\n   But this model of indeterminate sentencing eventually\nfell into disfavor. One concern was that it produced \u201c[s]eri\nous disparities in [the] sentences\u201d imposed on simi-\nlarly situated defendants. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 365.\nAnother was that the system\u2019s attempt to \u201cachieve reha\nbilitation of offenders had failed.\u201d Id., at 366. Lawmakers\nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs\ncould \u201crehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u201d\u2014or that\nparole officers could \u201cdetermine accurately whether or\nwhen a particular prisoner ha[d] been rehabilitated.\u201d\nS. Rep., at 40.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The statutes governing punishment of drug-addicted offenders (like\n\nTapia) provide an example of this system at work. If a court concluded\nthat such an offender was \u201clikely to be rehabilitated through treat\nment,\u201d it could order confinement \u201cfor treatment . . . for an indetermi\nnate period of time\u201d not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the statutory\nmaximum for the offender\u2019s crime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a74253(a) (1982 ed.); see\nalso \u00a74251(c) (\u201c \u2018Treatment\u2019 includes confinement and treatment in an\ninstitution . . . and includes, but is not limited to, medical, educational,\nsocial, psychological, and vocational services, corrective and preventive\nguidance and training, and other rehabilitative services\u201d). Once the\noffender had undergone treatment for six months, the Attorney General\ncould recommend that the Board of Parole release him from custody,\nand the Board could then order release \u201cin its discretion.\u201d \u00a74254.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform\nAct of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul fed\neral sentencing practices. The Act abandoned indetermi\nnate sentencing and parole in favor of a system in which\nSentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing\nCommission, would provide courts with \u201ca range of deter\nminate sentences for categories of offenses and defen\ndants.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 368. And the Act further\nchanneled judges\u2019 discretion by establishing a framework\nto govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.\n   Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender\nmust impose at least one of the following sanctions: im\nprisonment (often followed by supervised release), proba\ntion, or a fine. See \u00a73551(b). In determining the appro\npriate sentence from among these options, \u00a73553(a)(2)\nrequires the judge to consider specified factors, including:\n    \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n              \u201c(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense,\n              to promote respect for the law, and to pro\n              vide just punishment for the offense;\n              \u201c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to crimi\n              nal conduct;\n              \u201c(C) to protect the public from further\n              crimes of the defendant; and\n              \u201c(D) to provide the defendant with needed\n              educational or vocational training, medical\n              care, or other correctional treatment in the\n              most effective manner.\u201d\nThese four considerations\u2014retribution, deterrence, inca\npacitation, and rehabilitation\u2014are the four purposes of\nsentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence\n\u201cto achieve the[se] purposes . . . to the extent that they are\napplicable\u201d in a given case. \u00a73551(a).\n  The SRA then provides additional guidance about how\nthe considerations listed in \u00a73553(a)(2) pertain to each of\n6                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Act\u2019s main sentencing options\u2014imprisonment, super\nvised release, probation, and fines. See \u00a73582(a); \u00a73583;\n\u00a73562(a); \u00a73572(a). These provisions make clear that a\nparticular purpose may apply differently, or even not at\nall, depending on the kind of sentence under considera\ntion. For example, a court may not take account of retri\nbution (the first purpose listed in \u00a73553(a)(2)) when impos\ning a term of supervised release. See \u00a73583(c).\n   Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the\n\u201cfactors to be considered\u201d when a court orders imprison\nment. That section provides:\n    \u201cThe court, in determining whether to impose a term\n    of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is\n    to be imposed, in determining the length of the term,\n    shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n    to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing\n    that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\n    promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d\nA similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission\nin its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines.\nThe SRA instructs the Commission to:\n    \u201cinsure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriate\n    ness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment\n    for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or pro\n    viding the defendant with needed educational or voca\n    tional training, medical care, or other correctional\n    treatment.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(k).\nWith this statutory background established, we turn to\nthe matter of interpretation.\n                           III\n                            A\n  Our consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim starts with the text of\n18 U.

As just noted,\nthat section instructs courts to \u201crecogniz[e] that impris\nonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc\ntion and rehabilitation.\u201d A common\u2014and in context the\nmost natural\u2014definition of the word \u201crecognize\u201d is \u201cto ac\nknowledge or treat as valid.\u201d Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1611 (2d ed. 1987). And a thing\nthat is not \u201cappropriate\u201d is not \u201csuitable or fitting for a\nparticular purpose.\u201d Id., at 103. Putting these two defini\ntions together, \u00a73582(a) tells courts that they should ac\nknowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the pur\npose of promoting rehabilitation. And when should courts\nacknowledge this? Section \u00a73582(a) answers: when \u201cde\ntermining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and,\nif a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [when] deter\nmining the length of the term.\u201d So a court making these\ndecisions should consider the specified rationales of\npunishment except for rehabilitation, which it should ac\nknowledge as an unsuitable justification for a prison term.\n   As against this understanding, amicus argues that\n\u00a73582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause is not a flat prohibition\nbut only a \u201creminder\u201d or a \u201cguide [for] sentencing judges\u2019\ncognitive processes.\u201d Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus\nCuriae in Support of Judgment Below 23\u201324 (hereinafter\nAmicus Brief) (emphasis deleted). Amicus supports this\nview by offering a string of other definitions of the\nword \u201crecognize\u201d: \u201c \u2018recall to mind,\u2019 \u2018realize,\u2019 or \u2018perceive\nclearly.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 24 (quoting dictionary definitions). Once\nthese are plugged in, amicus suggests, \u00a73582(a) reveals\nitself as a kind of loosey-goosey caution not to put too\nmuch faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.\n   But we do not see how these alternative meanings of\n\u201crecognize\u201d help amicus\u2019s cause. A judge who \u201cperceives\nclearly\u201d that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\npromoting rehabilitation would hardly incarcerate some\none for that purpose. Ditto for a judge who \u201crealizes\u201d or\n8                 TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crecalls\u201d that imprisonment is not a way to rehabilitate an\noffender. To be sure, the drafters of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause could have used still more commanding language:\nCongress could have inserted a \u201cthou shalt not\u201d or equiva\nlent phrase to convey that a sentencing judge may never,\never, under any circumstances consider rehabilitation in\nimposing a prison term. But when we interpret a statute,\nwe cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the merely\nexcellent. Congress expressed itself clearly in \u00a73582(a),\neven if armchair legislators might come up with some\nthing even better. And what Congress said was that when\nsentencing an offender to prison, the court shall consider\nall the purposes of punishment except rehabilitation\u2014\nbecause imprisonment is not an appropriate means of\npursuing that goal.\n   Amicus also claims, echoing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reason\ning in Duran, that \u00a73582(a)\u2019s \u201crecognizing\u201d clause bars\ncourts from considering rehabilitation only when imposing\na prison term, and not when deciding on its length. The\nargument goes as follows. Section 3582(a) refers to two\ndecisions: \u201cThe court, [1] in determining whether to im\npose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprison\nment is to be imposed, [2] in determining the length of the\nterm\u201d must consider the purposes of punishment listed\nin \u00a73553(a)(2), subject to the caveat of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause. But that clause says only that \u201cimprisonment\u201d is\nnot an appropriate means of rehabilitation. Because the\n\u201cprimary meaning of \u2018imprisonment\u2019 is \u2018the act of confining\na person,\u2019 \u201d amicus argues, the clause relates only to\n[1] the decision to incarcerate, and not to [2] the separate\ndetermination of the sentence\u2019s length. Amicus Brief 52.\n   We again disagree. Under standard rules of grammar,\n\u00a73582(a) says: A sentencing judge shall recognize that\nimprisonment is not appropriate to promote rehabilita\ntion when the court considers the applicable factors of\n\u00a73553(a)(2); and a court considers these factors when\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining both whether to imprison an offender and\nwhat length of term to give him.          The use of the\nword \u201cimprisonment\u201d in the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause does not\ndestroy\u2014but instead fits neatly into\u2014this construction.\n\u201cImprisonment\u201d as used in the clause most naturally\nmeans \u201c[t]he state of being confined\u201d or \u201ca period of con\nfinement.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed. 2009); see\nalso Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1137\n(1993) (the \u201cstate of being imprisoned\u201d). So the word does\nnot distinguish between the defendant\u2019s initial placement\nbehind bars and his continued stay there. As the D. C.\nCircuit noted in rejecting an identical argument, \u201c[a]\nsentencing court deciding to keep a defendant locked up\nfor an additional month is, as to that month, in fact choos\ning imprisonment over release.\u201d In re Sealed Case, 573\nF. 3d 844, 850 (2009).4 Accordingly, the word \u201cimprison\nment\u201d does not change the function of the \u201crecognizing\u201d\nclause\u2014to constrain a sentencing court\u2019s decision both to\nimpose and to lengthen a prison term.5\n   The context of \u00a73582(a) puts an exclamation point on\nthis textual conclusion. As noted earlier, supra, at 6,\nanother provision of the SRA restates \u00a73582(a)\u2019s message,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Indeed, we can scarcely imagine a reason why Congress would have\n\nwanted to draw the distinction that amicus urges on us. That distinc\ntion would prevent a court from considering rehabilitative needs in\nimposing a 1-month sentence rather than probation, but not in choosing\na 60-month sentence over a 1-month term. The only policy argument\namicus can offer in favor of this result is that \u201c[t]he effects of impris\nonment plateau a short while after the incarceration\u201d and \u201c \u2018[t]he dif\nference in harm between longer and shorter prison terms is smaller\nthan typically assumed.\u2019 \u201d Amicus Brief 56. But nothing in the SRA\nindicates that Congress is so indifferent to the length of prison terms.\n   5 The Government argues that \u201cCongress did not intend to prohibit\n\ncourts from imposing less imprisonment in order to promote a defen\ndant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d Brief for United States 40 (emphasis added).\nThis case does not require us to address that question, and nothing in\nour decision expresses any views on it.\n10                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut to a different audience. That provision, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(k), directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that\nthe Guidelines \u201creflect the inappropriateness of imposing a\nsentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of\nrehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant\nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical\ncare, or other correctional treatment.\u201d In this way, Con\ngress ensured that all sentencing officials would work\nin tandem to implement the statutory determination to\n\u201crejec[t] imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilita\ntion.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367 (citing 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(k)). Section 994(k) bars the Commission from rec\nommending a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\u2014a phrase that\nagain refers both to the fact and to the length of incarcera\ntion\u2014based on a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs. And\n\u00a73582(a) prohibits a court from considering those needs to\nimpose or lengthen a period of confinement when selecting\na sentence from within, or choosing to depart from, the\nGuidelines range. Each actor at each stage in the sentenc\ning process receives the same message: Do not think about\nprison as a way to rehabilitate an offender.\n   Equally illuminating here is a statutory silence\u2014the\nabsence of any provision granting courts the power to\nensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation\nprograms. For when Congress wanted sentencing courts\nto take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave courts\nthe authority to direct appropriate treatment for offend\ners. Thus, the SRA instructs courts, in deciding whether\nto impose probation or supervised release, to consider\nwhether an offender could benefit from training and treat\nment programs. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73562(a); \u00a73583(c). And\nso the SRA also authorizes courts, when imposing those\nsentences, to order an offender\u2019s participation in cer\ntain programs and facilities. \u00a73563(b)(9); \u00a73563(b)(11);\n\u00a73563(a)(4); \u00a73583(d). As a condition of probation, for\nexample, the court may require the offender to \u201cundergo\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\navailable medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment,\nincluding treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as\nspecified by the court, and [to] remain in a specified insti\ntution if required for that purpose.\u201d \u00a73563(b)(9).\n   If Congress had similarly meant to allow courts to base\nprison terms on offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs, it would\nhave given courts the capacity to ensure that offenders\nparticipate in prison correctional programs. But in fact,\ncourts do not have this authority. When a court sentences\na federal offender, the BOP has plenary control, subject to\nstatutory constraints, over \u201cthe place of the prisoner\u2019s\nimprisonment,\u201d \u00a73621(b), and the treatment programs (if\nany) in which he may participate, \u00a7\u00a73621(e), (f ); \u00a73624(f ).\nSee also 28 CFR pt. 544 (2010) (BOP regulations for ad\nministering inmate educational, recreational, and voca\ntional programs); 28 CFR pt. 550, subpart F (drug abuse\ntreatment programs). A sentencing court can recommend\nthat the BOP place an offender in a particular facility\nor program. See \u00a73582(a). But decisionmaking authority\nrests with the BOP.\n   This case well illustrates the point. As noted earlier,\nthe District Court \u201cstrongly recommend[ed]\u201d that Tapia\nparticipate in RDAP, App. 29, and serve her sentence at\nFCI Dublin, \u201cwhere they have the facilities to really help\nher,\u201d id., at 28. But the court\u2019s recommendations were\nonly recommendations\u2014and in the end they had no effect.\nSee Amicus Brief 42 (\u201c[Tapia] was not admitted to RDAP,\nnor even placed in the prison recommended by the district\ncourt\u201d); Reply Brief for United States 8, n. 1 (\u201cAccording to\nBOP records, [Tapia] was encouraged to enroll [in RDAP]\nduring her psychology intake screening at [the federal\nprison], but she stated that she was not interested, and\nshe has not volunteered for the program\u201d). The sentencing\ncourt may have had plans for Tapia\u2019s rehabilitation, but it\nlacked the power to implement them. That incapacity\nspeaks volumes. It indicates that Congress did not intend\n12                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat courts consider offenders\u2019 rehabilitative needs when\nimposing prison sentences.\n   Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful,\nthe key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one\nlast piece of corroborating evidence. According to that\nReport, decades of experience with indeterminate sentenc\ning, resulting in the release of many inmates after they\ncompleted correctional programs, had left Congress skep\ntical that \u201crehabilitation can be induced reliably in a\nprison setting.\u201d S. Rep., at 38. Although some critics\nargued that \u201crehabilitation should be eliminated com\npletely as a purpose of sentencing,\u201d Congress declined to\nadopt that categorical position. Id., at 76. Instead, the\nReport explains, Congress barred courts from considering\nrehabilitation in imposing prison terms, ibid., and n. 165,\nbut not in ordering other kinds of sentences, ibid., and\nn. 164. \u201c[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,\u201d the Report\nstated, \u201cis still important in determining whether a sanc\ntion other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in a\nparticular case.\u201d See id., at 76\u201377 (emphasis added).\n   And so this is a case in which text, context, and history\npoint to the same bottom line: Section 3582(a) precludes\nsentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison\nterm to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\n                              B\n  With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked\nagainst him, amicus understandably tries to put the SRA\u2019s\nview of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame. Amicus\nbegins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA,\nrejected the old \u201c[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.\u201d Amicus Brief 1.\nBut according to amicus, that model had a very limited\nfocus: It was the belief that \u201cisolation and prison routine\u201d\ncould alone produce \u201cpenitence and spiritual renewal.\u201d\nId., at 1, 11. What the rehabilitation model did not in\nclude\u2014and the SRA therefore did not reject\u2014was prison\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment programs (including for drug addiction) tar\ngeted to offenders\u2019 particular needs. See id., at 21, 25, 27\u2013\n28. So even after the passage of \u00a73582(a), amicus argues,\na court may impose or lengthen a prison sentence to pro\nmote an offender\u2019s participation in a targeted treatment\nprogram. The only thing the court may not do is to impose\na prison term on the ground that confinement itself\u2014its\ninherent solitude and routine\u2014will lead to rehabilitation.\n    We think this reading of the SRA is too narrow. For one\nthing, the relevant history shows that at the time of\nthe SRA\u2019s enactment, prison rehabilitation efforts focused\non treatment, counseling, and training programs, not on\nseclusion and regimentation. See Rotman, The Failure of\nReform: United States, 1865\u20131965, in Oxford History of\nthe Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society\n169, 189\u2013190 (N. Morris & D. Rothman eds. 1995) (de\nscribing the pre-SRA \u201ctherapeutic model of rehabilitation\u201d\nas characterized by \u201cindividualized treatment\u201d and \u201cvoca\ntional training and group counseling programs\u201d); see also\nn. 3, supra (noting pre-SRA statutes linking the confine\nment of drug addicts to the completion of treatment pro\ngrams). Indeed, Congress had in mind precisely these\nprograms when it prohibited consideration of rehabilita\ntion in imposing a prison term. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(k)\n(instructing the Sentencing Commission to prevent the\nuse of imprisonment to \u201cprovid[e] the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training . . . or other\ncorrectional treatment\u201d); S. Rep., at 40 (rejecting the\n\u201cmodel of \u2018coercive\u2019 rehabilitation\u2014the theory of correction\nthat ties prison release dates to the successful completion\nof certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro\ngrams within the prisons\u201d). Far from falling outside the\n\u201crehabilitation model,\u201d these programs practically defined\nit.\n    It is hardly surprising, then, that amicus\u2019s argument\nfinds little support in the statutory text. Read most natu\n14                TAPIA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrally, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(a)\u2019s prohibition on \u201cpromoting\ncorrection and rehabilitation\u201d covers efforts to place of\nfenders in rehabilitation programs. Indeed, \u00a73582(a)\u2019s lan\nguage recalls the SRA\u2019s description of the rehabilitative\npurpose of sentencing\u2014\u201cprovid[ing] the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or\nother correctional treatment.\u201d \u00a73553(a)(2)(D). That de\nscription makes clear that, under the SRA, treatment,\ntraining, and like programs are rehabilitation\u2019s sum and\nsubstance. So amicus\u2019s efforts to exclude rehabilitation\nprograms from the \u201crecognizing\u201d clause\u2019s reach do not\nsucceed. That section prevents a sentencing court from\nimposing or lengthening a prison term because the court\nthinks an offender will benefit from a prison treatment\nprogram.\n                             IV\n   In this case, the sentencing transcript suggests the\npossibility that Tapia\u2019s sentence was based on her reha\nbilitative needs.\n   We note first what we do not disapprove about Tapia\u2019s\nsentencing. A court commits no error by discussing the\nopportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the bene\nfits of specific treatment or training programs. To the\ncontrary, a court properly may address a person who is\nabout to begin a prison term about these important mat\nters. And as noted earlier, a court may urge the BOP to\nplace an offender in a prison treatment program. See\nsupra, at 11. Section 3582(a) itself provides, just after the\nclause at issue here, that a court may \u201cmake a recommen\ndation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate\nfor the defendant\u201d; and in this calculus, the presence of a\nrehabilitation program may make one facility more appro\npriate than another. So the sentencing court here did\nnothing wrong\u2014and probably something very right\u2014in\ntrying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                 15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprogram.\n  But the record indicates that the court may have done\nmore\u2014that it may have selected the length of the sentence\nto ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug\nProgram. \u201cThe sentence has to be sufficient,\u201d the court\nexplained, \u201cto provide needed correctional treatment, and\nhere I think the needed correctional treatment is the\n500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see supra, at 1\u20132. Or\nagain: The \u201cnumber one\u201d thing \u201cis the need to provide\ntreatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get\nthe 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d App. 27; see supra, at 2.\nThese statements suggest that the court may have calcu\nlated the length of Tapia\u2019s sentence to ensure that she\nreceive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentenc\ning court may not do. As we have held, a court may not\nimpose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender\nto complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote\nrehabilitation.\n  For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion. Consistent with our\npractice, see, e.g., United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 8), we leave it to the Court of Ap\npeals to consider the effect of Tapia\u2019s failure to object to\nthe sentence when imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim.

Fourth, he considered the need \u201cto deter\ncriminal conduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further\ncrimes of the defendant,\u201d which he characterized as a \u201cbig\nfactor here, given [Tapia\u2019s] failure to appear and what she\ndid out on bail.\u201d App. 26; see \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(2)(B), (C). Fifth,\nhe took account of the need \u201cto provide needed correctional\ntreatment,\u201d in this case, the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) \u201c500\nHour Drug Program,\u201d more officially called the Residential\nDrug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). App. 27; see\n\u00a73553(a)(2)(D). And, finally, he noted the need \u201cto avoid\nunwarranted sentencing disparities\u201d and the need for the\nsentence \u201cto be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a)\nbut not greater.\u201d App. 27; see \u00a7\u00a73553(a), (a)(6).\n   Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36\nmonths\u2019 incarceration, App. 18, but her Guidelines range\nwas 41 to 51 months, id., at 13. After reviewing the\n\u00a73553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51\nmonths, the top of the Guidelines range. He offered two\nreasons for choosing this sentence: \u201cnumber one,\u201d the need\nfor drug treatment; and \u201c[n]umber two,\u201d deterrence. Id.,\nat 27. With respect to the latter reason, the judge high\nlighted Tapia\u2019s criminal history and her criminal conduct\nwhile released on bail\u2014which, he said, was \u201csomething\nthat motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the\nhigh end of the guideline range.\u201d Id., at 27\u201328. He con\ncluded, \u201cI think that a sentence less than what I am im\nposing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time\nso she could begin to address these problems.\u201d Id., at 28.\n   The District Judge\u2019s comments at sentencing suggest\nthat he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in\nfurther criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51\nmonths\u2019 incarceration. Granted, the judge also mentioned\nthe need to provide drug treatment through the RDAP.\nThe 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to\nhave had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP. See\nBOP Program Statement No. P5330.11, \u00a72.5.1(b) (Mar. 16,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an\ninmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining\non her sentence). Even the 36-month mandatory mini\nmum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the\nRDAP. I thus find it questionable that the judge length\nened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for\ndeterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was\nnecessary for rehabilitation. Cf. S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225,\np. 176 (1983) (\u201cA term imposed for another purpose of\nsentencing may . . . have a rehabilitative focus if rehabil\nitation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose\nof the sentence\u201d).\n   Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District\nJudge imposed or lengthened Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote\nrehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sen\ntencing were not perfectly clear. Given that Ninth Circuit\nprecedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to con\nsider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see\nante, at 2, and that the judge stated that the sentence\nneeded to be \u201clong enough to get the 500 Hour Drug\nProgram,\u201d App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not\nlengthen Tapia\u2019s sentence to promote rehabilitation in\nviolation of \u00a73582(a). I therefore agree with the Court\u2019s\ndisposition of this case and join the Court\u2019s opinion in full.\n</pre>",
