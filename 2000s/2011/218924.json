BAYER CORP.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131205. Argued January 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nRespondent (Bayer) moved in Federal District Court for an injunction\n  ordering a West Virginia state court not to consider a motion for class\n  certification filed by petitioners (Smith), who were plaintiffs in the\n  state-court action. Bayer thought such an injunction warranted be\n  cause, in a separate case, Bayer had persuaded the same Federal\n  District Court to deny a similar class-certification motion that had\n  been filed against Bayer by a different plaintiff, George McCollins.\n  The District Court had denied McCollins\u2019 certification motion under\n  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.\n     The court granted Bayer\u2019s requested injunction against the state\n  court proceedings, holding that its denial of certification in McCollins\u2019\n  case precluded litigation of the certification issue in Smith\u2019s case.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. It first noted\n  that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act) generally prohibits federal courts\n  from enjoining state court proceedings. But it found that the Act\u2019s re\n  litigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules\n  of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his pro\n  posed class. In so doing, the court concluded that Smith was invok\n  ing a State Rule, W. Va. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, that was sufficiently\n  similar to the Federal Rule McCollins had invoked, such that the cer\n  tification issues presented in the two cases were the same. The court\n  further held that Smith, as an unnamed member of McCollins\u2019 puta\n  tive class action, could be bound by the judgment in McCollins\u2019 case.\nHeld: In enjoining the state court from considering Smith\u2019s class certifi\n cation request, the federal court exceeded its authority under the \u201cre\n litigation exception\u201d to the Act. Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) Under that Act, a federal court \u201cmay not grant an injunction to\n stay proceedings in a State court except\u201d in rare cases, when neces\n2                        SMITH v.

S. 281, 286, \u201care\n    narrow and are \u2018not [to] be enlarged by loose statutory construction,\u2019 \u201d\n    Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140, 146. Indeed, \u201c[a]ny\n    doubts as to the propriety of a federal injunction against state court\n    proceedings should be resolved in favor of permitting the state courts\n    to proceed.\u201d Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 398 U. S., at 297. The excep\n    tion at issue in this case, known as the \u201crelitigation exception,\u201d au\n    thorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue\n    \u201cthat previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\u201d\n    Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147. This exception is designed to im\n    plement \u201cwell-recognized concepts\u201d of claim and issue preclusion.\n    Ibid. Because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclu\n    sive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court\u2014here, the West\n    Virginia court\u2014every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state\n    court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction\n    can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure. For the\n    federal court\u2019s class-action determination to preclude the state court\u2019s\n    adjudication of Smith\u2019s motion, at least two conditions must be met.\n    First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one\n    presented in the state tribunal. And second, Smith must have been a\n    party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete ex\n    ceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) The issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one\n    presented in the state tribunal. This case is little more than a rerun\n    of Chick Kam Choo. There, a federal court dismissed a suit involving\n    Singapore law on forum non conveniens grounds and then enjoined\n    the plaintiff from pursuing the \u201csame\u201d claim in Texas state court.\n    However, because the legal standards for forum non conveniens dif\n    fered in the two courts, the issues before those courts differed, mak\n    ing an injunction unwarranted. Here, Smith\u2019s proposed class mir\n    rored McCollins\u2019, and the two suits\u2019 substantive claims broadly\n    overlapped. But the federal court adjudicated McCollins\u2019 certification\n    motion under Federal Rule 23, whereas the state court was poised to\n    consider Smith\u2019s proposed class under W. Va. Rule 23. And the State\n    Supreme Court has generally stated that it will not necessarily inter\n    pret its Rule 23 as coterminous with the Federal Rule. Absent clear\n    evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to State Rule\n    23 tracking the federal court\u2019s analysis in McCollins\u2019 case, this Court\n    could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule the same way\n    and, thus, could not tell whether the certification issues in the two\n    courts were the same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunc\n    tion. And indeed, the case against an injunction here is even\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  stronger, because the State Supreme Court has expressly disap\n  proved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement\n  embraced by the Federal District Court. Pp. 8\u201312.\n     (c) The District Court\u2019s injunction was independently improper be\n  cause Smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered\n  by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion. Generally,\n  a party \u201cis \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\u2019 \u201d United\n  States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, or\n  who \u201cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party\n  practice,\u201d Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77. The definition of \u201cparty\u201d\n  cannot be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom\n  McCollins was denied leave to represent. The only exception to the\n  rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the ex\n  ception that binds non-named members of \u201cproperly conducted class\n  actions\u201d to judgments entered in such proceedings. Taylor v. Stur\n  gell, 553 U. S. 880, 894. But McCollins\u2019 suit was not a proper class\n  action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues should have pre\n  clusive effect is the District Court\u2019s decision not to certify a class.\n  Absent certification of a class under Federal Rule 23, the precondi\n  tion for binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed, nor a re\n  jected, class action may bind nonparties. See id., at 901. Bayer\n  claims that this Court\u2019s approach to class actions would permit class\n  counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing\n  plaintiffs. But principles of stare decisis and comity among courts\n  generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of simi\n  lar litigation brought by different plaintiffs. The right approach does\n  not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment. And to the extent class\n  actions raise special relitigation problems, the federal Class Action\n  Fairness Act of 2005 provides a remedy that does not involve depart\n  ing from the usual preclusion rules.

BAYER \n\n                 CORPORATION\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 16, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.*\n   In this case, a Federal District Court enjoined a state\ncourt from considering a plaintiff\u2019s request to approve a\nclass action. The District Court did so because it had\nearlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case,\nbrought by a different plaintiff against the same defen\ndant alleging similar claims. The federal court thought its\ninjunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue\nit had decided.\n   We hold to the contrary. In issuing this order to a state\ncourt, the federal court exceeded its authority under the\n\u201crelitigation exception\u201d to the Anti-Injunction Act. That\nstatutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a\nstate proceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to \u201cpro\ntect or effectuate [the federal court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72283. Here, that standard was not met for two\nreasons. First, the issue presented in the state court was\nnot identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal.\nAnd second, the plaintiff in the state court did not have\nthe requisite connection to the federal suit to be bound by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins Parts I and II\u2013A of this opinion.\n2                  SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s judgment.\n                              I\n  Because the question before us involves the effect of a\nformer adjudication on this case, we begin our statement\nof the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another. In\nAugust 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer\nCorporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West\nVirginia, asserting various state-law claims arising from\nBayer\u2019s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug\ncalled Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that\nsame month). McCollins contended that Bayer had vio\nlated West Virginia\u2019s consumer-protection statute and the\ncompany\u2019s express and implied warranties by selling him\na defective product. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state\ncourt to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had\nalso purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a\nclass action.\n  Approximately one month later, the suit now before us\nbegan in a different part of West Virginia. Petitioners\nKeith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed\nstate-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in\nMcCollins\u2019 suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County,\nWest Virginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court\nto certify under West Virginia\u2019s Rule 23 a class of Baycol\npurchasers residing in the State. Neither Smith nor\nMcCollins knew about the other\u2019s suit.\n  In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins\u2019 case to the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nWest Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332, 1441. The case was then transferred to\nthe District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order\nof the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which\nhad consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (num\nbering in the tens of thousands) before a single District\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt Judge. See \u00a71407. Bayer, however, could not\nremove Smith\u2019s case to federal court because Smith\nhad sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to\nBayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity. See\n\u00a71441(b).1 Smith\u2019s suit thus remained in the state court\nhouse in Brooke County.\n   Over the next six years, the two cases proceeded along\ntheir separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace. By\n2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their respec\ntive plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification. The Federal\nDistrict Court was the first to reach a decision.\n   Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,2 the Dis\ntrict Court declined to certify McCollins\u2019 proposed class\nof West Virginia Baycol purchasers. The District Court\u2019s\nreasoning proceeded in two steps. The court first ruled\nthat, under West Virginia law, each plaintiff would have\nto prove \u201cactual injury\u201d from his use of Baycol to recover.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court then held that be\ncause the necessary showing of harm would vary from\nplaintiff to plaintiff, \u201cindividual issues of fact predomi\nnate[d]\u201d over issues common to all members of the pro\nposed class, and so the case was not suitable for class\ntreatment. Id., at 45a. In the same order, the District\nCourt also dismissed McCollins\u2019 claims on the merits in\nlight of his failure to demonstrate physical injury from his\nuse of Baycol. McCollins chose not to appeal.\n   Although McCollins\u2019 suit was now concluded, Bayer\nasked the District Court for another order based upon it,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 119 Stat. 4, which postdates\nand therefore does not govern this lawsuit, now enables a defendant to\nremove to federal court certain class actions involving nondiverse\nparties. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453(b); see also infra, at 17.\n  2 Although McCollins had originally sought certification under West\n\nVirginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), federal procedural rules\ngovern a case that has been removed to federal court. See Shady Grove\nOrthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n4                        SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthis one affecting Smith\u2019s case in West Virginia. In a\nmotion\u2014receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCol\nlins\u2019 suit\u2014Bayer explained that the proposed class in\nSmith\u2019s case was identical to the one the federal court had\njust rejected. Bayer therefore requested that the federal\ncourt enjoin the West Virginia state court from hearing\nSmith\u2019s motion to certify a class. According to Bayer, that\norder was appropriate to protect the District Court\u2019s\njudgment in McCollins\u2019 suit denying class certification.\nThe District Court agreed and granted the injunction.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nIn re Baycol Prods. Litigation, 593 F. 3d 716 (2010). The\ncourt noted that the Anti-Injunction Act generally prohib\nits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.\nBut the court held that the Act\u2019s relitigation exception\nauthorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of\nissue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of\nhis proposed class. According to the court, Smith was\ninvoking a similar class action rule as McCollins had used\nto seek certification \u201cof the same class\u201d in a suit alleging\n\u201cthe same legal theories,\u201d id., at 724; the issue in the state\ncourt therefore was \u201csufficiently identical\u201d to the one the\nfederal court had decided to warrant preclusion, ibid. In\naddition, the court held, the parties in the two proceedings\nwere sufficiently alike: Because Smith was an unnamed\nmember of the class McCollins had proposed, and because\ntheir \u201cinterests were aligned,\u201d Smith was appropriately\nbound by the federal court\u2019s judgment. Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. __ (2010), because the\norder issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from\napplication of the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s relitigation excep\ntion. The first involves the requirement of preclusion law\nthat a subsequent suit raise the \u201csame issue\u201d as a previous\ncase.3 The second concerns the scope of the rule that a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Compare   In re Baycol Prods.

After all, a court\ndoes not usually \u201cget to dictate to other courts the preclu\nsion consequences of its own judgment.\u201d 18 C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\nDeciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive\neffect is usually the bailiwick of the second court (here, the\none in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction under the\nrelitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.5 For\nthat reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the\nstate court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297;\nan injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 That is especially so because an injunction is not the only way to\n\ncorrect a state trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to give preclusive effect to\na federal judgment. As we have noted before, \u201cthe state appellate\ncourts and ultimately this Court\u201d can review and reverse such a ruling.\nSee Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281,\n287 (1970).\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

For\nthe federal court\u2019s determination of the class issue to have\nthis preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.6\nFirst, the issue the federal court decided must be the same\nas the one presented in the state tribunal. See 18 Wright\n& Miller \u00a74417, at 412. And second, Smith must have\nbeen a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within\none of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against\nbinding nonparties. See 18A id., \u00a74449, at 330. In fact,\nas we will explain, the issues before the two courts were\nnot the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the ex\nceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound. So the\ncourts below erred in finding the certification issue pre\ncluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction\nappropriate.7\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect\n\nof a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity. See Semtek Int\u2019l Inc.\nv. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 508 (2001). Smith assumes\nthat federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia\u2019s\npreclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15\u201316, whereas Bayer favors\nlooking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal inter\nests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think\nthe question matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which\nfederal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant\nrespect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare, e.g.,\nMontana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153\u2013154 (1979) (describing\nelements of issue preclusion), with State v. Miller, 194 W. Va. 3, 9, 459\nS. E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same). We therefore need not decide whether,\nin general, federal common law ought to incorporate state law in\nsituations such as this.\n   7 Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith\u2019s\nargument, based on Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797\n(1985), that the District Court\u2019s action violated the Due Process Clause.\n8                  SMITH v. BAYER CORP. \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             A\n\n  In our most recent case on the relitigation exception,\nChick Kam Choo v. Exxon, we applied the \u201csame issue\u201d\nrequirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal\ncourt\u2019s injunction. 486 U. S., at 151. The federal court\nhad dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on grounds\nof forum non conveniens. After the plaintiff brought the\nsame claim in Texas state court, the federal court issued\nan injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in\nthat alternate forum. We held that the District Court had\ngone too far. \u201c[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the\nrelitigation exception,\u201d we explained, \u201cis that the . . . is\nsues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation\nin state proceedings actually have been decided by the\nfederal court.\u201d Id., at 148. That prerequisite, we thought,\nwas not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in\nstate court was not the one the federal court had resolved.\nThe federal court had considered the permissibility of the\nclaim under federal forum non conveniens principles. But\nthe Texas courts, we thought, \u201cwould apply a significantly\ndifferent forum non conveniens analysis,\u201d id., at 149; they\nhad in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal\ndoctrine. Our conclusion followed: \u201c[W]hether the Texas\nstate courts are an appropriate forum for [the plaintiff\u2019s]\nSingapore law claims has not yet been litigated.\u201d Ibid.\nBecause the legal standards in the two courts differed, the\nissues before the courts differed, and an injunction was\nunwarranted.\n  The question here closely resembles the one in Chick\nKam Choo. The class Smith proposed in state court mir\nrored the class McCollins sought to certify in federal court:\nBoth included all Baycol purchasers resident in West\nVirginia. Moreover, the substantive claims in the two\nsuits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that\nBayer had sold a defective product in violation of the\nState\u2019s consumer protection law and the company\u2019s war\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nranties. So far, so good for preclusion. But not so fast:\na critical question\u2014the question of the applicable legal\nstandard\u2014remains. The District Court ruled that the\nproposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal\nRule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate\nover common ones). But the state court was poised to\nconsider whether the proposed class satisfied West Vir\nginia Rule 23. If those two legal standards differ (as\nfederal and state forum non conveniens law differed in\nChick Kam Choo)\u2014then the federal court resolved an\nissue not before the state court. In that event, much like\nin Chick Kam Choo, \u201cwhether the [West Virginia] state\ncour[t]\u201d should certify the proposed class action \u201chas not\nyet been litigated.\u201d 486 U. S., at 149.\n   The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two competing\nways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal\nRules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in\nthe middle. The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively\non the near-identity of the two Rules\u2019 texts. See 593 F. 3d,\nat 723. That was the right place to start, but not to end.\nFederal and state courts, after all, can and do apply iden\ntically worded procedural provisions in widely varying\nways. If a State\u2019s procedural provision tracks the lan\nguage of a Federal Rule, but a state court interprets that\nprovision in a manner federal courts have not, then the\nstate court is using a different standard and thus deciding\na different issue. See 18 Wright & Miller \u00a74417, at 454\n(stating that preclusion is \u201cinappropriate\u201d when \u201cdifferent\nlegal standards . . . masquerad[e] behind similar legal\nlabels\u201d). At the other extreme, Smith contends that the\nsource of law is all that matters: a different sovereign\nmust in each and every case \u201chave the opportunity, if it\nchooses, to construe its procedural rule differently.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI, Principles of the Law,\nAggregate Litigation \u00a72.11, Reporters\u2019 Notes, cmt. b,\np. 181 (2010)). But if state courts have made crystal clear\n10                 SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat they follow the same approach as the federal court\napplied, we see no need to ignore that determination; in\nthat event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the\nsame. So a federal court considering whether the relitiga\ntion exception applies should examine whether state law\nparallels its federal counterpart. But as suggested earlier,\nsee supra, at 6, the federal court must resolve any uncer\ntainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion\nto the state courts.\n   Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme Court\nhas gone some way toward resolving the matter before us\nby declaring its independence from federal courts\u2019 inter\npretation of the Federal Rules\u2014and particularly of Rule\n23. In In re W. Va. Rezulin Litigation, 214 W. Va. 52, 585\nS. E. 2d 52 (2003) (In re Rezulin), the West Virginia high\ncourt considered a plaintiff\u2019s motion to certify a class\u2014\ncoincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defec\ntive pharmaceutical product. The court made a point of\ncomplaining about the parties\u2019 and lower court\u2019s near\nexclusive reliance on federal cases about Federal Rule 23\nto decide the certification question. Such cases, the court\ncautioned, \u201c \u2018may be persuasive, but [they are] not binding\nor controlling.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 61, 585 S. E. 2d, at 61. And lest\nanyone mistake the import of this message, the court went\non: The aim of \u201cthis rule is to avoid having our legal\nanalysis of our Rules \u2018amount to nothing more than Pav\nlovian responses to federal decisional law.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (italics\nomitted). Of course, the state courts might still have\nadopted an approach to their Rule 23 that tracked the\nanalysis the federal court used in McCollins\u2019 case. But\nabsent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we\ncould not conclude that they would interpret their Rule in\nthe same way. And if that is so, we could not tell whether\nthe certification issues in the state and federal courts were\nthe same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.\n   But here the case against an injunction is even stronger,\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause the West Virginia Supreme Court has disap\nproved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance\nrequirement that the Federal District Court embraced.\nRecall that the federal court held that the presence of\na single individualized issue\u2014injury from the use of\nBaycol\u2014prevented class certification. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt did not identify the common issues in the case; nor\ndid it balance these common issues against the need to\nprove individual injury to determine which predominated.\nThe court instead applied a strict test barring class treat\nment when proof of each plaintiff\u2019s injury is necessary.8\nBy contrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court in In\nre Rezulin adopted an all-things-considered, balancing\ninquiry in interpreting its Rule 23. Rejecting any \u201crigid\ntest,\u201d the state court opined that the predominance re\nquirement \u201ccontemplates a review of many factors.\u201d 214\nW. Va., at 72, 585 S. E. 2d, at 72. Indeed, the court noted,\na \u201c \u2018single common issue\u2019 \u201d in a case could outweigh \u201c \u2018nu\nmerous . . . individual questions.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. That meant, the\ncourt further explained (quoting what it termed the \u201clead\ning treatise\u201d on the subject), that even objections to certifi\ncation \u201c \u2018based on . . . causation, or reliance\u2019 \u201d\u2014which typi\ncally involve showings of individual injury\u2014\u201c \u2018will not bar\npredominance satisfaction.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 2 A. Conte &\nH. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a74.26, p. 241 (4th\ned. 2002)). So point for point, the analysis set out in In re\nRezulin diverged from the District Court\u2019s interpretation\nof Federal Rule 23. A state court using the In re Rezulin\nstandard would decide a different question than the one\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The District Court\u2019s approach to the predominance inquiry is consis\n\ntent with the approach employed by the Eighth Circuit. See In re St.\nJude Medical, Inc., 522 F. 3d 836, 837\u2013840 (2008) (holding that most\ncommercial misrepresentation cases are \u201cunsuitable for class treat\nment\u201d because individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate).\nWe express no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.\n12                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe federal court had earlier resolved.9\n   This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of Chick\nKam Choo. A federal court and a state court apply differ\nent law. That means they decide distinct questions. The\nfederal court\u2019s resolution of one issue does not preclude the\nstate court\u2019s determination of another. It then goes with\nout saying that the federal court may not issue an injunc\ntion. The Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s re-litigation exception does\nnot extend nearly so far.\n                             B\n   The injunction issued here runs into another basic\npremise of preclusion law: A court\u2019s judgment binds only\nthe parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete and\nlimited exceptions. See, e.g., 18A Wright & Miller \u00a74449,\nat 330. The importance of this rule and the narrowness of\nits exceptions go hand in hand. We have repeatedly \u201cem\nphasize[d] the fundamental nature of the general rule\u201d\nthat only parties can be bound by prior judgments; accord\ningly, we have taken a \u201cconstrained approach to nonparty\npreclusion.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 898 (2008).\nAgainst this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below\nby arguing that Smith\u2014an unnamed member of a pro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Bayer argues that In re Rezulin does not preclude an injunction in\n\nthis case because the West Virginia court there decided that common\nissues predominated over individual issues of damages, not over indi\nvidual issues of liability (as exist here). See Brief for Respondent 25\u2013\n26. We think Bayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its\nconsequence. Our point is not that In re Rezulin dictates the answer\nto the class certification question here; the two cases are indeed too\ndissimilar for that to be true. The point instead is that In re Rezulin\narticulated a general approach to the predominance requirement that\ndiffers markedly from the one the federal court used. Minor variations\nin the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not\ndefeat preclusion; but where, as here, the State\u2019s courts \u201cwould apply a\nsignificantly different . . . analysis,\u201d Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp.,\n486 U. S. 140, 149 (1988), the federal and state courts decide different\nissues.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nposed but uncertified class\u2014qualifies as a party to the\nMcCollins litigation. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201334.\nAlternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court\u2019s\njudgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to\nthe rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class\nactions. See id., at 34\u201339. We think neither contention\nhas merit.\n   Bayer\u2019s first claim ill-comports with any proper under\nstanding of what a \u201cparty\u201d is. In general, \u201c[a] \u2018party\u2019 to\nlitigation is \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is\nbrought,\u2019 \u201d United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New\nYork, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4), or one who\n\u201cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third\nparty practice,\u201d Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987).\nAnd we have further held that an unnamed member of a\ncertified class may be \u201cconsidered a \u2018party\u2019 for the [particu\nlar] purpos[e] of appealing\u201d an adverse judgment. Devlin\nv. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1, 7 (2002). But as the dissent in\nDevlin noted, no one in that case was \u201cwilling to advance\nthe novel and surely erroneous argument that a non\nnamed class member is a party to the class-action litiga\ntion before the class is certified.\u201d Id., at 16, n. 1 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.). Still less does that argument make sense once\ncertification is denied. The definition of the term \u201cparty\u201d\ncan on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person\nlike Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied\nleave to represent.10 If the judgment in the McCollins\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two\n\ncases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class\nmay wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an\nindividual claim or move to intervene in the suit. See Brief for Respon\ndent 32\u201333 (citing United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385\n(1977); American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974)). But\nthese cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial\nadministration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class\nsuit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations\nperiod) related to that proceeding. See id., at 553; McDonald, 432\n14                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigation can indeed bind Smith, it must do so under\nprinciples of nonparty preclusion.\n   As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37, one such\nprinciple allows unnamed members of a class action to be\nbound, even though they are not parties to the suit. See\nCooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U. S.\n867, 874 (1984) (\u201c[U]nder elementary principles of prior\nadjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class\naction is binding on class members in any subsequent\nlitigation\u201d); see also Taylor, 553 U. S., at 894 (stating that\nnonparties can be bound in \u201cproperly conducted class\nactions\u201d). But here Bayer faces a conundrum. If we know\none thing about the McCollins suit, we know that it was\nnot a class action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer\nargues ought to be given preclusive effect is the District\nCourt\u2019s decision that a class could not properly be certi\nfied. So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class\naction (because it is only as such that a nonparty in\nSmith\u2019s situation can be bound) to a determination that\nthere could not be a class action. And if the logic of that\nposition is not immediately transparent, here is Bayer\u2019s\nattempt to clarify: \u201c[U]ntil the moment when class certi\nfication was denied, the McCollins case was a properly\nconducted class action.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37. That is\ntrue, according to Bayer, because McCollins\u2019 interests\nwere aligned with the members of the class he proposed\nand he \u201cact[ed] in a representative capacity when he\nsought class certification.\u201d Id., at 36.\n   But wishing does not make it so. McCollins sought class\ncertification, but he failed to obtain that result. Because\nthe District Court found that individual issues predomi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nU. S., at 394, n. 15. That result is consistent with a commonplace of\npreclusion law\u2014that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even\nthough they cannot be bound by, former litigation. See Parklane Ho\nsiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 326\u2013333 (1979); Blonder-Tongue\nLaboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313 (1971).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule\n23\u2019s requirements for class proceedings. In these circum\nstances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class\naction existed at any time in the litigation. Federal Rule\n23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal\ncourt, where McCollins brought his suit. So in the absence\nof a certification under that Rule, the precondition for\nbinding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed class\naction nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties.\nWhat does have this effect is a class action approved under\nRule 23. But McCollins\u2019 lawsuit was never that.\n   We made essentially these same points in Taylor v.\nSturgell just a few Terms ago. The question there con\ncerned the propriety of binding nonparties under a theory\nof \u201cvirtual representation\u201d based on \u201cidentity of interests\nand some kind of relationship between parties and non\nparties.\u201d 553 U. S., at 901. We rejected the theory\nunanimously, explaining that it \u201cwould \u2018recogniz[e], in\neffect, a common-law kind of class action.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Such a\ndevice, we objected, would authorize preclusion \u201cshorn of\n[Rule 23\u2019s] procedural protections.\u201d Ibid. Or as otherwise\nstated in the opinion: We could not allow \u201ccircumvent[ion]\u201d\nof Rule 23\u2019s protections through a \u201cvirtual representation\ndoctrine that allowed courts to \u2018create de facto class ac\ntions at will.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We could hardly have been more\nclear that a \u201cproperly conducted class action,\u201d with bind\ning effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts\nin just one way\u2014through the procedure set out in Rule 23.\nBayer attempts to distinguish Taylor by noting that the\nparty in the prior litigation there did not propose a class\naction. But we do not see why that difference matters.\nYes, McCollins wished to represent a class, and made a\nmotion to that effect. But it did not come to pass. To\nallow McCollins\u2019 suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt\n16                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe very theory Taylor rejected.11\n  Bayer\u2019s strongest argument comes not from established\nprinciples of preclusion, but instead from policy concerns\nrelating to use of the class action device. Bayer warns\nthat under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try\nto certify the same class \u201cby the simple expedient of\nchanging the named plaintiff in the caption of the com\nplaint.\u201d Brief for Respondent 47\u201348. And in this world of\n\u201cserial relitigation of class certification,\u201d Bayer contends,\ndefendants \u201cwould be forced in effect to buy litigation\npeace by settling.\u201d Id., at 2, 12; see also In re Bridge\nstone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation,\n333 F. 3d 763, 767 (CA7 2003) (objecting to an \u201can asym\nmetric system in which class counsel can win but never\nlose\u201d because of their ability to relitigate the issue of\ncertification).\n  But this form of argument flies in the face of the rule\nagainst nonparty preclusion. That rule perforce leads to\nrelitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after\nplaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because\nnone a party to the last suit) tries his hand at establishing\nsome legal principle or obtaining some grant of relief. We\nconfronted a similar policy concern in Taylor, which in\nvolved litigation brought under the Freedom of Infor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The great weight of scholarly authority\u2014from the Restatement of\n\nJudgments to the American Law Institute to Wright and Miller\u2014\nagrees that an uncertified class action cannot bind proposed class\nmembers.

The Government there cautioned\nthat unless we bound nonparties a \u201c \u2018potentially limitless\u2019 \u201d\nnumber of plaintiffs, perhaps coordinating with each\nother, could \u201cmount a series of repetitive lawsuits\u201d de\nmanding the selfsame documents. 553 U.

But\nwe rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a\nsingle successful FOIA suit\u2014disclosure of documents to\nthe public\u2014could \u201ctrum[p]\u201d or \u201csubsum[e]\u201d all prior losses,\njust as a single successful class certification motion could\ndo. In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 333 F. 3d, at 766, 767. As\nthat response suggests, our legal system generally relies\non principles of stare decisis and comity among courts to\nmitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litiga\ntion brought by different plaintiffs. We have not thought\nthat the right approach (except in the discrete categories\nof cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a\njudgment.\n   And to the extent class actions raise special problems of\nrelitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not\ninvolve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In\nthe Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled\ndefendants to remove to federal court any sizable class\naction involving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once\nremoval takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification.\nAnd federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping\nsuits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judi\ncial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many\nactions involving Baycol). See \u00a71407. Finally, we would\nexpect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each\nother\u2019s class certification decisions when addressing a\ncommon dispute. See, e.g., Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill\nHarbert Constr. Co., 529 U. S. 193, 198 (2000) (citing\nLandis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936)).\nCAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to suits\nlike this one beginning before its enactment. But Con\n18                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019s decision to address the relitigation concerns associ\nated with class actions through the mechanism of removal\nprovides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere\nin this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.12\nAnd once again, that is especially so when the federal\ncourt is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state\nproceeding.\n                       *     *    *\n   The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District\nCourt entered here. The Act\u2019s relitigation exception au\nthorizes injunctions only when a former federal adjudica\ntion clearly precludes a state-court decision. As we said\nmore than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained\nsince that time, \u201c[a]ny doubts . . . should be resolved in\nfavor of permitting the state courts to proceed.\u201d Atlantic\nCoast Line, 398 U. S., at 297. Under this approach, close\ncases have easy answers: The federal court should not\nissue an injunction, and the state court should decide the\npreclusion question. But this case does not even strike us\nas close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits\ndiffered because the relevant legal standards differed.\nAnd the mere proposal of a class in the federal action\ncould not bind persons who were not parties there. For\nthese reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n                                                              Reversed.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 By the same token, nothing in our holding today forecloses legisla\n\ntion to modify established principles of preclusion should Congress\ndecide that CAFA does not sufficiently prevent relitigation of class\ncertification motions. Nor does this opinion at all address the permis\nsibility of a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to\nthis question.

BAYER CORP.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u20131205. Argued January 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nRespondent (Bayer) moved in Federal District Court for an injunction\n  ordering a West Virginia state court not to consider a motion for class\n  certification filed by petitioners (Smith), who were plaintiffs in the\n  state-court action. Bayer thought such an injunction warranted be\n  cause, in a separate case, Bayer had persuaded the same Federal\n  District Court to deny a similar class-certification motion that had\n  been filed against Bayer by a different plaintiff, George McCollins.\n  The District Court had denied McCollins\u2019 certification motion under\n  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.\n     The court granted Bayer\u2019s requested injunction against the state\n  court proceedings, holding that its denial of certification in McCollins\u2019\n  case precluded litigation of the certification issue in Smith\u2019s case.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. It first noted\n  that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act) generally prohibits federal courts\n  from enjoining state court proceedings. But it found that the Act\u2019s re\n  litigation exception authorized this injunction because ordinary rules\n  of issue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of his pro\n  posed class. In so doing, the court concluded that Smith was invok\n  ing a State Rule, W. Va. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, that was sufficiently\n  similar to the Federal Rule McCollins had invoked, such that the cer\n  tification issues presented in the two cases were the same. The court\n  further held that Smith, as an unnamed member of McCollins\u2019 puta\n  tive class action, could be bound by the judgment in McCollins\u2019 case.\nHeld: In enjoining the state court from considering Smith\u2019s class certifi\n cation request, the federal court exceeded its authority under the \u201cre\n litigation exception\u201d to the Act.

Co., 398 U. S., at 297. The excep\n    tion at issue in this case, known as the \u201crelitigation exception,\u201d au\n    thorizes an injunction to prevent state litigation of a claim or issue\n    \u201cthat previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.\u201d\n    Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147. This exception is designed to im\n    plement \u201cwell-recognized concepts\u201d of claim and issue preclusion.\n    Ibid. Because deciding whether and how prior litigation has preclu\n    sive effect is usually the bailiwick of the second court\u2014here, the West\n    Virginia court\u2014every benefit of the doubt goes toward the state\n    court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297; an injunction\n    can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond peradventure. For the\n    federal court\u2019s class-action determination to preclude the state court\u2019s\n    adjudication of Smith\u2019s motion, at least two conditions must be met.\n    First, the issue the federal court decided must be the same as the one\n    presented in the state tribunal. And second, Smith must have been a\n    party to the federal suit or must fall within one of a few discrete ex\n    ceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) The issue the federal court decided was not the same as the one\n    presented in the state tribunal. This case is little more than a rerun\n    of Chick Kam Choo. There, a federal court dismissed a suit involving\n    Singapore law on forum non conveniens grounds and then enjoined\n    the plaintiff from pursuing the \u201csame\u201d claim in Texas state court.\n    However, because the legal standards for forum non conveniens dif\n    fered in the two courts, the issues before those courts differed, mak\n    ing an injunction unwarranted. Here, Smith\u2019s proposed class mir\n    rored McCollins\u2019, and the two suits\u2019 substantive claims broadly\n    overlapped. But the federal court adjudicated McCollins\u2019 certification\n    motion under Federal Rule 23, whereas the state court was poised to\n    consider Smith\u2019s proposed class under W. Va. Rule 23. And the State\n    Supreme Court has generally stated that it will not necessarily inter\n    pret its Rule 23 as coterminous with the Federal Rule. Absent clear\n    evidence that the state courts had adopted an approach to State Rule\n    23 tracking the federal court\u2019s analysis in McCollins\u2019 case, this Court\n    could not conclude that they would interpret their Rule the same way\n    and, thus, could not tell whether the certification issues in the two\n    courts were the same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunc\n    tion. And indeed, the case against an injunction here is even\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  stronger, because the State Supreme Court has expressly disap\n  proved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement\n  embraced by the Federal District Court. Pp. 8\u201312.\n     (c) The District Court\u2019s injunction was independently improper be\n  cause Smith was not a party to the federal suit and was not covered\n  by any exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion. Generally,\n  a party \u201cis \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought,\u2019 \u201d United\n  States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, or\n  who \u201cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third-party\n  practice,\u201d Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77. The definition of \u201cparty\u201d\n  cannot be stretched so far as to cover a person like Smith, whom\n  McCollins was denied leave to represent. The only exception to the\n  rule against nonparty preclusion potentially relevant here is the ex\n  ception that binds non-named members of \u201cproperly conducted class\n  actions\u201d to judgments entered in such proceedings. Taylor v. Stur\n  gell, 553 U. S. 880, 894. But McCollins\u2019 suit was not a proper class\n  action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer argues should have pre\n  clusive effect is the District Court\u2019s decision not to certify a class.\n  Absent certification of a class under Federal Rule 23, the precondi\n  tion for binding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed, nor a re\n  jected, class action may bind nonparties. See id., at 901. Bayer\n  claims that this Court\u2019s approach to class actions would permit class\n  counsel to try repeatedly to certify the same class simply by changing\n  plaintiffs. But principles of stare decisis and comity among courts\n  generally suffice to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of simi\n  lar litigation brought by different plaintiffs. The right approach does\n  not lie in binding nonparties to a judgment. And to the extent class\n  actions raise special relitigation problems, the federal Class Action\n  Fairness Act of 2005 provides a remedy that does not involve depart\n  ing from the usual preclusion rules.

The District Court did so because it had\nearlier denied a motion to certify a class in a related case,\nbrought by a different plaintiff against the same defen\ndant alleging similar claims. The federal court thought its\ninjunction appropriate to prevent relitigation of the issue\nit had decided.\n   We hold to the contrary. In issuing this order to a state\ncourt, the federal court exceeded its authority under the\n\u201crelitigation exception\u201d to the Anti-Injunction Act. That\nstatutory provision permits a federal court to enjoin a\nstate proceeding only in rare cases, when necessary to \u201cpro\ntect or effectuate [the federal court\u2019s] judgments.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72283. Here, that standard was not met for two\nreasons. First, the issue presented in the state court was\nnot identical to the one decided in the federal tribunal.\nAnd second, the plaintiff in the state court did not have\nthe requisite connection to the federal suit to be bound by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins Parts I and II\u2013A of this opinion.\n2                  SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s judgment.\n                              I\n  Because the question before us involves the effect of a\nformer adjudication on this case, we begin our statement\nof the facts not with this lawsuit, but with another. In\nAugust 2001, George McCollins sued respondent Bayer\nCorporation in the Circuit Court of Cabell County, West\nVirginia, asserting various state-law claims arising from\nBayer\u2019s sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug\ncalled Baycol (which Bayer withdrew from the market that\nsame month). McCollins contended that Bayer had vio\nlated West Virginia\u2019s consumer-protection statute and the\ncompany\u2019s express and implied warranties by selling him\na defective product. And pursuant to West Virginia Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23 (2011), McCollins asked the state\ncourt to certify a class of West Virginia residents who had\nalso purchased Baycol, so that the case could proceed as a\nclass action.\n  Approximately one month later, the suit now before us\nbegan in a different part of West Virginia. Petitioners\nKeith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza (Smith for short) filed\nstate-law claims against Bayer, similar to those raised in\nMcCollins\u2019 suit, in the Circuit Court of Brooke County,\nWest Virginia. And like McCollins, Smith asked the court\nto certify under West Virginia\u2019s Rule 23 a class of Baycol\npurchasers residing in the State. Neither Smith nor\nMcCollins knew about the other\u2019s suit.\n  In January 2002, Bayer removed McCollins\u2019 case to the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nWest Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332, 1441. The case was then transferred to\nthe District of Minnesota pursuant to a preexisting order\nof the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which\nhad consolidated all federal suits involving Baycol (num\nbering in the tens of thousands) before a single District\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Bayer, however, could not\nremove Smith\u2019s case to federal court because Smith\nhad sued several West Virginia defendants in addition to\nBayer, and so the suit lacked complete diversity. See\n\u00a71441(b).1 Smith\u2019s suit thus remained in the state court\nhouse in Brooke County.\n   Over the next six years, the two cases proceeded along\ntheir separate pretrial paths at roughly the same pace. By\n2008, both courts were preparing to turn to their respec\ntive plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification. The Federal\nDistrict Court was the first to reach a decision.\n   Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,2 the Dis\ntrict Court declined to certify McCollins\u2019 proposed class\nof West Virginia Baycol purchasers. The District Court\u2019s\nreasoning proceeded in two steps. The court first ruled\nthat, under West Virginia law, each plaintiff would have\nto prove \u201cactual injury\u201d from his use of Baycol to recover.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court then held that be\ncause the necessary showing of harm would vary from\nplaintiff to plaintiff, \u201cindividual issues of fact predomi\nnate[d]\u201d over issues common to all members of the pro\nposed class, and so the case was not suitable for class\ntreatment. Id., at 45a. In the same order, the District\nCourt also dismissed McCollins\u2019 claims on the merits in\nlight of his failure to demonstrate physical injury from his\nuse of Baycol. McCollins chose not to appeal.\n   Although McCollins\u2019 suit was now concluded, Bayer\nasked the District Court for another order based upon it,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 119 Stat. 4, which postdates\nand therefore does not govern this lawsuit, now enables a defendant to\nremove to federal court certain class actions involving nondiverse\nparties. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453(b); see also infra, at 17.\n  2 Although McCollins had originally sought certification under West\n\nVirginia Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (2011), federal procedural rules\ngovern a case that has been removed to federal court. See Shady Grove\nOrthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n4                        SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthis one affecting Smith\u2019s case in West Virginia. In a\nmotion\u2014receipt of which first apprised Smith of McCol\nlins\u2019 suit\u2014Bayer explained that the proposed class in\nSmith\u2019s case was identical to the one the federal court had\njust rejected. Bayer therefore requested that the federal\ncourt enjoin the West Virginia state court from hearing\nSmith\u2019s motion to certify a class. According to Bayer, that\norder was appropriate to protect the District Court\u2019s\njudgment in McCollins\u2019 suit denying class certification.\nThe District Court agreed and granted the injunction.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nIn re Baycol Prods. Litigation, 593 F. 3d 716 (2010). The\ncourt noted that the Anti-Injunction Act generally prohib\nits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.\nBut the court held that the Act\u2019s relitigation exception\nauthorized the injunction here because ordinary rules of\nissue preclusion barred Smith from seeking certification of\nhis proposed class. According to the court, Smith was\ninvoking a similar class action rule as McCollins had used\nto seek certification \u201cof the same class\u201d in a suit alleging\n\u201cthe same legal theories,\u201d id., at 724; the issue in the state\ncourt therefore was \u201csufficiently identical\u201d to the one the\nfederal court had decided to warrant preclusion, ibid. In\naddition, the court held, the parties in the two proceedings\nwere sufficiently alike: Because Smith was an unnamed\nmember of the class McCollins had proposed, and because\ntheir \u201cinterests were aligned,\u201d Smith was appropriately\nbound by the federal court\u2019s judgment. Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 561 U. S. __ (2010), because the\norder issued here implicates two circuit splits arising from\napplication of the Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s relitigation excep\ntion.

That exception is de\nsigned to implement \u201cwell-recognized concepts\u201d of claim\nand issue preclusion. Chick Kam Choo, 486 U. S., at 147.\nThe provision authorizes an injunction to prevent state\nlitigation of a claim or issue \u201cthat previously was pre\nsented to and decided by the federal court.\u201d Ibid. But in\napplying this exception, we have taken special care to\nkeep it \u201cstrict and narrow.\u201d Id., at 148.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a74405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).\nDeciding whether and how prior litigation has preclusive\neffect is usually the bailiwick of the second court (here, the\none in West Virginia). So issuing an injunction under the\nrelitigation exception is resorting to heavy artillery.5 For\nthat reason, every benefit of the doubt goes toward the\nstate court, see Atlantic Coast Line, 398 U. S., at 287, 297;\nan injunction can issue only if preclusion is clear beyond\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 That is especially so because an injunction is not the only way to\n\ncorrect a state trial court\u2019s erroneous refusal to give preclusive effect to\na federal judgment. As we have noted before, \u201cthe state appellate\ncourts and ultimately this Court\u201d can review and reverse such a ruling.\nSee Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281,\n287 (1970).\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

For\nthe federal court\u2019s determination of the class issue to have\nthis preclusive effect, at least two conditions must be met.6\nFirst, the issue the federal court decided must be the same\nas the one presented in the state tribunal. See 18 Wright\n& Miller \u00a74417, at 412. And second, Smith must have\nbeen a party to the federal suit, or else must fall within\none of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against\nbinding nonparties. See 18A id., \u00a74449, at 330. In fact,\nas we will explain, the issues before the two courts were\nnot the same, and Smith was neither a party nor the ex\nceptional kind of nonparty who can be bound. So the\ncourts below erred in finding the certification issue pre\ncluded, and erred all the more in thinking an injunction\nappropriate.7\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We have held that federal common law governs the preclusive effect\n\nof a decision of a federal court sitting in diversity. See Semtek Int\u2019l Inc.\nv. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 508 (2001). Smith assumes\nthat federal common law should here incorporate West Virginia\u2019s\npreclusion law, see Brief for Petitioners 15\u201316, whereas Bayer favors\nlooking only to federal rules of preclusion because of the federal inter\nests at stake in this case, see Brief for Respondent 18. We do not think\nthe question matters here. Neither party identifies any way in which\nfederal and state principles of preclusion law differ in any relevant\nrespect. Nor have we found any such divergence. Compare, e.g.,\nMontana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 153\u2013154 (1979) (describing\nelements of issue preclusion), with State v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">W. Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9, 459\nS. E. 2d 114, 120 (1995) (same). We therefore need not decide whether,\nin general, federal common law ought to incorporate state law in\nsituations such as this.\n   7 Because we rest our decision on the Anti-Injunction Act and the\n\nprinciples of issue preclusion that inform it, we do not consider Smith\u2019s\nargument, based on Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797\n(1985), that the District Court\u2019s action violated the Due Process Clause.\n8                  SMITH v. BAYER CORP. \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             A\n\n  In our most recent case on the relitigation exception,\nChick Kam Choo v. Exxon, we applied the \u201csame issue\u201d\nrequirement of preclusion law to invalidate a federal\ncourt\u2019s injunction. 486 U. S., at 151. The federal court\nhad dismissed a suit involving Singapore law on grounds\nof forum non conveniens. After the plaintiff brought the\nsame claim in Texas state court, the federal court issued\nan injunction barring the plaintiff from pursuing relief in\nthat alternate forum. We held that the District Court had\ngone too far. \u201c[A]n essential prerequisite for applying the\nrelitigation exception,\u201d we explained, \u201cis that the . . . is\nsues which the federal injunction insulates from litigation\nin state proceedings actually have been decided by the\nfederal court.\u201d Id., at 148. That prerequisite, we thought,\nwas not satisfied because the issue to be adjudicated in\nstate court was not the one the federal court had resolved.\nThe federal court had considered the permissibility of the\nclaim under federal forum non conveniens principles. But\nthe Texas courts, we thought, \u201cwould apply a significantly\ndifferent forum non conveniens analysis,\u201d id., at 149; they\nhad in prior cases rejected the strictness of the federal\ndoctrine. Our conclusion followed: \u201c[W]hether the Texas\nstate courts are an appropriate forum for [the plaintiff\u2019s]\nSingapore law claims has not yet been litigated.\u201d Ibid.\nBecause the legal standards in the two courts differed, the\nissues before the courts differed, and an injunction was\nunwarranted.\n  The question here closely resembles the one in Chick\nKam Choo. The class Smith proposed in state court mir\nrored the class McCollins sought to certify in federal court:\nBoth included all Baycol purchasers resident in West\nVirginia. Moreover, the substantive claims in the two\nsuits broadly overlapped: Both complaints alleged that\nBayer had sold a defective product in violation of the\nState\u2019s consumer protection law and the company\u2019s war\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nranties. So far, so good for preclusion. But not so fast:\na critical question\u2014the question of the applicable legal\nstandard\u2014remains. The District Court ruled that the\nproposed class did not meet the requirements of Federal\nRule 23 (because individualized issues would predominate\nover common ones). But the state court was poised to\nconsider whether the proposed class satisfied West Vir\nginia Rule 23. If those two legal standards differ (as\nfederal and state forum non conveniens law differed in\nChick Kam Choo)\u2014then the federal court resolved an\nissue not before the state court. In that event, much like\nin Chick Kam Choo, \u201cwhether the [West Virginia] state\ncour[t]\u201d should certify the proposed class action \u201chas not\nyet been litigated.\u201d 486 U. S., at 149.\n   The Court of Appeals and Smith offer us two competing\nways of deciding whether the West Virginia and Federal\nRules differ, but we think the right path lies somewhere in\nthe middle. The Eighth Circuit relied almost exclusively\non the near-identity of the two Rules\u2019 texts. See 593 F. 3d,\nat 723. That was the right place to start, but not to end.\nFederal and state courts, after all, can and do apply iden\ntically worded procedural provisions in widely varying\nways. If a State\u2019s procedural provision tracks the lan\nguage of a Federal Rule, but a state court interprets that\nprovision in a manner federal courts have not, then the\nstate court is using a different standard and thus deciding\na different issue. See 18 Wright & Miller \u00a74417, at 454\n(stating that preclusion is \u201cinappropriate\u201d when \u201cdifferent\nlegal standards . . . masquerad[e] behind similar legal\nlabels\u201d). At the other extreme, Smith contends that the\nsource of law is all that matters: a different sovereign\nmust in each and every case \u201chave the opportunity, if it\nchooses, to construe its procedural rule differently.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 22 (quoting ALI, Principles of the Law,\nAggregate Litigation \u00a72.11, Reporters\u2019 Notes, cmt. b,\np. 181 (2010)). But if state courts have made crystal clear\n10                 SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat they follow the same approach as the federal court\napplied, we see no need to ignore that determination; in\nthat event, the issues in the two cases would indeed be the\nsame. So a federal court considering whether the relitiga\ntion exception applies should examine whether state law\nparallels its federal counterpart. But as suggested earlier,\nsee supra, at 6, the federal court must resolve any uncer\ntainty on that score by leaving the question of preclusion\nto the state courts.\n   Under this approach, the West Virginia Supreme Court\nhas gone some way toward resolving the matter before us\nby declaring its independence from federal courts\u2019 inter\npretation of the Federal Rules\u2014and particularly of Rule\n23. In In re W. Va. Rezulin Litigation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">W. Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585\nS. E. 2d 52 (2003) (In re Rezulin), the West Virginia high\ncourt considered a plaintiff\u2019s motion to certify a class\u2014\ncoincidentally enough, in a suit about an allegedly defec\ntive pharmaceutical product. The court made a point of\ncomplaining about the parties\u2019 and lower court\u2019s near\nexclusive reliance on federal cases about Federal Rule 23\nto decide the certification question. Such cases, the court\ncautioned, \u201c \u2018may be persuasive, but [they are] not binding\nor controlling.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 61, 585 S. E. 2d, at 61. And lest\nanyone mistake the import of this message, the court went\non: The aim of \u201cthis rule is to avoid having our legal\nanalysis of our Rules \u2018amount to nothing more than Pav\nlovian responses to federal decisional law.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (italics\nomitted). Of course, the state courts might still have\nadopted an approach to their Rule 23 that tracked the\nanalysis the federal court used in McCollins\u2019 case. But\nabsent clear evidence that the state courts had done so, we\ncould not conclude that they would interpret their Rule in\nthe same way. And if that is so, we could not tell whether\nthe certification issues in the state and federal courts were\nthe same. That uncertainty would preclude an injunction.\n   But here the case against an injunction is even stronger,\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause the West Virginia Supreme Court has disap\nproved the approach to Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance\nrequirement that the Federal District Court embraced.\nRecall that the federal court held that the presence of\na single individualized issue\u2014injury from the use of\nBaycol\u2014prevented class certification. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt did not identify the common issues in the case; nor\ndid it balance these common issues against the need to\nprove individual injury to determine which predominated.\nThe court instead applied a strict test barring class treat\nment when proof of each plaintiff\u2019s injury is necessary.8\nBy contrast, the West Virginia Supreme Court in In\nre Rezulin adopted an all-things-considered, balancing\ninquiry in interpreting its Rule 23. Rejecting any \u201crigid\ntest,\u201d the state court opined that the predominance re\nquirement \u201ccontemplates a review of many factors.\u201d 214\nW. Va., at 72, 585 S. E. 2d, at 72. Indeed, the court noted,\na \u201c \u2018single common issue\u2019 \u201d in a case could outweigh \u201c \u2018nu\nmerous . . . individual questions.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. That meant, the\ncourt further explained (quoting what it termed the \u201clead\ning treatise\u201d on the subject), that even objections to certifi\ncation \u201c \u2018based on . . . causation, or reliance\u2019 \u201d\u2014which typi\ncally involve showings of individual injury\u2014\u201c \u2018will not bar\npredominance satisfaction.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 2 A. Conte &\nH. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a74.26, p. 241 (4th\ned. 2002)). So point for point, the analysis set out in In re\nRezulin diverged from the District Court\u2019s interpretation\nof Federal Rule 23. A state court using the In re Rezulin\nstandard would decide a different question than the one\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The District Court\u2019s approach to the predominance inquiry is consis\n\ntent with the approach employed by the Eighth Circuit. See In re St.\nJude Medical, Inc., 522 F. 3d 836, 837\u2013840 (2008) (holding that most\ncommercial misrepresentation cases are \u201cunsuitable for class treat\nment\u201d because individual issues of reliance necessarily predominate).\nWe express no opinion as to the correctness of this approach.\n12                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe federal court had earlier resolved.9\n   This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of Chick\nKam Choo. A federal court and a state court apply differ\nent law. That means they decide distinct questions. The\nfederal court\u2019s resolution of one issue does not preclude the\nstate court\u2019s determination of another. It then goes with\nout saying that the federal court may not issue an injunc\ntion. The Anti-Injunction Act\u2019s re-litigation exception does\nnot extend nearly so far.\n                             B\n   The injunction issued here runs into another basic\npremise of preclusion law: A court\u2019s judgment binds only\nthe parties to a suit, subject to a handful of discrete and\nlimited exceptions. See, e.g., 18A Wright & Miller \u00a74449,\nat 330. The importance of this rule and the narrowness of\nits exceptions go hand in hand. We have repeatedly \u201cem\nphasize[d] the fundamental nature of the general rule\u201d\nthat only parties can be bound by prior judgments; accord\ningly, we have taken a \u201cconstrained approach to nonparty\npreclusion.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 898 (2008).\nAgainst this backdrop, Bayer defends the decision below\nby arguing that Smith\u2014an unnamed member of a pro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Bayer argues that In re Rezulin does not preclude an injunction in\n\nthis case because the West Virginia court there decided that common\nissues predominated over individual issues of damages, not over indi\nvidual issues of liability (as exist here). See Brief for Respondent 25\u2013\n26. We think Bayer is right about this distinction, but wrong about its\nconsequence. Our point is not that In re Rezulin dictates the answer\nto the class certification question here; the two cases are indeed too\ndissimilar for that to be true. The point instead is that In re Rezulin\narticulated a general approach to the predominance requirement that\ndiffers markedly from the one the federal court used. Minor variations\nin the application of what is in essence the same legal standard do not\ndefeat preclusion; but where, as here, the State\u2019s courts \u201cwould apply a\nsignificantly different . . . analysis,\u201d Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp.,\n486 U. S. 140, 149 (1988), the federal and state courts decide different\nissues.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nposed but uncertified class\u2014qualifies as a party to the\nMcCollins litigation. See Brief for Respondent 32\u201334.\nAlternatively, Bayer claims that the District Court\u2019s\njudgment binds Smith under the recognized exception to\nthe rule against nonparty preclusion for members of class\nactions. See id., at 34\u201339. We think neither contention\nhas merit.\n   Bayer\u2019s first claim ill-comports with any proper under\nstanding of what a \u201cparty\u201d is. In general, \u201c[a] \u2018party\u2019 to\nlitigation is \u2018[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is\nbrought,\u2019 \u201d United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New\nYork, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4), or one who\n\u201cbecome[s] a party by intervention, substitution, or third\nparty practice,\u201d Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987).\nAnd we have further held that an unnamed member of a\ncertified class may be \u201cconsidered a \u2018party\u2019 for the [particu\nlar] purpos[e] of appealing\u201d an adverse judgment. Devlin\nv. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1, 7 (2002). But as the dissent in\nDevlin noted, no one in that case was \u201cwilling to advance\nthe novel and surely erroneous argument that a non\nnamed class member is a party to the class-action litiga\ntion before the class is certified.\u201d Id., at 16, n. 1 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.). Still less does that argument make sense once\ncertification is denied. The definition of the term \u201cparty\u201d\ncan on no account be stretched so far as to cover a person\nlike Smith, whom the plaintiff in a lawsuit was denied\nleave to represent.10 If the judgment in the McCollins\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 In support of its claim that Smith counts as a party, Bayer cites two\n\ncases in which we held that a putative member of an uncertified class\nmay wait until after the court rules on the certification motion to file an\nindividual claim or move to intervene in the suit. See Brief for Respon\ndent 32\u201333 (citing United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385\n(1977); American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974)). But\nthese cases, which were specifically grounded in policies of judicial\nadministration, demonstrate only that a person not a party to a class\nsuit may receive certain benefits (such as the tolling of a limitations\nperiod) related to that proceeding. See id., at 553; McDonald, 432\n14                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigation can indeed bind Smith, it must do so under\nprinciples of nonparty preclusion.\n   As Bayer notes, see Brief for Respondent 37, one such\nprinciple allows unnamed members of a class action to be\nbound, even though they are not parties to the suit. See\nCooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U. S.\n867, 874 (1984) (\u201c[U]nder elementary principles of prior\nadjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class\naction is binding on class members in any subsequent\nlitigation\u201d); see also Taylor, 553 U. S., at 894 (stating that\nnonparties can be bound in \u201cproperly conducted class\nactions\u201d). But here Bayer faces a conundrum. If we know\none thing about the McCollins suit, we know that it was\nnot a class action. Indeed, the very ruling that Bayer\nargues ought to be given preclusive effect is the District\nCourt\u2019s decision that a class could not properly be certi\nfied. So Bayer wants to bind Smith as a member of a class\naction (because it is only as such that a nonparty in\nSmith\u2019s situation can be bound) to a determination that\nthere could not be a class action. And if the logic of that\nposition is not immediately transparent, here is Bayer\u2019s\nattempt to clarify: \u201c[U]ntil the moment when class certi\nfication was denied, the McCollins case was a properly\nconducted class action.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37. That is\ntrue, according to Bayer, because McCollins\u2019 interests\nwere aligned with the members of the class he proposed\nand he \u201cact[ed] in a representative capacity when he\nsought class certification.\u201d Id., at 36.\n   But wishing does not make it so. McCollins sought class\ncertification, but he failed to obtain that result. Because\nthe District Court found that individual issues predomi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nU. S., at 394, n. 15. That result is consistent with a commonplace of\npreclusion law\u2014that nonparties sometimes may benefit from, even\nthough they cannot be bound by, former litigation. See Parklane Ho\nsiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322, 326\u2013333 (1979); Blonder-Tongue\nLaboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313 (1971).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnated, it held that the action did not satisfy Federal Rule\n23\u2019s requirements for class proceedings. In these circum\nstances, we cannot say that a properly conducted class\naction existed at any time in the litigation. Federal Rule\n23 determines what is and is not a class action in federal\ncourt, where McCollins brought his suit. So in the absence\nof a certification under that Rule, the precondition for\nbinding Smith was not met. Neither a proposed class\naction nor a rejected class action may bind nonparties.\nWhat does have this effect is a class action approved under\nRule 23. But McCollins\u2019 lawsuit was never that.\n   We made essentially these same points in Taylor v.\nSturgell just a few Terms ago. The question there con\ncerned the propriety of binding nonparties under a theory\nof \u201cvirtual representation\u201d based on \u201cidentity of interests\nand some kind of relationship between parties and non\nparties.\u201d 553 U. S., at 901. We rejected the theory\nunanimously, explaining that it \u201cwould \u2018recogniz[e], in\neffect, a common-law kind of class action.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Such a\ndevice, we objected, would authorize preclusion \u201cshorn of\n[Rule 23\u2019s] procedural protections.\u201d Ibid. Or as otherwise\nstated in the opinion: We could not allow \u201ccircumvent[ion]\u201d\nof Rule 23\u2019s protections through a \u201cvirtual representation\ndoctrine that allowed courts to \u2018create de facto class ac\ntions at will.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. We could hardly have been more\nclear that a \u201cproperly conducted class action,\u201d with bind\ning effect on nonparties, can come about in federal courts\nin just one way\u2014through the procedure set out in Rule 23.\nBayer attempts to distinguish Taylor by noting that the\nparty in the prior litigation there did not propose a class\naction. But we do not see why that difference matters.\nYes, McCollins wished to represent a class, and made a\nmotion to that effect. But it did not come to pass. To\nallow McCollins\u2019 suit to bind nonparties would be to adopt\n16                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe very theory Taylor rejected.11\n  Bayer\u2019s strongest argument comes not from established\nprinciples of preclusion, but instead from policy concerns\nrelating to use of the class action device. Bayer warns\nthat under our approach class counsel can repeatedly try\nto certify the same class \u201cby the simple expedient of\nchanging the named plaintiff in the caption of the com\nplaint.\u201d Brief for Respondent 47\u201348. And in this world of\n\u201cserial relitigation of class certification,\u201d Bayer contends,\ndefendants \u201cwould be forced in effect to buy litigation\npeace by settling.\u201d Id., at 2, 12; see also In re Bridge\nstone/Firestone, Inc., Tires Prods. Liability Litigation,\n333 F. 3d 763, 767 (CA7 2003) (objecting to an \u201can asym\nmetric system in which class counsel can win but never\nlose\u201d because of their ability to relitigate the issue of\ncertification).\n  But this form of argument flies in the face of the rule\nagainst nonparty preclusion. That rule perforce leads to\nrelitigation of many issues, as plaintiff after plaintiff after\nplaintiff (none precluded by the last judgment because\nnone a party to the last suit) tries his hand at establishing\nsome legal principle or obtaining some grant of relief. We\nconfronted a similar policy concern in Taylor, which in\nvolved litigation brought under the Freedom of Infor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The great weight of scholarly authority\u2014from the Restatement of\n\nJudgments to the American Law Institute to Wright and Miller\u2014\nagrees that an uncertified class action cannot bind proposed class\nmembers. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a741(1), p. 393 (1980)\n(A nonparty may be bound only when his interests are adequately\nrepresented by \u201c[t]he representative of a class of persons similarly\nsituated, designated as such with the approval of the court\u201d); ALI,\nPrinciples of the Law Aggregate Litigation \u00a72.11, Reporters\u2019 Notes, cmt.\nb, p. 181 (2010) (\u201c[N]one of [the exceptions to the rule against nonparty\npreclusion] extend generally to the situation of a would-be absent class\nmember with respect to a denial of class certification\u201d); 18A Wright &\nMiller \u00a74455, at 457\u2013458 (\u201c[A]bsent certification there is no basis for\nprecluding a nonparty\u201d under the class-action exception).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmation Act (FOIA). The Government there cautioned\nthat unless we bound nonparties a \u201c \u2018potentially limitless\u2019 \u201d\nnumber of plaintiffs, perhaps coordinating with each\nother, could \u201cmount a series of repetitive lawsuits\u201d de\nmanding the selfsame documents. 553 U. S., at 903. But\nwe rejected this argument, even though the payoff in a\nsingle successful FOIA suit\u2014disclosure of documents to\nthe public\u2014could \u201ctrum[p]\u201d or \u201csubsum[e]\u201d all prior losses,\njust as a single successful class certification motion could\ndo. In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 333 F. 3d, at 766, 767. As\nthat response suggests, our legal system generally relies\non principles of stare decisis and comity among courts to\nmitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litiga\ntion brought by different plaintiffs. We have not thought\nthat the right approach (except in the discrete categories\nof cases we have recognized) lies in binding nonparties to a\njudgment.\n   And to the extent class actions raise special problems of\nrelitigation, Congress has provided a remedy that does not\ninvolve departing from the usual rules of preclusion. In\nthe Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71332(d), 1453 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), Congress enabled\ndefendants to remove to federal court any sizable class\naction involving minimal diversity of citizenship. Once\nremoval takes place, Federal Rule 23 governs certification.\nAnd federal courts may consolidate multiple overlapping\nsuits against a single defendant in one court (as the Judi\ncial Panel on Multi-District Litigation did for the many\nactions involving Baycol). See \u00a71407. Finally, we would\nexpect federal courts to apply principles of comity to each\nother\u2019s class certification decisions when addressing a\ncommon dispute. See, e.g., Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill\nHarbert Constr. Co., 529 U. S. 193, 198 (2000) (citing\nLandis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936)).\nCAFA may be cold comfort to Bayer with respect to suits\nlike this one beginning before its enactment. But Con\n18                     SMITH v. BAYER CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019s decision to address the relitigation concerns associ\nated with class actions through the mechanism of removal\nprovides yet another reason for federal courts to adhere\nin this context to longstanding principles of preclusion.12\nAnd once again, that is especially so when the federal\ncourt is deciding whether to go so far as to enjoin a state\nproceeding.\n                       *     *    *\n   The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits the order the District\nCourt entered here. The Act\u2019s relitigation exception au\nthorizes injunctions only when a former federal adjudica\ntion clearly precludes a state-court decision. As we said\nmore than 40 years ago, and have consistently maintained\nsince that time, \u201c[a]ny doubts . . . should be resolved in\nfavor of permitting the state courts to proceed.\u201d Atlantic\nCoast Line, 398 U. S., at 297. Under this approach, close\ncases have easy answers: The federal court should not\nissue an injunction, and the state court should decide the\npreclusion question. But this case does not even strike us\nas close. The issues in the federal and state lawsuits\ndiffered because the relevant legal standards differed.\nAnd the mere proposal of a class in the federal action\ncould not bind persons who were not parties there. For\nthese reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n                                                              Reversed.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 By the same token, nothing in our holding today forecloses legisla\n\ntion to modify established principles of preclusion should Congress\ndecide that CAFA does not sufficiently prevent relitigation of class\ncertification motions. Nor does this opinion at all address the permis\nsibility of a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to\nthis question. Cf. n. 7, supra (declining to reach Smith\u2019s due process\nclaim).\n</pre>",
