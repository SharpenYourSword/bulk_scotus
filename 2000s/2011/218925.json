NORTH CAROLINA\n\n CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\n    No. 09\u201311121.       Argued March 23, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nPolice stopped and questioned petitioner J. D. B., a 13-year-old, sev\n  enth-grade student, upon seeing him near the site of two home break\n  ins. Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen\n  items was found at J. D. B.\u2019s school and seen in his possession, Inves\n  tigator DiCostanzo went to the school. A uniformed police officer on\n  detail to the school took J. D. B. from his classroom to a closed-door\n  conference room, where police and school administrators questioned\n  him for at least 30 minutes. Before beginning, they did not give him\n  Miranda warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his le\n  gal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room. He first de\n  nied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to\n  tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.\n  DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer ques\n  tions and was free to leave. Asked whether he understood, J. D. B.\n  nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the sto\n  len items. He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\u2019s request. When\n  the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus\n  home. Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., charging\n  him with breaking and entering and with larceny. His public de\n  fender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived\n  therefrom, arguing that J. D. B. had been interrogated in a custodial\n  setting without being afforded Miranda warnings and that his\n  statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed\n  his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress. The court adju\n  dicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and\n  State Supreme Court affirmed. The latter court declined to find\n  J. D. B.\u2019s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police\n  custody.\n2                   J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nHeld: A child\u2019s age properly informs Miranda\u2019s custody analysis. Pp. 5\u2013\n 18.\n    (a) Custodial police interrogation entails \u201cinherently compelling\n pressures,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467, that \u201ccan induce\n a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they\n never committed,\u201d Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Recent\n studies suggest that risk is all the more acute when the subject of\n custodial interrogation is a juvenile. Whether a suspect is \u201cin cus\n tody\u201d for Miranda purposes is an objective determination involving\n two discrete inquires: \u201cfirst, what were the circumstances surround\n ing the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a\n reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the\n interrogation and leave.\u201d Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112\n (footnote omitted). The police and courts must \u201cexamine all of the\n circumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d Stansbury v. Califor\n nia, 511 U. S. 318, 322, including those that \u201cwould have affected\n how a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive\n his or her freedom to leave,\u201d id., at 325. However, the test involves\n no consideration of the particular suspect\u2019s \u201cactual mindset.\u201d Yar\n borough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 667. By limiting analysis to ob\n jective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task\n of anticipating each suspect\u2019s idiosyncrasies and divining how those\n particular traits affect that suspect\u2019s subjective state of mind. Berke\n mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430\u2013431. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) In some circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u201cwould have affected how a\n reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive his or\n her freedom to leave.\u201d Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 325. Courts can ac\n count for that reality without doing any damage to the objective na\n ture of the custody analysis. A child\u2019s age is far \u201cmore than a chrono\n logical fact.\u201d Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115. It is a fact\n that \u201cgenerates commonsense conclusions about behavior and percep\n tion,\u201d Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a\n class. Children \u201cgenerally are less mature and responsible than\n adults,\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115; they \u201coften lack the experience,\n perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could\n be detrimental to them,\u201d Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635; and\n they \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to . . . outside pressures\u201d\n than adults, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569. In the specific\n context of police interrogation, events that \u201cwould leave a man cold\n and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a\u201d teen. Haley v. Ohio,\n 332 U. S. 596, 599. The law has historically reflected the same as\n sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise\n mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to under\n stand the world around them.

S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  a class\u2014e.g., limitations on their ability to marry without parental\n  consent\u2014exhibit the settled understanding that the differentiating\n  characteristics of youth are universal.\n     Given a history \u201creplete with laws and judicial recognition\u201d that\n  children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults, Eddings, 455\n  U. S., at 115\u2013116, there is no justification for taking a different\n  course here. So long as the child\u2019s age was known to the officer at the\n  time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a\n  reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis re\n  quires officers neither to consider circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to\n  them, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to\u201c \u2018 \u201canticipat[e] the frailties\n  or idiosyncrasies\u201d of the particular suspect being questioned.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Al\n  varado, 541 U. S., at 662. Precisely because childhood yields objec\n  tive conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not in\n  volve a determination of how youth affects a particular child\u2019s\n  subjective state of mind. In fact, were the court precluded from tak\n  ing J. D. B.\u2019s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the\n  circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when\n  some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school\n  are specific to children. These conclusions are not undermined by the\n  Court\u2019s observation in Alvarado that accounting for a juvenile\u2019s age\n  in the Miranda custody analysis \u201ccould be viewed as creating a sub\n  jective inquiry,\u201d 541 U. S., at 668. The Court said nothing about\n  whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it\n  simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective\n  Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. So long as the child\u2019s age\n  was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to\n  a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consis\n  tent with the Miranda test\u2019s objective nature. This does not mean\n  that a child\u2019s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor\n  in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore. Pp. 8\u201314.\n     (c) Additional arguments that the State and its amici offer for ex\n  cluding age from the custody inquiry are unpersuasive. Pp. 14\u201318.\n     (d) On remand, the state courts are to address the question\n  whether J. D. B. was in custody when he was interrogated, taking ac\n  count of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, includ\n  ing J. D. B.\u2019s age at the time. P. 18.\n363 N. C. 664, 686 S.

D. B., PETITIONER v. NORTH CAROLINA\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                   NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                [June 16, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case presents the question whether the age of a\nchild subjected to police questioning is relevant to the\ncustody analysis of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436\n(1966). It is beyond dispute that children will often feel\nbound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the\nsame circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no\nreason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to\nthat commonsense reality, we hold that a child\u2019s age prop\nerly informs the Miranda custody analysis.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade\nstudent attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel\nHill, North Carolina when he was removed from his class\nroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed\ndoor conference room, and questioned by police for at least\nhalf an hour.\n  This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B.\nin the span of a week. Five days earlier, two home break\nins occurred, and various items were stolen. Police\nstopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a\n2                    J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nresidence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.\nThat same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.\u2019s grand\nmother\u2014his legal guardian\u2014as well as his aunt.\n   Police later learned that a digital camera matching the\ndescription of one of the stolen items had been found at\nJ. D. B.\u2019s middle school and seen in J. D. B.\u2019s possession.\nInvestigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with\nthe local police force who had been assigned to the case,\nwent to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arrival,\nDiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail\nto the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assis\ntant principal, and an administrative intern that he was\nthere to question J. D. B. about the break-ins. Although\nDiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify\nJ. D. B.\u2019s date of birth, address, and parent contact in\nformation from school records, neither the police offi\ncers nor the school administrators contacted J. D. B.\u2019s\ngrandmother.\n   The uniformed officer interrupted J. D. B.\u2019s afternoon\nsocial studies class, removed J. D. B. from the classroom,\nand escorted him to a school conference room.1 There,\nJ. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal,\nand the administrative intern. The door to the conference\nroom was closed. With the two police officers and the two\nadministrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the\nnext 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the commencement of\nquestioning, J. D. B. was given neither Miranda warnings\nnor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother. Nor was\nhe informed that he was free to leave the room.\n   Questioning began with small talk\u2014discussion of sports\nand J. D. B.\u2019s family life. DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although the State suggests that the \u201crecord is unclear as to who\n\nbrought J. D. B. to the conference room, and the trial court made no\nfactual findings on this specific point,\u201d Brief for Respondent 3, n. 1, the\nState agreed at the certiorari stage that \u201cthe SRO [school resource\nofficer] escorted petitioner\u201d to the room, Brief in Opposition 3.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

B. explained that he had been in\nthe neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he\nwas seeking work mowing lawns. DiCostanzo pressed\nJ. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain\nwork; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one\nof the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her\nhouse; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.\nThe assistant principal urged J. D. B. to \u201cdo the right\nthing,\u201d warning J. D. B. that \u201cthe truth always comes out\nin the end.\u201d App. 99a, 112a.\n   Eventually, J. D. B. asked whether he would \u201cstill be in\ntrouble\u201d if he returned the \u201cstuff.\u201d Ibid. In response,\nDiCostanzo explained that return of the stolen items\nwould be helpful, but \u201cthis thing is going to court\u201d regard\nless. Id., at 112a; ibid. (\u201c[W]hat\u2019s done is done[;] now you\nneed to help yourself by making it right\u201d); see also id., at\n99a. DiCostanzo then warned that he may need to seek a\nsecure custody order if he believed that J. D. B. would\ncontinue to break into other homes. When J. D. B. asked\nwhat a secure custody order was, DiCostanzo explained\nthat \u201cit\u2019s where you get sent to juvenile detention before\ncourt.\u201d Id., at 112a.\n   After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention,\nJ. D. B. confessed that he and a friend were responsible for\nthe break-ins. DiCostanzo only then informed J. D. B.\nthat he could refuse to answer the investigator\u2019s questions\nand that he was free to leave.2 Asked whether he under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial court\u2019s fac\ntual findings were \u201cuncontested and therefore . . . binding\u201d on it. In re\nJ. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 668, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 137 (2009). The court\ndescribed the sequence of events set forth in the text. See id., at 670\u2013\n671, 686 S. E. 2d, at 139. (\u201cImmediately following J. D. B.\u2019s initial\nconfession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not\nhave to speak with him and that he was free to leave\u201d (internal quota\ntion marks and alterations omitted)). Though less than perfectly\n4                    J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nstood, J. D. B. nodded and provided further detail, includ\ning information about the location of the stolen items.\nEventually J. D. B. wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\u2019s\nrequest. When the bell rang indicating the end of the\nschoolday, J. D. B. was allowed to leave to catch the bus\nhome.\n                                B\n   Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., each\nalleging one count of breaking and entering and one count\nof larceny. J. D. B.\u2019s public defender moved to suppress\nhis statements and the evidence derived therefrom, argu\ning that suppression was necessary because J. D. B. had\nbeen \u201cinterrogated by police in a custodial setting without\nbeing afforded Miranda warning[s],\u201d App. 89a, and be\ncause his statements were involuntary under the totality\nof the circumstances test, id., at 142a; see Schneckloth v.\nBustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973) (due process pre\ncludes admission of a confession where \u201ca defendant\u2019s will\nwas overborne\u201d by the circumstances of the interrogation).\nAfter a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and\nJ. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, decid\ning that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the\nschoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were\nvoluntary. As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of\nadmission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the\ndenial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated\nJ. D. B. delinquent. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nexplicit, the trial court\u2019s order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially\n\nconfessed prior to DiCostanzo\u2019s warnings. See App. 99a.\n  Nonetheless, both parties\u2019 submissions to this Court suggest that\nthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure\ncustody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5. Because we remand for a\ndetermination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analy\nsis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made\na conclusive finding of fact in this respect.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

E. 2d\n795 (2009). The North Carolina Supreme Court held, over\ntwo dissents, that J. D.

Even for an adult, the physical and psychological\nisolation of custodial interrogation can \u201cundermine the\nindividual\u2019s will to resist and . . . compel him to speak\nwhere he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d Ibid.

Prior to questioning, a suspect\n\u201cmust be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that\nany statement he does make may be used as evidence\nagainst him, and that he has a right to the presence of an\nattorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d 384 U.

As we have repeatedly emphasized,\nwhether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d is an objective inquiry.\n    \u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determina\n    tion: first, what were the circumstances surrounding\n    the interrogation; and second, given those circum\n    stances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she\n    was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and\n    leave. Once the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and\n    actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an ob\n    jective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there\n    a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\n    of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d Thomp\n    son v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995) (internal quo\n    tation marks, alteration, and footnote omitted).\nSee also Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 662\u2013663\n(2004); Stansbury, 511 U.

Rather than demar\ncate a limited set of relevant circumstances, we have\nrequired police officers and courts to \u201cexamine all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d Stansbury,\n511 U. S., at 322, including any circumstance that \u201cwould\nhave affected how a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s\nposition \u201cwould perceive his or her freedom to leave,\u201d id.,\nat 325. On the other hand, the \u201csubjective views harbored\nby either the interrogating officers or the person being\nquestioned\u201d are irrelevant. Id., at 323. The test, in other\nwords, involves no consideration of the \u201cactual mindset\u201d of\nthe particular suspect subjected to police questioning.\nAlvarado, 541 U. S., at 667; see also California v. Beheler,\n8                 J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n463 U. S. 1121, 1125, n. 3 (1983) (per curiam).\n  The benefit of the objective custody analysis is that it is\n\u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police.\u201d Alvarado,\n541 U. S., at 668. But see Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 441\n(recognizing the \u201coccasiona[l] . . . difficulty\u201d that police and\ncourts nonetheless have in \u201cdeciding exactly when a sus\npect has been taken into custody\u201d). Police must make in\nthe-moment judgments as to when to administer Miranda\nwarnings. By limiting analysis to the objective circum\nstances of the interrogation, and asking how a reasonable\nperson in the suspect\u2019s position would understand his\nfreedom to terminate questioning and leave, the objective\ntest avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating\nthe idiosyncrasies of every individual suspect and divining\nhow those particular traits affect each person\u2019s subjective\nstate of mind. See id., at 430\u2013431 (officers are not re\nquired to \u201cmake guesses\u201d as to circumstances \u201cunknow\nable\u201d to them at the time); Alvarado, 541 U.

We cannot agree. In\nsome circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u201cwould have affected\nhow a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould\nperceive his or her freedom to leave.\u201d Stansbury, 511\nU. S., at 325. That is, a reasonable child subjected to\npolice questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit\nwhen a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think\nit clear that courts can account for that reality without\ndoing any damage to the objective nature of the custody\nanalysis.\n   A child\u2019s age is far \u201cmore than a chronological fact.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Such\nconclusions apply broadly to children as a class. And, they\nare self-evident to anyone who was a child once himself,\nincluding any police officer or judge.\n   Time and again, this Court has drawn these common\nsense conclusions for itself.

The law has historically reflected the same as\nsumption that children characteristically lack the capacity\nto exercise mature judgment and possess only an incom\nplete ability to understand the world around them.

In negligence suits, for\ninstance, where liability turns on what an objectively\nreasonable person would do in the circumstances, \u201c[a]ll\nAmerican jurisdictions accept the idea that a person\u2019s\nchildhood is a relevant circumstance\u201d to be considered.\nRestatement (Third) of Torts \u00a710, Comment b, p. 117\n(2005); see also id., Reporters\u2019 Note, pp. 121\u2013122 (collect\ning cases); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7283A, Com\nment b, p. 15 (1963\u20131964) (\u201c[T]here is a wide basis of\ncommunity experience upon which it is possible, as a\npractical matter, to determine what is to be expected of\n[children]\u201d).\n   As this discussion establishes, \u201c[o]ur history is replete\nwith laws and judicial recognition\u201d that children cannot be\nviewed simply as miniature adults. Eddings, 455 U. S., at\n115\u2013116. We see no justification for taking a different\ncourse here. So long as the child\u2019s age was known to the\nofficer at the time of the interview, or would have been\nobjectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including\nage as part of the custody analysis requires officers nei\nther to consider circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to them,\nBerkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to \u201canticipat[e] the frail\nties or idiosyncrasies\u201d of the particular suspect whom they\nquestion, Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The same \u201cwide basis of community\nexperience\u201d that makes it possible, as an objective matter,\n\u201cto determine what is to be expected\u201d of children in other\ncontexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7283A, at 15; see\nsupra, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know\nwhat to expect of children subjected to police questioning.\n   In other words, a child\u2019s age differs from other personal\ncharacteristics that, even when known to police, have no\nobjectively discernible relationship to a reasonable per\nson\u2019s understanding of his freedom of action. Alvarado,\nholds, for instance, that a suspect\u2019s prior interrogation\n12                   J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhistory with law enforcement has no role to play in the\ncustody analysis because such experience could just as\neasily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away\nas to feel compelled to stay in place. 541 U. S., at 668.\nBecause the effect in any given case would be \u201ccontingent\n[on the] psycholog[y]\u201d of the individual suspect, the Court\nexplained, such experience cannot be considered without\ncompromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.\nIbid. A child\u2019s age, however, is different. Precisely be\ncause childhood yields objective conclusions like those we\nhave drawn ourselves\u2014among others, that children are\n\u201cmost susceptible to influence,\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115,\nand \u201coutside pressures,\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at 569\u2014\nconsidering age in the custody analysis in no way involves\na determination of how youth \u201csubjectively affect[s] the\nmindset\u201d of any particular child, Brief for Respondent 14.7\n  In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the\ncustody analysis would be nonsensical absent some con\nsideration of the suspect\u2019s age. This case is a prime exam\nple. Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.\u2019s youth\ninto account, it would be forced to evaluate the circum\nstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable\nperson of average years. In other words, how would a\nreasonable adult understand his situation, after being\nremoved from a seventh-grade social studies class by a\nuniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his\nassistant principal to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d; and being\nwarned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile\ndetention and separation from his guardian and primary\ncaretaker? To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s protestations, today\u2019s holding neither\n\ninvites consideration of whether a particular suspect is \u201cunusually\nmeek or compliant,\u201d post, at 9 (opinion of ALITO, J.), nor \u201cexpan[ds]\u201d the\nMiranda custody analysis, post, at 8, into a test that requires officers to\nanticipate and account for a suspect\u2019s every personal characteristic, see\npost, at 11\u201312.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nits absurdity. Neither officers nor courts can reasonably\nevaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their\nnature, are specific to children without accounting for the\nage of the child subjected to those circumstances.\n   Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns\n\u201cregarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to\nminors can be accommodated by considering the unique\ncircumstances present when minors are questioned in\nschool,\u201d post, at 17 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the effect of the\nschoolhouse setting cannot be disentangled from the iden\ntity of the person questioned. A student\u2014whose presence\nat school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school\nis cause for disciplinary action\u2014is in a far different posi\ntion than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to\nchaperone an event, or an adult from the community on\nschool grounds to attend a basketball game. Without\nasking whether the person \u201cquestioned in school\u201d is a\n\u201cminor,\u201d ibid., the coercive effect of the schoolhouse setting\nis unknowable.\n   Our prior decision in Alvarado in no way undermines\nthese conclusions. In that case, we held that a state-court\ndecision that failed to mention a 17-year-old\u2019s age as part\nof the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively un\nreasonable under the deferential standard of review set\nforth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Like the North\nCarolina Supreme Court here, see 363 N. C., at 672, 686\nS. E. 2d, at 140, we observed that accounting for a juve\nnile\u2019s age in the Miranda custody analysis \u201ccould be\nviewed as creating a subjective inquiry,\u201d 541 U. S., at 668.\nWe said nothing, however, of whether such a view would\nbe correct under the law. Cf. Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___,\n____, n. 3 (2010) (slip op., at 11, n. 3) (\u201c[W]hether the\n[state court] was right or wrong is not the pertinent ques\ntion under AEDPA\u201d). To the contrary, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s\nconcurring opinion explained that a suspect\u2019s age may\n14                  J. D. B. v.

S., at 669.\n  Reviewing the question de novo today, we hold that so\nlong as the child\u2019s age was known to the officer at the time\nof police questioning, or would have been objectively ap\nparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody\nanalysis is consistent with the objective nature of that\ntest.8 This is not to say that a child\u2019s age will be a deter\nminative, or even a significant, factor in every case. Cf.\nibid. (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (explaining that a state\ncourt decision omitting any mention of the defendant\u2019s age\nwas not unreasonable under AEDPA\u2019s deferential stan\ndard of review where the defendant \u201cwas almost 18 years\nold at the time of his interview\u201d); post, at 17 (suggesting\nthat \u201cteenagers nearing the age of majority\u201d are likely to\nreact to an interrogation as would a \u201ctypical 18-year-old\nin similar circumstances\u201d). It is, however, a reality that\ncourts cannot simply ignore.\n                           III\n  The State and its amici offer numerous reasons that\ncourts must blind themselves to a juvenile defendant\u2019s\nage.

See supra, at\n7; Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 323 (1994) (per curiam).\nUnlike a child\u2019s youth, an officer\u2019s purely internal thoughts have no\nconceivable effect on how a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position\nwould understand his freedom of action. See id., at 323\u2013325; Berkemer\nv. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 442 (1984). Rather than \u201covertur[n]\u201d that\nsettled principle, post, at 13, the limitation that a child\u2019s age may\ninform the custody analysis only when known or knowable simply\nreflects our unwillingness to require officers to \u201cmake guesses\u201d as to\ncircumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to them in deciding when to give Miranda\nwarnings, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430\u2013431.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Despite the supposed\nsignificance of this distinction, however, at oral argument\ncounsel for the State suggested without hesitation that at\nleast some undeniably personal characteristics\u2014for in\nstance, whether the individual being questioned is blind\u2014\nare circumstances relevant to the custody analysis. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41. Thus, the State\u2019s quarrel cannot be\nthat age is a personal characteristic, without more.9\n  The State further argues that age is irrelevant to the\ncustody analysis because it \u201cgo[es] to how a suspect may\ninternalize and perceive the circumstances of an interro\ngation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12; see also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21 (hereinafter U.

But the same\ncan be said of every objective circumstance that the State\nagrees is relevant to the custody analysis: Each circum\nstance goes to how a reasonable person would \u201cinternalize\nand perceive\u201d every other. See, e.g., Stansbury, 511 U. S.,\nat 325.

In either case, the question\nbecomes how a reasonable person would understand the circumstances,\neither from the perspective of a blind person or, as here, a 13-year-old\nchild.\n16               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKeohane, 516 U. S., at 113, instead of evaluating the cir\ncumstances one by one.\n  In the same vein, the State and its amici protest that\nthe \u201ceffect of . . . age on [the] perception of custody is\ninternal,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20, or \u201cpsychological,\u201d U. S.\nBrief 21. But the whole point of the custody analysis is to\ndetermine whether, given the circumstances, \u201ca reason\nable person [would] have felt he or she was . . . at liberty\nto terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d Keohane, 516\nU. S., at 112. Because the Miranda custody inquiry turns\non the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s\nposition, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is sub\njective simply because it has an \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cpsychologi\ncal\u201d impact on perception. Were that so, there would be no\nobjective circumstances to consider at all.\n  Relying on our statements that the objective custody\ntest is \u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police,\u201d\nAlvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a\nchild\u2019s age must be excluded from the analysis in order to\npreserve clarity. Similarly, the dissent insists that the\nclarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a\n\u201cone-size-fits-all reasonable-person test\u201d applies. Post, at\n13. In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendant\u2019s\nage will often make the inquiry more artificial, see supra,\nat 12\u201313, and thus only add confusion. And in any event,\na child\u2019s age, when known or apparent, is hardly an ob\nscure factor to assess. Though the State and the dissent\nworry about gradations among children of different ages,\nthat concern cannot justify ignoring a child\u2019s age alto\ngether. Just as police officers are competent to account for\nother objective circumstances that are a matter of degree\nsuch as the length of questioning or the number of officers\npresent, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of\nrelative age. Indeed, they are competent to do so even\nthough an interrogation room lacks the \u201creflective atmos\nphere of a [jury] deliberation room,\u201d post, at 15.

In short, officers and\njudges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of devel\nopmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or\nexpertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for\na child\u2019s age. They simply need the common sense to\nknow that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is\nan adult.\n   There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with\nthe State\u2019s plea for clarity and the dissent\u2019s singular focus\non simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded\nfrom the custody analysis a circumstance that we deter\nmined was relevant and objective, simply to make the\nfault line between custodial and noncustodial \u201cbrighter.\u201d\nIndeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else,\nthe custody test would presumably ask only whether the\nsuspect had been placed under formal arrest. Berkemer,\n468 U. S., at 441; see ibid. (acknowledging the \u201cocca\nsiona[l] . . . difficulty\u201d police officers confront in determin\ning when a suspect has been taken into custody). But\nwe have rejected that \u201cmore easily administered line,\u201d\nrecognizing that it would simply \u201cenable the police to\ncircumvent the constraints on custodial interrogations\nestablished by Miranda.\u201d Ibid.; see also ibid., n. 33.10\n   Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does\n\nnot answer the question whether a child\u2019s age is an objective circum\nstance relevant to the custody analysis. Miranda simply holds that\nwarnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without \u201cpaus[ing]\nto inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his\nrights without a warning being given.\u201d 384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at\n468\u2013469 (\u201cAssessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed,\nbased on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact\nwith authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a\nclearcut fact\u201d (footnote omitted)). That conclusion says nothing about\nwhether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first\nplace.\n18               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nage from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juve\nniles\u2019 constitutional rights because the due process volun\ntariness test independently accounts for a child\u2019s youth.\nTo be sure, that test permits consideration of a child\u2019s age,\nand it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendant\u2019s\ninculpatory statements at trial. See Gallegos, 370 U. S., at\n53\u201355; Haley, 332 U. S., at 599\u2013601; see also post, at 17\u2013\n18 (\u201c[C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care\nto ensure that [young children\u2019s] incriminating statements\nwere not obtained involuntarily\u201d). But Miranda\u2019s proce\ndural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness\ntest is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation\nis at stake. See 384 U. S., at 458 (\u201cUnless adequate pro\ntective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion\ninherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained\nfrom the defendant can truly be the product of his free\nchoice\u201d); Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 442 (\u201c[R]eliance on the\ntraditional totality-of-the-circumstances test raise[s] a risk\nof overlooking an involuntary custodial confession\u201d); see\nalso supra, at 5\u20136. To hold, as the State requests, that a\nchild\u2019s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been\ntaken into custody\u2014and thus to ignore the very real dif\nferences between children and adults\u2014would be to deny\nchildren the full scope of the procedural safeguards that\nMiranda guarantees to adults.\n                        *     *    *\n  The question remains whether J.

The judgment of the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the\nmain justifications for the Miranda1 rule: the perceived\nneed for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.\nAnd today\u2019s holding is not needed to protect the constitu\u00ad\ntional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.\n   Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime places a high value on\nclarity and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly fact\u00ad\nspecific constitutional rule against the admission of in-\nvoluntary confessions, the Miranda Court set down rigid\nstandards that often require courts to ignore personal\ncharacteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular\nsuspect\u2019s actual susceptibility to police pressure. This\nrigidity, however, has brought with it one of Miranda\u2019s\nprincipal strengths\u2014\u201cthe ease and clarity of its applica\u00ad\ntion\u201d by law enforcement officials and courts. See Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425\u2013426 (1986). A key contribu\u00ad\ntor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been\nMiranda\u2019s objective reasonable-person test for determin\u00ad\ning custody.\n   Miranda\u2019s custody requirement is based on the proposi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 See   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n2                J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntion that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is height\u00ad\nened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is\nsubjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on\nfreedom of movement. When this custodial threshold is\nreached, Miranda warnings must precede police question\u00ad\ning. But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis\nconsiders only whether, under the circumstances, a hypo\u00ad\nthetical reasonable person would consider himself to be\nconfined.\n   Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypotheti\u00ad\ncal reasonable person. Some, including those who have\nbeen hardened by past interrogations, may have no need\nfor Miranda warnings at all. And for other suspects\u2014\nthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of\npolice questioning\u2014Miranda warnings may come too late\nto be of any use. That is a necessary consequence of\nMiranda\u2019s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the\nconstitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects\nare left unprotected. A vulnerable defendant can still turn\nto the constitutional rule against actual coercion and\ncontend that that his confession was extracted against his\nwill.\n   Today\u2019s decision shifts the Miranda custody determina\u00ad\ntion from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an\ninquiry that must account for at least one individualized\ncharacteristic\u2014age\u2014that is thought to correlate with sus\u00ad\nceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no\nway the only personal characteristic that may correlate\nwith pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced\nto choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It may\nchoose to limit today\u2019s decision by arbitrarily distinguish\u00ad\ning a suspect\u2019s age from other personal characteristics\u2014\nsuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior ex\u00ad\nperience with law enforcement\u2014that may also correlate\nwith susceptibility to coercive pressures. Or, if the Court\nis unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto effect a fundamental transformation of the Miranda\ncustody test\u2014from a clear, easily applied prophylactic\nrule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the\nvoluntariness test that the Miranda Court found to be\nunsatisfactory.\n   For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down\nthis road. First, many minors subjected to police interro\u00ad\ngation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects\nthe one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule may not be a\nbad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the\nMiranda custody rule to minors arise because of the\nunique circumstances present when the police conduct\ninterrogations at school. The Miranda custody rule has\nalways taken into account the setting in which question\u00ad\ning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such\ncases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases\nlike the one now before us, where the suspect is especially\nyoung, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness\nstandard can take special care to ensure that incriminat\u00ad\ning statements were not obtained through coercion.\n   Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does\nnot require the extreme makeover of Miranda that today\u2019s\ndecision may portend.\n                             I\n  In the days before Miranda, this Court\u2019s sole metric for\nevaluating the admissibility of confessions was a volun\u00ad\ntariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nSelf-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States,\n168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);\nBrown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936) (due process).\nThe question in these voluntariness cases was whether the\nparticular \u201cdefendant\u2019s will\u201d had been \u201coverborne.\u201d\nLynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963). Courts took\ninto account both \u201cthe details of the interrogation\u201d and\n4                 J. D. B. v.

S. 156, 185 (1953).\n   All manner of individualized, personal characteristics\nwere relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the\nmost frequently mentioned factors were the defendant\u2019s\neducation, physical condition, intelligence, and mental\nhealth. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993);\nsee Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967) (\u201conly a\nfifth-grade education\u201d); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U.

S. 191, 193, 196, 198 (1957) (\u201clow\nmentality, if not mentally ill\u201d). The suspect\u2019s age also\nreceived prominent attention in several cases, e.g.,\nGallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962), especially\nwhen the suspect was a \u201cmere child.\u201d Haley v. Ohio, 332\nU. S. 596, 599 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight\nassigned to any one consideration varied from case to case.\nBut all of these factors, along with anything else that\nmight have affected the \u201cindividual\u2019s . . . capacity for\neffective choice,\u201d were relevant in determining whether\nthe confession was coerced or compelled. See Miranda\nv. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506\u2013507 (1966) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting).\n   The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness in\u00ad\nquiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a\n\u201ccomplex of values,\u201d Schneckloth, supra, at 223, 224, and\nto make a careful, highly individualized determination as\nto whether the police had wrung \u201ca confession out of [the]\naccused against his will.\u201d Blackburn v.

Its requirements\nare no doubt \u201crigid,\u201d see Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S.\n1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they\noften require courts to suppress \u201ctrustworthy and highly\nprobative\u201d statements that may be perfectly \u201cvoluntary\nunder [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.\u201d Fare v.\nMichael C., 442 U.

S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),\nand an administrable standard for the courts.

Surely this is incorrect. The\nvery act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all\nsorts of \u201crelevant and objective\u201d circumstances\u2014for example, all the\nobjective circumstances of a suspect\u2019s life history\u2014that might otherwise\nbear on a custody determination.\n8                J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntics in these and other custody cases should come as no\nsurprise. To account for such individualized considera\u00ad\ntions would be to contradict Miranda\u2019s central premise.\nThe Miranda Court\u2019s decision to adopt its inflexible pro\u00ad\nphylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion\nthat \u201c[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant pos\u00ad\nsessed, based on information as to his age, education,\nintelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be\nmore than speculation.\u201d 384 U. S., at 468\u2013469.\n                               II\n   In light of this established practice, there is no denying\nthat, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is\nembarking on a new expansion of the established custody\nstandard. And since Miranda is this Court\u2019s rule, \u201cnot a\nconstitutional command,\u201d it is up to the Court \u201cto justify\nits expansion.\u201d Cf. Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688\n(1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to\ndo.\n   In its present form, Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime\nalready imposes \u201chigh cost[s]\u201d by requiring suppression of\nconfessions that are often \u201chighly probative\u201d and \u201cvolun\u00ad\ntary\u201d by any traditional standard. Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298, 312 (1985); see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 444\n(under Miranda \u201cstatements which may be by no means\ninvoluntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his\n\u2018rights,\u2019 may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defen\u00ad\ndant go free as a result\u201d). Nonetheless, a \u201ccore virtue\u201d of\nMiranda has been the clarity and precision of its guidance\nto \u201cpolice and courts.\u201d Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680,\n694 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Moran,\n475 U. S., at 425 (\u201c[O]ne of the principal advantages of\nMiranda is the ease and clarity of its application\u201d (inter\u00ad\nnal quotation marks omitted)). This increased clarity \u201chas\nbeen thought to outweigh the burdens\u201d that Miranda\nimposes. Fare, 442 U. S., at 718. The Court has, however,\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 658 (citing cases). Given this prac\u00ad\ntice, there should be a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d against the\nCourt\u2019s new departure from the established custody test.\nSee United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640 (2004)\n(plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption\ncannot be overcome here.\n                              A\n   The Court\u2019s rationale for importing age into the custody\nstandard is that minors tend to lack adults\u2019 \u201ccapacity to\nexercise mature judgment\u201d and that failing to account for\nthat \u201creality\u201d will leave some minors unprotected under\nMiranda in situations where they perceive themselves to\nbe confined. See ante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many\nsuspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to\npolice pressure than the average adult. As the Court\nnotes, our pre-Miranda cases were particularly attuned to\nthis \u201creality\u201d in applying the constitutional requirement of\nvoluntariness in fact. Ante, at 9 (relying on Haley, 332\nU. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and Gallegos, 370 U. S.,\nat 54). It is no less a \u201creality,\u201d however, that many per\u00ad\nsons over the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police\npressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See\nPayne, 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a \u201cmen\u00ad\ntally dull 19-year-old youth\u201d relevant in voluntariness\ninquiry). Yet the Miranda custody standard has never\naccounted for the personal characteristics of these or any\nother individual defendants.\n   Indeed, it has always been the case under Miranda that\nthe unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same\nfixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as\nthose who are unusually resistant to police pressure.\n10               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nBerkemer, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 (\u201c[O]nly relevant\ninquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position\nwould have understood his situation\u201d). Miranda\u2019s rigid\nstandards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.\nThey are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a\nwindfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who\noften have no need for Miranda\u2019s protections. Compare\nMiranda, supra, at 471\u2013472 (\u201c[N]o amount of circumstan\u00ad\ntial evidence that the person may have been aware of \u201d his\nrights can overcome Miranda\u2019s requirements), with Orozco\nv. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 329 (1969) (White, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cWhere the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman,\nprofessional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of\nwhat his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that\nhis answer to every question asked him is compelled\nunless he is advised of those rights with which he is al\u00ad\nready intimately familiar\u201d). And Miranda\u2019s requirements\nare underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account\nfor \u201cfrailties,\u201d \u201cidiosyncrasies,\u201d and other individualized\nconsiderations that might cause a person to bend more\neasily during a confrontation with the police. See Alva\nrado, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nMembers of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major\nweakness in Miranda\u2019s \u201ccode of rules for confessions.\u201d See\n384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Fare, 439 U. S.,\nat 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (\u201c[T]he rigidity of\n[Miranda\u2019s] prophylactic rules was a principal weakness\nin the view of dissenters and critics outside the Court\u201d).\nBut if it is, then the weakness is an inescapable conse\u00ad\nquence of the Miranda Court\u2019s decision to supplement the\nmore holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size\u00ad\nfits-all prophylactic rule.\n   That is undoubtedly why this Court\u2019s Miranda cases\nhave never before mentioned \u201cthe suspect\u2019s age\u201d or any\nother individualized consideration in applying the custody\nstandard. See Alvarado, supra, at 666. And unless the\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf. In re\nJ. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 666, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 136\u2013137\n(2009). Are those facts more or less important than the\nstudent\u2019s age in determining whether he or she \u201cfelt . . . at\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave\u201d? See\nThompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). An I. Q.\nscore, like age, is more than just a number. Ante, at 8\n(\u201c[A]ge is far \u2018more than a chronological fact\u2019 \u201d). And an\nindividual\u2019s intelligence can also yield \u201cconclusions\u201d simi\u00ad\nlar to those \u201cwe have drawn ourselves\u201d in cases far afield\nof Miranda. Ante, at 12. Compare ibid. (relying on Ed\ndings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005)), with Smith v. Texas, 543\nU. S. 37, 44\u201345 (2004) (per curiam).\n   How about the suspect\u2019s cultural background? Suppose\nthe police learn (or should have learned, see ante, at 11)\nthat a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant\nfrom a country in which dire consequences often befall any\nperson who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with\nthe police.9 Is this really less relevant than the fact that a\nsuspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?\n   The defendant\u2019s education is another personal charac\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Cf.United States v. Chalan, 812 F. 2d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (re\u00ad\njecting claim that Native American suspect was \u201cin custody\u201d for\nMiranda purposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal authorities\nwas \u201cexpected of all tribal members\u201d).\n12                J.

Under today\u2019s decision, why should police officers\nand courts \u201cblind themselves,\u201d ante, at 1, to the fact that a\nsuspect has \u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d? See Clewis,\n386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what\nif the police know or should know that the suspect is \u201ca\ncollege-educated man with law school training\u201d? See\nCrooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 440 (1958), overruled\nby Miranda, supra, at 479, and n. 48. How are these\nindividual considerations meaningfully different from age\nin their \u201crelationship to a reasonable person\u2019s understand\u00ad\ning of his freedom of action\u201d? Ante, at 11. The Court\nproclaims that \u201c[a] child\u2019s age . . . is different,\u201d ante, at 12,\nbut the basis for this ipse dixit is dubious.\n   I have little doubt that today\u2019s decision will soon be cited\nby defendants\u2014and perhaps by prosecutors as well\u2014for\nthe proposition that all manner of other individual charac\u00ad\nteristics should be treated like age and taken into account\nin the Miranda custody calculus. Indeed, there are al\u00ad\nready lower court decisions that take this approach. See\nUnited States v. Beraun-Panez, 812 F. 2d 578, 581, modi\u00ad\nfied 830 F. 2d 127 (CA9 1987) (\u201creasonable person who\nwas an alien\u201d); In re Jorge D., 202 Ariz. 277, 280, 43\nP. 3d 605, 608 (App. 2002) (age, maturity, and experience);\nState v.

App. 580,\n594, 698 A. 2d 1155, 1162 (1997) (\u201ceducation, age, and\nintelligence\u201d).\n   In time, the Court will have to confront these issues,\nand it will be faced with a difficult choice. It may choose\nto distinguish today\u2019s decision and adhere to the arbitrary\nproclamation that \u201cage . . . is different.\u201d Ante, at 12. Or it\nmay choose to extend today\u2019s holding and, in doing so,\nfurther undermine the very rationale for the Miranda\nregime.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            13\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   If the Court chooses the latter course, then a core virtue\nof Miranda\u2014the \u201cease and clarity of its application\u201d\u2014will\nbe lost. Moran, 475 U. S., at 425; see Fare, 442 U. S., at\n718 (noting that the clarity of Miranda\u2019s requirements\n\u201chas been thought to outweigh the burdens that the deci\u00ad\nsion . . . imposes\u201d). However, even today\u2019s more limited\ndeparture from Miranda\u2019s one-size-fits-all reasonable\u00ad\nperson test will produce the very consequences that\nprompted the Miranda Court to abandon exclusive reli\u00ad\nance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The\nCourt\u2019s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will\nbe hard for judges to apply. See Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).\n   The Court holds that age must be taken into account\nwhen it \u201cwas known to the officer at the time of the inter\u00ad\nview,\u201d or when it \u201cwould have been objectively apparent\u201d\nto a reasonable officer. Ante, at 11. The first half of this\ntest overturns the rule that the \u201cinitial determination of\ncustody\u201d does not depend on the \u201csubjective views har\u00ad\nbored by . . . interrogating officers.\u201d Stansbury, 511 U. S.,\nat 323. The second half will generate time-consuming\nsatellite litigation over a reasonable officer\u2019s perceptions.\nWhen, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the\ninquiry may be relatively simple. But not all police ques\u00ad\ntioning of minors takes place in schools. In many cases,\ncourts will presumably have to make findings as to\nwhether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful\nlook to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the\nsuspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer\nwould have recognized that a suspect\u2019s I. D. was a fake.\nThe inquiry will be both \u201ctime-consuming and disruptive\u201d\nfor the police and the courts. See Berkemer, 468 U. S., at\n432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar\nconsiderations). It will also be made all the more compli\u00ad\ncated by the fact that a suspect\u2019s dress and manner will\n14               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\noften be different when the issue is litigated in court than\nit was at the time of the interrogation.\n   Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further prob\u00ad\nlems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put them\u00ad\nselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year\u00ad\nold, or 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for\nexample, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a cus\u00ad\ntody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical,\naverage 15-year-old. Forty-five years of personal experi\u00ad\nence and societal change separate this judge from the days\nwhen he or she was 15 years old. And this judge may or\nmay not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court\u2019s\nanswer to these difficulties is to state that \u201cno imaginative\npowers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or]\ntraining in cognitive science\u201d will be necessary. Ante, at\n17. Judges \u201csimply need the common sense,\u201d the Court\nassures, \u201cto know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old\nand neither is an adult.\u201d Ante, at 17. It is obvious, how\u00ad\never, that application of the Court\u2019s new rule demands\nmuch more than this.\n   Take a fairly typical case in which today\u2019s holding may\nmake a difference. A 16\u00bd-year-old moves to suppress\nincriminating statements made prior to the administra\u00ad\ntion of Miranda warnings. The circumstances are such\nthat, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not\nfind that he or she was in custody, but the defendant\nargues that a reasonable 16\u00bd-year-old would view the\nsituation differently. The judge will not have the luxury of\nmerely saying: \u201cIt is common sense that a 16\u00bd-year-old is\nnot an 18-year-old. Motion granted.\u201d Rather, the judge\nwill be required to determine whether the differences\nbetween a typical 16\u00bd-year-old and a typical 18-year-old\nwith respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interroga\u00ad\ntion are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody\ndetermination.

In particular, the Court\nrelies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant\nfactor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in\nnegligence suits. Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)\nof Torts \u00a710, Comment b, p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is\ngenerally a question for the jury, the members of which\ncan draw on their varied experiences with persons of\ndifferent ages. It also involves a post hoc determination,\nin the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about\nwhether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.\nThe Miranda custody determination, by contrast, must be\nmade in the first instance by police officers in the course of\nan investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.\nSee Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting \u201cthe importance\u201d\nunder Miranda of providing \u201ca workable rule \u2018to guide\npolice officers, who have only limited time and expertise to\nreflect on and balance the social and individual interests\ninvolved in the specific circumstances they confront\u2019 \u201d);\nAlvarado, 541 U.

Today\u2019s decision, by contrast, injects a new, compli\u00ad\ncating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied\nprophylactic rule. See Alvarado, supra, at 668\u2013669.10\n                             III\n  The Court\u2019s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and\nadministrability that have long been recognized as \u201cprin\u00ad\ncipal advantages\u201d of Miranda\u2019s prophylactic requirements.\nSee, e.g., Moran, 475 U. S., at 425. But what is worse, the\nCourt takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other,\nless disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are\nnot coerced into confessing.\n  As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court\u2019s\nstandard introduces will likely yield little added protection\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court also relies on North Carolina\u2019s concession at oral argu\u00ad\nment that a court could take into account a suspect\u2019s blindness as a\nfactor relevant to the Miranda custody determination.

In\nsuch a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelli\u00ad\ngible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the\nadvice at all. And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to\nleave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the\nconditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in\nmaking the Miranda custody determination.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

Most juveniles who are\nsubjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the\nage of majority.11 These defendants\u2019 reactions to police\npressure are unlikely to be much different from the reac\u00ad\ntion of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A\none-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule thus provides a\nroughly reasonable fit for these defendants.\n   In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises\nregarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to\nminors can be accommodated by considering the unique\ncircumstances present when minors are questioned in\nschool. See Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311 (reciting at length\nthe factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody\ndetermination here, including the fact that petitioner was\nremoved from class by a police officer, that the interview\ntook place in a school conference room, and that a uni\u00ad\nformed officer and a vice principal were present). The\nMiranda custody rule has always taken into account the\nsetting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a\nsuspect\u2019s freedom of movement, and the presence of police\nofficers or other authority figures.

It can do so here as well.12\n   Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the\nsuspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defen\u00ad\ndant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 See  Dept of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2008\nCrime in the United States (Sept. 2009), online at http://www2.fbi.gov/\nucr/cius2008/data/table_38.html (all Internet materials as visited June\n8, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (indicating that less\nthan 30% of juvenile arrests in the United States are of suspects who\nare under 15).\n   12 The Court thinks it would be \u201cabsur[d]\u201d to consider the school set\u00ad\n\nting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for\nthe Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable\nminor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that\nMiranda demands.\n18                  J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nensure that incriminating statements were not obtained\ninvoluntarily. The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and\naccommodating by nature, see Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at\n224, and the Court\u2019s precedents already make clear that\n\u201cspecial care\u201d must be exercised in applying the voluntari\u00ad\nness test where the confession of a \u201cmere child\u201d is at issue.\nHaley, 332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion). If Miranda\u2019s\nrigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the\nunique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigor\u00ad\nously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to\nensure that the rights of minors are protected. There is no\nneed to run Miranda off the rails.\n                         *     *     *\n    The Court rests its decision to inject personal character\u00ad\nistics into the Miranda custody inquiry on the principle\nthat judges applying Miranda cannot \u201cblind themselves to\n. . . commonsense reality.\u201d Ante, at 1, 8, 10\u201311, 14. But\nthe Court\u2019s shift is fundamentally at odds with the clear\nprophylactic rules that Miranda has long enforced.\nMiranda frequently requires judges to blind themselves to\nthe reality that many un-Mirandized custodial confessions\nare \u201cby no means involuntary\u201d or coerced. Dickerson, 530\nU. S., at 444. It also requires police to provide a rote\nrecitation of Miranda warnings that many suspects al\u00ad\nready know and could likely recite from memory.13 Under\ntoday\u2019s new, \u201creality\u201d-based approach to the doctrine,\nperhaps these and other principles of our Miranda juris\u00ad\nprudence will, like the custody standard, now be ripe for\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Surveys have shown that \u201c[l]arge majorities\u201d of the public are aware\n\nthat \u201cindividuals arrested for a crime\u201d have a right to \u201cremai[n] silent\n(81%),\u201d a right to \u201ca lawyer (95%),\u201d and a right to have a lawyer \u201cap\u00ad\npointed\u201d if the arrestee \u201ccannot afford one (88%).\u201d See Belden, Russonello\n& Stewart, Developing a National Message for Indigent Defense: Analy\u00ad\nsis of National Survey 4 (Oct. 2001), online at http://www.nlada.org/\nDMS/Documents/1211996548.53/Polling%20results%20report.pdf.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

B., a 13-year-old, sev\n  enth-grade student, upon seeing him near the site of two home break\n  ins. Five days later, after a digital camera matching one of the stolen\n  items was found at J. D. B.\u2019s school and seen in his possession, Inves\n  tigator DiCostanzo went to the school. A uniformed police officer on\n  detail to the school took J. D. B. from his classroom to a closed-door\n  conference room, where police and school administrators questioned\n  him for at least 30 minutes. Before beginning, they did not give him\n  Miranda warnings or the opportunity to call his grandmother, his le\n  gal guardian, nor tell him he was free to leave the room. He first de\n  nied his involvement, but later confessed after officials urged him to\n  tell the truth and told him about the prospect of juvenile detention.\n  DiCostanzo only then told him that he could refuse to answer ques\n  tions and was free to leave. Asked whether he understood, J. D. B.\n  nodded and provided further detail, including the location of the sto\n  len items. He also wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\u2019s request. When\n  the school day ended, he was permitted to leave to catch the bus\n  home. Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., charging\n  him with breaking and entering and with larceny. His public de\n  fender moved to suppress his statements and the evidence derived\n  therefrom, arguing that J. D. B. had been interrogated in a custodial\n  setting without being afforded Miranda warnings and that his\n  statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  J. D. B. entered a transcript of admission to the charges, but renewed\n  his objection to the denial of his motion to suppress. The court adju\n  dicated him delinquent, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals and\n  State Supreme Court affirmed. The latter court declined to find\n  J. D. B.\u2019s age relevant to the determination whether he was in police\n  custody.\n2                   J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nHeld: A child\u2019s age properly informs Miranda\u2019s custody analysis. Pp. 5\u2013\n 18.\n    (a) Custodial police interrogation entails \u201cinherently compelling\n pressures,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 467, that \u201ccan induce\n a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they\n never committed,\u201d Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. Recent\n studies suggest that risk is all the more acute when the subject of\n custodial interrogation is a juvenile. Whether a suspect is \u201cin cus\n tody\u201d for Miranda purposes is an objective determination involving\n two discrete inquires: \u201cfirst, what were the circumstances surround\n ing the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a\n reasonable person have felt he or she was at liberty to terminate the\n interrogation and leave.\u201d Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112\n (footnote omitted). The police and courts must \u201cexamine all of the\n circumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d Stansbury v. Califor\n nia, 511 U. S. 318, 322, including those that \u201cwould have affected\n how a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive\n his or her freedom to leave,\u201d id., at 325. However, the test involves\n no consideration of the particular suspect\u2019s \u201cactual mindset.\u201d Yar\n borough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 667. By limiting analysis to ob\n jective circumstances, the test avoids burdening police with the task\n of anticipating each suspect\u2019s idiosyncrasies and divining how those\n particular traits affect that suspect\u2019s subjective state of mind. Berke\n mer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 430\u2013431. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) In some circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u201cwould have affected how a\n reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould perceive his or\n her freedom to leave.\u201d Stansbury, 511 U. S., at 325. Courts can ac\n count for that reality without doing any damage to the objective na\n ture of the custody analysis. A child\u2019s age is far \u201cmore than a chrono\n logical fact.\u201d Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115. It is a fact\n that \u201cgenerates commonsense conclusions about behavior and percep\n tion,\u201d Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 674, that apply broadly to children as a\n class. Children \u201cgenerally are less mature and responsible than\n adults,\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115; they \u201coften lack the experience,\n perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could\n be detrimental to them,\u201d Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 635; and\n they \u201care more vulnerable or susceptible to . . . outside pressures\u201d\n than adults, Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569. In the specific\n context of police interrogation, events that \u201cwould leave a man cold\n and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a\u201d teen. Haley v. Ohio,\n 332 U. S. 596, 599. The law has historically reflected the same as\n sumption that children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise\n mature judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to under\n stand the world around them.

S., at 115\u2013116, there is no justification for taking a different\n  course here. So long as the child\u2019s age was known to the officer at the\n  time of the interview, or would have been objectively apparent to a\n  reasonable officer, including age as part of the custody analysis re\n  quires officers neither to consider circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to\n  them, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to\u201c \u2018 \u201canticipat[e] the frailties\n  or idiosyncrasies\u201d of the particular suspect being questioned.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Al\n  varado, 541 U. S., at 662. Precisely because childhood yields objec\n  tive conclusions, considering age in the custody analysis does not in\n  volve a determination of how youth affects a particular child\u2019s\n  subjective state of mind. In fact, were the court precluded from tak\n  ing J. D. B.\u2019s youth into account, it would be forced to evaluate the\n  circumstances here through the eyes of a reasonable adult, when\n  some objective circumstances surrounding an interrogation at school\n  are specific to children. These conclusions are not undermined by the\n  Court\u2019s observation in Alvarado that accounting for a juvenile\u2019s age\n  in the Miranda custody analysis \u201ccould be viewed as creating a sub\n  jective inquiry,\u201d 541 U. S., at 668. The Court said nothing about\n  whether such a view would be correct under the law or whether it\n  simply merited deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective\n  Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. So long as the child\u2019s age\n  was known to the officer, or would have been objectively apparent to\n  a reasonable officer, including age in the custody analysis is consis\n  tent with the Miranda test\u2019s objective nature. This does not mean\n  that a child\u2019s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor\n  in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore. Pp. 8\u201314.\n     (c) Additional arguments that the State and its amici offer for ex\n  cluding age from the custody inquiry are unpersuasive. Pp. 14\u201318.\n     (d) On remand, the state courts are to address the question\n  whether J. D.

Arizona, 384 U. S. 436\n(1966). It is beyond dispute that children will often feel\nbound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the\nsame circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no\nreason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to\nthat commonsense reality, we hold that a child\u2019s age prop\nerly informs the Miranda custody analysis.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Petitioner J. D. B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade\nstudent attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel\nHill, North Carolina when he was removed from his class\nroom by a uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed\ndoor conference room, and questioned by police for at least\nhalf an hour.\n  This was the second time that police questioned J. D. B.\nin the span of a week. Five days earlier, two home break\nins occurred, and various items were stolen. Police\nstopped and questioned J. D. B. after he was seen behind a\n2                    J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nresidence in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.\nThat same day, police also spoke to J. D. B.\u2019s grand\nmother\u2014his legal guardian\u2014as well as his aunt.\n   Police later learned that a digital camera matching the\ndescription of one of the stolen items had been found at\nJ. D. B.\u2019s middle school and seen in J. D. B.\u2019s possession.\nInvestigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with\nthe local police force who had been assigned to the case,\nwent to the school to question J. D. B. Upon arrival,\nDiCostanzo informed the uniformed police officer on detail\nto the school (a so-called school resource officer), the assis\ntant principal, and an administrative intern that he was\nthere to question J. D. B. about the break-ins. Although\nDiCostanzo asked the school administrators to verify\nJ. D. B.\u2019s date of birth, address, and parent contact in\nformation from school records, neither the police offi\ncers nor the school administrators contacted J. D. B.\u2019s\ngrandmother.\n   The uniformed officer interrupted J. D. B.\u2019s afternoon\nsocial studies class, removed J. D. B. from the classroom,\nand escorted him to a school conference room.1 There,\nJ. D. B. was met by DiCostanzo, the assistant principal,\nand the administrative intern. The door to the conference\nroom was closed. With the two police officers and the two\nadministrators present, J. D. B. was questioned for the\nnext 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the commencement of\nquestioning, J. D. B. was given neither Miranda warnings\nnor the opportunity to speak to his grandmother. Nor was\nhe informed that he was free to leave the room.\n   Questioning began with small talk\u2014discussion of sports\nand J. D. B.\u2019s family life. DiCostanzo asked, and J. D. B.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although the State suggests that the \u201crecord is unclear as to who\n\nbrought J. D.

B. explained that he had been in\nthe neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he\nwas seeking work mowing lawns. DiCostanzo pressed\nJ. D. B. for additional detail about his efforts to obtain\nwork; asked J. D. B. to explain a prior incident, when one\nof the victims returned home to find J. D. B. behind her\nhouse; and confronted J. D. B. with the stolen camera.\nThe assistant principal urged J. D. B. to \u201cdo the right\nthing,\u201d warning J. D. B. that \u201cthe truth always comes out\nin the end.\u201d App. 99a, 112a.\n   Eventually, J. D. B. asked whether he would \u201cstill be in\ntrouble\u201d if he returned the \u201cstuff.\u201d Ibid. In response,\nDiCostanzo explained that return of the stolen items\nwould be helpful, but \u201cthis thing is going to court\u201d regard\nless. Id., at 112a; ibid. (\u201c[W]hat\u2019s done is done[;] now you\nneed to help yourself by making it right\u201d); see also id., at\n99a. DiCostanzo then warned that he may need to seek a\nsecure custody order if he believed that J. D. B. would\ncontinue to break into other homes. When J. D. B. asked\nwhat a secure custody order was, DiCostanzo explained\nthat \u201cit\u2019s where you get sent to juvenile detention before\ncourt.\u201d Id., at 112a.\n   After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention,\nJ. D. B. confessed that he and a friend were responsible for\nthe break-ins. DiCostanzo only then informed J. D. B.\nthat he could refuse to answer the investigator\u2019s questions\nand that he was free to leave.2 Asked whether he under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The North Carolina Supreme Court noted that the trial court\u2019s fac\ntual findings were \u201cuncontested and therefore . . . binding\u201d on it.

(\u201cImmediately following J. D. B.\u2019s initial\nconfession, Investigator DiCostanzo informed J. D. B. that he did not\nhave to speak with him and that he was free to leave\u201d (internal quota\ntion marks and alterations omitted)). Though less than perfectly\n4                    J. D. B. v.

D. B. wrote a statement, at DiCostanzo\u2019s\nrequest. When the bell rang indicating the end of the\nschoolday, J. D. B. was allowed to leave to catch the bus\nhome.\n                                B\n   Two juvenile petitions were filed against J. D. B., each\nalleging one count of breaking and entering and one count\nof larceny. J. D. B.\u2019s public defender moved to suppress\nhis statements and the evidence derived therefrom, argu\ning that suppression was necessary because J. D. B. had\nbeen \u201cinterrogated by police in a custodial setting without\nbeing afforded Miranda warning[s],\u201d App. 89a, and be\ncause his statements were involuntary under the totality\nof the circumstances test, id., at 142a; see Schneckloth v.\nBustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 226 (1973) (due process pre\ncludes admission of a confession where \u201ca defendant\u2019s will\nwas overborne\u201d by the circumstances of the interrogation).\nAfter a suppression hearing at which DiCostanzo and\nJ. D. B. testified, the trial court denied the motion, decid\ning that J. D. B. was not in custody at the time of the\nschoolhouse interrogation and that his statements were\nvoluntary. As a result, J. D. B. entered a transcript of\nadmission to all four counts, renewing his objection to the\ndenial of his motion to suppress, and the court adjudicated\nJ. D. B. delinquent. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nexplicit, the trial court\u2019s order indicates a finding that J. D. B. initially\n\nconfessed prior to DiCostanzo\u2019s warnings. See App. 99a.\n  Nonetheless, both parties\u2019 submissions to this Court suggest that\nthe warnings came after DiCostanzo raised the possibility of a secure\ncustody order but before J. D. B. confessed for the first time. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 5; Brief for Respondent 5. Because we remand for a\ndetermination whether J. D. B. was in custody under the proper analy\nsis, the state courts remain free to revisit whether the trial court made\na conclusive finding of fact in this respect.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

As we have repeatedly emphasized,\nwhether a suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d is an objective inquiry.\n    \u201cTwo discrete inquiries are essential to the determina\n    tion: first, what were the circumstances surrounding\n    the interrogation; and second, given those circum\n    stances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she\n    was at liberty to terminate the interrogation and\n    leave. Once the scene is set and the players\u2019 lines and\n    actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an ob\n    jective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there\n    a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\n    of the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d Thomp\n    son v.

Rather than demar\ncate a limited set of relevant circumstances, we have\nrequired police officers and courts to \u201cexamine all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d Stansbury,\n511 U.

On the other hand, the \u201csubjective views harbored\nby either the interrogating officers or the person being\nquestioned\u201d are irrelevant. Id., at 323. The test, in other\nwords, involves no consideration of the \u201cactual mindset\u201d of\nthe particular suspect subjected to police questioning.\nAlvarado, 541 U. S., at 667; see also California v. Beheler,\n8                 J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n463 U.

But see Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 441\n(recognizing the \u201coccasiona[l] . . . difficulty\u201d that police and\ncourts nonetheless have in \u201cdeciding exactly when a sus\npect has been taken into custody\u201d). Police must make in\nthe-moment judgments as to when to administer Miranda\nwarnings. By limiting analysis to the objective circum\nstances of the interrogation, and asking how a reasonable\nperson in the suspect\u2019s position would understand his\nfreedom to terminate questioning and leave, the objective\ntest avoids burdening police with the task of anticipating\nthe idiosyncrasies of every individual suspect and divining\nhow those particular traits affect each person\u2019s subjective\nstate of mind. See id., at 430\u2013431 (officers are not re\nquired to \u201cmake guesses\u201d as to circumstances \u201cunknow\nable\u201d to them at the time); Alvarado, 541 U.

We cannot agree. In\nsome circumstances, a child\u2019s age \u201cwould have affected\nhow a reasonable person\u201d in the suspect\u2019s position \u201cwould\nperceive his or her freedom to leave.\u201d Stansbury, 511\nU. S., at 325. That is, a reasonable child subjected to\npolice questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit\nwhen a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think\nit clear that courts can account for that reality without\ndoing any damage to the objective nature of the custody\nanalysis.\n   A child\u2019s age is far \u201cmore than a chronological fact.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Such\nconclusions apply broadly to children as a class.

The law has historically reflected the same as\nsumption that children characteristically lack the capacity\nto exercise mature judgment and possess only an incom\nplete ability to understand the world around them.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng\nland *464\u2013*465 (hereinafter Blackstone) (explaining that\nlimits on children\u2019s legal capacity under the common law\n\u201csecure them from hurting themselves by their own im\nprovident acts\u201d).

In negligence suits, for\ninstance, where liability turns on what an objectively\nreasonable person would do in the circumstances, \u201c[a]ll\nAmerican jurisdictions accept the idea that a person\u2019s\nchildhood is a relevant circumstance\u201d to be considered.\nRestatement (Third) of Torts \u00a710, Comment b, p. 117\n(2005); see also id., Reporters\u2019 Note, pp. 121\u2013122 (collect\ning cases); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7283A, Com\nment b, p. 15 (1963\u20131964) (\u201c[T]here is a wide basis of\ncommunity experience upon which it is possible, as a\npractical matter, to determine what is to be expected of\n[children]\u201d).\n   As this discussion establishes, \u201c[o]ur history is replete\nwith laws and judicial recognition\u201d that children cannot be\nviewed simply as miniature adults. Eddings, 455 U. S., at\n115\u2013116. We see no justification for taking a different\ncourse here. So long as the child\u2019s age was known to the\nofficer at the time of the interview, or would have been\nobjectively apparent to any reasonable officer, including\nage as part of the custody analysis requires officers nei\nther to consider circumstances \u201cunknowable\u201d to them,\nBerkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, nor to \u201canticipat[e] the frail\nties or idiosyncrasies\u201d of the particular suspect whom they\nquestion, Alvarado, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The same \u201cwide basis of community\nexperience\u201d that makes it possible, as an objective matter,\n\u201cto determine what is to be expected\u201d of children in other\ncontexts, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7283A, at 15; see\nsupra, at 10, and n. 6, likewise makes it possible to know\nwhat to expect of children subjected to police questioning.\n   In other words, a child\u2019s age differs from other personal\ncharacteristics that, even when known to police, have no\nobjectively discernible relationship to a reasonable per\nson\u2019s understanding of his freedom of action. Alvarado,\nholds, for instance, that a suspect\u2019s prior interrogation\n12                   J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhistory with law enforcement has no role to play in the\ncustody analysis because such experience could just as\neasily lead a reasonable person to feel free to walk away\nas to feel compelled to stay in place. 541 U.

A child\u2019s age, however, is different. Precisely be\ncause childhood yields objective conclusions like those we\nhave drawn ourselves\u2014among others, that children are\n\u201cmost susceptible to influence,\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115,\nand \u201coutside pressures,\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at 569\u2014\nconsidering age in the custody analysis in no way involves\na determination of how youth \u201csubjectively affect[s] the\nmindset\u201d of any particular child, Brief for Respondent 14.7\n  In fact, in many cases involving juvenile suspects, the\ncustody analysis would be nonsensical absent some con\nsideration of the suspect\u2019s age. This case is a prime exam\nple. Were the court precluded from taking J. D. B.\u2019s youth\ninto account, it would be forced to evaluate the circum\nstances present here through the eyes of a reasonable\nperson of average years. In other words, how would a\nreasonable adult understand his situation, after being\nremoved from a seventh-grade social studies class by a\nuniformed school resource officer; being encouraged by his\nassistant principal to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d; and being\nwarned by a police investigator of the prospect of juvenile\ndetention and separation from his guardian and primary\ncaretaker? To describe such an inquiry is to demonstrate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s protestations, today\u2019s holding neither\n\ninvites consideration of whether a particular suspect is \u201cunusually\nmeek or compliant,\u201d post, at 9 (opinion of ALITO, J.), nor \u201cexpan[ds]\u201d the\nMiranda custody analysis, post, at 8, into a test that requires officers to\nanticipate and account for a suspect\u2019s every personal characteristic, see\npost, at 11\u201312.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nits absurdity. Neither officers nor courts can reasonably\nevaluate the effect of objective circumstances that, by their\nnature, are specific to children without accounting for the\nage of the child subjected to those circumstances.\n   Indeed, although the dissent suggests that concerns\n\u201cregarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to\nminors can be accommodated by considering the unique\ncircumstances present when minors are questioned in\nschool,\u201d post, at 17 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the effect of the\nschoolhouse setting cannot be disentangled from the iden\ntity of the person questioned. A student\u2014whose presence\nat school is compulsory and whose disobedience at school\nis cause for disciplinary action\u2014is in a far different posi\ntion than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to\nchaperone an event, or an adult from the community on\nschool grounds to attend a basketball game. Without\nasking whether the person \u201cquestioned in school\u201d is a\n\u201cminor,\u201d ibid., the coercive effect of the schoolhouse setting\nis unknowable.\n   Our prior decision in Alvarado in no way undermines\nthese conclusions. In that case, we held that a state-court\ndecision that failed to mention a 17-year-old\u2019s age as part\nof the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively un\nreasonable under the deferential standard of review set\nforth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214. Like the North\nCarolina Supreme Court here, see 363 N. C., at 672, 686\nS. E. 2d, at 140, we observed that accounting for a juve\nnile\u2019s age in the Miranda custody analysis \u201ccould be\nviewed as creating a subjective inquiry,\u201d 541 U. S., at 668.\nWe said nothing, however, of whether such a view would\nbe correct under the law. Cf. Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___,\n____, n. 3 (2010) (slip op., at 11, n. 3) (\u201c[W]hether the\n[state court] was right or wrong is not the pertinent ques\ntion under AEDPA\u201d). To the contrary, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s\nconcurring opinion explained that a suspect\u2019s age may\n14                  J. D. B. v.

S., at 669.\n  Reviewing the question de novo today, we hold that so\nlong as the child\u2019s age was known to the officer at the time\nof police questioning, or would have been objectively ap\nparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody\nanalysis is consistent with the objective nature of that\ntest.8 This is not to say that a child\u2019s age will be a deter\nminative, or even a significant, factor in every case. Cf.\nibid. (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (explaining that a state\ncourt decision omitting any mention of the defendant\u2019s age\nwas not unreasonable under AEDPA\u2019s deferential stan\ndard of review where the defendant \u201cwas almost 18 years\nold at the time of his interview\u201d); post, at 17 (suggesting\nthat \u201cteenagers nearing the age of majority\u201d are likely to\nreact to an interrogation as would a \u201ctypical 18-year-old\nin similar circumstances\u201d). It is, however, a reality that\ncourts cannot simply ignore.\n                           III\n  The State and its amici offer numerous reasons that\ncourts must blind themselves to a juvenile defendant\u2019s\nage.

See supra, at\n7; Stansbury v. California, 511 U.

Despite the supposed\nsignificance of this distinction, however, at oral argument\ncounsel for the State suggested without hesitation that at\nleast some undeniably personal characteristics\u2014for in\nstance, whether the individual being questioned is blind\u2014\nare circumstances relevant to the custody analysis. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 41. Thus, the State\u2019s quarrel cannot be\nthat age is a personal characteristic, without more.9\n  The State further argues that age is irrelevant to the\ncustody analysis because it \u201cgo[es] to how a suspect may\ninternalize and perceive the circumstances of an interro\ngation.\u201d Brief for Respondent 12; see also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21 (hereinafter U. S. Brief) (argu\ning that a child\u2019s age has no place in the custody analysis\nbecause it goes to whether a suspect is \u201cparticularly sus\nceptible\u201d to the external circumstances of the interrogation\n(some internal quotation marks omitted)). But the same\ncan be said of every objective circumstance that the State\nagrees is relevant to the custody analysis: Each circum\nstance goes to how a reasonable person would \u201cinternalize\nand perceive\u201d every other. See, e.g., Stansbury, 511 U. S.,\nat 325. Indeed, this is the very reason that we ask\nwhether the objective circumstances \u201cadd up to custody,\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The State\u2019s purported distinction between blindness and age\u2014that\n\ntaking account of a suspect\u2019s youth requires a court \u201cto get into the\nmind\u201d of the child, whereas taking account of a suspect\u2019s blindness does\nnot, Tr. of Oral Arg. 41\u201342\u2014is mistaken. In either case, the question\nbecomes how a reasonable person would understand the circumstances,\neither from the perspective of a blind person or, as here, a 13-year-old\nchild.\n16               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKeohane, 516 U. S., at 113, instead of evaluating the cir\ncumstances one by one.\n  In the same vein, the State and its amici protest that\nthe \u201ceffect of . . . age on [the] perception of custody is\ninternal,\u201d Brief for Respondent 20, or \u201cpsychological,\u201d U. S.\nBrief 21. But the whole point of the custody analysis is to\ndetermine whether, given the circumstances, \u201ca reason\nable person [would] have felt he or she was . . . at liberty\nto terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d Keohane, 516\nU. S., at 112. Because the Miranda custody inquiry turns\non the mindset of a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s\nposition, it cannot be the case that a circumstance is sub\njective simply because it has an \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cpsychologi\ncal\u201d impact on perception. Were that so, there would be no\nobjective circumstances to consider at all.\n  Relying on our statements that the objective custody\ntest is \u201cdesigned to give clear guidance to the police,\u201d\nAlvarado, 541 U. S., at 668, the State next argues that a\nchild\u2019s age must be excluded from the analysis in order to\npreserve clarity. Similarly, the dissent insists that the\nclarity of the custody analysis will be destroyed unless a\n\u201cone-size-fits-all reasonable-person test\u201d applies. Post, at\n13. In reality, however, ignoring a juvenile defendant\u2019s\nage will often make the inquiry more artificial, see supra,\nat 12\u201313, and thus only add confusion. And in any event,\na child\u2019s age, when known or apparent, is hardly an ob\nscure factor to assess. Though the State and the dissent\nworry about gradations among children of different ages,\nthat concern cannot justify ignoring a child\u2019s age alto\ngether. Just as police officers are competent to account for\nother objective circumstances that are a matter of degree\nsuch as the length of questioning or the number of officers\npresent, so too are they competent to evaluate the effect of\nrelative age. Indeed, they are competent to do so even\nthough an interrogation room lacks the \u201creflective atmos\nphere of a [jury] deliberation room,\u201d post, at 15.

In short, officers and\njudges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of devel\nopmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or\nexpertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for\na child\u2019s age. They simply need the common sense to\nknow that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is\nan adult.\n   There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw with\nthe State\u2019s plea for clarity and the dissent\u2019s singular focus\non simplifying the analysis: Not once have we excluded\nfrom the custody analysis a circumstance that we deter\nmined was relevant and objective, simply to make the\nfault line between custodial and noncustodial \u201cbrighter.\u201d\nIndeed, were the guiding concern clarity and nothing else,\nthe custody test would presumably ask only whether the\nsuspect had been placed under formal arrest. Berkemer,\n468 U. S., at 441; see ibid. (acknowledging the \u201cocca\nsiona[l] . . . difficulty\u201d police officers confront in determin\ning when a suspect has been taken into custody). But\nwe have rejected that \u201cmore easily administered line,\u201d\nrecognizing that it would simply \u201cenable the police to\ncircumvent the constraints on custodial interrogations\nestablished by Miranda.\u201d Ibid.; see also ibid., n. 33.10\n   Finally, the State and the dissent suggest that excluding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Contrary to the dissent\u2019s intimation, see post, at 8, Miranda does\n\nnot answer the question whether a child\u2019s age is an objective circum\nstance relevant to the custody analysis. Miranda simply holds that\nwarnings must be given once a suspect is in custody, without \u201cpaus[ing]\nto inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his\nrights without a warning being given.\u201d 384 U. S., at 468; see also id., at\n468\u2013469 (\u201cAssessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed,\nbased on information as to age, education, intelligence, or prior contact\nwith authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a\nclearcut fact\u201d (footnote omitted)). That conclusion says nothing about\nwhether age properly informs whether a child is in custody in the first\nplace.\n18               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nage from the custody analysis comes at no cost to juve\nniles\u2019 constitutional rights because the due process volun\ntariness test independently accounts for a child\u2019s youth.\nTo be sure, that test permits consideration of a child\u2019s age,\nand it erects its own barrier to admission of a defendant\u2019s\ninculpatory statements at trial. See Gallegos, 370 U. S., at\n53\u201355; Haley, 332 U. S., at 599\u2013601; see also post, at 17\u2013\n18 (\u201c[C]ourts should be instructed to take particular care\nto ensure that [young children\u2019s] incriminating statements\nwere not obtained involuntarily\u201d). But Miranda\u2019s proce\ndural safeguards exist precisely because the voluntariness\ntest is an inadequate barrier when custodial interrogation\nis at stake. See 384 U. S., at 458 (\u201cUnless adequate pro\ntective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion\ninherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained\nfrom the defendant can truly be the product of his free\nchoice\u201d); Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 442 (\u201c[R]eliance on the\ntraditional totality-of-the-circumstances test raise[s] a risk\nof overlooking an involuntary custodial confession\u201d); see\nalso supra, at 5\u20136. To hold, as the State requests, that a\nchild\u2019s age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been\ntaken into custody\u2014and thus to ignore the very real dif\nferences between children and adults\u2014would be to deny\nchildren the full scope of the procedural safeguards that\nMiranda guarantees to adults.\n                        *     *    *\n  The question remains whether J.

It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the\nmain justifications for the Miranda1 rule: the perceived\nneed for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases.\nAnd today\u2019s holding is not needed to protect the constitu\u00ad\ntional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.\n   Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime places a high value on\nclarity and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly fact\u00ad\nspecific constitutional rule against the admission of in-\nvoluntary confessions, the Miranda Court set down rigid\nstandards that often require courts to ignore personal\ncharacteristics that may be highly relevant to a particular\nsuspect\u2019s actual susceptibility to police pressure. This\nrigidity, however, has brought with it one of Miranda\u2019s\nprincipal strengths\u2014\u201cthe ease and clarity of its applica\u00ad\ntion\u201d by law enforcement officials and courts. See Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425\u2013426 (1986). A key contribu\u00ad\ntor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been\nMiranda\u2019s objective reasonable-person test for determin\u00ad\ning custody.\n   Miranda\u2019s custody requirement is based on the proposi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 See   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n2                J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntion that the risk of unconstitutional coercion is height\u00ad\nened when a suspect is placed under formal arrest or is\nsubjected to some functionally equivalent limitation on\nfreedom of movement. When this custodial threshold is\nreached, Miranda warnings must precede police question\u00ad\ning. But in the interest of simplicity, the custody analysis\nconsiders only whether, under the circumstances, a hypo\u00ad\nthetical reasonable person would consider himself to be\nconfined.\n   Many suspects, of course, will differ from this hypotheti\u00ad\ncal reasonable person. Some, including those who have\nbeen hardened by past interrogations, may have no need\nfor Miranda warnings at all. And for other suspects\u2014\nthose who are unusually sensitive to the pressures of\npolice questioning\u2014Miranda warnings may come too late\nto be of any use. That is a necessary consequence of\nMiranda\u2019s rigid standards, but it does not mean that the\nconstitutional rights of these especially sensitive suspects\nare left unprotected. A vulnerable defendant can still turn\nto the constitutional rule against actual coercion and\ncontend that that his confession was extracted against his\nwill.\n   Today\u2019s decision shifts the Miranda custody determina\u00ad\ntion from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an\ninquiry that must account for at least one individualized\ncharacteristic\u2014age\u2014that is thought to correlate with sus\u00ad\nceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no\nway the only personal characteristic that may correlate\nwith pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced\nto choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It may\nchoose to limit today\u2019s decision by arbitrarily distinguish\u00ad\ning a suspect\u2019s age from other personal characteristics\u2014\nsuch as intelligence, education, occupation, or prior ex\u00ad\nperience with law enforcement\u2014that may also correlate\nwith susceptibility to coercive pressures. Or, if the Court\nis unwilling to draw these arbitrary lines, it will be forced\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto effect a fundamental transformation of the Miranda\ncustody test\u2014from a clear, easily applied prophylactic\nrule into a highly fact-intensive standard resembling the\nvoluntariness test that the Miranda Court found to be\nunsatisfactory.\n   For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down\nthis road. First, many minors subjected to police interro\u00ad\ngation are near the age of majority, and for these suspects\nthe one-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule may not be a\nbad fit. Second, many of the difficulties in applying the\nMiranda custody rule to minors arise because of the\nunique circumstances present when the police conduct\ninterrogations at school. The Miranda custody rule has\nalways taken into account the setting in which question\u00ad\ning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in such\ncases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases\nlike the one now before us, where the suspect is especially\nyoung, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness\nstandard can take special care to ensure that incriminat\u00ad\ning statements were not obtained through coercion.\n   Safeguarding the constitutional rights of minors does\nnot require the extreme makeover of Miranda that today\u2019s\ndecision may portend.\n                             I\n  In the days before Miranda, this Court\u2019s sole metric for\nevaluating the admissibility of confessions was a volun\u00ad\ntariness standard rooted in both the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nSelf-Incrimination Clause and the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States,\n168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897) (Self-Incrimination Clause);\nBrown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936) (due process).\nThe question in these voluntariness cases was whether the\nparticular \u201cdefendant\u2019s will\u201d had been \u201coverborne.\u201d\nLynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 (1963). Courts took\ninto account both \u201cthe details of the interrogation\u201d and\n4                 J. D. B. v.

S. 156, 185 (1953).\n   All manner of individualized, personal characteristics\nwere relevant in this voluntariness inquiry. Among the\nmost frequently mentioned factors were the defendant\u2019s\neducation, physical condition, intelligence, and mental\nhealth. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 693 (1993);\nsee Clewis v. Texas, 386 U. S. 707, 712 (1967) (\u201conly a\nfifth-grade education\u201d); Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U.

S. 191, 193, 196, 198 (1957) (\u201clow\nmentality, if not mentally ill\u201d). The suspect\u2019s age also\nreceived prominent attention in several cases, e.g.,\nGallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 54 (1962), especially\nwhen the suspect was a \u201cmere child.\u201d Haley v. Ohio, 332\nU. S. 596, 599 (1948) (plurality opinion). The weight\nassigned to any one consideration varied from case to case.\nBut all of these factors, along with anything else that\nmight have affected the \u201cindividual\u2019s . . . capacity for\neffective choice,\u201d were relevant in determining whether\nthe confession was coerced or compelled. See Miranda\nv. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506\u2013507 (1966) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting).\n   The all-encompassing nature of the voluntariness in\u00ad\nquiry had its benefits. It allowed courts to accommodate a\n\u201ccomplex of values,\u201d Schneckloth, supra, at 223, 224, and\nto make a careful, highly individualized determination as\nto whether the police had wrung \u201ca confession out of [the]\naccused against his will.\u201d Blackburn v.

Shatzer, 559 U. S. __, __\n(2010) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Miranda, 384 U.

Its requirements\nare no doubt \u201crigid,\u201d see Fare v. Michael C., 439 U. S.\n1310, 1314 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers), and they\noften require courts to suppress \u201ctrustworthy and highly\nprobative\u201d statements that may be perfectly \u201cvoluntary\nunder [a] traditional Fifth Amendment analysis.\u201d Fare v.\nMichael C., 442 U.

S. 649, 658 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted),\nand an administrable standard for the courts.

Instead, the Court focused\nonly on the external circumstances of the interrogation\nitself. The opinion concluded that a typical \u201ctraffic stop\u201d is\nakin to a \u201cTerry stop\u201d7 and does not qualify as the equiva\u00ad\nlent of \u201cformal arrest.\u201d Id., at 439.\n   California v. Beheler, supra, is another useful example.\nThere, the circumstances of the interrogation were \u201cre\u00ad\nmarkably similar\u201d to the facts of the Court\u2019s earlier deci\u00ad\nsion in Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492 (1977) (per\ncuriam)\u2014the suspect was \u201cnot placed under arrest,\u201d he\n\u201cvoluntarily [came] to the police station,\u201d and he was\n\u201callowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief inter\u00ad\nview.\u201d 463 U.

A California court in\nBeheler had nonetheless distinguished Mathiason because\nthe police knew that Beheler \u201chad been drinking earlier in\nthe day\u201d and was \u201cemotionally distraught.\u201d 463 U. S., at\n1124\u20131125. In a summary reversal, this Court explained\nthat the fact \u201c[t]hat the police knew more\u201d personal infor\u00ad\nmation about Beheler than they did about Mathiason was\n\u201cirrelevant.\u201d Id., at 1125. Neither one of them was in\ncustody under the objective reasonable-person standard.\nIbid.; see also Alvarado, supra, at 668, 669 (experience\nwith law enforcement irrelevant to Miranda custody\nanalysis \u201cas a de novo matter\u201d).8\n   The glaring absence of reliance on personal characteris\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Terry v.

Surely this is incorrect. The\nvery act of adopting a reasonable-person test necessarily excludes all\nsorts of \u201crelevant and objective\u201d circumstances\u2014for example, all the\nobjective circumstances of a suspect\u2019s life history\u2014that might otherwise\nbear on a custody determination.\n8                J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntics in these and other custody cases should come as no\nsurprise. To account for such individualized considera\u00ad\ntions would be to contradict Miranda\u2019s central premise.\nThe Miranda Court\u2019s decision to adopt its inflexible pro\u00ad\nphylactic requirements was expressly based on the notion\nthat \u201c[a]ssessments of the knowledge the defendant pos\u00ad\nsessed, based on information as to his age, education,\nintelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be\nmore than speculation.\u201d 384 U. S., at 468\u2013469.\n                               II\n   In light of this established practice, there is no denying\nthat, by incorporating age into its analysis, the Court is\nembarking on a new expansion of the established custody\nstandard. And since Miranda is this Court\u2019s rule, \u201cnot a\nconstitutional command,\u201d it is up to the Court \u201cto justify\nits expansion.\u201d Cf. Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688\n(1988) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). This the Court fails to\ndo.\n   In its present form, Miranda\u2019s prophylactic regime\nalready imposes \u201chigh cost[s]\u201d by requiring suppression of\nconfessions that are often \u201chighly probative\u201d and \u201cvolun\u00ad\ntary\u201d by any traditional standard. Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298, 312 (1985); see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 444\n(under Miranda \u201cstatements which may be by no means\ninvoluntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his\n\u2018rights,\u2019 may nonetheless be excluded and a guilty defen\u00ad\ndant go free as a result\u201d). Nonetheless, a \u201ccore virtue\u201d of\nMiranda has been the clarity and precision of its guidance\nto \u201cpolice and courts.\u201d Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.

S., at 658 (citing cases). Given this prac\u00ad\ntice, there should be a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d against the\nCourt\u2019s new departure from the established custody test.\nSee United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 640 (2004)\n(plurality opinion). In my judgment, that presumption\ncannot be overcome here.\n                              A\n   The Court\u2019s rationale for importing age into the custody\nstandard is that minors tend to lack adults\u2019 \u201ccapacity to\nexercise mature judgment\u201d and that failing to account for\nthat \u201creality\u201d will leave some minors unprotected under\nMiranda in situations where they perceive themselves to\nbe confined. See ante, at 10, 8. I do not dispute that many\nsuspects who are under 18 will be more susceptible to\npolice pressure than the average adult. As the Court\nnotes, our pre-Miranda cases were particularly attuned to\nthis \u201creality\u201d in applying the constitutional requirement of\nvoluntariness in fact. Ante, at 9 (relying on Haley, 332\nU. S., at 599 (plurality opinion), and Gallegos, 370 U. S.,\nat 54). It is no less a \u201creality,\u201d however, that many per\u00ad\nsons over the age of 18 are also more susceptible to police\npressure than the hypothetical reasonable person. See\nPayne, 356 U. S., at 567 (fact that defendant was a \u201cmen\u00ad\ntally dull 19-year-old youth\u201d relevant in voluntariness\ninquiry). Yet the Miranda custody standard has never\naccounted for the personal characteristics of these or any\nother individual defendants.\n   Indeed, it has always been the case under Miranda that\nthe unusually meek or compliant are subject to the same\nfixed rules, including the same custody requirement, as\nthose who are unusually resistant to police pressure.\n10               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nBerkemer, 468 U. S., at 442, and n. 35 (\u201c[O]nly relevant\ninquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position\nwould have understood his situation\u201d). Miranda\u2019s rigid\nstandards are both overinclusive and underinclusive.\nThey are overinclusive to the extent that they provide a\nwindfall to the most hardened and savvy of suspects, who\noften have no need for Miranda\u2019s protections. Compare\nMiranda, supra, at 471\u2013472 (\u201c[N]o amount of circumstan\u00ad\ntial evidence that the person may have been aware of \u201d his\nrights can overcome Miranda\u2019s requirements), with Orozco\nv. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 329 (1969) (White, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cWhere the defendant himself [w]as a lawyer, policeman,\nprofessional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of\nwhat his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that\nhis answer to every question asked him is compelled\nunless he is advised of those rights with which he is al\u00ad\nready intimately familiar\u201d). And Miranda\u2019s requirements\nare underinclusive to the extent that they fail to account\nfor \u201cfrailties,\u201d \u201cidiosyncrasies,\u201d and other individualized\nconsiderations that might cause a person to bend more\neasily during a confrontation with the police. See Alva\nrado, 541 U. S., at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nMembers of this Court have seen this rigidity as a major\nweakness in Miranda\u2019s \u201ccode of rules for confessions.\u201d See\n384 U. S., at 504 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Fare, 439 U. S.,\nat 1314 (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (\u201c[T]he rigidity of\n[Miranda\u2019s] prophylactic rules was a principal weakness\nin the view of dissenters and critics outside the Court\u201d).\nBut if it is, then the weakness is an inescapable conse\u00ad\nquence of the Miranda Court\u2019s decision to supplement the\nmore holistic voluntariness requirement with a one-size\u00ad\nfits-all prophylactic rule.\n   That is undoubtedly why this Court\u2019s Miranda cases\nhave never before mentioned \u201cthe suspect\u2019s age\u201d or any\nother individualized consideration in applying the custody\nstandard. See Alvarado, supra, at 666. And unless the\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Q. of 75 and is in a special-education class. Cf. In re\nJ. D. B., 363 N. C. 664, 666, 686 S. E. 2d 135, 136\u2013137\n(2009). Are those facts more or less important than the\nstudent\u2019s age in determining whether he or she \u201cfelt . . . at\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave\u201d? See\nThompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). An I. Q.\nscore, like age, is more than just a number. Ante, at 8\n(\u201c[A]ge is far \u2018more than a chronological fact\u2019 \u201d). And an\nindividual\u2019s intelligence can also yield \u201cconclusions\u201d simi\u00ad\nlar to those \u201cwe have drawn ourselves\u201d in cases far afield\nof Miranda. Ante, at 12. Compare ibid. (relying on Ed\ndings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005)), with Smith v. Texas, 543\nU. S. 37, 44\u201345 (2004) (per curiam).\n   How about the suspect\u2019s cultural background? Suppose\nthe police learn (or should have learned, see ante, at 11)\nthat a suspect they wish to question is a recent immigrant\nfrom a country in which dire consequences often befall any\nperson who dares to attempt to cut short any meeting with\nthe police.9 Is this really less relevant than the fact that a\nsuspect is a month or so away from his 18th birthday?\n   The defendant\u2019s education is another personal charac\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Cf.United States v. Chalan, 812 F. 2d 1302, 1307 (CA10 1987) (re\u00ad\njecting claim that Native American suspect was \u201cin custody\u201d for\nMiranda purposes because, by custom, obedience to tribal authorities\nwas \u201cexpected of all tribal members\u201d).\n12                J.

Under today\u2019s decision, why should police officers\nand courts \u201cblind themselves,\u201d ante, at 1, to the fact that a\nsuspect has \u201conly a fifth-grade education\u201d? See Clewis,\n386 U. S., at 712 (voluntariness case). Alternatively, what\nif the police know or should know that the suspect is \u201ca\ncollege-educated man with law school training\u201d? See\nCrooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 440 (1958), overruled\nby Miranda, supra, at 479, and n. 48. How are these\nindividual considerations meaningfully different from age\nin their \u201crelationship to a reasonable person\u2019s understand\u00ad\ning of his freedom of action\u201d? Ante, at 11. The Court\nproclaims that \u201c[a] child\u2019s age . . . is different,\u201d ante, at 12,\nbut the basis for this ipse dixit is dubious.\n   I have little doubt that today\u2019s decision will soon be cited\nby defendants\u2014and perhaps by prosecutors as well\u2014for\nthe proposition that all manner of other individual charac\u00ad\nteristics should be treated like age and taken into account\nin the Miranda custody calculus. Indeed, there are al\u00ad\nready lower court decisions that take this approach. See\nUnited States v.

It may choose\nto distinguish today\u2019s decision and adhere to the arbitrary\nproclamation that \u201cage . . . is different.\u201d Ante, at 12. Or it\nmay choose to extend today\u2019s holding and, in doing so,\nfurther undermine the very rationale for the Miranda\nregime.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Moran, 475 U. S., at 425; see Fare, 442 U. S., at\n718 (noting that the clarity of Miranda\u2019s requirements\n\u201chas been thought to outweigh the burdens that the deci\u00ad\nsion . . . imposes\u201d). However, even today\u2019s more limited\ndeparture from Miranda\u2019s one-size-fits-all reasonable\u00ad\nperson test will produce the very consequences that\nprompted the Miranda Court to abandon exclusive reli\u00ad\nance on the voluntariness test in the first place: The\nCourt\u2019s test will be hard for the police to follow, and it will\nbe hard for judges to apply. See Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 444 (2000).\n   The Court holds that age must be taken into account\nwhen it \u201cwas known to the officer at the time of the inter\u00ad\nview,\u201d or when it \u201cwould have been objectively apparent\u201d\nto a reasonable officer. Ante, at 11. The first half of this\ntest overturns the rule that the \u201cinitial determination of\ncustody\u201d does not depend on the \u201csubjective views har\u00ad\nbored by . . . interrogating officers.\u201d Stansbury, 511 U. S.,\nat 323. The second half will generate time-consuming\nsatellite litigation over a reasonable officer\u2019s perceptions.\nWhen, as here, the interrogation takes place in school, the\ninquiry may be relatively simple. But not all police ques\u00ad\ntioning of minors takes place in schools. In many cases,\ncourts will presumably have to make findings as to\nwhether a particular suspect had a sufficiently youthful\nlook to alert a reasonable officer to the possibility that the\nsuspect was under 18, or whether a reasonable officer\nwould have recognized that a suspect\u2019s I. D. was a fake.\nThe inquiry will be both \u201ctime-consuming and disruptive\u201d\nfor the police and the courts. See Berkemer, 468 U. S., at\n432 (refusing to modify the custody test based on similar\nconsiderations). It will also be made all the more compli\u00ad\ncated by the fact that a suspect\u2019s dress and manner will\n14               J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\noften be different when the issue is litigated in court than\nit was at the time of the interrogation.\n   Even after courts clear this initial hurdle, further prob\u00ad\nlems will likely emerge as judges attempt to put them\u00ad\nselves in the shoes of the average 16-year-old, or 15-year\u00ad\nold, or 13-year-old, as the case may be. Consider, for\nexample, a 60-year-old judge attempting to make a cus\u00ad\ntody determination through the eyes of a hypothetical,\naverage 15-year-old. Forty-five years of personal experi\u00ad\nence and societal change separate this judge from the days\nwhen he or she was 15 years old. And this judge may or\nmay not have been an average 15-year-old. The Court\u2019s\nanswer to these difficulties is to state that \u201cno imaginative\npowers, knowledge of developmental psychology, [or]\ntraining in cognitive science\u201d will be necessary. Ante, at\n17. Judges \u201csimply need the common sense,\u201d the Court\nassures, \u201cto know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old\nand neither is an adult.\u201d Ante, at 17. It is obvious, how\u00ad\never, that application of the Court\u2019s new rule demands\nmuch more than this.\n   Take a fairly typical case in which today\u2019s holding may\nmake a difference. A 16\u00bd-year-old moves to suppress\nincriminating statements made prior to the administra\u00ad\ntion of Miranda warnings. The circumstances are such\nthat, if the defendant were at least 18, the court would not\nfind that he or she was in custody, but the defendant\nargues that a reasonable 16\u00bd-year-old would view the\nsituation differently. The judge will not have the luxury of\nmerely saying: \u201cIt is common sense that a 16\u00bd-year-old is\nnot an 18-year-old. Motion granted.\u201d Rather, the judge\nwill be required to determine whether the differences\nbetween a typical 16\u00bd-year-old and a typical 18-year-old\nwith respect to susceptibility to the pressures of interroga\u00ad\ntion are sufficient to change the outcome of the custody\ndetermination.

In particular, the Court\nrelies on the fact that the age of a defendant is a relevant\nfactor under the reasonable-person standard applicable in\nnegligence suits. Ante, at 11 (citing Restatement (Third)\nof Torts \u00a710, Comment b, p. 117 (2005)). But negligence is\ngenerally a question for the jury, the members of which\ncan draw on their varied experiences with persons of\ndifferent ages. It also involves a post hoc determination,\nin the reflective atmosphere of a deliberation room, about\nwhether the defendant conformed to a standard of care.\nThe Miranda custody determination, by contrast, must be\nmade in the first instance by police officers in the course of\nan investigation that may require quick decisionmaking.\nSee Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658 (noting \u201cthe importance\u201d\nunder Miranda of providing \u201ca workable rule \u2018to guide\npolice officers, who have only limited time and expertise to\nreflect on and balance the social and individual interests\ninvolved in the specific circumstances they confront\u2019 \u201d);\nAlvarado, 541 U.

In addition, these state statutes generally\ncreate clear, workable rules to guide police conduct. See\nBrief for Petitioner 16\u201317 (citing statutes that require or\npermit parents to be present during custodial interroga\u00ad\ntion of a minor, that require minors to be advised of a\nstatutory right to communicate with a parent or guardian,\nand that require parental consent to custodial interroga\u00ad\ntion). Today\u2019s decision, by contrast, injects a new, compli\u00ad\ncating factor into what had been a clear, easily applied\nprophylactic rule. See Alvarado, supra, at 668\u2013669.10\n                             III\n  The Court\u2019s decision greatly diminishes the clarity and\nadministrability that have long been recognized as \u201cprin\u00ad\ncipal advantages\u201d of Miranda\u2019s prophylactic requirements.\nSee, e.g., Moran, 475 U. S., at 425. But what is worse, the\nCourt takes this step unnecessarily, as there are other,\nless disruptive tools available to ensure that minors are\nnot coerced into confessing.\n  As an initial matter, the difficulties that the Court\u2019s\nstandard introduces will likely yield little added protection\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court also relies on North Carolina\u2019s concession at oral argu\u00ad\nment that a court could take into account a suspect\u2019s blindness as a\nfactor relevant to the Miranda custody determination. Ante, at 15, and\nn. 9. This is a far-fetched hypothetical, and neither the parties nor\ntheir amici cite any case in which such a problem has actually arisen.\nPresumably such a case would involve a situation in which a blind\ndefendant was given \u201ca typed document advising him that he [was] free\nto leave.\u201d See Brief for Juvenile Law Center as Amicus Curiae 23. In\nsuch a case, furnishing this advice in a form calculated to be unintelli\u00ad\ngible to the suspect would be tantamount to failing to provide the\nadvice at all. And advice by the police that a suspect is or is not free to\nleave at will has always been regarded as a circumstance regarding the\nconditions of the interrogation that must be taken into account in\nmaking the Miranda custody determination.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfor most juvenile defendants. Most juveniles who are\nsubjected to police interrogation are teenagers nearing the\nage of majority.11 These defendants\u2019 reactions to police\npressure are unlikely to be much different from the reac\u00ad\ntion of a typical 18-year-old in similar circumstances. A\none-size-fits-all Miranda custody rule thus provides a\nroughly reasonable fit for these defendants.\n   In addition, many of the concerns that petitioner raises\nregarding the application of the Miranda custody rule to\nminors can be accommodated by considering the unique\ncircumstances present when minors are questioned in\nschool. See Brief for Petitioner 10\u201311 (reciting at length\nthe factors petitioner believes to be relevant to the custody\ndetermination here, including the fact that petitioner was\nremoved from class by a police officer, that the interview\ntook place in a school conference room, and that a uni\u00ad\nformed officer and a vice principal were present). The\nMiranda custody rule has always taken into account the\nsetting in which questioning occurs, restrictions on a\nsuspect\u2019s freedom of movement, and the presence of police\nofficers or other authority figures. See Alvarado, supra, at\n665; Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 14). It can do so here as well.12\n   Finally, in cases like the one now before us, where the\nsuspect is much younger than the typical juvenile defen\u00ad\ndant, courts should be instructed to take particular care to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 See  Dept of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2008\nCrime in the United States (Sept. 2009), online at http://www2.fbi.gov/\nucr/cius2008/data/table_38.html (all Internet materials as visited June\n8, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (indicating that less\nthan 30% of juvenile arrests in the United States are of suspects who\nare under 15).\n   12 The Court thinks it would be \u201cabsur[d]\u201d to consider the school set\u00ad\n\nting without accounting for age, ante, at 12, but the real absurdity is for\nthe Court to require police officers to get inside the head of a reasonable\nminor while making the quick, on-the-spot determinations that\nMiranda demands.\n18                  J. D. B. v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nensure that incriminating statements were not obtained\ninvoluntarily. The voluntariness inquiry is flexible and\naccommodating by nature, see Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at\n224, and the Court\u2019s precedents already make clear that\n\u201cspecial care\u201d must be exercised in applying the voluntari\u00ad\nness test where the confession of a \u201cmere child\u201d is at issue.\nHaley, 332 U. S., at 599 (plurality opinion). If Miranda\u2019s\nrigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the\nunique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigor\u00ad\nously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to\nensure that the rights of minors are protected. There is no\nneed to run Miranda off the rails.\n                         *     *     *\n    The Court rests its decision to inject personal character\u00ad\nistics into the Miranda custody inquiry on the principle\nthat judges applying Miranda cannot \u201cblind themselves to\n. . . commonsense reality.\u201d Ante, at 1, 8, 10\u201311, 14. But\nthe Court\u2019s shift is fundamentally at odds with the clear\nprophylactic rules that Miranda has long enforced.\nMiranda frequently requires judges to blind themselves to\nthe reality that many un-Mirandized custodial confessions\nare \u201cby no means involuntary\u201d or coerced. Dickerson, 530\nU. S., at 444. It also requires police to provide a rote\nrecitation of Miranda warnings that many suspects al\u00ad\nready know and could likely recite from memory.13 Under\ntoday\u2019s new, \u201creality\u201d-based approach to the doctrine,\nperhaps these and other principles of our Miranda juris\u00ad\nprudence will, like the custody standard, now be ripe for\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 Surveys have shown that \u201c[l]arge majorities\u201d of the public are aware\n\nthat \u201cindividuals arrested for a crime\u201d have a right to \u201cremai[n] silent\n(81%),\u201d a right to \u201ca lawyer (95%),\u201d and a right to have a lawyer \u201cap\u00ad\npointed\u201d if the arrestee \u201ccannot afford one (88%).\u201d See Belden, Russonello\n& Stewart, Developing a National Message for Indigent Defense: Analy\u00ad\nsis of National Survey 4 (Oct. 2001), online at http://www.nlada.org/\nDMS/Documents/1211996548.53/Polling%20results%20report.pdf.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
