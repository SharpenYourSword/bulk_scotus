UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u201311328.       Argued March 21, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nWhile conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Wil\n lie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name. After handcuffing\n Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and\n found Davis\u2019s revolver. Davis was then indicted on charges of being a\n felon in possession of a firearm. In a suppression motion, Davis ac\n knowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing\n Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting New York v. Belton, 453\n U. S. 454, but Davis raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to pre\n serve the issue on appeal. The District Court denied the motion, and\n Davis was convicted. While his appeal was pending, this Court an\n nounced, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing\n automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants. The\n Eleventh Circuit held, under Gant, that the vehicle search at issue\n violated Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, but the court declined to\n suppress the revolver and affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction.\nHeld: Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding\n appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule. Pp. 6\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) The exclusionary rule\u2019s sole purpose is to deter future Fourth\n Amendment violations, e.g., Herring v. United States, 555 U. S. 135,\n 141, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is\n \u201cthought most efficaciously served,\u201d United States v. Calandra, 414\n U. S. 338, 348. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence bene\n fits of suppression must outweigh the rule\u2019s heavy costs. Under a\n line of cases beginning with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, the\n result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the \u201cflagrancy of the po\n lice misconduct\u201d at issue. Id., at 909, 911. When the police exhibit\n \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201creckless,\u201d or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d disregard for Fourth\n2                       DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Amendment rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the\n    costs. Herring, supra, at 144. But when the police act with an objec\n    tively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or\n    when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the de\n    terrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot \u201cpay\n    its way.\u201d See Leon, supra, at 909, 919, 908, n. 6; Herring, supra, at\n    137. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitu\n    tional under Gant, Davis concedes that the officers\u2019 conduct was in\n    strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable\n    in any way. Under this Court\u2019s exclusionary-rule precedents, the ac\n    knowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim. Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considera\n    tions should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this\n    case. Pp. 11\u201319.\n          (1) The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to\n    enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue,\n    not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive. This argument erroneously\n    conflates retroactivity with remedy. Because Davis\u2019s conviction had\n    not become final when Gant was announced, Gant applies retroac\n    tively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as\n    a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314,\n    326, 328. But retroactive application of a new rule does not deter\n    mine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain. See\n    Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S. 79, 83, 84. The remedy of exclusion does\n    not automatically follow from a Fourth Amendment violation, see\n    Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13, and applies only where its \u201cpurpose\n    is effectively advanced,\u201d Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347. The ap\n    plication of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes Griffith\n    nor denies retroactive effect to Gant. Pp. 12\u201316.\n          (2) Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying\n    the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding\n    precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law by\n    discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent. Facili\n    tating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consid\n    eration in this Court\u2019s exclusionary-rule cases. In any event, apply\n    ing the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this\n    Court\u2019s review of Fourth Amendment precedents. If precedent from a\n    federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particu\n    lar type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the\n    question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to\n    litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those\n    cases. Davis\u2019s claim that this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

In many\n  cases, defendants will test this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment prece\n  dents by arguing that they are distinguishable. And at most, this ar\n  gument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a\n  petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Court\u2019s prece\n  dents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.

UNITED \n\n                   STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 16, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fourth Amendment protects the right to be free\nfrom \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d but it is silent\nabout how this right is to be enforced. To supplement\nthe bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a\ndeterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from intro\nducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment\nviolation. The question here is whether to apply this\nsanction when the police conduct a search in compliance\nwith binding precedent that is later overruled. Because\nsuppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct\nin these circumstances, and because it would come at a\nhigh cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold\nthat searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance\non binding appellate precedent are not subject to the\nexclusionary rule.\n                          I\n  The question presented arises in this case as a result\nof a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on\nsearches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent\noccupants.\n2                    DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n   Under this Court\u2019s decision in Chimel v. California, 395\nU. S. 752 (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest\nmay conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person\nand the area \u201cwithin his immediate control.\u201d Id., at 763\n(internal quotation marks omitted). This rule \u201cmay be\nstated clearly enough,\u201d but in the early going after Chimel\nit proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that in\nvolved searches \u201cinside [of] automobile[s] after the arrest\nees [we]re no longer in [them].\u201d See New York v. Belton,\n453 U. S. 454, 458\u2013459 (1981). A number of courts up\nheld the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were\n\u201csubstantially contemporaneous\u201d with occupants\u2019 arrests.1\nOther courts disapproved of automobile searches incident\nto arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the\narrestee might gain access to the vehicle and \u201cdestroy\nevidence or grab a weapon.\u201d2 In New York v. Belton, this\nCourt granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See id., at\n459\u2013460.\n   In Belton, a police officer conducting a traffic stop law\nfully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the\narrestees to line up, un-handcuffed, along the side of the\nthruway. Id., at 456; see Brief for Petitioner in New York\nv. Belton, O. T. 1980, No. 80\u2013328, p. 3. The officer then\nsearched the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and found\ncocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat. Belton,\n453 U. S., at 456. This Court upheld the search as rea\nsonable incident to the occupants\u2019 arrests.

Numerous courts read\nthe decision to authorize automobile searches incident to\narrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the\narrestee in any particular case was within reaching dis\ntance of the vehicle at the time of the search. See Thorn\nton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 628 (2004) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Even after the\narrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been\nsubdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that\nBelton still authorized a substantially contemporaneous\nsearch of the automobile\u2019s passenger compartment.3\n   Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of\nBelton. In State v. Gant, 216 Ariz. 1, 162 P. 3d 640 (2007),\nthe Arizona Supreme Court considered an automobile\nsearch conducted after the vehicle\u2019s occupant had been\narrested, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car. The court\ndistinguished Belton as a case in which \u201cfour unsecured\u201d\narrestees \u201cpresented an immediate risk of loss of evidence\nand an obvious threat to [a] lone officer\u2019s safety.\u201d 216\nAriz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643. The court held that where no\nsuch \u201cexigencies exis[t]\u201d\u2014where the arrestee has been\nsubdued and the scene secured\u2014the rule of Belton does\nnot apply. 216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P. 3d, at 643.\n   This Court granted certiorari in Gant, see 552 U. S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See,e.g., United States v. Dorsey, 418 F. 3d 1038, 1041, 1043\u20131044\n(CA9 2005) (upholding automobile search conducted after the officer\nhad \u201chandcuffed [the arrestee] and put him in the back of [the] patrol\ncar\u201d); United States v. Barnes, 374 F. 3d 601, 604 (CA8 2004) (same).\n4                  DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1230 (2008), and affirmed in a 5-to-4 decision. Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009). Four of the Justices in the\nmajority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that\nBelton\u2019s holding applies only where \u201cthe arrestee is unse\ncured and within reaching distance of the passenger com\npartment at the time of the search.\u201d 556 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10). The four dissenting Justices, by contrast,\nunderstood Belton to have explicitly adopted the simple,\nbright-line rule stated in the Belton Court\u2019s opinion. 556\nU. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 3); see Bel\nton, 453 U. S., at 460 (\u201c[W]e hold that when a policeman\nhas made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an\nautomobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that\narrest, search the passenger compartment of that automo\nbile\u201d (footnote omitted)). To limit Belton to cases involving\nunsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to over\nrule the decision\u2019s clear holding. Gant, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 2\u20133). JUSTICE SCALIA, who provided the fifth vote\nto affirm in Gant, agreed with the dissenters\u2019 understand\ning of Belton\u2019s holding. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132)\n(concurring opinion). JUSTICE SCALIA favored a more ex\nplicit and complete overruling of Belton, but he joined\nwhat became the majority opinion to avoid \u201ca 4-to-1-to-4\u201d\ndisposition. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\u20134). As a result,\nthe Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an\nautomobile search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest is\nconstitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching dis\ntance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police\nhave reason to believe that the vehicle contains \u201cevidence\nrelevant to the crime of arrest.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u2013\n10) (citing Thornton, supra, at 632 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).\n                           B\n  The search at issue in this case took place a full two\nyears before this Court announced its new rule in Gant.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOn an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville,\nAlabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually\nresulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving\nwhile intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a\nfalse name to police). The police handcuffed both Owens\nand Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of\nseparate patrol cars. The police then searched the pas\nsenger compartment of Owens\u2019s vehicle and found a re\nvolver inside Davis\u2019s jacket pocket.\n   Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on\none count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). In his motion to suppress\nthe revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers\u2019 search\nfully complied with \u201cexisting Eleventh Circuit precedent.\u201d\nApp. 13\u201315. Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had\nlong read Belton to establish a bright-line rule authorizing\nsubstantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident\nto arrests of recent occupants. See United States v. Gon\nzalez, 71 F. 3d 819, 822, 824\u2013827 (CA11 1996) (upholding\nautomobile search conducted after the defendant had been\n\u201cpulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground,\nand placed under arrest\u201d). Davis recognized that the Dis\ntrict Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but\nhe raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve \u201cthe\nissue for review\u201d on appeal. App. 15. The District Court\ndenied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the fire\narms charge.\n   While Davis\u2019s appeal was pending, this Court decided\nGant. The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied\nGant\u2019s new rule and held that the vehicle search incident\nto Davis\u2019s arrest \u201cviolated [his] Fourth Amendment\nrights.\u201d 598 F. 3d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010). As for\nwhether this constitutional violation warranted suppres\nsion, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue\nthat turned on \u201cthe potential of exclusion to deter wrong\nful police conduct.\u201d Id., at 1265 (quoting Herring v. United\n6                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 555 U. S. 135, 137 (2009); internal quotation marks\nomitted).

Hudson v. Michigan,\n547 U. S. 586, 596 (2006). The analysis must also account\nfor the \u201csubstantial social costs\u201d generated by the rule.\nLeon, supra, at 907. Exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both\nthe judicial system and society at large. Stone, 428 U. S.,\nat 490\u2013491. It almost always requires courts to ignore\nreliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or inno\ncence. Ibid. And its bottom-line effect, in many cases, is\nto suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the\ncommunity without punishment. See Herring, supra, at\n141. Our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter\npill when necessary, but only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d Hudson,\nsupra, at 591. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deter\nrence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy\ncosts. See Herring, supra, at 141; Leon, supra, at 910.\n   Admittedly, there was a time when our exclusionary\nrule cases were not nearly so discriminating in their\napproach to the doctrine. \u201cExpansive dicta\u201d in several deci\nsions, see Hudson, supra, at 591, suggested that the rule\nwas a self-executing mandate implicit in the Fourth\nAmendment itself. See Olmstead v. United States, 277\nU. S. 438, 462 (1928) (remarking on the \u201cstriking outcome\nof the Weeks case\u201d that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment, although\nnot referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts,\nreally forbade its introduction\u201d); Mapp, supra, at 655\n(\u201c[A]ll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in viola\ntion of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inad\nmissible in a state court\u201d). As late as our 1971 decision in\nWhiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S.\n560, 568\u2013569, the Court \u201ctreated identification of a Fourth\nAmendment violation as synonymous with application of\nthe exclusionary rule.\u201d Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13\n(1995). In time, however, we came to acknowledge the\n8                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusionary rule for what it undoubtedly is\u2014a \u201cjudicially\ncreated remedy\u201d of this Court\u2019s own making. Calandra,\nsupra, at 348. We abandoned the old, \u201creflexive\u201d applica\ntion of the doctrine, and imposed a more rigorous weighing\nof its costs and deterrence benefits. Evans, supra, at 13;\nsee, e.g., Calandra, supra; Janis, supra; Stone, supra; INS\nv. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984); United States v.\nHavens, 446 U. S. 620 (1980). In a line of cases beginning\nwith United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, we also recali\nbrated our cost-benefit analysis in exclusion cases to focus\nthe inquiry on the \u201cflagrancy of the police misconduct\u201d at\nissue. Id., at 909, 911.\n   The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the\ndeterrence benefits of exclusion \u201cvar[y] with the culpabil\nity of the law enforcement conduct\u201d at issue. Herring, 555\nU. S., at 143. When the police exhibit \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201creck\nless,\u201d or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d disregard for Fourth Amend\nment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and\ntends to outweigh the resulting costs. Id., at 144. But\nwhen the police act with an objectively \u201creasonable good\nfaith belief\u201d that their conduct is lawful, Leon, supra, at\n909 (internal quotation marks omitted), or when their\nconduct involves only simple, \u201cisolated\u201d negligence, Her\nring, supra, at 137, the \u201c \u2018deterrence rationale loses much\nof its force,\u2019 \u201d and exclusion cannot \u201cpay its way.\u201d See\nLeon, supra, at 919, 908, n. 6 (quoting United States v.\nPeltier, 422 U. S. 531, 539 (1975)).\n   The Court has over time applied this \u201cgood-faith\u201d excep\ntion across a range of cases. Leon itself, for example, held\nthat the exclusionary rule does not apply when the police\nconduct a search in \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance\u201d on a\nwarrant later held invalid. 468 U. S., at 922. The error in\nsuch a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the\npolice officer, and \u201cpunish[ing] the errors of judges\u201d is not\nthe office of the exclusionary rule. Id., at 916; see also\nMassachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 990 (1984)\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(companion case declining to apply exclusionary rule\nwhere warrant held invalid as a result of judge\u2019s clerical\nerror).\n   Other good-faith cases have sounded a similar theme.\nIllinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340 (1987), extended the good\nfaith exception to searches conducted in reasonable reli\nance on subsequently invalidated statutes. Id., at 349\u2013\n350 (\u201clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of\nthe rule\u201d). In Arizona v. Evans, supra, the Court applied\nthe good-faith exception in a case where the police rea\nsonably relied on erroneous information concerning an\narrest warrant in a database maintained by judicial em\nployees. Id., at 14. Most recently, in Herring v. United\nStates, 555 U. S. 135, we extended Evans in a case where\npolice employees erred in maintaining records in a war\nrant database. \u201c[I]solated,\u201d \u201cnonrecurring\u201d police negli\ngence, we determined, lacks the culpability required to\njustify the harsh sanction of exclusion. 555 U. S., at 137,\n144.\n                             III\n   The question in this case is whether to apply the exclu\nsionary rule when the police conduct a search in objec\ntively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.\nAt the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet\ndecided Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh\nCircuit had interpreted our decision in New York v. Belton,\n453 U. S. 454, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing\nthe search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment incident\nto a recent occupant\u2019s arrest. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d, at 825.\nThe search incident to Davis\u2019s arrest in this case followed\nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Gonzalez precedent to the letter.\nAlthough the search turned out to be unconstitutional\nunder Gant, all agree that the officers\u2019 conduct was in\nstrict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was\nnot culpable in any way. See Brief for Petitioner 49 (\u201csup\n10                     DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npression\u201d in this case would \u201cimpl[y] no assignment of\nblame\u201d).\n  Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowl\nedged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim.\nPolice practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion\nonly when they are deliberate enough to yield \u201cmean\ningfu[l]\u201d deterrence, and culpable enough to be \u201cworth the\nprice paid by the justice system.\u201d Herring, 555 U. S., at\n144. The conduct of the officers here was neither of these\nthings. The officers who conducted the search did not\nviolate Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights deliberately,\nrecklessly, or with gross negligence. See ibid. Nor does\nthis case involve any \u201crecurring or systemic negligence\u201d on\nthe part of law enforcement. Ibid. The police acted in\nstrict compliance with binding precedent, and their behav\nior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to\nbecome a strict-liability regime, it can have no application\nin this case.\n  Indeed, in 27 years of practice under Leon\u2019s good-faith\nexception, we have \u201cnever applied\u201d the exclusionary rule to\nsuppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable,\ninnocent police conduct. Herring, supra, at 144. If the\npolice in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in\nconducting their search, see Leon, supra, or on an errone\nous warrant record in a government database, Herring,\nsupra, the exclusionary rule would not apply. And if\nCongress or the Alabama Legislature had enacted a stat\nute codifying the precise holding of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in Gonzalez,4 we would swiftly conclude that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Cf.

The\nsame should be true of Davis\u2019s attempt here to\n\u201c \u2018[p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges\u2019] error.\u2019 \u201d\nSee ibid.\n    About all that exclusion would deter in this case is\nconscientious police work. Responsible law-enforcement\nofficers will take care to learn \u201cwhat is required of them\u201d\nunder Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform\ntheir conduct to these rules. Hudson, 547 U. S., at 599.\nBut by the same token, when binding appellate precedent\nspecifically authorizes a particular police practice, well\ntrained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their\ncrime-detection and public-safety responsibilities. An of\nficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appel\nlate precedent does no more than \u201c \u2018ac[t] as a reasonable\nofficer would and should act\u2019 \u201d under the circumstances.\nLeon, 468 U. S., at 920 (quoting Stone, 428 U. S., at 539\u2013\n540 (White, J., dissenting)). The deterrent effect of exclu\nsion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer\nfrom \u201c \u2018do[ing] his duty.\u2019 \u201d 468 U. S., at 920.\n    That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule\nseeks to foster. We have stated before, and we reaffirm\ntoday, that the harsh sanction of exclusion \u201cshould not be\napplied to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement\nactivity.\u201d Id., at 919.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npable, other considerations should prevent the good-faith\nexception from applying. We are not persuaded.\n                              A\n                              1\n   The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is\nthat the exclusionary rule\u2019s availability to enforce new\nFourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, see\nGriffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), not a good-faith\nissue. They contend that applying the good-faith excep\ntion where police have relied on overruled precedent effec\ntively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of Linklet\nter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). See post, at 2\u20135.\n   In Linkletter, we held that the retroactive effect of a new\nconstitutional rule of criminal procedure should be deter\nmined on a case-by-case weighing of interests. For each\nnew rule, Linkletter required courts to consider a three\nfactor balancing test that looked to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the\nnew rule, \u201creliance\u201d on the old rule by law enforcement\nand others, and the effect retroactivity would have \u201con\nthe administration of justice.\u201d 381 U. S., at 636. After\n\u201cweigh[ing] the merits and demerits in each case,\u201d courts\ndecided whether and to what extent a new rule should be\ngiven retroactive effect. Id., at 629. In Linkletter itself,\nthe balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude\nthat Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\u2014which incorporated the\nexclusionary rule against the States\u2014should not apply\nretroactively to cases already final on direct review. 381\nU. S., at 639\u2013640. The next year, we extended Linkletter\nto retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review.\nSee Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 733 (1966)\n(holding that Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),\nand Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), applied\nretroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions\nwere released).\n   Over time, Linkletter proved difficult to apply in a con\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsistent, coherent way. Individual applications of the\nstandard \u201cproduced strikingly divergent results,\u201d see Dan\nforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 273 (2008), that\nmany saw as \u201cincompatible\u201d and \u201cinconsistent.\u201d Desist v.\nUnited States, 394 U. S. 244, 258 (1969) (Harlan, J., dis\nsenting). Justice Harlan in particular, who had endorsed\nthe Linkletter standard early on, offered a strong critique\nin which he argued that \u201cbasic judicial\u201d norms required\nfull retroactive application of new rules to all cases still\nsubject to direct review. 394 U. S., at 258\u2013259; see also\nMackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 675\u2013702 (1971)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nEventually, and after more than 20 years of toil under\nLinkletter, the Court adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s view and\nheld that newly announced rules of constitutional criminal\nprocedure must apply \u201cretroactively to all cases, state or\nfederal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no\nexception.\u201d Griffith, supra, at 328.\n                              2\n   The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good\nfaith exception in this case is \u201cincompatible\u201d with our\nretroactivity precedent under Griffith. See post, at 2;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 3\u20137. We think this argument\nconflates what are two distinct doctrines.\n   Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with\nwhether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available\non direct review as a potential ground for relief. Retroac\ntive application under Griffith lifts what would otherwise\nbe a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the govern\nment\u2019s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.\nSee Danforth, supra, at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may\n\u201cmake more sense to speak in terms of the \u2018redressability\u2019\nof violations of new rules, rather than the \u2018retroactivity\u2019 of\nsuch new rules\u201d). Retroactive application does not, how\never, determine what \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d (if any) the\n14                DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant should obtain. See Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S.\n79, 84 (1994) (noting that it \u201cdoes not necessarily follow\u201d\nfrom retroactive application of a new rule that the defen\ndant will \u201cgain . . . relief\u201d). Remedy is a separate, analyti\ncally distinct issue. Cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nSmith, 496 U. S. 167, 189 (1990) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he\nCourt has never equated its retroactivity principles with\nremedial principles\u201d). As a result, the retroactive applica\ntion of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law\nraises the question whether a suppression remedy applies;\nit does not answer that question. See Leon, 468 U. S., at\n906 (\u201cWhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately\nimposed in a particular case . . . is \u2018an issue separate from\nthe question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the\nparty seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police\nconduct\u2019 \u201d).\n   When this Court announced its decision in Gant, Davis\u2019s\nconviction had not yet become final on direct review. Gant\ntherefore applies retroactively to this case. Davis may\ninvoke its newly announced rule of substantive Fourth\nAmendment law as a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith,\nsupra, at 326, 328. The question, then, becomes one of\nremedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the\nexclusionary rule. But exclusion of evidence does not\nautomatically follow from the fact that a Fourth Amend\nment violation occurred. See Evans, 514 U. S., at 13\u201314.\nThe remedy is subject to exceptions and applies only\nwhere its \u201cpurpose is effectively advanced.\u201d Krull, 480\nU. S., at 347.\n   The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of\nthe established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit\nits availability in cases involving new Fourth Amendment\nrules. Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the\ndissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery\nexception were applicable in this case. See post, at 3;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 22 (\u201cDoctrines such as inevitable\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and]\nstanding . . . sharply limit the impact of newly-announced\nrules\u201d). The good-faith exception, however, is no less an\nestablished limit on the remedy of exclusion than is inevi\ntable discovery. Its application here neither contravenes\nGriffith nor denies retroactive effect to Gant.5\n   It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of\nLinkletter, the Court\u2019s decisions on the \u201cretroactivity prob\nlem in the context of the exclusionary rule\u201d did take\ninto account whether \u201claw enforcement officers reasonably\nbelieved in good faith\u201d that their conduct was in compli\nance with governing law. Peltier, 422 U. S., at 535\u2013537.\nAs a matter of retroactivity analysis, that approach is no\nlonger applicable. See Griffith, 479 U. S. 314. It does not\nfollow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is\nirrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule. When this Court adopted the good-faith\nexception in Leon, the Court\u2019s opinion explicitly relied on\nPeltier and imported its reasoning into the good-faith\ninquiry. See 468 U. S., at 918\u2013919. That reasonable\nreliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity\ncases does not make it any less relevant under our Leon\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent argues that the good-faith exception is \u201cunlike . . . inevi\ntable discovery\u201d because the former applies in all cases where the police\nreasonably rely on binding precedent, while the latter \u201capplies only\nupon occasion.\u201d Post, at 3. We fail to see how this distinction makes\nany difference. The same could be said\u2014indeed, the same was said\u2014of\nsearches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes. See Krull, 480\nU. S., at 368\u2013369 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (arguing that result in\nKrull was inconsistent with Griffith). When this Court strikes down a\nstatute on Fourth Amendment grounds, the good-faith exception may\nprevent the exclusionary rule from applying \u201cin every case pending\nwhen [the statute] is overturned.\u201d Post, at 3. This result does not\nmake the Court\u2019s newly announced rule of Fourth Amendment law any\nless retroactive. It simply limits the applicability of a suppression\nremedy. See Krull, supra, at 354\u2013355, n. 11.\n16                   DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nline of cases.6\n                            B\n  Davis also contends that applying the good-faith ex\nception to searches conducted in reliance on binding pre\ncedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment\nlaw. With no possibility of suppression, criminal defen\ndants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request\nthat courts overrule precedent.7\n                               1\n    This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern\nunderstanding of the role of the exclusionary rule. We\nhave never held that facilitating the overruling of prece\ndent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule\ncase. Rather, we have said time and again that the sole\npurpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by\nlaw enforcement. See, e.g., Sheppard, 468 U. S., at 990\n(\u201c \u2018adopted to deter unlawful searches by police\u2019 \u201d); Evans,\nsupra, at 14 (\u201chistorically designed as a means of deterring\npolice misconduct\u201d).\n    We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the\nfocus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpa\nble police conduct. In Leon, for example, we made clear\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Nor  does United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537 (1982), foreclose\napplication of the good-faith exception in cases involving changing law.\nJohnson distinguished Peltier and held that all Fourth Amendment\ncases should be retroactive on direct review so long as the new decision\nis not a \u201cclear break\u201d from prior precedent. 457 U. S., at 562. Johnson\nhad no occasion to opine on the good-faith exception to the exclusionary\nrule, which we adopted two years later in Leon.\n   7 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit \u201cnew Fourth\n\nAmendment decisions to be applied only prospectively,\u201d thus amounting\nto \u201ca regime of rule-creation by advisory opinion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n23, 25. For reasons discussed in connection with Davis\u2019s argument that\napplication of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter\nregime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the\nquestion of remedy.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 916; see id., at 918 (\u201cIf exclusion of evidence\nobtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant\nis to have any deterrent effect . . . it must alter the behav\nior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of\ntheir departments\u201d). Krull too noted that \u201clegislators, like\njudicial officers, are not the focus\u201d of the exclusionary rule.\n480 U. S., at 350. And in Evans, we said that the exclu\nsionary rule was aimed at deterring \u201cpolice misconduct,\nnot mistakes by court employees.\u201d 514 U. S., at 14. These\ncases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be\nmodified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of cul\npable law-enforcement conduct.\n                             2\n  And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in\nthis context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of\nprior Fourth Amendment precedents. In most instances,\nas in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will\nbe a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Su\npreme Court. But a good-faith exception for objectively\nreasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent\nreview and correction of such decisions. This Court re\nviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of\nAppeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of\nColumbia Court of Appeals. If one or even many of these\ncourts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defen\ndants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open\nwill still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the\nissue. This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de\nvelopment of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be\nstunted.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good\n\nfaith exception will prevent us from \u201crely[ing] upon lower courts to\nwork out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves.\u201d Post, at\n18                    DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of this\nCourt will be effectively insulated from challenge under a\ngood-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent.\nBut this argument is overblown. For one thing, it is im\nportant to keep in mind that this argument applies to an\nexceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this\nCourt\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare. Indeed,\nit has been more than 40 years since the Court last\nhanded down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.\nChimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (overruling United\nStates v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), and Harris v.\nUnited States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947)). And even in those\ncases, Davis points out that no fewer than eight separate\ndoctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully\nchallenges an existing precedent from getting any relief.\nBrief for Petitioner 50. Moreover, as a practical matter,\ndefense counsel in many cases will test this Court\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment precedents in the same way that Belton was\ntested in Gant\u2014by arguing that the precedent is distin\nguishable. See Brief for Respondent in Arizona v. Gant,\nO. T. 2008, No. 07\u2013542, pp. 22\u201329.9\n  At most, Davis\u2019s argument might suggest that\u2014to\nprevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified\u2014\nthe petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of\none of this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents should\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n5. If that is correct, then today\u2019s holding may well lead to more circuit\nsplits in Fourth Amendment cases and a fuller docket of Fourth\nAmendment cases in this Court. See this Court\u2019s Rule 10. Such a state\nof affairs is unlikely to result in ossification of Fourth Amendment\ndoctrine.\n  9 Where the search at issue is conducted in accordance with a munici\n\npal \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom,\u201d Fourth Amendment precedents may also be\nchallenged, without the obstacle of the good-faith exception or qualified\nimmunity, in civil suits against municipalities. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983;\nLos Angeles County v. Humphries, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n7) (citing Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U.

Such a result would\nundoubtedly be a windfall to this one random litigant.\nBut the exclusionary rule is \u201cnot a personal constitutional\nright.\u201d Stone, 428 U. S., at 486. It is a \u201cjudicially created\u201d\nsanction, Calandra, 414 U. S., at 348, specifically designed\nas a \u201cwindfall\u201d remedy to deter future Fourth Amendment\nviolations. See Stone, supra, at 490. The good-faith excep\ntion is a judicially created exception to this judicially\ncreated rule. Therefore, in a future case, we could, if\nnecessary, recognize a limited exception to the good-faith\nexception for a defendant who obtains a judgment over\nruling one of our Fourth Amendment prece-\ndents. Cf. Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929, 952\u2013953 (1965)\n(\u201c[T]he same authority that empowered the Court to sup\nplement the amendment by the exclusionary rule a hun\ndred and twenty-five years after its adoption, likewise\nallows it to modify that rule as the lessons of experience\nmay teach\u201d (internal quotation marks and footnotes\nomitted)).10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III\n\nstanding to challenge an existing Fourth Amendment precedent if the\ngood-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant\nfrom obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that\nprecedent. This argument confuses weakness on the merits with\nabsence of Article III standing. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.\n605, 624 (1989) (standing does not \u201c \u2018depen[d] on the merits of [a\nclaim]\u2019 \u201d). And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.\nIn many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8),\ndefendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to\nthe precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not\nfall within the scope of the precedent.\n  In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to\nchallenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that\nprovides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.\nAs noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428\nU. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not\n20                  DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  But this is not such a case. Davis did not secure a deci\nsion overturning a Supreme Court precedent; the police in\nhis case reasonably relied on binding Circuit precedent.\nSee United States v. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d 819. That sort of\nblameless police conduct, we hold, comes within the good\nfaith exception and is not properly subject to the exclu\nsionary rule.\n                        *    *    *\n  It is one thing for the criminal \u201cto go free because the\nconstable has blundered.\u201d People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13,\n21, 150 N. E. 585, 587 (1926) (Cardozo, J.). It is quite\nanother to set the criminal free because the constable has\nscrupulously adhered to governing law. Excluding evi\ndence in such cases deters no police misconduct and im\nposes substantial social costs. We therefore hold that\nwhen the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable\nreliance on binding appellate precedent, the exclusionary\nrule does not apply. The judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit is\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbe impaired. And because (at least in almost all instances) the prece\n\ndent can be challenged by others, Fourth Amendment case law will not \n\nbe insulated from reconsideration. \n\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

United States, 555\nU. S. 135, 141 (2009); Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347\u2013\n348 (1987). Accordingly, we have held, application of the\nexclusionary rule is unwarranted when it \u201c \u2018does not result\nin appreciable deterrence.\u2019 \u201d Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1,\n11 (1995) (quoting United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433,\n454 (1976)). In the circumstances of this case, where\n\u201cbinding appellate precedent specifically authorize[d] a\nparticular police practice,\u201d ante, at 11\u2014in accord with\nthe holdings of nearly every other court in the country\u2014\napplication of the exclusionary rule cannot reasonably\nbe expected to yield appreciable deterrence. I am thus\ncompelled to conclude that the exclusionary rule does\nnot apply in this case and to agree with the Court\u2019s\ndisposition.\n   This case does not present the markedly different ques\ntion whether the exclusionary rule applies when the law\ngoverning the constitutionality of a particular search is\nunsettled.    As we previously recognized in deciding\nwhether to apply a Fourth Amendment holding retroac\ntively, when police decide to conduct a search or seizure in\nthe absence of case law (or other authority) specifically\n2                  DAVIS v.

Official awareness of the\n    dubious constitutionality of a practice would be coun\n    terbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the\n    Fourth Amendment law in the area remained un\n    settled, evidence obtained through the questionable\n    practice would be excluded only in the one case\n    definitively resolving the unsettled question.\u201d United\n    States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 561 (1982) (footnote\n    omitted).\nThe Court of Appeals recognized as much in limiting its\napplication of the good-faith exception it articulated in this\ncase to situations where its \u201cprecedent on a given point [is]\nunequivocal.\u201d 598 F. 3d 1259, 1266 (CA11 2010); see id.,\nat 1266\u20131267 (\u201c[W]e do not mean to encourage police to\nadopt a \u2018 \u201clet\u2019s-wait-until-it\u2019s-decided approach\u201d \u2019 to \u2018unset\ntled\u2019 questions of Fourth Amendment law\u201d (quoting John\nson, 457 U.

Whether exclusion would deter\nFourth Amendment violations where appellate precedent\ndoes not specifically authorize a certain practice and, if so,\nwhether the benefits of exclusion would outweigh its costs\nare questions unanswered by our previous decisions.\n   The dissent suggests that today\u2019s decision essentially\nanswers those questions, noting that an officer who con\nducts a search in the face of unsettled precedent \u201cis no\nmore culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \u2018bind\ning precedent.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 7 (opinion of BREYER, J.).

Rather, an officer\u2019s culpability is relevant because\nit may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion\nwould result in appreciable deterrence. See ante, at 8\n(\u201cThe basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the\ndeterrence benefits of exclusion var[y] with the culpability\nof the law enforcement conduct at issue\u201d (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; alteration in original)); see also, e.g.,\nHerring, 555 U.

See, e.g., ante, at\n6\u20137; Herring, 555 U. S., at 141; Krull, 480 U.

Gant, 556 U. S. ___, this Court\nheld that a police search of an automobile without a war\nrant violates the Fourth Amendment if the police have pre\nviously removed the automobile\u2019s occupants and placed\nthem securely in a squad car. The present case involves\nthese same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal\nwhen this Court decided Gant. Because Gant represents a\n\u201cshift\u201d in the Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\nante, at 1, we must decide whether and how Gant\u2019s new\nrule applies here.\n                             I\n  I agree with the Court about whether Gant\u2019s new rule\napplies. It does apply. Between 1965, when the Court\ndecided Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, and 1987,\nwhen it decided Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, that\nconclusion would have been more difficult to reach. Under\nLinkletter, the Court determined a new rule\u2019s retroactivity\nby looking to several different factors, including whether\nthe new rule represented a \u201cclear break\u201d with the past and\nthe degree of \u201creliance by law enforcement authorities on\nthe old standards.\u201d Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244,\n248\u2013249 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted) (also\n2                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nciting \u201cthe purpose to be served by the new standards\u201d\nand \u201cthe effect on the administration of justice\u201d as factors\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). And the Court would\noften not apply the new rule to identical cases still pend\ning on appeal. See ibid.\n   After 22 years of struggling with its Linkletter approach,\nhowever, the Court decided in Griffith that Linkletter\nhad proved unfair and unworkable. It then substituted a\nclearer approach, stating that \u201ca new rule for the conduct\nof criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all\ncases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet\nfinal, with no exception for cases in which the new rule\nconstitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d 479 U. S., at\n328. The Court today, following Griffith, concludes that\nGant\u2019s new rule applies here. And to that extent I agree\nwith its decision.\n                             II\n   The Court goes on, however, to decide how Gant\u2019s new\nrule will apply. And here it adds a fatal twist. While\nconceding that, like the search in Gant, this search vio\nlated the Fourth Amendment, it holds that, unlike Gant,\nthis defendant is not entitled to a remedy. That is be\ncause the Court finds a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception which\nprevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth\nAmendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally\nseized evidence. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383\n(1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Leaving Davis\nwith a right but not a remedy, the Court \u201ckeep[s] the word\nof promise to our ear\u201d but \u201cbreak[s] it to our hope.\u201d\n                            A\n  At this point I can no longer agree with the Court. A\nnew \u201cgood faith\u201d exception and this Court\u2019s retroactivity\ndecisions are incompatible. For one thing, the Court\u2019s\ndistinction between (1) retroactive application of a new\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and\nruns counter to precedent. To determine that a new rule\nis retroactive is to determine that, at least in the normal\ncase, there is a remedy. As we have previously said, the\n\u201csource of a \u2018new rule\u2019 is the Constitution itself, not any\njudicial power to create new rules of law\u201d; hence, \u201c[w]hat\nwe are actually determining when we assess the \u2018retroac\ntivity\u2019 of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly\nannounced right, but whether a violation of the right that\noccurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will\nentitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.\u201d Dan\nforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 271 (2008). The Court\u2019s\n\u201cgood faith\u201d exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a\nremedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates\n\u201ca categorical bar to obtaining redress\u201d in every case pend\ning when a precedent is overturned. Ante, at 13\u201314.\n   For another thing, the Court\u2019s holding re-creates the\nvery problems that led the Court to abandon Linkletter\u2019s\napproach to retroactivity in favor of Griffith\u2019s. One such\nproblem concerns workability. The Court says that its\nexception applies where there is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d\npolice \u201creliance on binding appellate precedent.\u201d Ante, at\n1, 19. But to apply the term \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d\noften requires resolution of complex questions of degree.\nDavis conceded that he faced binding anti-Gant precedent\nin the Eleventh Circuit. But future litigants will be less\nforthcoming. Ante, at 18. Indeed, those litigants will now\nhave to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit\nprecedent was not \u201cbinding\u201d lest they find relief foreclosed\neven if they win their constitutional claim.\n   At the same time, Fourth Amendment precedents fre\nquently require courts to \u201cslosh\u201d their \u201cway through the\nfactbound morass of \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Scott v. Harris,\n550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007). Suppose an officer\u2019s conduct is\nconsistent with the language of a Fourth Amendment rule\nthat a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly\n4                  DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndistinguishable facts? Suppose the case creating the rele\nvant precedent did not directly announce any general\nrule but involved highly analogous facts? What about a\nrule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant\u2019s\njurisdiction, had previously accepted? What rules can be\ndeveloped for determining when, where, and how these\ndifferent kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as rele\nvant \u201cbinding precedent\u201d? The Linkletter-like result is\nlikely complex legal argument and police force confusion.\nSee Williams v. United States, 401 U. S. 646, 676 (1971)\n(opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow Linklet\nter decisions as \u201calmost as difficult\u201d as trying to follow \u201cthe\ntracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended\nvictim\u201d).\n   Another such problem concerns fairness. Today\u2019s hold\ning, like that in Linkletter, \u201cviolates basic norms of con\nstitutional adjudication.\u201d Griffith, supra, at 322. It treats\nthe defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way\nwhile treating similarly situated defendants whose cases\nare pending on appeal in a different way. See ante, at 18\u2013\n19. Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong\nwhen he said:\n    \u201cWe cannot release criminals from jail merely because\n    we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to\n    announce a constitutional doctrine] . . . . Simply fish\n    ing one case from the stream of appellate review, us\n    ing it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional\n    standards, and then permitting a stream of similar\n    cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new\n    rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our\n    ordinary] model of judicial review.\u201d Williams, supra,\n    at 679.\nAnd in Griffith, the Court \u201cembraced to a significant ex\ntent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice\nHarlan.\u201d 479 U.

How would\ncourts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their\nprior decisions when other circuits\u2019 cases lead them to\nbelieve those decisions may be wrong? Why would a de\nfendant seek to overturn any such decision? After all, if\nthe (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if\nthe defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he\nloses (on relief). See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 301\n(1967). To what extent then could this Court rely upon\nlower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences\namong themselves\u2014through circuit reconsideration of a\nprecedent that other circuits have criticized? See Ari-\nzona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 23, n. 1 (1995) (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                              B\n   Perhaps more important, the Court\u2019s rationale for creat\ning its new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception threatens to undermine\nwell-settled Fourth Amendment law. The Court correctly\nsays that pre-Gant Eleventh Circuit precedent had held\nthat a Gant-type search was constitutional; hence the\npolice conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent,\nwas \u201cinnocent.\u201d Ante, at 10. But the Court then finds this\nfact sufficient to create a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the\nexclusionary rule. It reasons that the \u201csole purpose\u201d of the\nexclusionary rule \u201cis to deter future Fourth Amendment\nviolations,\u201d ante, at 6. The \u201cdeterrence benefits of exclu\nsion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement\nconduct at issue,\u201d ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted). Those benefits are sufficient to jus\ntify exclusion where \u201cpolice exhibit deliberate, reckless,\nor grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment\n6                DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nthose benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the\npolice act with \u201csimple, isolated negligence\u201d or an \u201cobjec\ntively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is\nlawful,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   If the Court means what it says, what will happen to the\nexclusionary rule, a rule that the Court adopted nearly a\ncentury ago for federal courts, Weeks v. United States, 232\nU. S. 383, and made applicable to state courts a half cen\ntury ago through the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v.\nOhio, 367 U. S. 643? The Court has thought of that rule\nnot as punishment for the individual officer or as repara\ntion for the individual defendant but more generally as\nan effective way to secure enforcement of the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s commands. Weeks, supra, at 393 (without\nthe exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment would be \u201cof\nno value,\u201d and \u201cmight as well be stricken from the Consti\ntution\u201d). This Court has deviated from the \u201csuppression\u201d\nnorm in the name of \u201cgood faith\u201d only a handful of times\nand in limited, atypical circumstances: where a magistrate\nhas erroneously issued a warrant, United States v. Leon,\n468 U. S. 897 (1984); where a database has erroneously\ninformed police that they have a warrant, Arizona v.\nEvans, 514 U. S. 1 (1995), Herring v. United States, 555\nU. S. 135 (2009); and where an unconstitutional statute\npurported to authorize the search, Illinois v. Krull, 480\nU. S. 340 (1987). See Herring, supra, at 142 (\u201cgood faith\u201d\nexception inaptly named).\n   The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is\nunderstandable. Defendants frequently move to suppress\nevidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. In many, per\nhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how\nthe Fourth Amendment applied to the particular factual\ncircumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good\nfaith. Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances,\ncourts will find that the police were wrong. And, unless\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Em\npirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitu\ntional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153\nU. Pa. L. Rev. 1709, 1728 (2005) (suppression motions are\nfiled in approximately 7% of criminal cases; approximately\n12% of suppression motions are successful); LaFave, su\npra, at 64 (\u201cSurely many more Fourth Amendment viola\ntions result from carelessness than from intentional con\nstitutional violations\u201d); Stewart, The Road to Mapp v.\nOhio and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future\nof the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83\nColum.

[are] motivated by com\nmendable zeal, not condemnable malice\u201d).\n   But an officer who conducts a search that he believes\ncomplies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately\nturns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nbounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows\nerroneous \u201cbinding precedent.\u201d Nor is an officer more\nculpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive\nrather than \u201cbinding,\u201d where it only describes how to treat\nroughly analogous instances, or where it just does not\nexist. Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it\nwould place determinative weight upon the culpability of\nan individual officer\u2019s conduct, and if it would apply the\nexclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment viola\ntion was \u201cdeliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\u201d then\nthe \u201cgood faith\u201d exception will swallow the exclusionary\nrule.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09\u201311328.       Argued March 21, 2011\u2014Decided June 16, 2011\nWhile conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Wil\n lie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name. After handcuffing\n Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and\n found Davis\u2019s revolver. Davis was then indicted on charges of being a\n felon in possession of a firearm. In a suppression motion, Davis ac\n knowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing\n Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting New York v. Belton, 453\n U. S. 454, but Davis raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to pre\n serve the issue on appeal. The District Court denied the motion, and\n Davis was convicted. While his appeal was pending, this Court an\n nounced, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing\n automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants. The\n Eleventh Circuit held, under Gant, that the vehicle search at issue\n violated Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, but the court declined to\n suppress the revolver and affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction.\nHeld: Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding\n appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule. Pp. 6\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) The exclusionary rule\u2019s sole purpose is to deter future Fourth\n Amendment violations, e.g., Herring v. United States, 555 U. S. 135,\n 141, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is\n \u201cthought most efficaciously served,\u201d United States v. Calandra, 414\n U. S. 338, 348. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence bene\n fits of suppression must outweigh the rule\u2019s heavy costs. Under a\n line of cases beginning with United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, the\n result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the \u201cflagrancy of the po\n lice misconduct\u201d at issue. Id., at 909, 911. When the police exhibit\n \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201creckless,\u201d or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d disregard for Fourth\n2                       DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Amendment rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the\n    costs. Herring, supra, at 144. But when the police act with an objec\n    tively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or\n    when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the de\n    terrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot \u201cpay\n    its way.\u201d See Leon, supra, at 909, 919, 908, n. 6; Herring, supra, at\n    137. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitu\n    tional under Gant, Davis concedes that the officers\u2019 conduct was in\n    strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable\n    in any way. Under this Court\u2019s exclusionary-rule precedents, the ac\n    knowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim. Pp. 9\u2013\n    11.\n       (c) The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considera\n    tions should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this\n    case. Pp. 11\u201319.\n          (1) The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to\n    enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue,\n    not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive. This argument erroneously\n    conflates retroactivity with remedy. Because Davis\u2019s conviction had\n    not become final when Gant was announced, Gant applies retroac\n    tively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as\n    a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314,\n    326, 328. But retroactive application of a new rule does not deter\n    mine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain. See\n    Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S. 79, 83, 84. The remedy of exclusion does\n    not automatically follow from a Fourth Amendment violation, see\n    Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13, and applies only where its \u201cpurpose\n    is effectively advanced,\u201d Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347. The ap\n    plication of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes Griffith\n    nor denies retroactive effect to Gant. Pp. 12\u201316.\n          (2) Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying\n    the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding\n    precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law by\n    discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent. Facili\n    tating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consid\n    eration in this Court\u2019s exclusionary-rule cases. In any event, apply\n    ing the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this\n    Court\u2019s review of Fourth Amendment precedents. If precedent from a\n    federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particu\n    lar type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the\n    question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to\n    litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those\n    cases. Davis\u2019s claim that this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

In many\n  cases, defendants will test this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment prece\n  dents by arguing that they are distinguishable. And at most, this ar\n  gument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a\n  petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Court\u2019s prece\n  dents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.

To supplement\nthe bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a\ndeterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from intro\nducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment\nviolation. The question here is whether to apply this\nsanction when the police conduct a search in compliance\nwith binding precedent that is later overruled. Because\nsuppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct\nin these circumstances, and because it would come at a\nhigh cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold\nthat searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance\non binding appellate precedent are not subject to the\nexclusionary rule.\n                          I\n  The question presented arises in this case as a result\nof a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on\nsearches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent\noccupants.\n2                    DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n   Under this Court\u2019s decision in Chimel v. California, 395\nU. S. 752 (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest\nmay conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s person\nand the area \u201cwithin his immediate control.\u201d Id., at 763\n(internal quotation marks omitted). This rule \u201cmay be\nstated clearly enough,\u201d but in the early going after Chimel\nit proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that in\nvolved searches \u201cinside [of] automobile[s] after the arrest\nees [we]re no longer in [them].\u201d See New York v. Belton,\n453 U. S. 454, 458\u2013459 (1981). A number of courts up\nheld the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were\n\u201csubstantially contemporaneous\u201d with occupants\u2019 arrests.1\nOther courts disapproved of automobile searches incident\nto arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the\narrestee might gain access to the vehicle and \u201cdestroy\nevidence or grab a weapon.\u201d2 In New York v. Belton, this\nCourt granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. See id., at\n459\u2013460.\n   In Belton, a police officer conducting a traffic stop law\nfully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the\narrestees to line up, un-handcuffed, along the side of the\nthruway. Id., at 456; see Brief for Petitioner in New York\nv. Belton, O. T. 1980, No. 80\u2013328, p. 3. The officer then\nsearched the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and found\ncocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat. Belton,\n453 U. S., at 456.

Numerous courts read\nthe decision to authorize automobile searches incident to\narrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the\narrestee in any particular case was within reaching dis\ntance of the vehicle at the time of the search. See Thorn\nton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 628 (2004) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Even after the\narrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been\nsubdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that\nBelton still authorized a substantially contemporaneous\nsearch of the automobile\u2019s passenger compartment.3\n   Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of\nBelton.

Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009). Four of the Justices in the\nmajority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that\nBelton\u2019s holding applies only where \u201cthe arrestee is unse\ncured and within reaching distance of the passenger com\npartment at the time of the search.\u201d 556 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10). The four dissenting Justices, by contrast,\nunderstood Belton to have explicitly adopted the simple,\nbright-line rule stated in the Belton Court\u2019s opinion. 556\nU. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 3); see Bel\nton, 453 U.

To limit Belton to cases involving\nunsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to over\nrule the decision\u2019s clear holding. Gant, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 2\u20133). JUSTICE SCALIA, who provided the fifth vote\nto affirm in Gant, agreed with the dissenters\u2019 understand\ning of Belton\u2019s holding. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132)\n(concurring opinion). JUSTICE SCALIA favored a more ex\nplicit and complete overruling of Belton, but he joined\nwhat became the majority opinion to avoid \u201ca 4-to-1-to-4\u201d\ndisposition. 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\u20134). As a result,\nthe Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an\nautomobile search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest is\nconstitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching dis\ntance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police\nhave reason to believe that the vehicle contains \u201cevidence\nrelevant to the crime of arrest.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u2013\n10) (citing Thornton, supra, at 632 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).\n                           B\n  The search at issue in this case took place a full two\nyears before this Court announced its new rule in Gant.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOn an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville,\nAlabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually\nresulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving\nwhile intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a\nfalse name to police). The police handcuffed both Owens\nand Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of\nseparate patrol cars. The police then searched the pas\nsenger compartment of Owens\u2019s vehicle and found a re\nvolver inside Davis\u2019s jacket pocket.\n   Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on\none count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nSee 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1). In his motion to suppress\nthe revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers\u2019 search\nfully complied with \u201cexisting Eleventh Circuit precedent.\u201d\nApp. 13\u201315. Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had\nlong read Belton to establish a bright-line rule authorizing\nsubstantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident\nto arrests of recent occupants. See United States v. Gon\nzalez, 71 F. 3d 819, 822, 824\u2013827 (CA11 1996) (upholding\nautomobile search conducted after the defendant had been\n\u201cpulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground,\nand placed under arrest\u201d). Davis recognized that the Dis\ntrict Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but\nhe raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve \u201cthe\nissue for review\u201d on appeal. App. 15. The District Court\ndenied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the fire\narms charge.\n   While Davis\u2019s appeal was pending, this Court decided\nGant. The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied\nGant\u2019s new rule and held that the vehicle search incident\nto Davis\u2019s arrest \u201cviolated [his] Fourth Amendment\nrights.\u201d 598 F. 3d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010). As for\nwhether this constitutional violation warranted suppres\nsion, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue\nthat turned on \u201cthe potential of exclusion to deter wrong\nful police conduct.\u201d Id., at 1265 (quoting Herring v. United\n6                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 555 U. S. 135, 137 (2009); internal quotation marks\nomitted). The court concluded that \u201cpenalizing the [ar\nresting] officer\u201d for following binding appellate precedent\nwould do nothing to \u201cdete[r] . . . Fourth Amendment viola\ntions.\u201d 598 F. 3d, at 1265\u20131266 (bracketing and internal\nquotation marks omitted). It therefore declined to apply\nthe exclusionary rule and affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction. We\ngranted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n   The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the peo\nple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and ef\nfects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d The\nAmendment says nothing about suppressing evidence ob\ntained in violation of this command. That rule\u2014the\nexclusionary rule\u2014is a \u201cprudential\u201d doctrine, Pennsyl\nvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357,\n363 (1998), created by this Court to \u201ccompel respect for the\nconstitutional guaranty.\u201d Elkins v. United States, 364\nU. S. 206, 217 (1960); see Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.\n383 (1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Exclusion\nis \u201cnot a personal constitutional right,\u201d nor is it designed\nto \u201credress the injury\u201d occasioned by an unconstitutional\nsearch. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486 (1976); see\nUnited States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454, n. 29 (1976)\n(exclusionary rule \u201cunsupportable as reparation or com\npensatory dispensation to the injured criminal\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). The rule\u2019s sole purpose, we\nhave repeatedly held, is to deter future Fourth Amend\nment violations. E.g., Herring, supra, at 141, and n. 2;\nUnited States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 909, 921, n. 22\n(1984); Elkins, supra, at 217 (\u201ccalculated to prevent, not to\nrepair\u201d). Our cases have thus limited the rule\u2019s operation\nto situations in which this purpose is \u201cthought most effica\nciously served.\u201d United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,\n348 (1974).

Hudson v. Michigan,\n547 U. S. 586, 596 (2006). The analysis must also account\nfor the \u201csubstantial social costs\u201d generated by the rule.\nLeon, supra, at 907. Exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both\nthe judicial system and society at large. Stone, 428 U. S.,\nat 490\u2013491. It almost always requires courts to ignore\nreliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or inno\ncence. Ibid. And its bottom-line effect, in many cases, is\nto suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the\ncommunity without punishment. See Herring, supra, at\n141. Our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter\npill when necessary, but only as a \u201clast resort.\u201d Hudson,\nsupra, at 591. For exclusion to be appropriate, the deter\nrence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy\ncosts. See Herring, supra, at 141; Leon, supra, at 910.\n   Admittedly, there was a time when our exclusionary\nrule cases were not nearly so discriminating in their\napproach to the doctrine. \u201cExpansive dicta\u201d in several deci\nsions, see Hudson, supra, at 591, suggested that the rule\nwas a self-executing mandate implicit in the Fourth\nAmendment itself. See Olmstead v. United States, 277\nU. S. 438, 462 (1928) (remarking on the \u201cstriking outcome\nof the Weeks case\u201d that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment, although\nnot referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts,\nreally forbade its introduction\u201d); Mapp, supra, at 655\n(\u201c[A]ll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in viola\ntion of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inad\nmissible in a state court\u201d). As late as our 1971 decision in\nWhiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U. S.\n560, 568\u2013569, the Court \u201ctreated identification of a Fourth\nAmendment violation as synonymous with application of\nthe exclusionary rule.\u201d Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 13\n(1995). In time, however, we came to acknowledge the\n8                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusionary rule for what it undoubtedly is\u2014a \u201cjudicially\ncreated remedy\u201d of this Court\u2019s own making. Calandra,\nsupra, at 348. We abandoned the old, \u201creflexive\u201d applica\ntion of the doctrine, and imposed a more rigorous weighing\nof its costs and deterrence benefits. Evans, supra, at 13;\nsee, e.g., Calandra, supra; Janis, supra; Stone, supra; INS\nv. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 (1984); United States v.\nHavens, 446 U. S. 620 (1980). In a line of cases beginning\nwith United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, we also recali\nbrated our cost-benefit analysis in exclusion cases to focus\nthe inquiry on the \u201cflagrancy of the police misconduct\u201d at\nissue. Id., at 909, 911.\n   The basic insight of the Leon line of cases is that the\ndeterrence benefits of exclusion \u201cvar[y] with the culpabil\nity of the law enforcement conduct\u201d at issue. Herring, 555\nU. S., at 143. When the police exhibit \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201creck\nless,\u201d or \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d disregard for Fourth Amend\nment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and\ntends to outweigh the resulting costs. Id., at 144. But\nwhen the police act with an objectively \u201creasonable good\nfaith belief\u201d that their conduct is lawful, Leon, supra, at\n909 (internal quotation marks omitted), or when their\nconduct involves only simple, \u201cisolated\u201d negligence, Her\nring, supra, at 137, the \u201c \u2018deterrence rationale loses much\nof its force,\u2019 \u201d and exclusion cannot \u201cpay its way.\u201d See\nLeon, supra, at 919, 908, n. 6 (quoting United States v.\nPeltier, 422 U. S. 531, 539 (1975)).\n   The Court has over time applied this \u201cgood-faith\u201d excep\ntion across a range of cases. Leon itself, for example, held\nthat the exclusionary rule does not apply when the police\nconduct a search in \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance\u201d on a\nwarrant later held invalid. 468 U. S., at 922. The error in\nsuch a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the\npolice officer, and \u201cpunish[ing] the errors of judges\u201d is not\nthe office of the exclusionary rule. Id., at 916; see also\nMassachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 990 (1984)\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(companion case declining to apply exclusionary rule\nwhere warrant held invalid as a result of judge\u2019s clerical\nerror).\n   Other good-faith cases have sounded a similar theme.\nIllinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340 (1987), extended the good\nfaith exception to searches conducted in reasonable reli\nance on subsequently invalidated statutes. Id., at 349\u2013\n350 (\u201clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus of\nthe rule\u201d). In Arizona v. Evans, supra, the Court applied\nthe good-faith exception in a case where the police rea\nsonably relied on erroneous information concerning an\narrest warrant in a database maintained by judicial em\nployees. Id., at 14. Most recently, in Herring v. United\nStates, 555 U. S. 135, we extended Evans in a case where\npolice employees erred in maintaining records in a war\nrant database. \u201c[I]solated,\u201d \u201cnonrecurring\u201d police negli\ngence, we determined, lacks the culpability required to\njustify the harsh sanction of exclusion. 555 U. S., at 137,\n144.\n                             III\n   The question in this case is whether to apply the exclu\nsionary rule when the police conduct a search in objec\ntively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.\nAt the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet\ndecided Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh\nCircuit had interpreted our decision in New York v. Belton,\n453 U. S. 454, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing\nthe search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment incident\nto a recent occupant\u2019s arrest. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d, at 825.\nThe search incident to Davis\u2019s arrest in this case followed\nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Gonzalez precedent to the letter.\nAlthough the search turned out to be unconstitutional\nunder Gant, all agree that the officers\u2019 conduct was in\nstrict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was\nnot culpable in any way. See Brief for Petitioner 49 (\u201csup\n10                     DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npression\u201d in this case would \u201cimpl[y] no assignment of\nblame\u201d).\n  Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowl\nedged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim.\nPolice practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion\nonly when they are deliberate enough to yield \u201cmean\ningfu[l]\u201d deterrence, and culpable enough to be \u201cworth the\nprice paid by the justice system.\u201d Herring, 555 U. S., at\n144. The conduct of the officers here was neither of these\nthings. The officers who conducted the search did not\nviolate Davis\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights deliberately,\nrecklessly, or with gross negligence. See ibid. Nor does\nthis case involve any \u201crecurring or systemic negligence\u201d on\nthe part of law enforcement. Ibid. The police acted in\nstrict compliance with binding precedent, and their behav\nior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to\nbecome a strict-liability regime, it can have no application\nin this case.\n  Indeed, in 27 years of practice under Leon\u2019s good-faith\nexception, we have \u201cnever applied\u201d the exclusionary rule to\nsuppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable,\ninnocent police conduct. Herring, supra, at 144. If the\npolice in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in\nconducting their search, see Leon, supra, or on an errone\nous warrant record in a government database, Herring,\nsupra, the exclusionary rule would not apply. And if\nCongress or the Alabama Legislature had enacted a stat\nute codifying the precise holding of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndecision in Gonzalez,4 we would swiftly conclude that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Cf.

Responsible law-enforcement\nofficers will take care to learn \u201cwhat is required of them\u201d\nunder Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform\ntheir conduct to these rules. Hudson, 547 U. S., at 599.\nBut by the same token, when binding appellate precedent\nspecifically authorizes a particular police practice, well\ntrained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their\ncrime-detection and public-safety responsibilities. An of\nficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appel\nlate precedent does no more than \u201c \u2018ac[t] as a reasonable\nofficer would and should act\u2019 \u201d under the circumstances.\nLeon, 468 U. S., at 920 (quoting Stone, 428 U. S., at 539\u2013\n540 (White, J., dissenting)).

S., at 920.\n    That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule\nseeks to foster.

Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), not a good-faith\nissue. They contend that applying the good-faith excep\ntion where police have relied on overruled precedent effec\ntively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of Linklet\nter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). See post, at 2\u20135.\n   In Linkletter, we held that the retroactive effect of a new\nconstitutional rule of criminal procedure should be deter\nmined on a case-by-case weighing of interests. For each\nnew rule, Linkletter required courts to consider a three\nfactor balancing test that looked to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the\nnew rule, \u201creliance\u201d on the old rule by law enforcement\nand others, and the effect retroactivity would have \u201con\nthe administration of justice.\u201d 381 U. S., at 636. After\n\u201cweigh[ing] the merits and demerits in each case,\u201d courts\ndecided whether and to what extent a new rule should be\ngiven retroactive effect. Id., at 629. In Linkletter itself,\nthe balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude\nthat Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\u2014which incorporated the\nexclusionary rule against the States\u2014should not apply\nretroactively to cases already final on direct review. 381\nU. S., at 639\u2013640. The next year, we extended Linkletter\nto retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review.\nSee Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 733 (1966)\n(holding that Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),\nand Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.

Individual applications of the\nstandard \u201cproduced strikingly divergent results,\u201d see Dan\nforth v. Minnesota, 552 U.

Justice Harlan in particular, who had endorsed\nthe Linkletter standard early on, offered a strong critique\nin which he argued that \u201cbasic judicial\u201d norms required\nfull retroactive application of new rules to all cases still\nsubject to direct review. 394 U. S., at 258\u2013259; see also\nMackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 675\u2013702 (1971)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nEventually, and after more than 20 years of toil under\nLinkletter, the Court adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s view and\nheld that newly announced rules of constitutional criminal\nprocedure must apply \u201cretroactively to all cases, state or\nfederal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no\nexception.\u201d Griffith, supra, at 328.\n                              2\n   The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good\nfaith exception in this case is \u201cincompatible\u201d with our\nretroactivity precedent under Griffith. See post, at 2;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 3\u20137. We think this argument\nconflates what are two distinct doctrines.\n   Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with\nwhether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available\non direct review as a potential ground for relief. Retroac\ntive application under Griffith lifts what would otherwise\nbe a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the govern\nment\u2019s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.\nSee Danforth, supra, at 271, n. 5 (noting that it may\n\u201cmake more sense to speak in terms of the \u2018redressability\u2019\nof violations of new rules, rather than the \u2018retroactivity\u2019 of\nsuch new rules\u201d). Retroactive application does not, how\never, determine what \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d (if any) the\n14                DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant should obtain. See Powell v. Nevada, 511 U. S.\n79, 84 (1994) (noting that it \u201cdoes not necessarily follow\u201d\nfrom retroactive application of a new rule that the defen\ndant will \u201cgain . . . relief\u201d). Remedy is a separate, analyti\ncally distinct issue. Cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nSmith, 496 U. S. 167, 189 (1990) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he\nCourt has never equated its retroactivity principles with\nremedial principles\u201d). As a result, the retroactive applica\ntion of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law\nraises the question whether a suppression remedy applies;\nit does not answer that question. See Leon, 468 U. S., at\n906 (\u201cWhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately\nimposed in a particular case . . . is \u2018an issue separate from\nthe question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the\nparty seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police\nconduct\u2019 \u201d).\n   When this Court announced its decision in Gant, Davis\u2019s\nconviction had not yet become final on direct review. Gant\ntherefore applies retroactively to this case. Davis may\ninvoke its newly announced rule of substantive Fourth\nAmendment law as a basis for seeking relief. See Griffith,\nsupra, at 326, 328. The question, then, becomes one of\nremedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the\nexclusionary rule. But exclusion of evidence does not\nautomatically follow from the fact that a Fourth Amend\nment violation occurred. See Evans, 514 U. S., at 13\u201314.\nThe remedy is subject to exceptions and applies only\nwhere its \u201cpurpose is effectively advanced.\u201d Krull, 480\nU. S., at 347.\n   The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of\nthe established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit\nits availability in cases involving new Fourth Amendment\nrules. Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the\ndissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery\nexception were applicable in this case. See post, at 3;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 22 (\u201cDoctrines such as inevitable\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

The good-faith exception, however, is no less an\nestablished limit on the remedy of exclusion than is inevi\ntable discovery. Its application here neither contravenes\nGriffith nor denies retroactive effect to Gant.5\n   It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of\nLinkletter, the Court\u2019s decisions on the \u201cretroactivity prob\nlem in the context of the exclusionary rule\u201d did take\ninto account whether \u201claw enforcement officers reasonably\nbelieved in good faith\u201d that their conduct was in compli\nance with governing law. Peltier, 422 U. S., at 535\u2013537.\nAs a matter of retroactivity analysis, that approach is no\nlonger applicable. See Griffith, 479 U. S. 314. It does not\nfollow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is\nirrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule. When this Court adopted the good-faith\nexception in Leon, the Court\u2019s opinion explicitly relied on\nPeltier and imported its reasoning into the good-faith\ninquiry. See 468 U. S., at 918\u2013919. That reasonable\nreliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity\ncases does not make it any less relevant under our Leon\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent argues that the good-faith exception is \u201cunlike . . . inevi\ntable discovery\u201d because the former applies in all cases where the police\nreasonably rely on binding precedent, while the latter \u201capplies only\nupon occasion.\u201d Post, at 3. We fail to see how this distinction makes\nany difference. The same could be said\u2014indeed, the same was said\u2014of\nsearches conducted in reasonable reliance on statutes. See Krull, 480\nU. S., at 368\u2013369 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (arguing that result in\nKrull was inconsistent with Griffith). When this Court strikes down a\nstatute on Fourth Amendment grounds, the good-faith exception may\nprevent the exclusionary rule from applying \u201cin every case pending\nwhen [the statute] is overturned.\u201d Post, at 3. This result does not\nmake the Court\u2019s newly announced rule of Fourth Amendment law any\nless retroactive. It simply limits the applicability of a suppression\nremedy. See Krull, supra, at 354\u2013355, n. 11.\n16                   DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nline of cases.6\n                            B\n  Davis also contends that applying the good-faith ex\nception to searches conducted in reliance on binding pre\ncedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment\nlaw. With no possibility of suppression, criminal defen\ndants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request\nthat courts overrule precedent.7\n                               1\n    This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern\nunderstanding of the role of the exclusionary rule. We\nhave never held that facilitating the overruling of prece\ndent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule\ncase. Rather, we have said time and again that the sole\npurpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by\nlaw enforcement. See, e.g., Sheppard, 468 U. S., at 990\n(\u201c \u2018adopted to deter unlawful searches by police\u2019 \u201d); Evans,\nsupra, at 14 (\u201chistorically designed as a means of deterring\npolice misconduct\u201d).\n    We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the\nfocus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpa\nble police conduct. In Leon, for example, we made clear\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Nor  does United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537 (1982), foreclose\napplication of the good-faith exception in cases involving changing law.\nJohnson distinguished Peltier and held that all Fourth Amendment\ncases should be retroactive on direct review so long as the new decision\nis not a \u201cclear break\u201d from prior precedent. 457 U. S., at 562. Johnson\nhad no occasion to opine on the good-faith exception to the exclusionary\nrule, which we adopted two years later in Leon.\n   7 Davis also asserts that a good-faith rule would permit \u201cnew Fourth\n\nAmendment decisions to be applied only prospectively,\u201d thus amounting\nto \u201ca regime of rule-creation by advisory opinion.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n23, 25. For reasons discussed in connection with Davis\u2019s argument that\napplication of the good-faith exception here would revive the Linkletter\nregime, this argument conflates the question of retroactivity with the\nquestion of remedy.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u201cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police\nmisconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.\u201d\n468 U. S., at 916; see id., at 918 (\u201cIf exclusion of evidence\nobtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant\nis to have any deterrent effect . . . it must alter the behav\nior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of\ntheir departments\u201d). Krull too noted that \u201clegislators, like\njudicial officers, are not the focus\u201d of the exclusionary rule.\n480 U. S., at 350. And in Evans, we said that the exclu\nsionary rule was aimed at deterring \u201cpolice misconduct,\nnot mistakes by court employees.\u201d 514 U. S., at 14. These\ncases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be\nmodified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of cul\npable law-enforcement conduct.\n                             2\n  And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in\nthis context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of\nprior Fourth Amendment precedents. In most instances,\nas in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will\nbe a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Su\npreme Court. But a good-faith exception for objectively\nreasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent\nreview and correction of such decisions. This Court re\nviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of\nAppeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of\nColumbia Court of Appeals. If one or even many of these\ncourts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defen\ndants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open\nwill still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the\nissue. This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de\nvelopment of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be\nstunted.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent does not dispute this point, but it claims that the good\n\nfaith exception will prevent us from \u201crely[ing] upon lower courts to\nwork out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves.\u201d Post, at\n18                    DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of this\nCourt will be effectively insulated from challenge under a\ngood-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent.\nBut this argument is overblown. For one thing, it is im\nportant to keep in mind that this argument applies to an\nexceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this\nCourt\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare. Indeed,\nit has been more than 40 years since the Court last\nhanded down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.\nChimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (overruling United\nStates v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), and Harris v.\nUnited States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947)). And even in those\ncases, Davis points out that no fewer than eight separate\ndoctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully\nchallenges an existing precedent from getting any relief.\nBrief for Petitioner 50. Moreover, as a practical matter,\ndefense counsel in many cases will test this Court\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment precedents in the same way that Belton was\ntested in Gant\u2014by arguing that the precedent is distin\nguishable. See Brief for Respondent in Arizona v. Gant,\nO. T. 2008, No. 07\u2013542, pp. 22\u201329.9\n  At most, Davis\u2019s argument might suggest that\u2014to\nprevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified\u2014\nthe petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of\none of this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment precedents should\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n5. If that is correct, then today\u2019s holding may well lead to more circuit\nsplits in Fourth Amendment cases and a fuller docket of Fourth\nAmendment cases in this Court. See this Court\u2019s Rule 10. Such a state\nof affairs is unlikely to result in ossification of Fourth Amendment\ndoctrine.\n  9 Where the search at issue is conducted in accordance with a munici\n\npal \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom,\u201d Fourth Amendment precedents may also be\nchallenged, without the obstacle of the good-faith exception or qualified\nimmunity, in civil suits against municipalities. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983;\nLos Angeles County v. Humphries, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n7) (citing Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U.

Such a result would\nundoubtedly be a windfall to this one random litigant.\nBut the exclusionary rule is \u201cnot a personal constitutional\nright.\u201d Stone, 428 U. S., at 486. It is a \u201cjudicially created\u201d\nsanction, Calandra, 414 U. S., at 348, specifically designed\nas a \u201cwindfall\u201d remedy to deter future Fourth Amendment\nviolations. See Stone, supra, at 490. The good-faith excep\ntion is a judicially created exception to this judicially\ncreated rule. Therefore, in a future case, we could, if\nnecessary, recognize a limited exception to the good-faith\nexception for a defendant who obtains a judgment over\nruling one of our Fourth Amendment prece-\ndents. Cf. Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929, 952\u2013953 (1965)\n(\u201c[T]he same authority that empowered the Court to sup\nplement the amendment by the exclusionary rule a hun\ndred and twenty-five years after its adoption, likewise\nallows it to modify that rule as the lessons of experience\nmay teach\u201d (internal quotation marks and footnotes\nomitted)).10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Davis contends that a criminal defendant will lack Article III\n\nstanding to challenge an existing Fourth Amendment precedent if the\ngood-faith exception to the exclusionary rule precludes the defendant\nfrom obtaining relief based on police conduct that conformed to that\nprecedent. This argument confuses weakness on the merits with\nabsence of Article III standing. See ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S.\n605, 624 (1989) (standing does not \u201c \u2018depen[d] on the merits of [a\nclaim]\u2019 \u201d). And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.\nIn many instances, as in Gant, see 556 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8),\ndefendants will not simply concede that the police conduct conformed to\nthe precedent; they will argue instead that the police conduct did not\nfall within the scope of the precedent.\n  In any event, even if some criminal defendants will be unable to\nchallenge some precedents for the reason that Davis suggests, that\nprovides no good reason for refusing to apply the good-faith exception.\nAs noted, the exclusionary rule is not a personal right, see Stone, 428\nU. S., at 486, 490, and therefore the rights of these defendants will not\n20                  DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  But this is not such a case. Davis did not secure a deci\nsion overturning a Supreme Court precedent; the police in\nhis case reasonably relied on binding Circuit precedent.\nSee United States v. Gonzalez, 71 F. 3d 819. That sort of\nblameless police conduct, we hold, comes within the good\nfaith exception and is not properly subject to the exclu\nsionary rule.\n                        *    *    *\n  It is one thing for the criminal \u201cto go free because the\nconstable has blundered.\u201d People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13,\n21, 150 N. E. 585, 587 (1926) (Cardozo, J.). It is quite\nanother to set the criminal free because the constable has\nscrupulously adhered to governing law. Excluding evi\ndence in such cases deters no police misconduct and im\nposes substantial social costs. We therefore hold that\nwhen the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable\nreliance on binding appellate precedent, the exclusionary\nrule does not apply. The judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit is\n                                                 Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbe impaired. And because (at least in almost all instances) the prece\n\ndent can be challenged by others, Fourth Amendment case law will not \n\nbe insulated from reconsideration. \n\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Accordingly, we have held, application of the\nexclusionary rule is unwarranted when it \u201c \u2018does not result\nin appreciable deterrence.\u2019 \u201d Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1,\n11 (1995) (quoting United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433,\n454 (1976)). In the circumstances of this case, where\n\u201cbinding appellate precedent specifically authorize[d] a\nparticular police practice,\u201d ante, at 11\u2014in accord with\nthe holdings of nearly every other court in the country\u2014\napplication of the exclusionary rule cannot reasonably\nbe expected to yield appreciable deterrence. I am thus\ncompelled to conclude that the exclusionary rule does\nnot apply in this case and to agree with the Court\u2019s\ndisposition.\n   This case does not present the markedly different ques\ntion whether the exclusionary rule applies when the law\ngoverning the constitutionality of a particular search is\nunsettled.    As we previously recognized in deciding\nwhether to apply a Fourth Amendment holding retroac\ntively, when police decide to conduct a search or seizure in\nthe absence of case law (or other authority) specifically\n2                  DAVIS v.

UNITED \n\n                   STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 16, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n  In 2009, in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, this Court\nheld that a police search of an automobile without a war\nrant violates the Fourth Amendment if the police have pre\nviously removed the automobile\u2019s occupants and placed\nthem securely in a squad car. The present case involves\nthese same circumstances, and it was pending on appeal\nwhen this Court decided Gant. Because Gant represents a\n\u201cshift\u201d in the Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\nante, at 1, we must decide whether and how Gant\u2019s new\nrule applies here.\n                             I\n  I agree with the Court about whether Gant\u2019s new rule\napplies. It does apply. Between 1965, when the Court\ndecided Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, and 1987,\nwhen it decided Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, that\nconclusion would have been more difficult to reach. Under\nLinkletter, the Court determined a new rule\u2019s retroactivity\nby looking to several different factors, including whether\nthe new rule represented a \u201cclear break\u201d with the past and\nthe degree of \u201creliance by law enforcement authorities on\nthe old standards.\u201d Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244,\n248\u2013249 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted) (also\n2                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nciting \u201cthe purpose to be served by the new standards\u201d\nand \u201cthe effect on the administration of justice\u201d as factors\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). And the Court would\noften not apply the new rule to identical cases still pend\ning on appeal. See ibid.\n   After 22 years of struggling with its Linkletter approach,\nhowever, the Court decided in Griffith that Linkletter\nhad proved unfair and unworkable. It then substituted a\nclearer approach, stating that \u201ca new rule for the conduct\nof criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all\ncases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet\nfinal, with no exception for cases in which the new rule\nconstitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d 479 U. S., at\n328. The Court today, following Griffith, concludes that\nGant\u2019s new rule applies here. And to that extent I agree\nwith its decision.\n                             II\n   The Court goes on, however, to decide how Gant\u2019s new\nrule will apply. And here it adds a fatal twist. While\nconceding that, like the search in Gant, this search vio\nlated the Fourth Amendment, it holds that, unlike Gant,\nthis defendant is not entitled to a remedy. That is be\ncause the Court finds a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception which\nprevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth\nAmendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally\nseized evidence. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383\n(1914); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). Leaving Davis\nwith a right but not a remedy, the Court \u201ckeep[s] the word\nof promise to our ear\u201d but \u201cbreak[s] it to our hope.\u201d\n                            A\n  At this point I can no longer agree with the Court. A\nnew \u201cgood faith\u201d exception and this Court\u2019s retroactivity\ndecisions are incompatible. For one thing, the Court\u2019s\ndistinction between (1) retroactive application of a new\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and\nruns counter to precedent. To determine that a new rule\nis retroactive is to determine that, at least in the normal\ncase, there is a remedy. As we have previously said, the\n\u201csource of a \u2018new rule\u2019 is the Constitution itself, not any\njudicial power to create new rules of law\u201d; hence, \u201c[w]hat\nwe are actually determining when we assess the \u2018retroac\ntivity\u2019 of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly\nannounced right, but whether a violation of the right that\noccurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will\nentitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.\u201d Dan\nforth v. Minnesota, 552 U. S. 264, 271 (2008). The Court\u2019s\n\u201cgood faith\u201d exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a\nremedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates\n\u201ca categorical bar to obtaining redress\u201d in every case pend\ning when a precedent is overturned. Ante, at 13\u201314.\n   For another thing, the Court\u2019s holding re-creates the\nvery problems that led the Court to abandon Linkletter\u2019s\napproach to retroactivity in favor of Griffith\u2019s. One such\nproblem concerns workability. The Court says that its\nexception applies where there is \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d\npolice \u201creliance on binding appellate precedent.\u201d Ante, at\n1, 19. But to apply the term \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d\noften requires resolution of complex questions of degree.\nDavis conceded that he faced binding anti-Gant precedent\nin the Eleventh Circuit. But future litigants will be less\nforthcoming. Ante, at 18. Indeed, those litigants will now\nhave to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit\nprecedent was not \u201cbinding\u201d lest they find relief foreclosed\neven if they win their constitutional claim.\n   At the same time, Fourth Amendment precedents fre\nquently require courts to \u201cslosh\u201d their \u201cway through the\nfactbound morass of \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Scott v. Harris,\n550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007). Suppose an officer\u2019s conduct is\nconsistent with the language of a Fourth Amendment rule\nthat a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly\n4                  DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndistinguishable facts? Suppose the case creating the rele\nvant precedent did not directly announce any general\nrule but involved highly analogous facts? What about a\nrule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant\u2019s\njurisdiction, had previously accepted? What rules can be\ndeveloped for determining when, where, and how these\ndifferent kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as rele\nvant \u201cbinding precedent\u201d? The Linkletter-like result is\nlikely complex legal argument and police force confusion.\nSee Williams v. United States, 401 U. S. 646, 676 (1971)\n(opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow Linklet\nter decisions as \u201calmost as difficult\u201d as trying to follow \u201cthe\ntracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended\nvictim\u201d).\n   Another such problem concerns fairness. Today\u2019s hold\ning, like that in Linkletter, \u201cviolates basic norms of con\nstitutional adjudication.\u201d Griffith, supra, at 322. It treats\nthe defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way\nwhile treating similarly situated defendants whose cases\nare pending on appeal in a different way. See ante, at 18\u2013\n19. Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong\nwhen he said:\n    \u201cWe cannot release criminals from jail merely because\n    we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to\n    announce a constitutional doctrine] . . . . Simply fish\n    ing one case from the stream of appellate review, us\n    ing it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional\n    standards, and then permitting a stream of similar\n    cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new\n    rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our\n    ordinary] model of judicial review.\u201d Williams, supra,\n    at 679.\nAnd in Griffith, the Court \u201cembraced to a significant ex\ntent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice\nHarlan.\u201d 479 U. S., at 322.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un\nfairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even\nto the defendant in the very case in which it announces a\n\u201cnew rule.\u201d But that approach would make matters worse.\nWhat would then happen in the lower courts? How would\ncourts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their\nprior decisions when other circuits\u2019 cases lead them to\nbelieve those decisions may be wrong? Why would a de\nfendant seek to overturn any such decision? After all, if\nthe (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if\nthe defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he\nloses (on relief). See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 301\n(1967). To what extent then could this Court rely upon\nlower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences\namong themselves\u2014through circuit reconsideration of a\nprecedent that other circuits have criticized? See Ari-\nzona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 23, n. 1 (1995) (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                              B\n   Perhaps more important, the Court\u2019s rationale for creat\ning its new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception threatens to undermine\nwell-settled Fourth Amendment law. The Court correctly\nsays that pre-Gant Eleventh Circuit precedent had held\nthat a Gant-type search was constitutional; hence the\npolice conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent,\nwas \u201cinnocent.\u201d Ante, at 10. But the Court then finds this\nfact sufficient to create a new \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the\nexclusionary rule. It reasons that the \u201csole purpose\u201d of the\nexclusionary rule \u201cis to deter future Fourth Amendment\nviolations,\u201d ante, at 6. The \u201cdeterrence benefits of exclu\nsion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement\nconduct at issue,\u201d ante, at 8 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted). Those benefits are sufficient to jus\ntify exclusion where \u201cpolice exhibit deliberate, reckless,\nor grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment\n6                DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nthose benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the\npolice act with \u201csimple, isolated negligence\u201d or an \u201cobjec\ntively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is\nlawful,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   If the Court means what it says, what will happen to the\nexclusionary rule, a rule that the Court adopted nearly a\ncentury ago for federal courts, Weeks v. United States, 232\nU. S. 383, and made applicable to state courts a half cen\ntury ago through the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v.\nOhio, 367 U. S. 643? The Court has thought of that rule\nnot as punishment for the individual officer or as repara\ntion for the individual defendant but more generally as\nan effective way to secure enforcement of the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s commands. Weeks, supra, at 393 (without\nthe exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment would be \u201cof\nno value,\u201d and \u201cmight as well be stricken from the Consti\ntution\u201d). This Court has deviated from the \u201csuppression\u201d\nnorm in the name of \u201cgood faith\u201d only a handful of times\nand in limited, atypical circumstances: where a magistrate\nhas erroneously issued a warrant, United States v. Leon,\n468 U. S. 897 (1984); where a database has erroneously\ninformed police that they have a warrant, Arizona v.\nEvans, 514 U. S. 1 (1995), Herring v. United States, 555\nU. S. 135 (2009); and where an unconstitutional statute\npurported to authorize the search, Illinois v. Krull, 480\nU. S. 340 (1987). See Herring, supra, at 142 (\u201cgood faith\u201d\nexception inaptly named).\n   The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is\nunderstandable. Defendants frequently move to suppress\nevidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. In many, per\nhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how\nthe Fourth Amendment applied to the particular factual\ncircumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good\nfaith. Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances,\ncourts will find that the police were wrong. And, unless\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previ\nously noted, courts have required the suppression of the\nevidence seized. 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a71.3,\npp. 103\u2013104 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cgood faith\u201d exception has not\nyet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures\nbeyond the \u201crather special situations\u201d of Evans, Herring,\nand Krull). See Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Em\npirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitu\ntional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153\nU. Pa. L. Rev. 1709, 1728 (2005) (suppression motions are\nfiled in approximately 7% of criminal cases; approximately\n12% of suppression motions are successful); LaFave, su\npra, at 64 (\u201cSurely many more Fourth Amendment viola\ntions result from carelessness than from intentional con\nstitutional violations\u201d); Stewart, The Road to Mapp v.\nOhio and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future\nof the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83\nColum. L. Rev. 1365, 1389 (1983) (\u201c[T]he vast majority of\nfourth amendment violations . . . [are] motivated by com\nmendable zeal, not condemnable malice\u201d).\n   But an officer who conducts a search that he believes\ncomplies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately\nturns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nbounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows\nerroneous \u201cbinding precedent.\u201d Nor is an officer more\nculpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive\nrather than \u201cbinding,\u201d where it only describes how to treat\nroughly analogous instances, or where it just does not\nexist. Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it\nwould place determinative weight upon the culpability of\nan individual officer\u2019s conduct, and if it would apply the\nexclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment viola\ntion was \u201cdeliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\u201d then\nthe \u201cgood faith\u201d exception will swallow the exclusionary\nrule. Indeed, our broad dicta in Herring\u2014dicta the Court\nrepeats and expands upon today\u2014may already be leading\n8                 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlower courts in this direction. See United States v. Julius,\n610 F. 3d 60, 66\u201367 (CA2 2010) (assuming warrantless\nsearch was unconstitutional and remanding for District\nCourt to \u201cperform the cost/benefit analysis required by\nHerring\u201d and to consider \u201cwhether the degree of police\nculpability in this case rose beyond mere . . . negligence\u201d\nbefore ordering suppression); United States v. Master, 614\nF. 3d 236, 243 (CA6 2010) (\u201c[T]he Herring Court\u2019s empha\nsis seems weighed more toward preserving evidence for\nuse in obtaining convictions, even if illegally seized . . .\nunless the officers engage in \u2018deliberate, reckless, or\ngrossly negligent conduct\u2019 \u201d (quoting Herring, supra, at\n144)). Today\u2019s decision will doubtless accelerate this\ntrend.\n  Any such change (which may already be underway)\nwould affect not \u201can exceedingly small set of cases,\u201d ante,\nat 18, but a very large number of cases, potentially many\nthousands each year. See Valdes, supra, at 1728. And\nsince the exclusionary rule is often the only sanction avail\nable for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth\nAmendment would no longer protect ordinary Americans\nfrom \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d See Wolf v.\nColorado, 338 U. S. 25, 41 (1949) (Murphy, J., dissenting)\n(overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)) (In\nmany circumstances, \u201cthere is but one alternative to the\nrule of exclusion. That is no sanction at all\u201d); Herring,\nsupra, at 152 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (the exclusionary\nrule is \u201can essential auxiliary\u201d to the Fourth Amendment).\nIt would become a watered-down Fourth Amendment,\noffering its protection against only those searches and sei\nzures that are egregiously unreasonable.\n                           III\n  In sum, I fear that the Court\u2019s opinion will undermine\nthe exclusionary rule.

Such an ap\nproach is consistent with our precedent, and it would\nindeed affect no more than \u201can exceedingly small set of\ncases.\u201d Ante, at 18.\n   For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
