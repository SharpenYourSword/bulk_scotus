UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–1227. Argued February 22, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011\nWhen petitioner Bond discovered that her close friend was pregnant by\n Bond’s husband, she began harassing the woman. The woman suf\n fered a minor burn after Bond put caustic substances on objects the\n woman was likely to touch. Bond was indicted for violating 18\n U. S. C. §229, which forbids knowing possession or use, for nonpeace\n ful purposes, of a chemical that “can cause death, temporary inca\n pacitation or permanent harm to humans,” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8),\n and which is part of a federal Act implementing a chemical weapons\n treaty ratified by the United States. The District Court denied\n Bond’s motion to dismiss the §229 charges on the ground that the\n statute exceeded Congress’ constitutional authority to enact. She en\n tered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the rul\n ing on the statute’s validity. She did just that, renewing her Tenth\n Amendment claim. The Third Circuit, however, accepted the Gov\n ernment’s position that she lacked standing. The Government has\n since changed its view on Bond’s standing.\nHeld: Bond has standing to challenge the federal statute on grounds\n that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to States.\n Pp. 3–14.\n    (a) The Third Circuit relied on a single sentence in Tennessee Elec.\n Power Co. v.

See\n Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp,\n 397 U. S. 150, 152–154. Here, Article III’s standing requirement had\n no bearing on Bond’s capacity to assert defenses in the District Court.\n And Article III’s prerequisites are met with regard to her standing to\n appeal.

There, the Court declined to reach the merits where\n    private power companies sought to enjoin the federally chartered\n    Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing and selling electric\n    power, claiming that the statute creating the TVA exceeded the Na\n    tional Government’s powers in violation of the Tenth Amendment. In\n    doing so, the Court repeatedly stated that the problem with the\n    power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a “cause of action,”\n    treating those concepts as interchangeable. E.g., 306 U. S., at 139.\n    The question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief typically\n    “goes to the merits” of a case, however, not to the dispute’s justiciabil\n    ity, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 92, and\n    conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion. This happened\n    with Tennessee Electric’s Tenth Amendment discussion. The state\n    ment on which the Third Circuit relied here, see 306 U. S., at 144,\n    should be read to refer to the absence of a cause of action for injury\n    caused by economic competition. To the extent the statement might\n    instead be read to suggest a private party does not have standing to\n    raise a Tenth Amendment issue, it is inconsistent with this Court’s\n    later precedents and should be deemed neither controlling nor in\n    structive on the issue of standing as that term is now defined and ap\n    plied. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment, contends that for\n    Bond to argue the National Government has interfered with state\n    sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert only a\n    State’s legal rights and interests. But in arguing that the Govern\n    ment has acted in excess of the authority that federalism defines,\n    Bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. Pp. 8–14.\n         (1) Federalism has more than one dynamic. In allocating powers\n    between the States and National Government, federalism “ ‘secures\n    to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign\n    power,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181. It enables\n    States to enact positive law in response to the initiative of those who\n    seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times, and it protects\n    the liberty of all persons within a State by ensuring that law enacted\n    in excess of delegated governmental power cannot direct or control\n    their actions. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458. Federal\n    ism’s limitations are not therefore a matter of rights belonging only\n    to the States. In a proper case, a litigant may challenge a law as en\n    acted in contravention of federalism, just as injured individuals may\n    challenge actions that transgress, e.g., separation-of-powers limita\n    tions, see, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919. The claim need not de\n    pend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitutional interests,\n    even if those interests are also implicated.

S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n        (2) The Government errs in contending that Bond should be\n  permitted to assert only that Congress could not enact the challenged\n  statute under its enumerated powers but that standing should be de\n  nied if she argues that the statute interferes with state sovereignty.\n  Here, Bond asserts that the public policy of the Pennsylvania, en\n  acted in its capacity as sovereign, has been displaced by that of the\n  National Government. The law to which she is subject, the prosecu\n  tion she seeks to counter, and the punishment she must face might\n  not have come about had the matter been left for Pennsylvania to de\n  cide. There is no support for the Government’s proposed distinction\n  between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential\n  standing rules. The principles of limited national powers and state\n  sovereignty are intertwined. Impermissible interference with state\n  sovereignty is not within the National Government’s enumerated\n  powers, and action exceeding the National Government’s enumerated\n  powers undermines the States’ sovereign interests. Individuals seek\n  ing to challenge such measures are subject to Article III and pruden\n  tial standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims, but here,\n  where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or con\n  troversy, she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from\n  disregard of the federal structure of the Government.

She relied on the Tenth\nAmendment, and, by extension, on the premise that Con­\ngress exceeded its powers by enacting it in contravention\nof basic federalism principles. The statute, 18 U. S. C.\n§229, was enacted to comply with a treaty; but petitioner\ncontends that, at least in the present instance, the treaty\ncannot be the source of congressional power to regulate or\nprohibit her conduct.\n  The Court of Appeals held that because a State was not\na party to the federal criminal proceeding, petitioner had\nno standing to challenge the statute as an infringement\nupon the powers reserved to the States. Having concluded\nthat petitioner does have standing to challenge the federal\nstatute on these grounds, this Court now reverses that\n2                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermination. The merits of petitioner’s challenge to the\nstatute’s validity are to be considered, in the first instance,\nby the Court of Appeals on remand and are not addressed\nin this opinion.\n                              I\n   This case arises from a bitter personal dispute, leading\nto the criminal acts charged here. Petitioner Carol Anne\nBond lived outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After dis­\ncovering that her close friend was pregnant and that\nthe father was Bond’s husband, Bond sought revenge.\nBond subjected the woman to a campaign of harassing\ntelephone calls and letters, acts that resulted in a crimi­\nnal conviction on a minor state charge. Bond persisted in\nher hostile acts, placing caustic substances on objects the\nwoman was likely to touch, including her mailbox, car\ndoor handle, and front doorknob. Bond’s victim suffered a\nminor burn on her hand and contacted federal investiga­\ntors, who identified Bond as the perpetrator.\n   Bond was indicted in the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for, among other\noffenses, two counts of violating §229. Section 229 forbids\nknowing possession or use of any chemical that “can cause\ndeath, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to\nhumans or animals” where not intended for a “peaceful\npurpose.” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8). The statute was en­\nacted as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention\nImplementation Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–856, 22\nU. S. C. §6701 et seq.; 18 U. S. C. §229 et seq. The Act\nimplements provisions of the Convention on the Prohibi­\ntion of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use\nof Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, a treaty\nthe United States ratified in 1997.\n   In the District Court, Bond moved to dismiss the §229\ncharges, contending the statute was beyond Congress’\nconstitutional authority to enact. The District Court\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndenied the motion. Bond entered a conditional plea of\nguilty, reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the\nvalidity of the statute. She was sentenced to six years in\nprison.\n   In the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Bond\nrenewed her challenge to the statute, citing, among other\nauthorities, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.\nThe Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefs on the\nquestion whether Bond had standing to raise the Tenth\nAmendment as a ground for invalidating a federal statute\nin the absence of a State’s participation in the proceedings.\n   In its supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals, the\nGovernment took the position that Bond did not have\nstanding. The Court of Appeals agreed. 581 F. 3d 128\n(2009).\n   When Bond sought certiorari, the Government advised\nthis Court that it had changed its position and that, in its\nview, Bond does have standing to challenge the constitu­\ntionality of §229 on Tenth Amendment grounds. See Brief\nfor United States (filed July 9, 2010). The Court granted\ncertiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), and appointed an amicus\ncuriae to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nStephen McAllister, a member of the bar of this Court,\nfiled an amicus brief and presented an oral argument that\nhave been of considerable assistance to the Court.\n                            II\n  To conclude that petitioner lacks standing to challenge\na federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes\nwith the powers reserved to States, the Court of Appeals\nrelied on a single sentence from this Court’s opinion in\nTennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118 (1939).\nSee 581 F. 3d, at 136–138. As the Court of Appeals noted\nhere, other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar ap­\nproach. E.g., United States v.

It\nshould be clear that Tennessee Electric does not cast doubt\non Bond’s standing for purposes of Article III’s case-or­\ncontroversy requirement. This Court long ago disap­\nproved of the case as authoritative respecting Article III\nlimitations. Association of Data Processing Service Or\nganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 152–154 (1970).\nIn the instant case, moreover, it is apparent—and in\nfact conceded not only by the Government but also by\namicus—that Article III poses no barrier. One who seeks\nto initiate or continue proceedings in federal court must\ndemonstrate, among other requirements, both standing to\nobtain the relief requested, see Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992), and, in addition,\nan “ongoing interest in the dispute” on the part of the\nopposing party that is sufficient to establish “concrete\nadverseness.” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). When\nthose conditions are met, Article III does not restrict the\nopposing party’s ability to object to relief being sought at\nits expense. The requirement of Article III standing thus\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad no bearing upon Bond’s capacity to assert defenses in\nthe District Court. As for Bond’s standing to appeal, it is\nclear Article III’s prerequisites are met. Bond’s challenge\nto her conviction and sentence “satisfies the case-or­\ncontroversy requirement, because the incarceration . . .\nconstitutes a concrete injury, caused by the conviction and\nredressable by invalidation of the conviction.” Spencer v.\nKemna, 523 U. S. 1, 7 (1998).\n   To resolve the case, this Court must consider next\nwhether Tennessee Electric is irrelevant with respect to\nprudential rules of standing as well. The question in\nTennessee Electric was whether a group of private power\ncompanies could bring suit to enjoin the federally char­\ntered Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing\nand selling electric power. It was conceded that competi­\ntion from the TVA would “inflict substantial damage” upon\nthe power companies. 306 U. S., at 137. According to the\ncompanies, the federal statute authorizing the creation\nand operation of the TVA was invalid because, among\nother reasons, it exceeded the powers of the National\nGovernment in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\n   Declining to reach the merits, the Court concluded the\npower companies’ lawsuit should be dismissed. It ex­\nplained that the suit was premised on the principle that a\nperson threatened with injury by conduct “which, but for\nstatutory authority for its performance, would be a viola­\ntion of his legal rights” could request an injunction from a\ncourt of equity and by this means test the validity of the\nstatute. Ibid. But the Court concluded that the TVA,\neven if it were shorn of congressional statutory authority,\nhad done nothing more than compete as a supplier of\nelectricity. Id., at 138. And since state law did not pur­\nport to grant any of the power companies a monopoly,\nthere was no basis for a suit in which the TVA might be\nforced to invoke its congressional authorization. Id., at\n138–143.\n6                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In that part of its analysis, and throughout its opinion,\nthe Tennessee Electric Court stated that the problem with\nthe power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a\n“cause of action.” It treated those concepts as inter­\nchangeable. E.g., id., at 139 (no “standing” because no\n“legal cause of complaint”); id., at 139–140 (no “standing”\nwithout “a cause of action or a right to sue”); id., at 142\n(“no standing,” no “right to sue for an injunction”); id.,\nat 144 (no Tenth Amendment “standing” and no Ninth\nAmendment “cause of action” for same reasons); see also\nBellia, Article III and the Cause of Action, 89 Iowa L. Rev.\n777, 826–830 (2004).\n   Even though decisions since Tennessee Electric have\nbeen careful to use the terms “cause of action” and “stand­\ning” with more precision, the distinct concepts can be\ndifficult to keep separate. If, for instance, the person\nalleging injury is remote from the zone of interests a stat­\nute protects, whether there is a legal injury at all and\nwhether the particular litigant is one who may assert it\ncan involve similar inquiries. Steel Co. v. Citizens for\nBetter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 96–97, and n. 2 (1998)\n(noting that statutory standing and the existence of a\ncause of action are “closely connected” and “sometimes\nidentical” questions).\n   Still, the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for\nrelief “goes to the merits” in the typical case, not the justi­\nciability of a dispute, id., at 92, and conflation of the two\nconcepts can cause confusion. This is the case with the\nTenth Amendment discussion in Tennessee Electric. The\nTennessee Electric Court noted that “[a] distinct ground\nupon which standing to maintain the suit is said to rest is\nthat the acts of the Authority cannot be upheld without\npermitting federal regulation of purely local matters re­\nserved to the states or the people by the Tenth Amend­\nment.” 306 U. S., at 143. The Court rejected the argu­\nment, however, concluding the Tenth Amendment did not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive one business a right to keep another from compet-\ning. Id., at 144. (“The sale of government property in\ncompetition with others is not a violation of the Tenth\nAmendment”).\n  The Court then added the sentence upon which the\nCourt of Appeals relied in the instant case, the sentence\nthat has been the source of disagreement among Courts of\nAppeals:\n    “As we have seen there is no objection to the Author­\n    ity’s operations by the states, and, if this were not so,\n    the appellants, absent the states or their officers, have\n    no standing in this suit to raise any question under\n    the amendment.” Ibid.\nThe quoted statement was in the context of a decision\nwhich held that business competitors had no legal injury,\nand the word standing can be interpreted in that sense.\nOn this reading, the statement reiterated an earlier point.\nThe statement explained that the States in which the TVA\noperated exempted it from their public utilities regula­\ntions; and that even if the States had not done so and the\nTVA had violated those regulations, the regulations were\nfor the States to enforce. See id., at 141–142. They con­\nferred no private right of action on business competitors.\nThis reading is consistent with the Tennessee Electric\nCourt’s use of the term “standing” elsewhere in its opinion\nto refer to the existence of a state-law cause of action. A\nholding that state utilities regulations did not supply a\ncause of action against a competitor is of no relevance to\nthe instant case, and we need not explore all of its implica­\ntions. See also Data Processing, 397 U. S., at 157–158\n(cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU. S. C. §702, permits suit based on injury from business\ncompetition).\n   Yet the quoted statement also could be read to refer to\nstanding in the sense of whether the power companies\n8                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere the proper litigants to raise a Tenth Amendment is­\nsue. To the extent that might have been the intention of\nthe Tennessee Electric Court, it is, for reasons to be ex­\nplained, inconsistent with our later precedents. The sen­\ntence from Tennessee Electric that we have quoted and\ndiscussed should be deemed neither controlling nor in­\nstructive on the issue of standing as that term is now\ndefined and applied.\n                             III\n  Amicus contends that federal courts should not adjudi­\ncate a claim like Bond’s because of the prudential rule that\na party “generally must assert his own legal rights and\ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal\nrights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422\nU. S. 490, 499, 500 (1975); see also Kowalski v. Tesmer,\n543 U. S. 125, 129–130 (2004). In amicus’ view, to argue\nthat the National Government has interfered with state\nsovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to\nassert the legal rights and interests of States and States\nalone. That, however, is not so. As explained below, Bond\nseeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. The\nindividual, in a proper case, can assert injury from gov­\nernmental action taken in excess of the authority that\nfederalism defines. Her rights in this regard do not belong\nto a State.\n                             A\n  The federal system rests on what might at first seem a\ncounterintuitive insight, that “freedom is enhanced by the\ncreation of two governments, not one.” Alden v. Maine,\n527 U. S. 706, 758 (1999). The Framers concluded that\nallocation of powers between the National Government\nand the States enhances freedom, first by protecting the\nintegrity of the governments themselves, and second by\nprotecting the people, from whom all governmental powers\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare derived.\n   Federalism has more than one dynamic. It is true that\nthe federal structure serves to grant and delimit the pre­\nrogatives and responsibilities of the States and the Na­\ntional Government vis-à-vis one another. The allocation\nof powers in our federal system preserves the integrity,\ndignity, and residual sovereignty of the States. The fed­\neral balance is, in part, an end in itself, to ensure that\nStates function as political entities in their own right.\n   But that is not its exclusive sphere of operation. Feder­\nalism is more than an exercise in setting the boundary\nbetween different institutions of government for their own\nintegrity. “State sovereignty is not just an end in itself:\n‘Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that\nderive from the diffusion of sovereign power.’ ” New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (quoting Coleman\nv. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759 (1991) (Blackmun, J.,\ndissenting)).\n   Some of these liberties are of a political character. The\nfederal structure allows local policies “more sensitive to\nthe diverse needs of a heterogeneous society,” permits\n“innovation and experimentation,” enables greater citizen\n“involvement in democratic processes,” and makes gov­\nernment “more responsive by putting the States in com­\npetition for a mobile citizenry.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501\nU. S. 452, 458 (1991). Federalism secures the freedom of\nthe individual. It allows States to respond, through the\nenactment of positive law, to the initiative of those who\nseek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times\nwithout having to rely solely upon the political processes\nthat control a remote central power. True, of course, these\nobjects cannot be vindicated by the Judiciary in the ab­\nsence of a proper case or controversy; but the individual\nliberty secured by federalism is not simply derivative of\nthe rights of the States.\n   Federalism also protects the liberty of all persons within\n10                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na State by ensuring that laws enacted in excess of dele­\ngated governmental power cannot direct or control their\nactions. See ibid. By denying any one government com­\nplete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, feder­\nalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary\npower. When government acts in excess of its lawful\npowers, that liberty is at stake.\n  The limitations that federalism entails are not therefore\na matter of rights belonging only to the States. States are\nnot the sole intended beneficiaries of federalism. See New\nYork, supra, at 181. An individual has a direct interest in\nobjecting to laws that upset the constitutional balance\nbetween the National Government and the States when\nthe enforcement of those laws causes injury that is con­\ncrete, particular, and redressable. Fidelity to principles of\nfederalism is not for the States alone to vindicate.\n  The recognition of an injured person’s standing to object\nto a violation of a constitutional principle that allocates\npower within government is illustrated, in an analogous\ncontext, by cases in which individuals sustain discrete,\njusticiable injury from actions that transgress separation­\nof-powers limitations. Separation-of-powers principles are\nintended, in part, to protect each branch of government\nfrom incursion by the others. Yet the dynamic between\nand among the branches is not the only object of the Con­\nstitution’s concern. The structural principles secured by\nthe separation of powers protect the individual as well.\n  In the precedents of this Court, the claims of individu­\nals—not of Government departments—have been the\nprincipal source of judicial decisions concerning separation\nof powers and checks and balances. For example, the re­\nquirement that a bill enacted by Congress be presented\nto the President for signature before it can become law\ngives the President a check over Congress’ exercise of\nlegislative power. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §7. Yet indi­\nviduals, too, are protected by the operations of separation\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof powers and checks and balances; and they are not dis­\nabled from relying on those principles in otherwise justici­\nable cases and controversies. In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.\n919 (1983), it was an individual who successfully chal­\nlenged the so-called legislative veto—a procedure that\nCongress used in an attempt to invalidate an executive\ndetermination without presenting the measure to the\nPresident. The procedure diminished the role of the Ex­\necutive, but the challenger sought to protect not the\nprerogatives of the Presidency as such but rather his\nown right to avoid deportation under an invalid order.\nChadha’s challenge was sustained. A cardinal principle of\nseparation of powers was vindicated at the insistence of an\nindividual, indeed one who was not a citizen of the United\nStates but who still was a person whose liberty was at\nrisk.\n   Chadha is not unique in this respect. Compare Clinton\nv. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 433–436 (1998) (injured\nparties have standing to challenge Presidential line-item\nveto) with Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 829–830 (1997)\n(Congress Members do not); see also, e.g., Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. ___ (2010); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211 (1995); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986); North\nern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458\nU. S. 50 (1982); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579 (1952); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\nUnited States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935). If the constitutional\nstructure of our Government that protects individual\nliberty is compromised, individuals who suffer otherwise\njusticiable injury may object.\n   Just as it is appropriate for an individual, in a proper\ncase, to invoke separation-of-powers or checks-and­\nbalances constraints, so too may a litigant, in a proper\ncase, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of consti­\ntutional principles of federalism. That claim need not\n12                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndepend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitu­\ntional interests, even if a State’s constitutional interests\nare also implicated.\n                               B\n   In this regard it is necessary to address a misconception\nin the position the Government now urges this Court to\nadopt. As noted, the Government agrees that petitioner\nhas standing to challenge the validity of §229. That con­\ncession, however, depends on describing petitioner’s claim\nin a narrow way. The Government contends petitioner\nasserts only that Congress could not enact the challenged\nstatute under its enumerated powers. Were she to argue,\nthe Government insists, that the statute “interferes with a\nspecific aspect of state sovereignty,” either instead of or in\naddition to her enumerated powers contention, the Court\nshould deny her standing. Brief for United States 18 (filed\nDec. 3, 2010).\n   The premise that petitioner does or should avoid making\nan “interference-with-sovereignty” argument is flawed.\nId., at 33. Here she asserts, for example, that the conduct\nwith which she is charged is “local in nature” and “should\nbe left to local authorities to prosecute” and that congres­\nsional regulation of that conduct “signals a massive and\nunjustifiable expansion of federal law enforcement into\nstate-regulated domain.” Record in No. 2:07–cr–00528–\nJG–1 (ED Pa.), Doc. 27, pp. 6, 19. The public policy of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capacity as\nsovereign, has been displaced by that of the National\nGovernment. The law to which petitioner is subject, the\nprosecution she seeks to counter, and the punishment she\nmust face might not have come about if the matter were\nleft for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to decide.\nIndeed, petitioner argues that under Pennsylvania law the\nexpected maximum term of imprisonment she could have\nreceived for the same conduct was barely more than a\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The princi-\nples of limited national powers and state sovereignty are\nintertwined. While neither originates in the Tenth Amend­\nment, both are expressed by it. Impermissible interfer­\nence with state sovereignty is not within the enumerated\npowers of the National Government, see New York, 505\nU. S., at 155–159, and action that exceeds the National\nGovernment’s enumerated powers undermines the sover­\neign interests of States. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 564 (1995). The unconstitutional action can\ncause concomitant injury to persons in individual cases.\n   An individual who challenges federal action on these\ngrounds is, of course, subject to the Article III require­\nments, as well as prudential rules, applicable to all liti­\ngants and claims. Individuals have “no standing to com­\nplain simply that their Government is violating the law.”\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984). It is not\nenough that a litigant “suffers in some indefinite way in\ncommon with people generally.” Frothingham v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (decided with Massachusetts v.\nMellon). If, in connection with the claim being asserted, a\nlitigant who commences suit fails to show actual or immi­\nnent harm that is concrete and particular, fairly traceable\nto the conduct complained of, and likely to be redressed by\na favorable decision, the Federal Judiciary cannot hear the\nclaim. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561. These requirements\nmust be satisfied before an individual may assert a consti­\ntutional claim; and in some instances, the result may be\nthat a State is the only entity capable of demonstrating\nthe requisite injury.\n   In this case, however, where the litigant is a party to an\notherwise justiciable case or controversy, she is not forbid­\nden to object that her injury results from disregard of the\n14                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal structure of our Government. Whether the Tenth\nAmendment is regarded as simply a “ ‘truism,’ ” New York,\nsupra, at 156 (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S.\n100, 124 (1941)), or whether it has independent force of its\nown, the result here is the same.\n                          *   *     *\n   There is no basis in precedent or principle to deny peti­\ntioner’s standing to raise her claims. The ultimate issue of\nthe statute’s validity turns in part on whether the law can\nbe deemed “necessary and proper for carrying into Execu­\ntion” the President’s Article II, §2 Treaty Power, see U. S.\nConst., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. This Court expresses no view on\nthe merits of that argument. It can be addressed by the\nCourt of Appeals on remand.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Bond, like any other defendant,\nhas a personal right not to be convicted under a constitu\ntionally invalid law. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial\nChallenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev.\n1321, 1331–1333 (2000); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981\nSup. Ct. Rev. 1, 3. See also North Carolina v. Pearce, 395\nU. S. 711, 739 (1969) (Black, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“Due process . . . is a guarantee that a\nman should be tried and convicted only in accordance with\nvalid laws of the land.”).\n   In this case, Bond argues that the statute under which\nshe was charged, 18 U. S. C. §229, exceeds Congress’\nenumerated powers and violates the Tenth Amendment.\nOther defendants might assert that a law exceeds Con\ngress’ power because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nor the Establishment Clause, or the Due Process Clause.\nWhatever the claim, success on the merits would require\nreversal of the conviction. “An offence created by [an\nunconstitutional law],” the Court has held, “is not a\ncrime.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376 (1880). “A\nconviction under [such a law] is not merely erroneous, but\nis illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of impris\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nonment.” Id., at 376–377. If a law is invalid as applied to\nthe criminal defendant’s conduct, the defendant is entitled\nto go free.\n   For this reason, a court has no “prudential” license to\ndecline to consider whether the statute under which the\ndefendant has been charged lacks constitutional applica\ntion to her conduct. And that is so even where the consti\ntutional provision that would render the conviction void is\ndirected at protecting a party not before the Court. Our\ndecisions concerning criminal laws infected with discrimi\nnation are illustrative. The Court must entertain the\nobjection—and reverse the conviction—even if the right to\nequal treatment resides in someone other than the de\nfendant. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 452–455\n(1972) (reversing conviction for distributing contraceptives\nbecause the law banning distribution violated the recipi\nent’s right to equal protection); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429\nU. S. 190, 192, 210, and n. 24 (1976) (law penalizing sale\nof beer to males but not females aged 18 to 20 could not\nbe enforced against vendor). See also Grayned v. City of\nRockford, 408 U. S. 104, 107, n. 2 (1972); Welsh v. United\nStates, 398 U. S. 333, 361–362 (1970) (Harlan, J., concur\nring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward,\nCongress would cure the unequal treatment by extending\nrather than invalidating the criminal proscription).\n   In short, a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any\nreason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S.\n332, 341 (1928). The validity of Bond’s conviction depends\nupon whether the Constitution permits Congress to enact\n§229. Her claim that it does not must be considered and\ndecided on the merits.\n</pre>", "id": 218927, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/06/16/Bond_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 22, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011\nWhen petitioner Bond discovered that her close friend was pregnant by\n Bond’s husband, she began harassing the woman. The woman suf\n fered a minor burn after Bond put caustic substances on objects the\n woman was likely to touch. Bond was indicted for violating 18\n U. S. C. §229, which forbids knowing possession or use, for nonpeace\n ful purposes, of a chemical that “can cause death, temporary inca\n pacitation or permanent harm to humans,” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8),\n and which is part of a federal Act implementing a chemical weapons\n treaty ratified by the United States. The District Court denied\n Bond’s motion to dismiss the §229 charges on the ground that the\n statute exceeded Congress’ constitutional authority to enact. She en\n tered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the rul\n ing on the statute’s validity. She did just that, renewing her Tenth\n Amendment claim. The Third Circuit, however, accepted the Gov\n ernment’s position that she lacked standing. The Government has\n since changed its view on Bond’s standing.\nHeld: Bond has standing to challenge the federal statute on grounds\n that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to States.\n Pp. 3–14.\n    (a) The Third Circuit relied on a single sentence in Tennessee Elec.\n Power Co. v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (2) Tennessee Electric is also irrelevant with respect to prudential\n    standing rules. There, the Court declined to reach the merits where\n    private power companies sought to enjoin the federally chartered\n    Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing and selling electric\n    power, claiming that the statute creating the TVA exceeded the Na\n    tional Government’s powers in violation of the Tenth Amendment. In\n    doing so, the Court repeatedly stated that the problem with the\n    power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a “cause of action,”\n    treating those concepts as interchangeable. E.g., 306 U. S., at 139.\n    The question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief typically\n    “goes to the merits” of a case, however, not to the dispute’s justiciabil\n    ity, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 92, and\n    conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion. This happened\n    with Tennessee Electric’s Tenth Amendment discussion. The state\n    ment on which the Third Circuit relied here, see 306 U. S., at 144,\n    should be read to refer to the absence of a cause of action for injury\n    caused by economic competition. To the extent the statement might\n    instead be read to suggest a private party does not have standing to\n    raise a Tenth Amendment issue, it is inconsistent with this Court’s\n    later precedents and should be deemed neither controlling nor in\n    structive on the issue of standing as that term is now defined and ap\n    plied. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Amicus, appointed to defend the judgment, contends that for\n    Bond to argue the National Government has interfered with state\n    sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert only a\n    State’s legal rights and interests. But in arguing that the Govern\n    ment has acted in excess of the authority that federalism defines,\n    Bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. Pp. 8–14.\n         (1) Federalism has more than one dynamic. In allocating powers\n    between the States and National Government, federalism “ ‘secures\n    to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign\n    power,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 181. It enables\n    States to enact positive law in response to the initiative of those who\n    seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times, and it protects\n    the liberty of all persons within a State by ensuring that law enacted\n    in excess of delegated governmental power cannot direct or control\n    their actions. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458. Federal\n    ism’s limitations are not therefore a matter of rights belonging only\n    to the States. In a proper case, a litigant may challenge a law as en\n    acted in contravention of federalism, just as injured individuals may\n    challenge actions that transgress, e.g., separation-of-powers limita\n    tions, see, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919. The claim need not de\n    pend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitutional interests,\n    even if those interests are also implicated.

The law to which she is subject, the prosecu\n  tion she seeks to counter, and the punishment she must face might\n  not have come about had the matter been left for Pennsylvania to de\n  cide. There is no support for the Government’s proposed distinction\n  between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential\n  standing rules. The principles of limited national powers and state\n  sovereignty are intertwined. Impermissible interference with state\n  sovereignty is not within the National Government’s enumerated\n  powers, and action exceeding the National Government’s enumerated\n  powers undermines the States’ sovereign interests. Individuals seek\n  ing to challenge such measures are subject to Article III and pruden\n  tial standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims, but here,\n  where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or con\n  troversy, she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from\n  disregard of the federal structure of the Government.

C.\n§229, was enacted to comply with a treaty; but petitioner\ncontends that, at least in the present instance, the treaty\ncannot be the source of congressional power to regulate or\nprohibit her conduct.\n  The Court of Appeals held that because a State was not\na party to the federal criminal proceeding, petitioner had\nno standing to challenge the statute as an infringement\nupon the powers reserved to the States. Having concluded\nthat petitioner does have standing to challenge the federal\nstatute on these grounds, this Court now reverses that\n2                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermination. The merits of petitioner’s challenge to the\nstatute’s validity are to be considered, in the first instance,\nby the Court of Appeals on remand and are not addressed\nin this opinion.\n                              I\n   This case arises from a bitter personal dispute, leading\nto the criminal acts charged here. Petitioner Carol Anne\nBond lived outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After dis­\ncovering that her close friend was pregnant and that\nthe father was Bond’s husband, Bond sought revenge.\nBond subjected the woman to a campaign of harassing\ntelephone calls and letters, acts that resulted in a crimi­\nnal conviction on a minor state charge. Bond persisted in\nher hostile acts, placing caustic substances on objects the\nwoman was likely to touch, including her mailbox, car\ndoor handle, and front doorknob. Bond’s victim suffered a\nminor burn on her hand and contacted federal investiga­\ntors, who identified Bond as the perpetrator.\n   Bond was indicted in the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for, among other\noffenses, two counts of violating §229. Section 229 forbids\nknowing possession or use of any chemical that “can cause\ndeath, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to\nhumans or animals” where not intended for a “peaceful\npurpose.” §§229(a); 229F(1); (7); (8). The statute was en­\nacted as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention\nImplementation Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–856, 22\nU. S. C. §6701 et seq.; 18 U. S. C. §229 et seq. The Act\nimplements provisions of the Convention on the Prohibi­\ntion of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use\nof Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, a treaty\nthe United States ratified in 1997.\n   In the District Court, Bond moved to dismiss the §229\ncharges, contending the statute was beyond Congress’\nconstitutional authority to enact. The District Court\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndenied the motion. Bond entered a conditional plea of\nguilty, reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the\nvalidity of the statute. She was sentenced to six years in\nprison.\n   In the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Bond\nrenewed her challenge to the statute, citing, among other\nauthorities, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.\nThe Court of Appeals asked for supplemental briefs on the\nquestion whether Bond had standing to raise the Tenth\nAmendment as a ground for invalidating a federal statute\nin the absence of a State’s participation in the proceedings.\n   In its supplemental brief in the Court of Appeals, the\nGovernment took the position that Bond did not have\nstanding. The Court of Appeals agreed. 581 F. 3d 128\n(2009).\n   When Bond sought certiorari, the Government advised\nthis Court that it had changed its position and that, in its\nview, Bond does have standing to challenge the constitu­\ntionality of §229 on Tenth Amendment grounds. See Brief\nfor United States (filed July 9, 2010). The Court granted\ncertiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), and appointed an amicus\ncuriae to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nStephen McAllister, a member of the bar of this Court,\nfiled an amicus brief and presented an oral argument that\nhave been of considerable assistance to the Court.\n                            II\n  To conclude that petitioner lacks standing to challenge\na federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes\nwith the powers reserved to States, the Court of Appeals\nrelied on a single sentence from this Court’s opinion in\nTennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118 (1939).\nSee 581 F. 3d, at 136–138. As the Court of Appeals noted\nhere, other Courts of Appeals have taken a similar ap­\nproach. E.g., United States v. Hacker, 565 F.3d 522, 525–\n527 (CA8 2009); Oregon v. Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F. 3d\n4                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n965, 971–972 (CA9 2009); Brooklyn Legal Servs. Corp. v.\nLegal Servs. Corp., 462 F. 3d 219, 234–235 (CA2 2006);\nMedeiros v. Vincent, 431 F. 3d 25, 33–36 (CA1 2005);\nUnited States v. Parker, 362 F. 3d 1279, 1284–1285 (CA10\n2004). That approach is in tension, if not conflict, with\ndecisions of some other Courts of Appeals. See Gillespie v.\nIndianapolis, 185 F. 3d 693, 700–704 (CA7 1999); Metro\nlina Family Practice Group, P. A. v. Sullivan, 767 F. Supp.\n1314 (WDNC 1989), aff’d 929 F. 2d 693 (CA4 1991); At\nlanta Gas Light Co. v. United States Dept. of Energy, 666\nF. 2d 1359, 1368, n. 16 (CA11 1982); see also United States\nv. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 918–921 (CA5 2011) (reserving\nissue); Lomont v. O’Neill, 285 F. 3d 9, 14, n. 5 (CADC\n2002) (same); Nance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 716 (CA9\n1981) (same).\n   Tennessee Electric is the appropriate place to begin. It\nshould be clear that Tennessee Electric does not cast doubt\non Bond’s standing for purposes of Article III’s case-or­\ncontroversy requirement. This Court long ago disap­\nproved of the case as authoritative respecting Article III\nlimitations. Association of Data Processing Service Or\nganizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 152–154 (1970).\nIn the instant case, moreover, it is apparent—and in\nfact conceded not only by the Government but also by\namicus—that Article III poses no barrier. One who seeks\nto initiate or continue proceedings in federal court must\ndemonstrate, among other requirements, both standing to\nobtain the relief requested, see Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561 (1992), and, in addition,\nan “ongoing interest in the dispute” on the part of the\nopposing party that is sufficient to establish “concrete\nadverseness.” Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted). When\nthose conditions are met, Article III does not restrict the\nopposing party’s ability to object to relief being sought at\nits expense. The requirement of Article III standing thus\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad no bearing upon Bond’s capacity to assert defenses in\nthe District Court. As for Bond’s standing to appeal, it is\nclear Article III’s prerequisites are met. Bond’s challenge\nto her conviction and sentence “satisfies the case-or­\ncontroversy requirement, because the incarceration . . .\nconstitutes a concrete injury, caused by the conviction and\nredressable by invalidation of the conviction.” Spencer v.\nKemna, 523 U. S. 1, 7 (1998).\n   To resolve the case, this Court must consider next\nwhether Tennessee Electric is irrelevant with respect to\nprudential rules of standing as well. The question in\nTennessee Electric was whether a group of private power\ncompanies could bring suit to enjoin the federally char­\ntered Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from producing\nand selling electric power. It was conceded that competi­\ntion from the TVA would “inflict substantial damage” upon\nthe power companies. 306 U. S., at 137. According to the\ncompanies, the federal statute authorizing the creation\nand operation of the TVA was invalid because, among\nother reasons, it exceeded the powers of the National\nGovernment in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\n   Declining to reach the merits, the Court concluded the\npower companies’ lawsuit should be dismissed. It ex­\nplained that the suit was premised on the principle that a\nperson threatened with injury by conduct “which, but for\nstatutory authority for its performance, would be a viola­\ntion of his legal rights” could request an injunction from a\ncourt of equity and by this means test the validity of the\nstatute. Ibid. But the Court concluded that the TVA,\neven if it were shorn of congressional statutory authority,\nhad done nothing more than compete as a supplier of\nelectricity. Id., at 138. And since state law did not pur­\nport to grant any of the power companies a monopoly,\nthere was no basis for a suit in which the TVA might be\nforced to invoke its congressional authorization. Id., at\n138–143.\n6                  BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In that part of its analysis, and throughout its opinion,\nthe Tennessee Electric Court stated that the problem with\nthe power companies’ suit was a lack of “standing” or a\n“cause of action.” It treated those concepts as inter­\nchangeable. E.g., id., at 139 (no “standing” because no\n“legal cause of complaint”); id., at 139–140 (no “standing”\nwithout “a cause of action or a right to sue”); id., at 142\n(“no standing,” no “right to sue for an injunction”); id.,\nat 144 (no Tenth Amendment “standing” and no Ninth\nAmendment “cause of action” for same reasons); see also\nBellia, Article III and the Cause of Action, 89 Iowa L. Rev.\n777, 826–830 (2004).\n   Even though decisions since Tennessee Electric have\nbeen careful to use the terms “cause of action” and “stand­\ning” with more precision, the distinct concepts can be\ndifficult to keep separate. If, for instance, the person\nalleging injury is remote from the zone of interests a stat­\nute protects, whether there is a legal injury at all and\nwhether the particular litigant is one who may assert it\ncan involve similar inquiries. Steel Co. v. Citizens for\nBetter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 96–97, and n. 2 (1998)\n(noting that statutory standing and the existence of a\ncause of action are “closely connected” and “sometimes\nidentical” questions).\n   Still, the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for\nrelief “goes to the merits” in the typical case, not the justi­\nciability of a dispute, id., at 92, and conflation of the two\nconcepts can cause confusion. This is the case with the\nTenth Amendment discussion in Tennessee Electric. The\nTennessee Electric Court noted that “[a] distinct ground\nupon which standing to maintain the suit is said to rest is\nthat the acts of the Authority cannot be upheld without\npermitting federal regulation of purely local matters re­\nserved to the states or the people by the Tenth Amend­\nment.” 306 U. S., at 143. The Court rejected the argu­\nment, however, concluding the Tenth Amendment did not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive one business a right to keep another from compet-\ning. Id., at 144. (“The sale of government property in\ncompetition with others is not a violation of the Tenth\nAmendment”).\n  The Court then added the sentence upon which the\nCourt of Appeals relied in the instant case, the sentence\nthat has been the source of disagreement among Courts of\nAppeals:\n    “As we have seen there is no objection to the Author­\n    ity’s operations by the states, and, if this were not so,\n    the appellants, absent the states or their officers, have\n    no standing in this suit to raise any question under\n    the amendment.” Ibid.\nThe quoted statement was in the context of a decision\nwhich held that business competitors had no legal injury,\nand the word standing can be interpreted in that sense.\nOn this reading, the statement reiterated an earlier point.\nThe statement explained that the States in which the TVA\noperated exempted it from their public utilities regula­\ntions; and that even if the States had not done so and the\nTVA had violated those regulations, the regulations were\nfor the States to enforce. See id., at 141–142. They con­\nferred no private right of action on business competitors.\nThis reading is consistent with the Tennessee Electric\nCourt’s use of the term “standing” elsewhere in its opinion\nto refer to the existence of a state-law cause of action. A\nholding that state utilities regulations did not supply a\ncause of action against a competitor is of no relevance to\nthe instant case, and we need not explore all of its implica­\ntions. See also Data Processing, 397 U. S., at 157–158\n(cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\nU. S. C. §702, permits suit based on injury from business\ncompetition).\n   Yet the quoted statement also could be read to refer to\nstanding in the sense of whether the power companies\n8                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwere the proper litigants to raise a Tenth Amendment is­\nsue. To the extent that might have been the intention of\nthe Tennessee Electric Court, it is, for reasons to be ex­\nplained, inconsistent with our later precedents. The sen­\ntence from Tennessee Electric that we have quoted and\ndiscussed should be deemed neither controlling nor in­\nstructive on the issue of standing as that term is now\ndefined and applied.\n                             III\n  Amicus contends that federal courts should not adjudi­\ncate a claim like Bond’s because of the prudential rule that\na party “generally must assert his own legal rights and\ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal\nrights or interests of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin, 422\nU. S. 490, 499, 500 (1975); see also Kowalski v. Tesmer,\n543 U. S. 125, 129–130 (2004). In amicus’ view, to argue\nthat the National Government has interfered with state\nsovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to\nassert the legal rights and interests of States and States\nalone. That, however, is not so. As explained below, Bond\nseeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. The\nindividual, in a proper case, can assert injury from gov­\nernmental action taken in excess of the authority that\nfederalism defines. Her rights in this regard do not belong\nto a State.\n                             A\n  The federal system rests on what might at first seem a\ncounterintuitive insight, that “freedom is enhanced by the\ncreation of two governments, not one.” Alden v. Maine,\n527 U. S. 706, 758 (1999). The Framers concluded that\nallocation of powers between the National Government\nand the States enhances freedom, first by protecting the\nintegrity of the governments themselves, and second by\nprotecting the people, from whom all governmental powers\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare derived.\n   Federalism has more than one dynamic. It is true that\nthe federal structure serves to grant and delimit the pre­\nrogatives and responsibilities of the States and the Na­\ntional Government vis-à-vis one another. The allocation\nof powers in our federal system preserves the integrity,\ndignity, and residual sovereignty of the States. The fed­\neral balance is, in part, an end in itself, to ensure that\nStates function as political entities in their own right.\n   But that is not its exclusive sphere of operation. Feder­\nalism is more than an exercise in setting the boundary\nbetween different institutions of government for their own\nintegrity. “State sovereignty is not just an end in itself:\n‘Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that\nderive from the diffusion of sovereign power.’ ” New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (quoting Coleman\nv. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759 (1991) (Blackmun, J.,\ndissenting)).\n   Some of these liberties are of a political character. The\nfederal structure allows local policies “more sensitive to\nthe diverse needs of a heterogeneous society,” permits\n“innovation and experimentation,” enables greater citizen\n“involvement in democratic processes,” and makes gov­\nernment “more responsive by putting the States in com­\npetition for a mobile citizenry.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501\nU. S. 452, 458 (1991). Federalism secures the freedom of\nthe individual. It allows States to respond, through the\nenactment of positive law, to the initiative of those who\nseek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times\nwithout having to rely solely upon the political processes\nthat control a remote central power. True, of course, these\nobjects cannot be vindicated by the Judiciary in the ab­\nsence of a proper case or controversy; but the individual\nliberty secured by federalism is not simply derivative of\nthe rights of the States.\n   Federalism also protects the liberty of all persons within\n10                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na State by ensuring that laws enacted in excess of dele­\ngated governmental power cannot direct or control their\nactions. See ibid. By denying any one government com­\nplete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, feder­\nalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary\npower. When government acts in excess of its lawful\npowers, that liberty is at stake.\n  The limitations that federalism entails are not therefore\na matter of rights belonging only to the States. States are\nnot the sole intended beneficiaries of federalism. See New\nYork, supra, at 181. An individual has a direct interest in\nobjecting to laws that upset the constitutional balance\nbetween the National Government and the States when\nthe enforcement of those laws causes injury that is con­\ncrete, particular, and redressable. Fidelity to principles of\nfederalism is not for the States alone to vindicate.\n  The recognition of an injured person’s standing to object\nto a violation of a constitutional principle that allocates\npower within government is illustrated, in an analogous\ncontext, by cases in which individuals sustain discrete,\njusticiable injury from actions that transgress separation­\nof-powers limitations. Separation-of-powers principles are\nintended, in part, to protect each branch of government\nfrom incursion by the others. Yet the dynamic between\nand among the branches is not the only object of the Con­\nstitution’s concern. The structural principles secured by\nthe separation of powers protect the individual as well.\n  In the precedents of this Court, the claims of individu­\nals—not of Government departments—have been the\nprincipal source of judicial decisions concerning separation\nof powers and checks and balances. For example, the re­\nquirement that a bill enacted by Congress be presented\nto the President for signature before it can become law\ngives the President a check over Congress’ exercise of\nlegislative power. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §7. Yet indi­\nviduals, too, are protected by the operations of separation\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof powers and checks and balances; and they are not dis­\nabled from relying on those principles in otherwise justici­\nable cases and controversies. In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S.\n919 (1983), it was an individual who successfully chal­\nlenged the so-called legislative veto—a procedure that\nCongress used in an attempt to invalidate an executive\ndetermination without presenting the measure to the\nPresident. The procedure diminished the role of the Ex­\necutive, but the challenger sought to protect not the\nprerogatives of the Presidency as such but rather his\nown right to avoid deportation under an invalid order.\nChadha’s challenge was sustained. A cardinal principle of\nseparation of powers was vindicated at the insistence of an\nindividual, indeed one who was not a citizen of the United\nStates but who still was a person whose liberty was at\nrisk.\n   Chadha is not unique in this respect. Compare Clinton\nv. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 433–436 (1998) (injured\nparties have standing to challenge Presidential line-item\nveto) with Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 829–830 (1997)\n(Congress Members do not); see also, e.g., Free Enterprise\nFund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561\nU. S. ___ (2010); Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211 (1995); Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714 (1986); North\nern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458\nU. S. 50 (1982); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\n343 U. S. 579 (1952); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.\nUnited States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935). If the constitutional\nstructure of our Government that protects individual\nliberty is compromised, individuals who suffer otherwise\njusticiable injury may object.\n   Just as it is appropriate for an individual, in a proper\ncase, to invoke separation-of-powers or checks-and­\nbalances constraints, so too may a litigant, in a proper\ncase, challenge a law as enacted in contravention of consti­\ntutional principles of federalism. That claim need not\n12                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndepend on the vicarious assertion of a State’s constitu­\ntional interests, even if a State’s constitutional interests\nare also implicated.\n                               B\n   In this regard it is necessary to address a misconception\nin the position the Government now urges this Court to\nadopt. As noted, the Government agrees that petitioner\nhas standing to challenge the validity of §229. That con­\ncession, however, depends on describing petitioner’s claim\nin a narrow way. The Government contends petitioner\nasserts only that Congress could not enact the challenged\nstatute under its enumerated powers. Were she to argue,\nthe Government insists, that the statute “interferes with a\nspecific aspect of state sovereignty,” either instead of or in\naddition to her enumerated powers contention, the Court\nshould deny her standing. Brief for United States 18 (filed\nDec. 3, 2010).\n   The premise that petitioner does or should avoid making\nan “interference-with-sovereignty” argument is flawed.\nId., at 33. Here she asserts, for example, that the conduct\nwith which she is charged is “local in nature” and “should\nbe left to local authorities to prosecute” and that congres­\nsional regulation of that conduct “signals a massive and\nunjustifiable expansion of federal law enforcement into\nstate-regulated domain.” Record in No. 2:07–cr–00528–\nJG–1 (ED Pa.), Doc. 27, pp. 6, 19. The public policy of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, enacted in its capacity as\nsovereign, has been displaced by that of the National\nGovernment. The law to which petitioner is subject, the\nprosecution she seeks to counter, and the punishment she\nmust face might not have come about if the matter were\nleft for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to decide.\nIndeed, petitioner argues that under Pennsylvania law the\nexpected maximum term of imprisonment she could have\nreceived for the same conduct was barely more than a\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The princi-\nples of limited national powers and state sovereignty are\nintertwined. While neither originates in the Tenth Amend­\nment, both are expressed by it. Impermissible interfer­\nence with state sovereignty is not within the enumerated\npowers of the National Government, see New York, 505\nU. S., at 155–159, and action that exceeds the National\nGovernment’s enumerated powers undermines the sover­\neign interests of States. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 564 (1995). The unconstitutional action can\ncause concomitant injury to persons in individual cases.\n   An individual who challenges federal action on these\ngrounds is, of course, subject to the Article III require­\nments, as well as prudential rules, applicable to all liti­\ngants and claims. Individuals have “no standing to com­\nplain simply that their Government is violating the law.”\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 755 (1984). It is not\nenough that a litigant “suffers in some indefinite way in\ncommon with people generally.” Frothingham v. Mellon,\n262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (decided with Massachusetts v.\nMellon). If, in connection with the claim being asserted, a\nlitigant who commences suit fails to show actual or immi­\nnent harm that is concrete and particular, fairly traceable\nto the conduct complained of, and likely to be redressed by\na favorable decision, the Federal Judiciary cannot hear the\nclaim. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561. These requirements\nmust be satisfied before an individual may assert a consti­\ntutional claim; and in some instances, the result may be\nthat a State is the only entity capable of demonstrating\nthe requisite injury.\n   In this case, however, where the litigant is a party to an\notherwise justiciable case or controversy, she is not forbid­\nden to object that her injury results from disregard of the\n14                BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal structure of our Government. Whether the Tenth\nAmendment is regarded as simply a “ ‘truism,’ ” New York,\nsupra, at 156 (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S.\n100, 124 (1941)), or whether it has independent force of its\nown, the result here is the same.\n                          *   *     *\n   There is no basis in precedent or principle to deny peti­\ntioner’s standing to raise her claims. The ultimate issue of\nthe statute’s validity turns in part on whether the law can\nbe deemed “necessary and proper for carrying into Execu­\ntion” the President’s Article II, §2 Treaty Power, see U. S.\nConst., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. This Court expresses no view on\nthe merits of that argument. It can be addressed by the\nCourt of Appeals on remand.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Bond, like any other defendant,\nhas a personal right not to be convicted under a constitu\ntionally invalid law. See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial\nChallenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev.\n1321, 1331–1333 (2000); Monaghan, Overbreadth, 1981\nSup. Ct. Rev. 1, 3. See also North Carolina v. Pearce, 395\nU. S. 711, 739 (1969) (Black, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“Due process . . . is a guarantee that a\nman should be tried and convicted only in accordance with\nvalid laws of the land.”).\n   In this case, Bond argues that the statute under which\nshe was charged, 18 U. S. C. §229, exceeds Congress’\nenumerated powers and violates the Tenth Amendment.\nOther defendants might assert that a law exceeds Con\ngress’ power because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nor the Establishment Clause, or the Due Process Clause.\nWhatever the claim, success on the merits would require\nreversal of the conviction. “An offence created by [an\nunconstitutional law],” the Court has held, “is not a\ncrime.” Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376 (1880). “A\nconviction under [such a law] is not merely erroneous, but\nis illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of impris\n2                 BOND v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nonment.” Id., at 376–377. If a law is invalid as applied to\nthe criminal defendant’s conduct, the defendant is entitled\nto go free.\n   For this reason, a court has no “prudential” license to\ndecline to consider whether the statute under which the\ndefendant has been charged lacks constitutional applica\ntion to her conduct. And that is so even where the consti\ntutional provision that would render the conviction void is\ndirected at protecting a party not before the Court. Our\ndecisions concerning criminal laws infected with discrimi\nnation are illustrative. The Court must entertain the\nobjection—and reverse the conviction—even if the right to\nequal treatment resides in someone other than the de\nfendant. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 452–455\n(1972) (reversing conviction for distributing contraceptives\nbecause the law banning distribution violated the recipi\nent’s right to equal protection); cf. Craig v. Boren, 429\nU. S. 190, 192, 210, and n. 24 (1976) (law penalizing sale\nof beer to males but not females aged 18 to 20 could not\nbe enforced against vendor). See also Grayned v. City of\nRockford, 408 U. S. 104, 107, n. 2 (1972); Welsh v. United\nStates, 398 U. S. 333, 361–362 (1970) (Harlan, J., concur\nring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward,\nCongress would cure the unequal treatment by extending\nrather than invalidating the criminal proscription).\n   In short, a law “beyond the power of Congress,” for any\nreason, is “no law at all.” Nigro v. United States, 276 U. S.\n332, 341 (1928). The validity of Bond’s conviction depends\nupon whether the Constitution permits Congress to enact\n§229. Her claim that it does not must be considered and\ndecided on the merits.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/218927/", "sha1": "f38a3a9da6b43b19bda31434063012a1a5534678", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-16T07:38:21"}
