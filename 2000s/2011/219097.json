ROGERS ET AL.\n\n CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n       No. 10–10. Argued March 23, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011\nAfter a South Carolina family court ordered petitioner Turner to pay\n  $51.73 per week to respondent Rogers to help support their child,\n  Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in con\n  tempt five times. For the first four, he was sentenced to 90 days’ im\n  prisonment, but he ultimately paid what he owed (twice without be\n  ing jailed, twice after spending a few days in custody). The fifth time\n  he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence. After his release,\n  the family court clerk issued a new “show cause” order against\n  Turner because he was $5728.76 in arrears. Both he and Rogers\n  were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.\n  The judge found Turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to 12\n  months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay\n  or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to\n  make support payments. After Turner completed his sentence, the\n  South Carolina Supreme Court rejected his claim that the Federal\n  Constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing, declar\n  ing that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safe\n  guards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.\nHeld:\n    1. Even though Turner has completed his 12-month sentence, and\n there are not alleged to be collateral consequences of the contempt\n determination that might keep the dispute alive, this case is not\n moot, because it is “capable of repetition” while “evading review,”\n Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 219\n U. S. 498, 515. A case remains live if “(1) the challenged action [is] in\n its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or ex\n piration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same\n complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.”\n Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149. Here, the “challenged ac\n2                          TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion,” Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its duration\n    too short to be fully litigated” through the state courts (and arrive\n    here) prior to its “expiration.” First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,\n    435 U. S. 765, 774. And there is a more than “reasonable” likelihood\n    that Turner will again be “subjected to the same action” because he\n    has frequently failed to make his support payments, has been the\n    subject of several civil contempt proceedings, has been imprisoned\n    several times, and is, once again, the subject of civil contempt pro\n    ceedings for failure to pay. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, and\n    St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41, distinguished. Pp. 5–7.\n       2. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause does not auto\n    matically require the State to provide counsel at civil contempt pro\n    ceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child\n    support order, even if that individual faces incarceration. In particu\n    lar, that Clause does not require that counsel be provided where the\n    opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and\n    the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to\n    adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair oppor\n    tunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express\n    court findings as to the supporting parent’s ability to comply with the\n    support order. Pp. 7–16.\n          (a) This Court’s precedents provide no definitive answer to the\n    question whether counsel must be provided. The Sixth Amendment\n    grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel, see, e.g.,\n    United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696, but does not govern civil\n    cases. Civil and criminal contempt differ. A court may not impose\n    punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly estab\n    lished that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms\n    of the order.” Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9. And once a\n    civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of\n    the contempt and is free. Id., at 633. The Due Process Clause allows\n    a State to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt pro\n    ceedings than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641. Cases directly con\n    cerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of\n    such a right “only” in cases involving incarceration, but have not held\n    that a right to counsel exists in all such cases. See In re Gault, 387\n    U. S. 1; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480; and Lassiter v. Department of\n    Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18. Pp. 7–10.\n          (b) Because a contempt proceeding to compel support payments\n    is civil, the question whether the “specific dictates of due process” re\n    quire appointed counsel is determined by examining the “distinct fac\n    tors” this Court has used to decide what specific safeguards are\n    needed to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair. Mathews v.\n    Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335. As relevant here those factors include\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n(1) the nature of “the private interest that will be affected,” (2) the\ncomparative “risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with\nand without “additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” and (3)\nthe nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not pro\nviding “additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].” Ibid.\n   The “private interest that will be affected” argues strongly for the\nright to counsel here. That interest consists of an indigent defen\ndant’s loss of personal liberty through imprisonment. Freedom “from\nbodily restraint” lies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due\nProcess Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80. Thus, accu\nrate decisionmaking as to the “ability to pay”—which marks a divid\ning line between civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, supra, at 635, n.\n7—must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a\nwrongful incarceration. And because ability to comply divides civil\nand criminal contempt proceedings, an erroneous determination\nwould also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a crimi\nnal proceeding would demand. Questions about ability to pay are\nlikely to arise frequently in child custody cases. On the other hand,\ndue process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil\nproceedings where incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon v. Scar\npelli, 411 U. S. 778. To determine whether a right to counsel is re\nquired here, opposing interests and the probable value of “additional\nor substitute procedural safeguards” must be taken into account.\nMathews, supra, at 335.\n   Doing so reveals three related considerations that, taken together,\nargue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the\npresent kind. First, the likely critical question in these cases is the\ndefendant’s ability to pay, which is often closely related to his indi\ngence and relatively straightforward. Second, sometimes, as here,\nthe person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the govern\nment represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented\nby counsel. A requirement that the State provide counsel to the non\ncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of repre\nsentation that would “alter significantly the nature of the proceed\ning,” Gagnon, supra, at 787, creating a degree of formality or delay\nthat would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and\nmake the proceedings less fair overall. Third, as the Federal Gov\nernment points out, an available set of “substitute procedural safe\nguards,” Mathews, supra, at 335, if employed together, can signifi\ncantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty. These\ninclude (1) notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical\nissue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva\nlent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an oppor\ntunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions\n4                          TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court\n    that the defendant has the ability to pay.\n       This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where\n    the underlying support payment is owed to the State, e.g., for reim\n    bursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the ques\n    tion what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a\n    defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,”\n    Gagnon, supra, at 788. Pp. 10–16.\n       3. Under the circumstances, Turner’s incarceration violated due\n    process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alter\n    native procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have\n    clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical ques\n    tion in his civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a\n    form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his fi\n    nancial circumstances. And the trial court did not find that he was\n    able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil con\n    tempt and ordered him incarcerated. P. 16.\n387 S. C. 142, 691 S.

TURNER, PETITIONER v. REBECCA L. \n\n               ROGERS ET AL. \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                   SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 [June 20, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   South Carolina’s Family Court enforces its child support\norders by threatening with incarceration for civil contempt\nthose who are (1) subject to a child support order, (2) able\nto comply with that order, but (3) fail to do so. We must\ndecide whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil\ncontempt hearing) to an indigent person potentially faced\nwith such incarceration. We conclude that where as here\nthe custodial parent (entitled to receive the support) is\nunrepresented by counsel, the State need not provide\ncounsel to the noncustodial parent (required to provide the\nsupport). But we attach an important caveat, namely,\nthat the State must nonetheless have in place alternative\nprocedures that assure a fundamentally fair determina\ntion of the critical incarceration-related question, whether\nthe supporting parent is able to comply with the support\norder.\n                           I\n                           A\n  South Carolina family courts enforce their child support\n2                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norders in part through civil contempt proceedings. Each\nmonth the family court clerk reviews outstanding child\nsupport orders, identifies those in which the supporting\nparent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends\nthat parent an order to “show cause” why he should not be\nheld in contempt. S. C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011). The\n“show cause” order and attached affidavit refer to the\nrelevant child support order, identify the amount of\nthe arrearage, and set a date for a court hearing. At the\nhearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in\ncontempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the\nrequired payments. See Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S. C. 348,\n351, 306 S. E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (“When the parent is\nunable to make the required payments, he is not in con\ntempt”). If he fails to make the required showing, the\ncourt may hold him in civil contempt. And it may require\nthat he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself\nof contempt by making the required child support pay\nments (but not for more than one year regardless). See\nS. C. Code Ann. §63–3–620 (Supp. 2010) (imprisonment\nfor up to one year of “adult who wilfully violates” a court\norder); Price v. Turner, 387 S. C. 142, 145, 691 S. E. 2d\n470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order must permit purging\nof contempt through compliance).\n                             B\n  In June 2003 a South Carolina family court entered an\norder, which (as amended) required petitioner, Michael\nTurner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent, Rebecca\nRogers, to help support their child. (Rogers’ father, Larry\nPrice, currently has custody of the child and is also a\nrespondent before this Court.) Over the next three years,\nTurner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was\nheld in contempt on five occasions. The first four times he\nwas sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment, but he ultimately\npaid the amount due (twice without being jailed, twice\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafter spending two or three days in custody). The fifth\ntime he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.\n  After his release in 2006 Turner remained in arrears.\nOn March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new “show cause”\norder. And after an initial postponement due to Turner’s\nfailure to appear, Turner’s civil contempt hearing took\nplace on January 3, 2008. Turner and Rogers were pre\nsent, each without representation by counsel.\n  The hearing was brief. The court clerk said that Turner\nwas $5,728.76 behind in his payments. The judge asked\nTurner if there was “anything you want to say.” Turner\nreplied,\n    “Well, when I first got out, I got back on dope. I done\n    meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a\n    little bit here and there. And, when I finally did get to\n    working, I broke my back, back in September. I filed\n    for disability and SSI. And, I didn’t get straightened\n    out off the dope until I broke my back and laid up for\n    two months. And, now I’m off the dope and every\n    thing. I just hope that you give me a chance. I don’t\n    know what else to say. I mean, I know I done wrong,\n    and I should have been paying and helping her, and\n    I’m sorry. I mean, dope had a hold to me.” App. to\n    Pet. for Cert. 17a.\nThe judge then said, “[o]kay,” and asked Rogers if she had\nanything to say. Ibid. After a brief discussion of federal\nbenefits, the judge stated,\n    “If there’s nothing else, this will be the Order of\n    the Court. I find the Defendant in willful contempt.\n    I’m [going to] sentence him to twelve months in the\n    Oconee County Detention Center. He may purge him\n    self of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having\n    a zero balance on or before his release. I’ve also\n    placed a lien on any SSI or other benefits.” Id., at\n    18a.\n4                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThe judge added that Turner would not receive good-time\nor work credits, but “[i]f you’ve got a job, I’ll make you\neligible for work release.” Ibid. When Turner asked why\nhe could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge\nsaid, “[b]ecause that’s my ruling.” Ibid.\n   The court made no express finding concerning Turner’s\nability to pay his arrearage (though Turner’s wife had\nvoluntarily submitted a copy of Turner’s application for\ndisability benefits, cf. post, at 7, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissent\ning); App. 135a–136a). Nor did the judge ask any followup\nquestions or otherwise address the ability-to-pay issue.\nAfter the hearing, the judge filled out a prewritten form\ntitled “Order for Contempt of Court,” which included the\nstatement:\n    “Defendant (was) (was not) gainfully employed and/or\n    (had) (did not have) the ability to make these support\n    payments when due.” Id., at 60a, 61a.\nBut the judge left this statement as is without indicating\nwhether Turner was able to make support payments.\n                             C\n  While serving his 12-month sentence, Turner, with the\nhelp of pro bono counsel, appealed. He claimed that\nthe Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his con\ntempt hearing. The South Carolina Supreme Court de\ncided Turner’s appeal after he had completed his sentence.\nAnd it rejected his “right to counsel” claim. The court\npointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from\ncriminal contempt. The former does not require all the\n“constitutional safeguards” applicable in criminal proceed\nings. 387 S. C., at 145, 691 S. E. 2d, at 472. And the right\nto government-paid counsel, the Supreme Court held, was\none of the “safeguards” not required. Ibid.\n  Turner sought certiorari.

They point\nout that Turner completed his 12-month prison sentence\nin 2009. And they add that there are no “collateral conse\nquences” of that particular contempt determination that\nmight keep the dispute alive. Compare Sibron v. New\nYork, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56 (1968) (release from prison does\nnot moot a criminal case because “collateral consequences”\n6                    TURNER v.

S. 1, 14 (1998) (declining to extend the presumption to\nparole revocation).\n   The short, conclusive answer to respondents’ mootness\nclaim, however, is that this case is not moot because it\nfalls within a special category of disputes that are “capable\nof repetition” while “evading review.” Southern Pacific\nTerminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). A dispute\nfalls into that category, and a case based on that dispute\nremains live, if “(1) the challenged action [is] in its dura\ntion too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that\nthe same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same\naction again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149\n(1975) (per curiam).\n   Our precedent makes clear that the “challenged action,”\nTurner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated” through the state\ncourts (and arrive here) prior to its “expiration.” See, e.g.,\nFirst Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n774 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (18-month\nperiod too short); Southern Pacific Terminal Co., supra, at\n514–516 (2-year period too short). At the same time, there\nis a more than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will\nagain be “subjected to the same action.” As we have\npointed out, supra, at 2–3, Turner has frequently failed to\nmake his child support payments. He has been the subject\nof several civil contempt proceedings. He has been im\nprisoned on several of those occasions. Within months of\nhis release from the imprisonment here at issue he was\nagain the subject of civil contempt proceedings. And he\nwas again imprisoned, this time for six months. As of\nDecember 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and\nanother contempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011.\nApp. 104a; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 1. These facts\nbring this case squarely within the special category of\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncases that are not moot because the underlying dispute\nis “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” See, e.g.,\nNebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 546–547\n(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Moreover, the underlying facts make this case unlike\nDeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam),\nand St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (per\ncuriam), two cases that respondents believe require us to\nfind this case moot regardless. DeFunis was moot, but\nthat is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again\nsuffer the conduct of which he complained (and others\nlikely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own\nlawsuits). Here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future\nimprisonment.\n   St. Pierre was moot because the petitioner (a witness\nheld in contempt and sentenced to five months’ imprison\nment) had failed to “apply to this Court for a stay” of the\nfederal-court order imposing imprisonment. 319 U. S., at\n42–43. And, like the witness in St. Pierre, Turner did not\nseek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprison\nment. But this case, unlike St. Pierre, arises out of a\nstate-court proceeding. And respondents give us no reason\nto believe that we would have (or that we could have)\ngranted a timely request for a stay had one been made.\nCf. 28 U. S. C. §1257 (granting this Court jurisdiction to\nreview final state-court judgments). In Sibron, we re\njected a similar “mootness” argument for just that reason.\n392 U. S., at 53, n. 13. And we find this case similar in\nthis respect to Sibron, not to St. Pierre.\n                           III \n\n                            A\n\n  We must decide whether the Due Process Clause grants\nan indigent defendant, such as Turner, a right to state\nappointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, which\nmay lead to his incarceration. This Court’s precedents\n8                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovide no definitive answer to that question. This Court\nhas long held that the Sixth Amendment grants an indi\ngent defendant the right to state-appointed counsel in\na criminal case. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335\n(1963). And we have held that this same rule applies to\ncriminal contempt proceedings (other than summary\nproceedings). United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696\n(1993); Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925).\n   But the Sixth Amendment does not govern civil cases.\nCivil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it\nseeks only to “coerc[e] the defendant to do” what a court\nhad previously ordered him to do. Gompers v. Bucks Stove\n& Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 442 (1911). A court may not\nimpose punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when\nit is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is\nunable to comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v.\nFeiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9 (1988). And once a civil\ncontemnor complies with the underlying order, he is\npurged of the contempt and is free. Id., at 633 (he\n“carr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in [his] own pockets”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a case not\ninvolving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt\nis at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protec\ntions than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641 (State may\nplace the burden of proving inability to pay on the defen\ndant).\n   This Court has decided only a handful of cases that\nmore directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.\nAnd the application of those decisions to the present case\nis not clear. On the one hand, the Court has held that the\nFourteenth Amendment requires the State to pay for\nrepresentation by counsel in a civil “juvenile delinquency”\nproceeding (which could lead to incarceration). In re\nGault, 387 U. S. 1, 35–42 (1967). Moreover, in Vitek v.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJones, 445 U. S. 480, 496–497 (1980), a plurality of four\nMembers of this Court would have held that the Four\nteenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in\na proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital\nfor the mentally ill. Further, in Lassiter v. Department of\nSocial Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18 (1981), a case\nthat focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of pa\nrental rights, the Court wrote that the\n    “pre-eminent generalization that emerges from this\n    Court’s precedents on an indigent’s right to appointed\n    counsel is that such a right has been recognized to ex\n    ist only where the litigant may lose his physical lib\n    erty if he loses the litigation.” Id., at 25.\nAnd the Court then drew from these precedents “the pre\nsumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed\ncounsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his\nphysical liberty.” Id., at 26–27.\n  On the other hand, the Court has held that a criminal\noffender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment\ndoes not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation\nrevocation hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778\n(1973); see also Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25 (1976)\n(no due process right to counsel in summary court-martial\nproceedings). And, at the same time, Gault, Vitek, and\nLassiter are readily distinguishable. The civil juvenile\ndelinquency proceeding at issue in Gault was “little differ\nent” from, and “comparable in seriousness” to, a criminal\nprosecution. 387 U. S., at 28, 36. In Vitek, the controlling\nopinion found no right to counsel. 445 U. S., at 499–500\n(Powell, J., concurring in part) (assistance of mental\nhealth professionals sufficient). And the Court’s state\nments in Lassiter constitute part of its rationale for deny\ning a right to counsel in that case. We believe those\nstatements are best read as pointing out that the Court\npreviously had found a right to counsel “only” in cases\n10                  TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving incarceration, not that a right to counsel exists\nin all such cases (a position that would have been difficult\nto reconcile with Gagnon).\n                              B\n  Civil contempt proceedings in child support cases con-\nstitute one part of a highly complex system designed to\nassure a noncustodial parent’s regular payment of funds\ntypically necessary for the support of his children. Often\nthe family receives welfare support from a state\nadministered federal program, and the State then seeks\nreimbursement from the noncustodial parent. See 42\nU. S. C. §§608(a)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006\ned.); S. C. Code Ann. §§43–5–65(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum.\nSupp.). Other times the custodial parent (often the\nmother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent, or an\nother person with custody) does not receive government\nbenefits and is entitled to receive the support payments\nherself.\n  The Federal Government has created an elaborate\nprocedural mechanism designed to help both the govern\nment and custodial parents to secure the payments to\nwhich they are entitled. See generally Blessing v. Free\nstone, 520 U. S. 329, 333 (1997) (describing the “interlock\ning set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs” as\nthey relate to child support enforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303\n(2010) (prescribing standards for state child support agen\ncies). These systems often rely upon wage withholding,\nexpedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child\nsupport orders, and automated data processing.            42\nU. S. C. §§666(a), (b), 654(24). But sometimes States will\nuse contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent\nreceives support payments or the government receives\nreimbursement. Although some experts have criticized\nthis last-mentioned procedure, and the Federal Govern\nment believes that “the routine use of contempt for non\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayment of child support is likely to be an ineffective\nstrategy,” the Government also tells us that “coercive\nenforcement remedies, such as contempt, have a role to\nplay.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21–22,\nand n. 8 (citing Dept. of Health and Human Services,\nNational Child Support Enforcement, Strategic Plan: FY\n2005–2009, pp. 2, 10). South Carolina, which relies heav\nily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an im\nportant tool.\n   We here consider an indigent’s right to paid counsel at\nsuch a contempt proceeding. It is a civil proceeding. And\nwe consequently determine the “specific dictates of due\nprocess” by examining the “distinct factors” that this\nCourt has previously found useful in deciding what spe\ncific safeguards the Constitution’s Due Process Clause re\nquires in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally\nfair. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976) (con\nsidering fairness of an administrative proceeding). As\nrelevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the\nprivate interest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative\n“risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with\nand without “additional or substitute procedural safe\nguards,” and (3) the nature and magnitude of any counter\nvailing interest in not providing “additional or substitute\nprocedural requirement[s].” Ibid. See also Lassiter, 452\nU. S., at 27–31 (applying the Mathews framework).\n   The “private interest that will be affected” argues\nstrongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.\nThat interest consists of an indigent defendant’s loss of\npersonal liberty through imprisonment. The interest in\nsecuring that freedom, the freedom “from bodily restraint,”\nlies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process\nClause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992).\nAnd we have made clear that its threatened loss through\nlegal proceedings demands “due process protection.”\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425 (1979).\n12                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Given the importance of the interest at stake, it is ob\nviously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in\nrespect to the key “ability to pay” question. Moreover, the\nfact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between\ncivil and criminal contempt, Hicks, 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7,\nreinforces the need for accuracy. That is because an incor\nrect decision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding\nas civil) can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by\ndepriving the defendant of the procedural protections\n(including counsel) that the Constitution would demand in\na criminal proceeding. See, e.g., Dixon, 509 U. S., at 696\n(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, protection from double\njeopardy); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 512–\n513, 517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than\nsix months’ imprisonment). And since 70% of child sup\nport arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either\nno reported income or income of $10,000 per year or less,\nthe issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often. See\nE. Sorensen, L. Sousa, & S. Schaner, Assessing Child\nSupport Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation\n22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute), online at\nhttp://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as\nvisited June 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file); id., at 23 (“research suggests that many obligors\nwho do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively\nlimited resources”); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the\nIndigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of\nDebtor’s Prison, 18 Cornell J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 95, 117\n(2008). See also, e.g., McBride v. McBride, 334 N. C. 124,\n131, n. 4, 431 S. E. 2d 14, 19, n. 4 (1993) (surveying North\nCarolina contempt orders and finding that the “failure of\ntrial courts to make a determination of a contemnor’s\nability to comply is not altogether infrequent”).\n   On the other hand, the Due Process Clause does not\nalways require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings\nwhere incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon, 411 U. S.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n778. And in determining whether the Clause requires a\nright to counsel here, we must take account of opposing\ninterests, as well as consider the probable value of “addi\ntional or substitute procedural safeguards.” Mathews,\nsupra, at 335.\n   Doing so, we find three related considerations that,\nwhen taken together, argue strongly against the Due\nProcess Clause requiring the State to provide indigents\nwith counsel in every proceeding of the kind before us.\n   First, the critical question likely at issue in these cases\nconcerns, as we have said, the defendant’s ability to pay.\nThat question is often closely related to the question of the\ndefendant’s indigence. But when the right procedures are\nin place, indigence can be a question that in many—but\nnot all—cases is sufficiently straightforward to warrant\ndetermination prior to providing a defendant with counsel,\neven in a criminal case. Federal law, for example, re\nquires a criminal defendant to provide information show\ning that he is indigent, and therefore entitled to state\nfunded counsel, before he can receive that assistance. See\n18 U. S. C. §3006A(b).\n   Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the\ndefendant at the hearing is not the government repre\nsented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented\nby counsel. See Dept. of Health and Human Services,\nOffice of Child Support Enforcement, Understanding Child\nSupport Debt: A Guide to Exploring Child Support Debt in\nYour State 5, 6 (2004) (51% of nationwide arrears, and\n58% in South Carolina, are not owed to the government).\nThe custodial parent, perhaps a woman with custody of\none or more children, may be relatively poor, unemployed,\nand unable to afford counsel. Yet she may have encour\naged the court to enforce its order through contempt. Cf.\nTr. Contempt Proceedings (Sept. 14, 2005), App. 44a–45a\n(Rogers asks court, in light of pattern of nonpayment, to\nconfine Turner). She may be able to provide the court\n14                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith significant information. Cf. id., at 41a–43a (Rogers\ndescribes where Turner lived and worked). And the pro\nceeding is ultimately for her benefit.\n   A requirement that the State provide counsel to the\nnoncustodial parent in these cases could create an asym\nmetry of representation that would “alter significantly the\nnature of the proceeding.” Gagnon, supra, at 787. Doing\nso could mean a degree of formality or delay that would\nunduly slow payment to those immediately in need. And,\nperhaps more important for present purposes, doing so\ncould make the proceedings less fair overall, increasing the\nrisk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family\nof the support it is entitled to receive. The needs of such\nfamilies play an important role in our analysis. Cf. post,\nat 10–12 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n   Third, as the Solicitor General points out, there is avail\nable a set of “substitute procedural safeguards,” Mathews,\n424 U. S., at 335, which, if employed together, can signifi\ncantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of lib\nerty. They can do so, moreover, without incurring some of\nthe drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right\nto counsel. Those safeguards include (1) notice to the de\nfendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the\ncontempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva\nlent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an oppor\ntunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to\nstatements and questions about his financial status, (e.g.,\nthose triggered by his responses on the form); and (4) an\nexpress finding by the court that the defendant has the\nability to pay. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 23–25. In presenting these al\nternatives, the Government draws upon considerable\nexperience in helping to manage statutorily mandated\nfederal-state efforts to enforce child support orders. See\nsupra, at 10. It does not claim that they are the only\npossible alternatives, and this Court’s cases suggest, for\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexample, that sometimes assistance other than purely\nlegal assistance (here, say, that of a neutral social worker)\ncan prove constitutionally sufficient. Cf. Vitek, 445 U. S.,\nat 499–500 (Powell, J., concurring in part) (provision of\nmental health professional). But the Government does\nclaim that these alternatives can assure the “fundamental\nfairness” of the proceeding even where the State does not\npay for counsel for an indigent defendant.\n   While recognizing the strength of Turner’s arguments,\nwe ultimately believe that the three considerations we\nhave just discussed must carry the day. In our view, a\ncategorical right to counsel in proceedings of the kind\nbefore us would carry with it disadvantages (in the form of\nunfairness and delay) that, in terms of ultimate fairness,\nwould deprive it of significant superiority over the alterna\ntives that we have mentioned. We consequently hold that\nthe Due Process Clause does not automatically require the\nprovision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an\nindigent individual who is subject to a child support order,\neven if that individual faces incarceration (for up to a\nyear). In particular, that Clause does not require the\nprovision of counsel where the opposing parent or other\ncustodian (to whom support funds are owed) is not repre\nsented by counsel and the State provides alternative\nprocedural safeguards equivalent to those we have men\ntioned (adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay,\nfair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant in\nformation, and court findings).\n   We do not address civil contempt proceedings where the\nunderlying child support payment is owed to the State, for\nexample, for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the\nparent with custody. See supra, at 10. Those proceedings\nmore closely resemble debt-collection proceedings. The\ngovernment is likely to have counsel or some other compe\ntent representative. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458,\n462–463 (1938) (“[T]he average defendant does not have\n16                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe professional legal skill to protect himself when brought\nbefore a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty,\nwherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and\nlearned counsel” (emphasis added)). And this kind of\nproceeding is not before us. Neither do we address what\ndue process requires in an unusually complex case where\na defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained\nadvocate.” Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 788; see also Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 18–20 (not claiming that Turner’s case is\nespecially complex).\n                             IV\n  The record indicates that Turner received neither coun\nsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those we\nhave described. He did not receive clear notice that his\nability to pay would constitute the critical question in his\ncivil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a\nform (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information\nabout his financial circumstances. The court did not find\nthat Turner was able to pay his arrearage, but instead left\nthe relevant “finding” section of the contempt order blank.\nThe court nonetheless found Turner in contempt and\nordered him incarcerated. Under these circumstances\nTurner’s incarceration violated the Due Process Clause.\n  We vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt and remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Therefore, I would affirm. Although the Court\nagrees that appointed counsel was not required in this\ncase, it nevertheless vacates the judgment of the South\nCarolina Supreme Court on a different ground, which the\nparties have never raised. Solely at the invitation of\nthe United States as amicus curiae, the majority decides\nthat Turner’s contempt proceeding violated due process be-\ncause it did not include “alternative procedural safe\nguards.” Ante, at 15. Consistent with this Court’s long\nstanding practice, I would not reach that question.1\n                              I\n  The only question raised in this case is whether the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment creates a\nright to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants facing\nincarceration in civil contempt proceedings. It does not.\n——————\n  1 I agree with the Court that this case is not moot because the chal\n\nlenged action is likely to recur yet is so brief that it otherwise evades\nour review. Ante, at 5–7.\n2                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   Under an original understanding of the Constitution,\nthere is no basis for concluding that the guarantee of due\nprocess secures a right to appointed counsel in civil con\ntempt proceedings. It certainly does not do so to the ex\ntent that the Due Process Clause requires “ ‘that our\nGovernment must proceed according to the “law of the\nland”—that is, according to written constitutional and statu\ntory provisions.’” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 589\n(2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358, 382 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting)). No one\ncontends that South Carolina law entitles Turner to ap\npointed counsel. Nor does any federal statute or constitu\ntional provision so provide. Although the Sixth Amend\nment secures a right to “the Assistance of Counsel,” it does\nnot apply here because civil contempt proceedings are not\n“criminal prosecutions.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; see ante, at\n8. Moreover, as originally understood, the Sixth Amend\nment guaranteed only the “right to employ counsel, or to\nuse volunteered services of counsel”; it did not require the\ncourt to appoint counsel in any circumstance. Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 2); see also United States v. Van Duzee, 140\nU. S. 169, 173 (1891); W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in\nAmerican Courts 21–22, 28–29 (1955); F. Heller, The\nSixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\n110 (1951).\n   Appointed counsel is also not required in civil contempt\nproceedings under a somewhat broader reading of the Due\nProcess Clause, which takes it to approve “ ‘[a] process of\nlaw, which is not otherwise forbidden, . . . [that] can show\nthe sanction of settled usage.’ ” Weiss v. United States, 510\nU. S. 163, 197 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting Hurtado v. California,\n110 U. S. 516, 528 (1884)). Despite a long history of courts\nexercising contempt authority, Turner has not identified\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 280–285 (1769)\n(describing the “summary proceedings” used to adjudicate\ncontempt). Indeed, Turner concedes that contempt pro\nceedings without appointed counsel have the blessing of\nhistory. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15–16 (admitting that there\nis no historical support for Turner’s rule); see also Brief for\nRespondents 47–48.\n                             B\n   Even under the Court’s modern interpretation of the\nConstitution, the Due Process Clause does not provide a\nright to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants\nfacing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. Such\na reading would render the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel—as it is currently understood—superfluous.\nMoreover, it appears that even cases applying the Court’s\nmodern interpretation of due process have not understood\nit to categorically require appointed counsel in circum\nstances outside those otherwise covered by the Sixth\nAmendment.\n                                1\n  Under the Court’s current jurisprudence, the Sixth\nAmendment entitles indigent defendants to appointed coun-\nsel in felony cases and other criminal cases resulting\nin a sentence of imprisonment. See Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U. S. 335, 344–345 (1963); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407\nU. S. 25, 37 (1972); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, 373–374\n(1979); Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 662 (2002).\nTurner concedes that, even under these cases, the Sixth\nAmendment does not entitle him to appointed counsel.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioner 12 (acknowledging that\n4                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“civil contempt is not a ‘criminal prosecution’ within the\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment”). He argues instead\nthat “the right to the assistance of counsel for persons\nfacing incarceration arises not only from the Sixth\nAmendment, but also from the requirement of fundamen\ntal fairness under the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment.” Brief for Petitioner 28. In his view,\nthis Court has relied on due process to “rejec[t] formalistic\ndistinctions between criminal and civil proceedings, in\nstead concluding that incarceration or other confinement\ntriggers the right to counsel.” Id., at 33.\n   But if the Due Process Clause created a right to ap\npointed counsel in all proceedings with the potential for\ndetention, then the Sixth Amendment right to appointed\ncounsel would be unnecessary. Under Turner’s theory,\nevery instance in which the Sixth Amendment guarantees\na right to appointed counsel is covered also by the Due\nProcess Clause. The Sixth Amendment, however, is the\nonly constitutional provision that even mentions the assis\ntance of counsel; the Due Process Clause says nothing\nabout counsel. Ordinarily, we do not read a general provi\nsion to render a specific one superfluous. Cf. Morales v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384 (1992)\n(“[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the\nspecific governs the general”). The fact that one constitu\ntional provision expressly provides a right to appointed\ncounsel in specific circumstances indicates that the Con\nstitution does not also sub silentio provide that right far\nmore broadly in another, more general, provision. Cf.\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 273 (1994) (plurality\nopinion) (“Where a particular Amendment provides an\nexplicit textual source of constitutional protection against\na particular sort of government behavior, that Amend\nment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due\nprocess,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 281 (KENNEDY,\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

(slip op., at 16) (applying Albright to the Tak\nings Clause).\n                              2\n   Moreover, contrary to Turner’s assertions, the holdings\nin this Court’s due process decisions regarding the right to\ncounsel are actually quite narrow. The Court has never\nfound in the Due Process Clause a categorical right to\nappointed counsel outside of criminal prosecutions or\nproceedings “functionally akin to a criminal trial.” Gag\nnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 789, n. 12 (1973) (dis\ncussing In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967)). This is consistent\nwith the conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not\nexpand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by\nthe Sixth Amendment.\n   After countless factors weighed, mores evaluated, and\npractices surveyed, the Court has not determined that due\nprocess principles of fundamental fairness categorically\nrequire counsel in any context outside criminal proceed\nings. See, e.g., Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of\nDurham Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 31–32 (1981); Wolff v. McDon\nnell, 418 U. S. 539, 569–570 (1974); see also Walters v.\nNational Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 307–\n308, 320–326 (1985); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, 583\n(1975). Even when the defendant’s liberty is at stake, the\nCourt has not concluded that fundamental fairness re\nquires that counsel always be appointed if the proceeding\nis not criminal.2 See, e.g., Scarpelli, supra, at 790 (proba\n——————\n 2 “Criminal   contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense”; therefore,\n6                      TURNER v.

S. 480, 497–500 (1980) (Powell, J., controlling opinion\nconcurring in part) (transfer of prisoner to mental hospi\ntal). Indeed, the only circumstance in which the Court has\nfound that due process categorically requires appointed\ncounsel is juvenile delinquency proceedings, which the\nCourt has described as “functionally akin to a criminal\ntrial.” Scarpelli, supra, at 789, n. 12 (discussing In re\nGault, supra); see ante, at 9.\n   Despite language in its opinions that suggests it could\nfind otherwise, the Court’s consistent judgment has been\nthat fundamental fairness does not categorically require\nappointed counsel in any context outside of criminal\nproceedings. The majority is correct, therefore, that the\nCourt’s precedent does not require appointed counsel in\nthe absence of a deprivation of liberty. Id., at 9–10. But a\nmore complete description of this Court’s cases is that\neven when liberty is at stake, the Court has required\nappointed counsel in a category of cases only where it\nwould have found the Sixth Amendment required it—in\ncriminal prosecutions.\n                             II\n  The majority agrees that the Constitution does not\nentitle Turner to appointed counsel. But at the invitation\nof the Federal Government as amicus curiae, the majority\nholds that his contempt hearing violated the Due Process\nClause for an entirely different reason, which the parties\n——————\ncriminal contemners are entitled to “the protections that the Consti\ntution requires of such criminal proceedings,” including the right to\ncounsel. Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 826 (1994) (citing\nCooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925); internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

I would not reach this issue.\n  There are good reasons not to consider new issues raised\nfor the first and only time in an amicus brief. As here,\nthe new issue may be outside the question presented.3 See\nPet. for Cert. i (“Whether . . . an indigent defendant has no\nconstitutional right to appointed counsel at a civil con\ntempt proceeding that results in his incarceration”); see\nalso ante, at 4–5 (identifying the conflict among lower\ncourts as regarding “the right to counsel”). As here, the\nnew issue may not have been addressed by, or even pre\nsented to, the state court. See 387 S. C. 142, 144, 691\nS. E. 2d 470, 472 (2010) (describing the only question as\nwhether “the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nUnited States Constitution guarantee [Turner], as an\nindigent defendant in family court, the right to appointed\ncounsel”). As here, the parties may not have preserved the\nissue, leaving the record undeveloped. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n49, 43 (“The record is insufficient” regarding alternative\nprocedures because “[t]hey were raised for the very first\ntime at the merits stage here; so, there’s been no develop\nment”); Brief for Respondents 63.

Because the family court received a form\ndetailing Turner’s finances and the judge could not hold Turner in\ncontempt without concluding that he could pay, the due process ques\ntion that the majority answers reduces to a factbound assessment of the\nfamily court’s performance. See ante, at 14–16; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioner 14–15 (“[I]n advance of his hearing, Turner supplied to the\nfamily court just such a form”).\n8                    TURNER v.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7–12, 14–15 (Turner’s coun\nsel rejecting the Government’s argument that any proce\ndures short of a categorical right to appointed counsel\ncould satisfy due process); Reply Brief for Petitioner 14–\n15.\n   Accordingly, it is the wise and settled general practice of\nthis Court not to consider an issue in the first instance,\nmuch less one raised only by an amicus. See this Court’s\nRule 14.1(a) (“Only the questions set out in the petition, or\nfairly included therein, will be considered by the Court”);\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110\n(2001) (per curiam) (“[T]his is a court of final review and\nnot first view” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United\nParcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60, n. 2 (1981)\n(declining to consider an amicus’ argument “since it was\nnot raised by either of the parties here or below” and was\noutside the grant of certiorari). This is doubly true when\nwe review the decision of a state court and triply so when\nthe new issue is a constitutional matter. See McGoldrick\nv. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430,\n434 (1940) (“[I]t is only in exceptional cases, and then only\nin cases coming from the federal courts, that [this Court]\nconsiders questions urged by a petitioner or appellant not\npressed or passed upon in the courts below”); Cardinale v.\nLouisiana, 394 U.

In some cases, the Court properly affirms a\nlower court’s judgment on an alternative ground or accepts\nthe persuasive argument of an amicus on a question that\nthe parties have raised. See, e.g., United States v.\nTinklenberg, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). But\nit transforms a case entirely to vacate a state court’s\njudgment based on an alternative constitutional ground\nadvanced only by an amicus and outside the question on\nwhich the petitioner sought (and this Court granted)\nreview.\n   It should come as no surprise that the majority confines\nits analysis of the Federal Government’s new issue to ac-\nknowledging the Government’s “considerable experience”\nin the field of child support enforcement and then adopt\ning the Government’s suggestions in toto. See ante,\nat 14–15. Perhaps if the issue had been preserved and\nbriefed by the parties, the majority would have had alter\nnative solutions or procedures to consider. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 43 (“[T]here’s been no development. We don’t know\nwhat other States are doing, the range of options out\nthere”). The Federal Government’s interest in States’\nchild support enforcement efforts may give the Govern\nment a valuable perspective,4 but it does not overcome the\nstrong reasons behind the Court’s practice of not consider\ning new issues, raised and addressed only by an amicus,\nfor the first time in this Court.\n                          III\n  For the reasons explained in the previous two sections,\nI would not engage in the majority’s balancing analysis.\nBut there is yet another reason not to undertake the\n——————\n  4 See,\n       e.g., Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 618;\nChild Support Recovery Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 3403; Child Support\nEnforcement Amendments of 1984, 98 Stat. 1305; Social Services\nAmendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 2337.\n10                   TURNER v.

For example, Virginia, which uses civil contempt as\n“a last resort,” reports that in 2010 “deadbeats” paid ap\nproximately $13 million “either before a court hearing\nto avoid a contempt finding or after a court hearing to\npurge the contempt finding.” Id., at 13a–14a.

After the family court\nimposed Turner’s weekly support obligation in June 2003,\nhe made no payments until the court held him in contempt\nthree months later, whereupon he paid over $1,000 to\navoid confinement.

Argued March 23, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011\nAfter a South Carolina family court ordered petitioner Turner to pay\n  $51.73 per week to respondent Rogers to help support their child,\n  Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in con\n  tempt five times. For the first four, he was sentenced to 90 days’ im\n  prisonment, but he ultimately paid what he owed (twice without be\n  ing jailed, twice after spending a few days in custody). The fifth time\n  he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence. After his release,\n  the family court clerk issued a new “show cause” order against\n  Turner because he was $5728.76 in arrears. Both he and Rogers\n  were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.\n  The judge found Turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to 12\n  months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay\n  or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to\n  make support payments. After Turner completed his sentence, the\n  South Carolina Supreme Court rejected his claim that the Federal\n  Constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing, declar\n  ing that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safe\n  guards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.\nHeld:\n    1.

And there is a more than “reasonable” likelihood\n    that Turner will again be “subjected to the same action” because he\n    has frequently failed to make his support payments, has been the\n    subject of several civil contempt proceedings, has been imprisoned\n    several times, and is, once again, the subject of civil contempt pro\n    ceedings for failure to pay. DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, and\n    St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41, distinguished. Pp. 5–7.\n       2. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause does not auto\n    matically require the State to provide counsel at civil contempt pro\n    ceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child\n    support order, even if that individual faces incarceration. In particu\n    lar, that Clause does not require that counsel be provided where the\n    opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and\n    the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to\n    adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair oppor\n    tunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express\n    court findings as to the supporting parent’s ability to comply with the\n    support order. Pp. 7–16.\n          (a) This Court’s precedents provide no definitive answer to the\n    question whether counsel must be provided. The Sixth Amendment\n    grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel, see, e.g.,\n    United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696, but does not govern civil\n    cases. Civil and criminal contempt differ. A court may not impose\n    punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly estab\n    lished that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms\n    of the order.” Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9. And once a\n    civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of\n    the contempt and is free. Id., at 633. The Due Process Clause allows\n    a State to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt pro\n    ceedings than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641. Cases directly con\n    cerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of\n    such a right “only” in cases involving incarceration, but have not held\n    that a right to counsel exists in all such cases. See In re Gault, 387\n    U. S. 1; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480; and Lassiter v. Department of\n    Social Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18. Pp. 7–10.\n          (b) Because a contempt proceeding to compel support payments\n    is civil, the question whether the “specific dictates of due process” re\n    quire appointed counsel is determined by examining the “distinct fac\n    tors” this Court has used to decide what specific safeguards are\n    needed to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair. Mathews v.\n    Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335. As relevant here those factors include\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n(1) the nature of “the private interest that will be affected,” (2) the\ncomparative “risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with\nand without “additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” and (3)\nthe nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not pro\nviding “additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].” Ibid.\n   The “private interest that will be affected” argues strongly for the\nright to counsel here. That interest consists of an indigent defen\ndant’s loss of personal liberty through imprisonment. Freedom “from\nbodily restraint” lies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due\nProcess Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80. Thus, accu\nrate decisionmaking as to the “ability to pay”—which marks a divid\ning line between civil and criminal contempt, Hicks, supra, at 635, n.\n7—must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a\nwrongful incarceration. And because ability to comply divides civil\nand criminal contempt proceedings, an erroneous determination\nwould also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a crimi\nnal proceeding would demand. Questions about ability to pay are\nlikely to arise frequently in child custody cases. On the other hand,\ndue process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil\nproceedings where incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon v. Scar\npelli, 411 U. S. 778. To determine whether a right to counsel is re\nquired here, opposing interests and the probable value of “additional\nor substitute procedural safeguards” must be taken into account.\nMathews, supra, at 335.\n   Doing so reveals three related considerations that, taken together,\nargue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the\npresent kind. First, the likely critical question in these cases is the\ndefendant’s ability to pay, which is often closely related to his indi\ngence and relatively straightforward. Second, sometimes, as here,\nthe person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the govern\nment represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented\nby counsel. A requirement that the State provide counsel to the non\ncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of repre\nsentation that would “alter significantly the nature of the proceed\ning,” Gagnon, supra, at 787, creating a degree of formality or delay\nthat would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and\nmake the proceedings less fair overall. Third, as the Federal Gov\nernment points out, an available set of “substitute procedural safe\nguards,” Mathews, supra, at 335, if employed together, can signifi\ncantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty. These\ninclude (1) notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical\nissue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva\nlent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an oppor\ntunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions\n4                          TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court\n    that the defendant has the ability to pay.\n       This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where\n    the underlying support payment is owed to the State, e.g., for reim\n    bursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the ques\n    tion what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a\n    defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,”\n    Gagnon, supra, at 788. Pp. 10–16.\n       3. Under the circumstances, Turner’s incarceration violated due\n    process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alter\n    native procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have\n    clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical ques\n    tion in his civil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a\n    form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his fi\n    nancial circumstances. And the trial court did not find that he was\n    able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil con\n    tempt and ordered him incarcerated. P. 16.\n387 S. C. 142, 691 S.

We must\ndecide whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil\ncontempt hearing) to an indigent person potentially faced\nwith such incarceration. We conclude that where as here\nthe custodial parent (entitled to receive the support) is\nunrepresented by counsel, the State need not provide\ncounsel to the noncustodial parent (required to provide the\nsupport). But we attach an important caveat, namely,\nthat the State must nonetheless have in place alternative\nprocedures that assure a fundamentally fair determina\ntion of the critical incarceration-related question, whether\nthe supporting parent is able to comply with the support\norder.\n                           I\n                           A\n  South Carolina family courts enforce their child support\n2                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norders in part through civil contempt proceedings. Each\nmonth the family court clerk reviews outstanding child\nsupport orders, identifies those in which the supporting\nparent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends\nthat parent an order to “show cause” why he should not be\nheld in contempt. S. C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011). The\n“show cause” order and attached affidavit refer to the\nrelevant child support order, identify the amount of\nthe arrearage, and set a date for a court hearing. At the\nhearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in\ncontempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the\nrequired payments. See Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S. C. 348,\n351, 306 S. E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (“When the parent is\nunable to make the required payments, he is not in con\ntempt”). If he fails to make the required showing, the\ncourt may hold him in civil contempt. And it may require\nthat he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself\nof contempt by making the required child support pay\nments (but not for more than one year regardless). See\nS. C. Code Ann. §63–3–620 (Supp. 2010) (imprisonment\nfor up to one year of “adult who wilfully violates” a court\norder); Price v. Turner, 387 S. C. 142, 145, 691 S. E. 2d\n470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order must permit purging\nof contempt through compliance).\n                             B\n  In June 2003 a South Carolina family court entered an\norder, which (as amended) required petitioner, Michael\nTurner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent, Rebecca\nRogers, to help support their child. (Rogers’ father, Larry\nPrice, currently has custody of the child and is also a\nrespondent before this Court.) Over the next three years,\nTurner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was\nheld in contempt on five occasions. The first four times he\nwas sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment, but he ultimately\npaid the amount due (twice without being jailed, twice\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nafter spending two or three days in custody). The fifth\ntime he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.\n  After his release in 2006 Turner remained in arrears.\nOn March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new “show cause”\norder. And after an initial postponement due to Turner’s\nfailure to appear, Turner’s civil contempt hearing took\nplace on January 3, 2008. Turner and Rogers were pre\nsent, each without representation by counsel.\n  The hearing was brief. The court clerk said that Turner\nwas $5,728.76 behind in his payments. The judge asked\nTurner if there was “anything you want to say.” Turner\nreplied,\n    “Well, when I first got out, I got back on dope. I done\n    meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a\n    little bit here and there. And, when I finally did get to\n    working, I broke my back, back in September. I filed\n    for disability and SSI. And, I didn’t get straightened\n    out off the dope until I broke my back and laid up for\n    two months. And, now I’m off the dope and every\n    thing. I just hope that you give me a chance. I don’t\n    know what else to say. I mean, I know I done wrong,\n    and I should have been paying and helping her, and\n    I’m sorry. I mean, dope had a hold to me.” App. to\n    Pet. for Cert. 17a.\nThe judge then said, “[o]kay,” and asked Rogers if she had\nanything to say. Ibid. After a brief discussion of federal\nbenefits, the judge stated,\n    “If there’s nothing else, this will be the Order of\n    the Court. I find the Defendant in willful contempt.\n    I’m [going to] sentence him to twelve months in the\n    Oconee County Detention Center. He may purge him\n    self of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having\n    a zero balance on or before his release. I’ve also\n    placed a lien on any SSI or other benefits.” Id., at\n    18a.\n4                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThe judge added that Turner would not receive good-time\nor work credits, but “[i]f you’ve got a job, I’ll make you\neligible for work release.” Ibid. When Turner asked why\nhe could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge\nsaid, “[b]ecause that’s my ruling.” Ibid.\n   The court made no express finding concerning Turner’s\nability to pay his arrearage (though Turner’s wife had\nvoluntarily submitted a copy of Turner’s application for\ndisability benefits, cf. post, at 7, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., dissent\ning); App. 135a–136a). Nor did the judge ask any followup\nquestions or otherwise address the ability-to-pay issue.\nAfter the hearing, the judge filled out a prewritten form\ntitled “Order for Contempt of Court,” which included the\nstatement:\n    “Defendant (was) (was not) gainfully employed and/or\n    (had) (did not have) the ability to make these support\n    payments when due.” Id., at 60a, 61a.\nBut the judge left this statement as is without indicating\nwhether Turner was able to make support payments.\n                             C\n  While serving his 12-month sentence, Turner, with the\nhelp of pro bono counsel, appealed. He claimed that\nthe Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his con\ntempt hearing. The South Carolina Supreme Court de\ncided Turner’s appeal after he had completed his sentence.\nAnd it rejected his “right to counsel” claim. The court\npointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from\ncriminal contempt. The former does not require all the\n“constitutional safeguards” applicable in criminal proceed\nings. 387 S. C., at 145, 691 S. E. 2d, at 472. And the right\nto government-paid counsel, the Supreme Court held, was\none of the “safeguards” not required. Ibid.\n  Turner sought certiorari.

Compare,\ne.g., Pasqua v. Council, 186 N. J. 127, 141–146, 892 A. 2d\n663, 671–674 (2006); Black v.

Eighth\nJudicial Dist. Ct., County of Clark, 120 Nev. 798, 808–813,\n102 P. 3d 41, 48–51 (2004) (no right to counsel in civil\ncontempt hearing for nonsupport, except in “rarest of\ncases”); Andrews v. Walton, 428 So. 2d 663, 666 (Fla. 1983)\n(“no circumstances in which a parent is entitled to court\nappointed counsel in a civil contempt proceeding for fail\nure to pay child support”). Compare also In re Grand Jury\nProceedings, 468 F. 2d 1368, 1369 (CA9 1972) (per curiam)\n(general right to counsel in civil contempt proceedings),\nwith Duval v. Duval, 114 N. H. 422, 425–427, 322 A. 2d 1,\n3–4 (1974) (no general right, but counsel may be required\non case-by-case basis).\n                              II\n   Respondents argue that this case is moot. See Massa\nchusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 480 (1923) (Article III\njudicial power extends only to actual “cases” and “contro\nversies”); Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 4) (“An actual controversy must be extant at all stages\nof review” (internal quotation marks omitted)). They point\nout that Turner completed his 12-month prison sentence\nin 2009. And they add that there are no “collateral conse\nquences” of that particular contempt determination that\nmight keep the dispute alive. Compare Sibron v. New\nYork, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56 (1968) (release from prison does\nnot moot a criminal case because “collateral consequences”\n6                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nare presumed to continue), with Spencer v. Kemna, 523\nU. S. 1, 14 (1998) (declining to extend the presumption to\nparole revocation).\n   The short, conclusive answer to respondents’ mootness\nclaim, however, is that this case is not moot because it\nfalls within a special category of disputes that are “capable\nof repetition” while “evading review.” Southern Pacific\nTerminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). A dispute\nfalls into that category, and a case based on that dispute\nremains live, if “(1) the challenged action [is] in its dura\ntion too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that\nthe same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same\naction again.” Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 149\n(1975) (per curiam).\n   Our precedent makes clear that the “challenged action,”\nTurner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated” through the state\ncourts (and arrive here) prior to its “expiration.” See, e.g.,\nFirst Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n774 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (18-month\nperiod too short); Southern Pacific Terminal Co., supra, at\n514–516 (2-year period too short). At the same time, there\nis a more than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will\nagain be “subjected to the same action.” As we have\npointed out, supra, at 2–3, Turner has frequently failed to\nmake his child support payments. He has been the subject\nof several civil contempt proceedings. He has been im\nprisoned on several of those occasions. Within months of\nhis release from the imprisonment here at issue he was\nagain the subject of civil contempt proceedings. And he\nwas again imprisoned, this time for six months. As of\nDecember 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and\nanother contempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011.\nApp. 104a; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 1. These facts\nbring this case squarely within the special category of\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncases that are not moot because the underlying dispute\nis “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” See, e.g.,\nNebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539, 546–547\n(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Moreover, the underlying facts make this case unlike\nDeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam),\nand St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S. 41 (1943) (per\ncuriam), two cases that respondents believe require us to\nfind this case moot regardless. DeFunis was moot, but\nthat is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again\nsuffer the conduct of which he complained (and others\nlikely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own\nlawsuits). Here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future\nimprisonment.\n   St. Pierre was moot because the petitioner (a witness\nheld in contempt and sentenced to five months’ imprison\nment) had failed to “apply to this Court for a stay” of the\nfederal-court order imposing imprisonment. 319 U. S., at\n42–43. And, like the witness in St. Pierre, Turner did not\nseek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprison\nment. But this case, unlike St. Pierre, arises out of a\nstate-court proceeding. And respondents give us no reason\nto believe that we would have (or that we could have)\ngranted a timely request for a stay had one been made.\nCf. 28 U. S. C. §1257 (granting this Court jurisdiction to\nreview final state-court judgments). In Sibron, we re\njected a similar “mootness” argument for just that reason.\n392 U. S., at 53, n. 13. And we find this case similar in\nthis respect to Sibron, not to St. Pierre.\n                           III \n\n                            A\n\n  We must decide whether the Due Process Clause grants\nan indigent defendant, such as Turner, a right to state\nappointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, which\nmay lead to his incarceration. This Court’s precedents\n8                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprovide no definitive answer to that question. This Court\nhas long held that the Sixth Amendment grants an indi\ngent defendant the right to state-appointed counsel in\na criminal case. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335\n(1963). And we have held that this same rule applies to\ncriminal contempt proceedings (other than summary\nproceedings). United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696\n(1993); Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 537 (1925).\n   But the Sixth Amendment does not govern civil cases.\nCivil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it\nseeks only to “coerc[e] the defendant to do” what a court\nhad previously ordered him to do. Gompers v. Bucks Stove\n& Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 442 (1911). A court may not\nimpose punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding when\nit is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is\nunable to comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v.\nFeiock, 485 U. S. 624, 638, n. 9 (1988). And once a civil\ncontemnor complies with the underlying order, he is\npurged of the contempt and is free. Id., at 633 (he\n“carr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in [his] own pockets”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a case not\ninvolving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt\nis at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protec\ntions than in a criminal case. Id., at 637–641 (State may\nplace the burden of proving inability to pay on the defen\ndant).\n   This Court has decided only a handful of cases that\nmore directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.\nAnd the application of those decisions to the present case\nis not clear. On the one hand, the Court has held that the\nFourteenth Amendment requires the State to pay for\nrepresentation by counsel in a civil “juvenile delinquency”\nproceeding (which could lead to incarceration).

S. 480, 496–497 (1980), a plurality of four\nMembers of this Court would have held that the Four\nteenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in\na proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital\nfor the mentally ill. Further, in Lassiter v. Department of\nSocial Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18 (1981), a case\nthat focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of pa\nrental rights, the Court wrote that the\n    “pre-eminent generalization that emerges from this\n    Court’s precedents on an indigent’s right to appointed\n    counsel is that such a right has been recognized to ex\n    ist only where the litigant may lose his physical lib\n    erty if he loses the litigation.” Id., at 25.\nAnd the Court then drew from these precedents “the pre\nsumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed\ncounsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his\nphysical liberty.” Id., at 26–27.\n  On the other hand, the Court has held that a criminal\noffender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment\ndoes not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation\nrevocation hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778\n(1973); see also Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25 (1976)\n(no due process right to counsel in summary court-martial\nproceedings). And, at the same time, Gault, Vitek, and\nLassiter are readily distinguishable. The civil juvenile\ndelinquency proceeding at issue in Gault was “little differ\nent” from, and “comparable in seriousness” to, a criminal\nprosecution. 387 U. S., at 28, 36. In Vitek, the controlling\nopinion found no right to counsel. 445 U. S., at 499–500\n(Powell, J., concurring in part) (assistance of mental\nhealth professionals sufficient). And the Court’s state\nments in Lassiter constitute part of its rationale for deny\ning a right to counsel in that case. We believe those\nstatements are best read as pointing out that the Court\npreviously had found a right to counsel “only” in cases\n10                  TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving incarceration, not that a right to counsel exists\nin all such cases (a position that would have been difficult\nto reconcile with Gagnon).\n                              B\n  Civil contempt proceedings in child support cases con-\nstitute one part of a highly complex system designed to\nassure a noncustodial parent’s regular payment of funds\ntypically necessary for the support of his children. Often\nthe family receives welfare support from a state\nadministered federal program, and the State then seeks\nreimbursement from the noncustodial parent. See 42\nU. S. C. §§608(a)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006\ned.); S. C. Code Ann. §§43–5–65(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum.\nSupp.). Other times the custodial parent (often the\nmother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent, or an\nother person with custody) does not receive government\nbenefits and is entitled to receive the support payments\nherself.\n  The Federal Government has created an elaborate\nprocedural mechanism designed to help both the govern\nment and custodial parents to secure the payments to\nwhich they are entitled. See generally Blessing v. Free\nstone, 520 U. S. 329, 333 (1997) (describing the “interlock\ning set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs” as\nthey relate to child support enforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303\n(2010) (prescribing standards for state child support agen\ncies). These systems often rely upon wage withholding,\nexpedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child\nsupport orders, and automated data processing.            42\nU. S. C. §§666(a), (b), 654(24). But sometimes States will\nuse contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent\nreceives support payments or the government receives\nreimbursement. Although some experts have criticized\nthis last-mentioned procedure, and the Federal Govern\nment believes that “the routine use of contempt for non\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayment of child support is likely to be an ineffective\nstrategy,” the Government also tells us that “coercive\nenforcement remedies, such as contempt, have a role to\nplay.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21–22,\nand n. 8 (citing Dept. of Health and Human Services,\nNational Child Support Enforcement, Strategic Plan: FY\n2005–2009, pp. 2, 10). South Carolina, which relies heav\nily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an im\nportant tool.\n   We here consider an indigent’s right to paid counsel at\nsuch a contempt proceeding. It is a civil proceeding. And\nwe consequently determine the “specific dictates of due\nprocess” by examining the “distinct factors” that this\nCourt has previously found useful in deciding what spe\ncific safeguards the Constitution’s Due Process Clause re\nquires in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally\nfair. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976) (con\nsidering fairness of an administrative proceeding). As\nrelevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the\nprivate interest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative\n“risk” of an “erroneous deprivation” of that interest with\nand without “additional or substitute procedural safe\nguards,” and (3) the nature and magnitude of any counter\nvailing interest in not providing “additional or substitute\nprocedural requirement[s].” Ibid. See also Lassiter, 452\nU. S., at 27–31 (applying the Mathews framework).\n   The “private interest that will be affected” argues\nstrongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.\nThat interest consists of an indigent defendant’s loss of\npersonal liberty through imprisonment. The interest in\nsecuring that freedom, the freedom “from bodily restraint,”\nlies “at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process\nClause.” Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71, 80 (1992).\nAnd we have made clear that its threatened loss through\nlegal proceedings demands “due process protection.”\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 425 (1979).\n12                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Given the importance of the interest at stake, it is ob\nviously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in\nrespect to the key “ability to pay” question. Moreover, the\nfact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between\ncivil and criminal contempt, Hicks, 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7,\nreinforces the need for accuracy. That is because an incor\nrect decision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding\nas civil) can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by\ndepriving the defendant of the procedural protections\n(including counsel) that the Constitution would demand in\na criminal proceeding. See, e.g., Dixon, 509 U. S., at 696\n(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, protection from double\njeopardy); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 512–\n513, 517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than\nsix months’ imprisonment). And since 70% of child sup\nport arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either\nno reported income or income of $10,000 per year or less,\nthe issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often. See\nE. Sorensen, L. Sousa, & S. Schaner, Assessing Child\nSupport Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation\n22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute), online at\nhttp://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as\nvisited June 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file); id., at 23 (“research suggests that many obligors\nwho do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively\nlimited resources”); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the\nIndigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of\nDebtor’s Prison, 18 Cornell J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 95, 117\n(2008). See also, e.g., McBride v. McBride, 334 N. C. 124,\n131, n. 4, 431 S. E. 2d 14, 19, n. 4 (1993) (surveying North\nCarolina contempt orders and finding that the “failure of\ntrial courts to make a determination of a contemnor’s\nability to comply is not altogether infrequent”).\n   On the other hand, the Due Process Clause does not\nalways require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings\nwhere incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon, 411 U. S.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n778. And in determining whether the Clause requires a\nright to counsel here, we must take account of opposing\ninterests, as well as consider the probable value of “addi\ntional or substitute procedural safeguards.” Mathews,\nsupra, at 335.\n   Doing so, we find three related considerations that,\nwhen taken together, argue strongly against the Due\nProcess Clause requiring the State to provide indigents\nwith counsel in every proceeding of the kind before us.\n   First, the critical question likely at issue in these cases\nconcerns, as we have said, the defendant’s ability to pay.\nThat question is often closely related to the question of the\ndefendant’s indigence. But when the right procedures are\nin place, indigence can be a question that in many—but\nnot all—cases is sufficiently straightforward to warrant\ndetermination prior to providing a defendant with counsel,\neven in a criminal case. Federal law, for example, re\nquires a criminal defendant to provide information show\ning that he is indigent, and therefore entitled to state\nfunded counsel, before he can receive that assistance. See\n18 U. S. C. §3006A(b).\n   Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the\ndefendant at the hearing is not the government repre\nsented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented\nby counsel. See Dept. of Health and Human Services,\nOffice of Child Support Enforcement, Understanding Child\nSupport Debt: A Guide to Exploring Child Support Debt in\nYour State 5, 6 (2004) (51% of nationwide arrears, and\n58% in South Carolina, are not owed to the government).\nThe custodial parent, perhaps a woman with custody of\none or more children, may be relatively poor, unemployed,\nand unable to afford counsel. Yet she may have encour\naged the court to enforce its order through contempt. Cf.\nTr. Contempt Proceedings (Sept. 14, 2005), App. 44a–45a\n(Rogers asks court, in light of pattern of nonpayment, to\nconfine Turner). She may be able to provide the court\n14                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith significant information. Cf. id., at 41a–43a (Rogers\ndescribes where Turner lived and worked). And the pro\nceeding is ultimately for her benefit.\n   A requirement that the State provide counsel to the\nnoncustodial parent in these cases could create an asym\nmetry of representation that would “alter significantly the\nnature of the proceeding.” Gagnon, supra, at 787. Doing\nso could mean a degree of formality or delay that would\nunduly slow payment to those immediately in need. And,\nperhaps more important for present purposes, doing so\ncould make the proceedings less fair overall, increasing the\nrisk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family\nof the support it is entitled to receive. The needs of such\nfamilies play an important role in our analysis. Cf. post,\nat 10–12 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n   Third, as the Solicitor General points out, there is avail\nable a set of “substitute procedural safeguards,” Mathews,\n424 U. S., at 335, which, if employed together, can signifi\ncantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of lib\nerty. They can do so, moreover, without incurring some of\nthe drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right\nto counsel. Those safeguards include (1) notice to the de\nfendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the\ncontempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equiva\nlent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an oppor\ntunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to\nstatements and questions about his financial status, (e.g.,\nthose triggered by his responses on the form); and (4) an\nexpress finding by the court that the defendant has the\nability to pay. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 23–25. In presenting these al\nternatives, the Government draws upon considerable\nexperience in helping to manage statutorily mandated\nfederal-state efforts to enforce child support orders. See\nsupra, at 10. It does not claim that they are the only\npossible alternatives, and this Court’s cases suggest, for\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexample, that sometimes assistance other than purely\nlegal assistance (here, say, that of a neutral social worker)\ncan prove constitutionally sufficient. Cf. Vitek, 445 U. S.,\nat 499–500 (Powell, J., concurring in part) (provision of\nmental health professional). But the Government does\nclaim that these alternatives can assure the “fundamental\nfairness” of the proceeding even where the State does not\npay for counsel for an indigent defendant.\n   While recognizing the strength of Turner’s arguments,\nwe ultimately believe that the three considerations we\nhave just discussed must carry the day. In our view, a\ncategorical right to counsel in proceedings of the kind\nbefore us would carry with it disadvantages (in the form of\nunfairness and delay) that, in terms of ultimate fairness,\nwould deprive it of significant superiority over the alterna\ntives that we have mentioned. We consequently hold that\nthe Due Process Clause does not automatically require the\nprovision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an\nindigent individual who is subject to a child support order,\neven if that individual faces incarceration (for up to a\nyear). In particular, that Clause does not require the\nprovision of counsel where the opposing parent or other\ncustodian (to whom support funds are owed) is not repre\nsented by counsel and the State provides alternative\nprocedural safeguards equivalent to those we have men\ntioned (adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay,\nfair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant in\nformation, and court findings).\n   We do not address civil contempt proceedings where the\nunderlying child support payment is owed to the State, for\nexample, for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the\nparent with custody. See supra, at 10. Those proceedings\nmore closely resemble debt-collection proceedings. The\ngovernment is likely to have counsel or some other compe\ntent representative. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458,\n462–463 (1938) (“[T]he average defendant does not have\n16                   TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe professional legal skill to protect himself when brought\nbefore a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty,\nwherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and\nlearned counsel” (emphasis added)). And this kind of\nproceeding is not before us. Neither do we address what\ndue process requires in an unusually complex case where\na defendant “can fairly be represented only by a trained\nadvocate.” Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 788; see also Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 18–20 (not claiming that Turner’s case is\nespecially complex).\n                             IV\n  The record indicates that Turner received neither coun\nsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those we\nhave described. He did not receive clear notice that his\nability to pay would constitute the critical question in his\ncivil contempt proceeding. No one provided him with a\nform (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information\nabout his financial circumstances. The court did not find\nthat Turner was able to pay his arrearage, but instead left\nthe relevant “finding” section of the contempt order blank.\nThe court nonetheless found Turner in contempt and\nordered him incarcerated. Under these circumstances\nTurner’s incarceration violated the Due Process Clause.\n  We vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt and remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Therefore, I would affirm. Although the Court\nagrees that appointed counsel was not required in this\ncase, it nevertheless vacates the judgment of the South\nCarolina Supreme Court on a different ground, which the\nparties have never raised. Solely at the invitation of\nthe United States as amicus curiae, the majority decides\nthat Turner’s contempt proceeding violated due process be-\ncause it did not include “alternative procedural safe\nguards.” Ante, at 15. Consistent with this Court’s long\nstanding practice, I would not reach that question.1\n                              I\n  The only question raised in this case is whether the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment creates a\nright to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants facing\nincarceration in civil contempt proceedings. It does not.\n——————\n  1 I agree with the Court that this case is not moot because the chal\n\nlenged action is likely to recur yet is so brief that it otherwise evades\nour review. Ante, at 5–7.\n2                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   Under an original understanding of the Constitution,\nthere is no basis for concluding that the guarantee of due\nprocess secures a right to appointed counsel in civil con\ntempt proceedings. It certainly does not do so to the ex\ntent that the Due Process Clause requires “ ‘that our\nGovernment must proceed according to the “law of the\nland”—that is, according to written constitutional and statu\ntory provisions.’” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 589\n(2004) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358, 382 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting)). No one\ncontends that South Carolina law entitles Turner to ap\npointed counsel. Nor does any federal statute or constitu\ntional provision so provide. Although the Sixth Amend\nment secures a right to “the Assistance of Counsel,” it does\nnot apply here because civil contempt proceedings are not\n“criminal prosecutions.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; see ante, at\n8. Moreover, as originally understood, the Sixth Amend\nment guaranteed only the “right to employ counsel, or to\nuse volunteered services of counsel”; it did not require the\ncourt to appoint counsel in any circumstance. Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 2); see also United States v. Van Duzee, 140\nU. S. 169, 173 (1891); W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in\nAmerican Courts 21–22, 28–29 (1955); F. Heller, The\nSixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\n110 (1951).\n   Appointed counsel is also not required in civil contempt\nproceedings under a somewhat broader reading of the Due\nProcess Clause, which takes it to approve “ ‘[a] process of\nlaw, which is not otherwise forbidden, . . . [that] can show\nthe sanction of settled usage.’ ” Weiss v. United States, 510\nU. S. 163, 197 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting Hurtado v. California,\n110 U. S. 516, 528 (1884)). Despite a long history of courts\nexercising contempt authority, Turner has not identified\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nany evidence that courts appointed counsel in those pro\nceedings. See Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 831\n(1994) (describing courts’ traditional assumption of “in\nherent contempt authority”); see also 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 280–285 (1769)\n(describing the “summary proceedings” used to adjudicate\ncontempt). Indeed, Turner concedes that contempt pro\nceedings without appointed counsel have the blessing of\nhistory. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15–16 (admitting that there\nis no historical support for Turner’s rule); see also Brief for\nRespondents 47–48.\n                             B\n   Even under the Court’s modern interpretation of the\nConstitution, the Due Process Clause does not provide a\nright to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants\nfacing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings. Such\na reading would render the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel—as it is currently understood—superfluous.\nMoreover, it appears that even cases applying the Court’s\nmodern interpretation of due process have not understood\nit to categorically require appointed counsel in circum\nstances outside those otherwise covered by the Sixth\nAmendment.\n                                1\n  Under the Court’s current jurisprudence, the Sixth\nAmendment entitles indigent defendants to appointed coun-\nsel in felony cases and other criminal cases resulting\nin a sentence of imprisonment. See Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U. S. 335, 344–345 (1963); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407\nU. S. 25, 37 (1972); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, 373–374\n(1979); Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 662 (2002).\nTurner concedes that, even under these cases, the Sixth\nAmendment does not entitle him to appointed counsel.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioner 12 (acknowledging that\n4                    TURNER v. ROGERS\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n“civil contempt is not a ‘criminal prosecution’ within the\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment”). He argues instead\nthat “the right to the assistance of counsel for persons\nfacing incarceration arises not only from the Sixth\nAmendment, but also from the requirement of fundamen\ntal fairness under the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment.” Brief for Petitioner 28. In his view,\nthis Court has relied on due process to “rejec[t] formalistic\ndistinctions between criminal and civil proceedings, in\nstead concluding that incarceration or other confinement\ntriggers the right to counsel.” Id., at 33.\n   But if the Due Process Clause created a right to ap\npointed counsel in all proceedings with the potential for\ndetention, then the Sixth Amendment right to appointed\ncounsel would be unnecessary. Under Turner’s theory,\nevery instance in which the Sixth Amendment guarantees\na right to appointed counsel is covered also by the Due\nProcess Clause. The Sixth Amendment, however, is the\nonly constitutional provision that even mentions the assis\ntance of counsel; the Due Process Clause says nothing\nabout counsel. Ordinarily, we do not read a general provi\nsion to render a specific one superfluous. Cf. Morales v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384 (1992)\n(“[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the\nspecific governs the general”). The fact that one constitu\ntional provision expressly provides a right to appointed\ncounsel in specific circumstances indicates that the Con\nstitution does not also sub silentio provide that right far\nmore broadly in another, more general, provision. Cf.\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 273 (1994) (plurality\nopinion) (“Where a particular Amendment provides an\nexplicit textual source of constitutional protection against\na particular sort of government behavior, that Amend\nment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due\nprocess,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 281 (KENNEDY,\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

(slip op., at 16) (applying Albright to the Tak\nings Clause).\n                              2\n   Moreover, contrary to Turner’s assertions, the holdings\nin this Court’s due process decisions regarding the right to\ncounsel are actually quite narrow. The Court has never\nfound in the Due Process Clause a categorical right to\nappointed counsel outside of criminal prosecutions or\nproceedings “functionally akin to a criminal trial.” Gag\nnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, 789, n. 12 (1973) (dis\ncussing In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967)). This is consistent\nwith the conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not\nexpand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by\nthe Sixth Amendment.\n   After countless factors weighed, mores evaluated, and\npractices surveyed, the Court has not determined that due\nprocess principles of fundamental fairness categorically\nrequire counsel in any context outside criminal proceed\nings. See, e.g., Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of\nDurham Cty., 452 U. S. 18, 31–32 (1981); Wolff v. McDon\nnell, 418 U. S. 539, 569–570 (1974); see also Walters v.\nNational Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 307–\n308, 320–326 (1985); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, 583\n(1975). Even when the defendant’s liberty is at stake, the\nCourt has not concluded that fundamental fairness re\nquires that counsel always be appointed if the proceeding\nis not criminal.2 See, e.g., Scarpelli, supra, at 790 (proba\n——————\n 2 “Criminal   contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense”; therefore,\n6                      TURNER v.

S. 584, 599–600, 606–607, 610, n. 18 (1979) (commit\nment of minor to mental hospital); Vitek v. Jones, 445\nU. S. 480, 497–500 (1980) (Powell, J., controlling opinion\nconcurring in part) (transfer of prisoner to mental hospi\ntal). Indeed, the only circumstance in which the Court has\nfound that due process categorically requires appointed\ncounsel is juvenile delinquency proceedings, which the\nCourt has described as “functionally akin to a criminal\ntrial.” Scarpelli, supra, at 789, n. 12 (discussing In re\nGault, supra); see ante, at 9.\n   Despite language in its opinions that suggests it could\nfind otherwise, the Court’s consistent judgment has been\nthat fundamental fairness does not categorically require\nappointed counsel in any context outside of criminal\nproceedings. The majority is correct, therefore, that the\nCourt’s precedent does not require appointed counsel in\nthe absence of a deprivation of liberty. Id., at 9–10. But a\nmore complete description of this Court’s cases is that\neven when liberty is at stake, the Court has required\nappointed counsel in a category of cases only where it\nwould have found the Sixth Amendment required it—in\ncriminal prosecutions.\n                             II\n  The majority agrees that the Constitution does not\nentitle Turner to appointed counsel. But at the invitation\nof the Federal Government as amicus curiae, the majority\nholds that his contempt hearing violated the Due Process\nClause for an entirely different reason, which the parties\n——————\ncriminal contemners are entitled to “the protections that the Consti\ntution requires of such criminal proceedings,” including the right to\ncounsel.

I would not reach this issue.\n  There are good reasons not to consider new issues raised\nfor the first and only time in an amicus brief. As here,\nthe new issue may be outside the question presented.3 See\nPet. for Cert. i (“Whether . . . an indigent defendant has no\nconstitutional right to appointed counsel at a civil con\ntempt proceeding that results in his incarceration”); see\nalso ante, at 4–5 (identifying the conflict among lower\ncourts as regarding “the right to counsel”). As here, the\nnew issue may not have been addressed by, or even pre\nsented to, the state court. See 387 S. C. 142, 144, 691\nS. E. 2d 470, 472 (2010) (describing the only question as\nwhether “the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nUnited States Constitution guarantee [Turner], as an\nindigent defendant in family court, the right to appointed\ncounsel”). As here, the parties may not have preserved the\nissue, leaving the record undeveloped. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n49, 43 (“The record is insufficient” regarding alternative\nprocedures because “[t]hey were raised for the very first\ntime at the merits stage here; so, there’s been no develop\nment”); Brief for Respondents 63.

Because the family court received a form\ndetailing Turner’s finances and the judge could not hold Turner in\ncontempt without concluding that he could pay, the due process ques\ntion that the majority answers reduces to a factbound assessment of the\nfamily court’s performance. See ante, at 14–16; Reply Brief for Peti\ntioner 14–15 (“[I]n advance of his hearing, Turner supplied to the\nfamily court just such a form”).\n8                    TURNER v.

Finally, as here, a party may even\noppose the position taken by its allegedly supportive\namicus. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7–12, 14–15 (Turner’s coun\nsel rejecting the Government’s argument that any proce\ndures short of a categorical right to appointed counsel\ncould satisfy due process); Reply Brief for Petitioner 14–\n15.\n   Accordingly, it is the wise and settled general practice of\nthis Court not to consider an issue in the first instance,\nmuch less one raised only by an amicus. See this Court’s\nRule 14.1(a) (“Only the questions set out in the petition, or\nfairly included therein, will be considered by the Court”);\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110\n(2001) (per curiam) (“[T]his is a court of final review and\nnot first view” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United\nParcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, 60, n. 2 (1981)\n(declining to consider an amicus’ argument “since it was\nnot raised by either of the parties here or below” and was\noutside the grant of certiorari). This is doubly true when\nwe review the decision of a state court and triply so when\nthe new issue is a constitutional matter. See McGoldrick\nv. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430,\n434 (1940) (“[I]t is only in exceptional cases, and then only\nin cases coming from the federal courts, that [this Court]\nconsiders questions urged by a petitioner or appellant not\npressed or passed upon in the courts below”); Cardinale v.\nLouisiana, 394 U. S. 437, 438 (1969) (“[T]he Court will not\ndecide federal constitutional issues raised here for the first\ntime on review of state court decisions”).\n   The majority errs in moving beyond the question that\nwas litigated below, decided by the state courts, petitioned\nto this Court, and argued by the parties here, to resolve a\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

In some cases, the Court properly affirms a\nlower court’s judgment on an alternative ground or accepts\nthe persuasive argument of an amicus on a question that\nthe parties have raised. See, e.g., United States v.\nTinklenberg, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). But\nit transforms a case entirely to vacate a state court’s\njudgment based on an alternative constitutional ground\nadvanced only by an amicus and outside the question on\nwhich the petitioner sought (and this Court granted)\nreview.\n   It should come as no surprise that the majority confines\nits analysis of the Federal Government’s new issue to ac-\nknowledging the Government’s “considerable experience”\nin the field of child support enforcement and then adopt\ning the Government’s suggestions in toto. See ante,\nat 14–15. Perhaps if the issue had been preserved and\nbriefed by the parties, the majority would have had alter\nnative solutions or procedures to consider. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 43 (“[T]here’s been no development. We don’t know\nwhat other States are doing, the range of options out\nthere”). The Federal Government’s interest in States’\nchild support enforcement efforts may give the Govern\nment a valuable perspective,4 but it does not overcome the\nstrong reasons behind the Court’s practice of not consider\ning new issues, raised and addressed only by an amicus,\nfor the first time in this Court.\n                          III\n  For the reasons explained in the previous two sections,\nI would not engage in the majority’s balancing analysis.\nBut there is yet another reason not to undertake the\n——————\n  4 See,\n       e.g., Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 618;\nChild Support Recovery Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 3403; Child Support\nEnforcement Amendments of 1984, 98 Stat. 1305; Social Services\nAmendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 2337.\n10                   TURNER v.

Id., at 335 (identifying the oppos\ning interest as “the Government’s interest”); Lassiter, 452\nU. S., at 27 (same). It does not account for the interests of\nthe child and custodial parent, who is usually the child’s\nmother. But their interests are the very reason for the\nchild support obligation and the civil contempt proceed\nings that enforce it.\n  When fathers fail in their duty to pay child support,\nchildren suffer.

The States that use civil contempt\nwith the threat of detention find it a “highly effective” tool\nfor collecting child support when nothing else works.\nCompendium of Responses Collected by the U. S. Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services Office of Child Support En\nforcement (Dec. 28, 2010), reprinted in App. to Brief\nfor Sen. DeMint et al. as Amici Curiae 7a; see id., at 3a,\n9a. For example, Virginia, which uses civil contempt as\n“a last resort,” reports that in 2010 “deadbeats” paid ap\nproximately $13 million “either before a court hearing\nto avoid a contempt finding or after a court hearing to\npurge the contempt finding.” Id., at 13a–14a. Other\nStates confirm that the mere threat of imprisonment is\noften quite effective because most contemners “will pay . . .\nrather than go to jail.” Id., at 4a; see also Underground\nEconomy C–2 (“Many judges . . . report that the prospect\nof [detention] often causes obligors to discover previously\nundisclosed resources that they can use to make child\nsupport payments”).\n  This case illustrates the point. After the family court\nimposed Turner’s weekly support obligation in June 2003,\nhe made no payments until the court held him in contempt\nthree months later, whereupon he paid over $1,000 to\navoid confinement. App. 17a–18a, 131a. Three more\ntimes, Turner refused to pay until the family court held\nhim in contempt—then paid in short order. Id., at 23a–\n25a, 31a–34a, 125a–126a, 129a–130a.\n  Although I think that the majority’s analytical frame\nwork does not account for the interests that children and\nmothers have in effective and flexible methods to secure\npayment, I do not pass on the wisdom of the majority’s\npreferred procedures. Nor do I address the wisdom of\nthe State’s decision to use certain methods of enforcement.\nWhether “deadbeat dads” should be threatened with in\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
