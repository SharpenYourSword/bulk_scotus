Argued April 19, 2011\u2014Decided June 20, 2011\nIn Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean\n  Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide\n  and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection\n  Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking pe\n  tition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor\n  vehicles. In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under \u00a7111 of\n  the Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a77411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions\n  from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pur\n  suant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to\n  issuing a final rule by May 2012.\n     The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated ef\n  forts to regulate greenhouse gases. Two groups of plaintiffs, respon\n  dents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court\n  against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners\n  here. One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York\n  City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts. According to the\n  complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide\n  in the Nation. By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs as\n  serted, the defendants\u2019 emissions substantially and unreasonably in\n  terfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of\n  interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law. All plain\n  tiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defen\n  dant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.\n     The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticia\n  ble political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed. On the\n  threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred\n  by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had ade\n2          AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    quately alleged Article III standing. On the merits, the court held\n    that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the \u201cfederal common law\n    of nuisance,\u201d relying on this Court\u2019s decisions holding that States\n    may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by\n    other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v. Milwau\n    kee, 406 U. S. 91, 93 (Milwaukee I). The court further determined\n    that the Clean Air Act did not \u201cdisplace\u201d federal common law.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an\n equally divided Court. P. 6.\n    2. The Clean Air Act and the EPA action the Act authorizes dis\n place any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon\n dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pp. 6\u201316.\n       (a) Since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, recognized\n that there \u201cis no federal general common law,\u201d a new federal common\n law has emerged for subjects of national concern. When dealing\n \u201cwith air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a\n federal common law.\u201d Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 103. Decisions of\n this Court predating Erie, but compatible with the emerging distinc\n tion between general common law and the new federal common law,\n have approved federal common-law suits brought by one State to\n abate pollution emanating from another State. See, e.g., Missouri v.\n Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241\u2013243. The plaintiffs contend that their\n right to maintain this suit follows from such cases. But recognition\n that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily\n mean that federal courts should create the controlling law. The\n Court need not address the question whether, absent the Clean Air\n Act and the EPA actions it authorizes, the plaintiffs could state a\n federal common-law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emis\n sions because of their contribution to global warming. Any such\n claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA\n to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) \u201c[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed\n by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an un\n usual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.\u201d Milwau\n kee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 314 (Milwaukee II). Legislative dis\n placement of federal common law does not require the \u201csame sort of\n evidence of a clear and manifest [congressional] purpose\u201d demanded\n for preemption of state law. Id., at 317. Rather, the test is simply\n whether the statute \u201cspeak[s] directly to [the] question\u201d at issue.\n Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625. Here, Massa\n chusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air\n pollution subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. 549 U. S., at\n 528\u2013529. And it is equally plain that the Act \u201cspeaks directly\u201d to\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nemissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants\u2019 plants. The Act di\nrects EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of station\nary sources that, \u201cin [the Administrator\u2019s] judgment,\u201d \u201ccaus[e], or\ncontribut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be\nanticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(A).\nOnce EPA lists a category, it must establish performance standards\nfor emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that\ncategory, \u00a77411(b)(1)(B), and, most relevant here, must regulate ex\nisting sources within the same category, \u00a77411(d). The Act also pro\nvides multiple avenues for enforcement. If EPA does not set emis\nsions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution, States\nand private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and\nEPA\u2019s response will be reviewable in federal court. See \u00a77607(b)(1).\nThe Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of\ncarbon dioxide from domestic power plants\u2014the same relief the\nplaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law. There is no room for\na parallel track. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (c) The Court rejects the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, and the Second\nCircuit\u2019s holding, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA\nactually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions stan\ndards for the defendants\u2019 plants. The relevant question for displace\nment purposes is \u201cwhether the field has been occupied, not whether it\nhas been occupied in a particular manner.\u201d Milwaukee II, 451 U. S.,\nat 324. The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the Legislature\u2019s\n\u201cconsidered judgment\u201d concerning air pollution regulation because it\npermits emissions until EPA acts. The critical point is that Congress\ndelegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon\ndioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation displaces federal\ncommon law. If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the\noutcome of EPA\u2019s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse is to seek\nCourt of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari.\n   The Act\u2019s prescribed order of decisionmaking\u2014first by the expert\nagency, and then by federal judges\u2014is yet another reason to resist\nsetting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.\nThe appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse gas\nproducing sector requires informed assessment of competing inter\nests. The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in\nthe first instance, in combination with state regulators. The expert\nagency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges,\nwho lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an\nagency can utilize in coping with issues of this order. The plaintiffs\u2019\nproposal to have federal judges determine, in the first instance, what\namount of carbon-dioxide emissions is \u201cunreasonable\u201d and what level\nof reduction is necessary cannot be reconciled with Congress\u2019 scheme.\n4          AMERICAN ELEC.

In light of the holding here that the\n    Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability vel non\n    of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the\n    federal Act. Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or\n    otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance\n    law, the matter is left for consideration on remand.

As relief, the plaintiffs ask for a decree\nsetting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an\ninitial cap, to be further reduced annually. The Clean Air\nAct and the Environmental Protection Agency action the\nAct authorizes, we hold, displace the claims the plaintiffs\nseek to pursue.\n                             I\n    In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), this\nCourt held that the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S.

POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhelps keep the Earth warm enough for life.\u201d 74 Fed. Reg.\n66499 (2009).1 Massachusetts held that the Environ\nmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread the Clean\nAir Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking\ncontrols on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor\nvehicles. 549 U. S., at 510\u2013511. Greenhouse gases, we\ndetermined, qualify as \u201cair pollutant[s]\u201d within the mean\ning of the governing Clean Air Act provision, id., at 528\u2013\n529 (quoting \u00a77602(g)); they are therefore within EPA\u2019s\nregulatory ken. Because EPA had authority to set green\nhouse gas emission standards and had offered no \u201crea\nsoned explanation\u201d for failing to do so, we concluded that\nthe agency had not acted \u201cin accordance with law\u201d when it\ndenied the requested rulemaking. Id., at 534\u2013535 (quot\ning \u00a77607(d)(9)(A)).\n   Responding to our decision in Massachusetts, EPA un\ndertook greenhouse gas regulation. In December 2009,\nthe agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from\nmotor vehicles \u201ccause, or contribute to, air pollution which\nmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health\nor welfare,\u201d the Act\u2019s regulatory trigger. \u00a77521(a)(1); 74\nFed.

Acknowl\nedging that not all scientists agreed on the causes and\nconsequences of the rise in global temperatures, id., at\n66506, 66518, 66523\u201366524, EPA concluded that \u201ccompel\nling\u201d evidence supported the \u201cattribution of observed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In addition to carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gases emitted\n\nby human activities include methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocar\nbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. 74 Fed.

Consequent dangers of greenhouse\ngas emissions, EPA determined, included increases in\nheat-related deaths; coastal inundation and erosion\ncaused by melting icecaps and rising sea levels; more\nfrequent and intense hurricanes, floods, and other \u201cex\ntreme weather events\u201d that cause death and destroy infra\nstructure; drought due to reductions in mountain snow\npack and shifting precipitation patterns; destruction of\necosystems supporting animals and plants; and potentially\n\u201csignificant disruptions\u201d of food production. Id., at 66524\u2013\n66535.2\n   EPA and the Department of Transportation subse\nquently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from\nlight-duty vehicles, see 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010), and\ninitiated a joint rulemaking covering medium- and heavy\nduty vehicles, see id., at 74152. EPA also began phasing\nin requirements that new or modified \u201c[m]ajor [greenhouse\ngas] emitting facilities\u201d use the \u201cbest available control\ntechnology.\u201d \u00a77475(a)(4); 75 Fed.

C. \u00a77411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emis\nsions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired\npower plants. Pursuant to a settlement finalized in March\n2011, EPA has committed to issuing a proposed rule by\nJuly 2011, and a final rule by May 2012. See 75 Fed.

The defen\ndants, now petitioners, are four private companies5 and\nthe Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned corpo\nration that operates fossil-fuel fired power plants in sev\neral States. According to the complaints, the defendants\n\u201care the five largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the\nUnited States.\u201d App. 57, 118.

Carr,\n369 U. S. 186 (1962), but the Second Circuit reversed, 582\nF. 3d 309 (2009). On the threshold questions, the Court of\nAppeals held that the suits were not barred by the politi\ncal question doctrine, id., at 332, and that the plaintiffs\nhad adequately alleged Article III standing, id., at 349.\n   Turning to the merits, the Second Circuit held that all\nplaintiffs had stated a claim under the \u201cfederal common\nlaw of nuisance.\u201d Id., at 358, 371. For this determination,\nthe court relied dominantly on a series of this Court\u2019s\ndecisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate\nair and water pollution produced by other States or by out\nof-state industry. Id., at 350\u2013351; see, e.g., Illinois v.\nMilwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 93, (1972) (Milwaukee I) (recog\nnizing right of Illinois to sue in federal district court to\nabate discharge of sewage into Lake Michigan).\n   The Court of Appeals further determined that the Clean\nAir Act did not \u201cdisplace\u201d federal common law. In Mil\nwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 316\u2013319 (1981) (Milwau\nkee II), this Court held that Congress had displaced the\nfederal common law right of action recognized in Milwau\nkee I by adopting amendments to the Clean Water Act, 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71251 et seq. That legislation installed an all\nencompassing regulatory program, supervised by an ex\npert administrative agency, to deal comprehensively with\ninterstate water pollution. The legislation itself prohib\nited the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the\nUnited States without a permit from a proper permitting\nauthority. Milwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 310\u2013311 (citing\n\u00a71311). At the time of the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, by\ncontrast, EPA had not yet promulgated any rule regulat\ning greenhouse gases, a fact the court thought dispositive.\n6        AMERICAN ELEC.

Four members of the\nCourt would hold that at least some plaintiffs have Article\nIII standing under Massachusetts, which permitted a\nState to challenge EPA\u2019s refusal to regulate greenhouse\ngas emissions, 549 U. S., at 520\u2013526; and, further, that no\nother threshold obstacle bars review.6 Four members of\nthe Court, adhering to a dissenting opinion in Massachu\nsetts, 549 U.

As\nthe Court stated in Milwaukee I: \u201cWhen we deal with air\nand water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a\nfederal common law.\u201d 406 U.

And where, as here, borrowing the law of a\nparticular State would be inappropriate, the Court re\nmains mindful that it does not have creative power akin to\nthat vested in Congress. See Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S.\n496, 519 (1906) (\u201cfact that this court must decide does not\nmean, of course, that it takes the place of a legislature\u201d);\ncf. United States v.

We have not yet de\ncided whether private citizens (here, the land trusts) or\npolitical subdivisions (New York City) of a State may\ninvoke the federal common law of nuisance to abate out-of\nstate pollution.

Any such claim would be\ndisplaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA to\nregulate carbon-dioxide emissions.\n                             B\n   \u201c[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously gov\nerned by a decision rested on federal common law,\u201d the\nCourt has explained, \u201cthe need for such an unusual exer\ncise of law-making by federal courts disappears.\u201d Mil\nwaukee II, 451 U.

S. 226, 236\u2013237 (1985).\n   We hold that the Clean Air Act and the EPA actions it\nauthorizes displace any federal common law right to seek\nabatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel\nfired power plants. Massachusetts made plain that emis\nsions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to\nregulation under the Act. 549 U. S., at 528\u2013529. And we\nthink it equally plain that the Act \u201cspeaks directly\u201d to\nemissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants\u2019 plants.\n   Section 111 of the Act directs the EPA Administrator to\nlist \u201ccategories of stationary sources\u201d that \u201cin [her] judg\nment . . . caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pol\nlution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\npublic health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(A).

See\nCounty of Oneida, 470 U. S., at 237\u2013239 (reach of remedial\nprovisions is important to determination whether statute\ndisplaces federal common law). EPA may delegate im\nplementation and enforcement authority to the States,\n\u00a77411(c)(1), (d)(1), but the agency retains the power to in\nspect and monitor regulated sources, to impose adminis\ntrative penalties for noncompliance, and to commence civil\nactions against polluters in federal court. \u00a7\u00a77411(c)(2),\n(d)(2), 7413, 7414. In specified circumstances, the Act im\nposes criminal penalties on any person who knowingly\nviolates emissions standards issued under \u00a77411. See\n\u00a77413(c). And the Act provides for private enforcement. If\nStates (or EPA) fail to enforce emissions limits against\nregulated sources, the Act permits \u201cany person\u201d to bring a\ncivil enforcement action in federal court. \u00a77604(a).\n   If EPA does not set emissions limits for a particular pol\nlutant or source of pollution, States and private parties\nmay petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPA\u2019s\nresponse will be reviewable in federal court.            See\n\u00a77607(b)(1); Massachusetts, 549 U. S., at 516\u2013517, 529. As\nearlier noted, see supra, at 3, EPA is currently engaged in\na \u00a77411 rulemaking to set standards for greenhouse gas\nemissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. To settle\nlitigation brought under \u00a77607(b) by a group that included\nthe majority of the plaintiffs in this very case, the agency\nagreed to complete that rulemaking by May 2012. 75 Fed.\nReg. 82392. The Act itself thus provides a means to seek\nlimits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power\nplants\u2014the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking\nfederal common law. We see no room for a parallel track.\n12     AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs argue, as the Second Circuit held, that\nfederal common law is not displaced until EPA actually\nexercises its regulatory authority, i.e., until it sets stan\ndards governing emissions from the defendants\u2019 plants.\nWe disagree.\n   The sewage discharges at issue in Milwaukee II, we do\nnot overlook, were subject to effluent limits set by EPA;\nunder the displacing statute, \u201c[e]very point source dis\ncharge\u201d of water pollution was \u201cprohibited unless covered\nby a permit.\u201d 451 U. S., at 318\u2013320 (emphasis deleted).\nAs Milwaukee II made clear, however, the relevant ques\ntion for purposes of displacement is \u201cwhether the field\nhas been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a\nparticular manner.\u201d Id., at 324. Of necessity, Congress se\nlects different regulatory regimes to address different\nproblems. Congress could hardly preemptively prohibit\nevery discharge of carbon dioxide unless covered by a\npermit. After all, we each emit carbon dioxide merely by\nbreathing.\n   The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the legisla\nture\u2019s \u201cconsidered judgment\u201d concerning the regulation of\nair pollution because it permits emissions until EPA\nacts. See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National\nSea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 22, n. 32 (1981) (finding\ndisplacement although Congress \u201callowed some continued\ndumping of sludge\u201d prior to a certain date). The critical\npoint is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision\nwhether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions\nfrom power plants; the delegation is what displaces federal\ncommon law. Indeed, were EPA to decline to regulate\ncarbon-dioxide emissions altogether at the conclusion of its\nongoing \u00a77411 rulemaking, the federal courts would have\nno warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance\nto upset the agency\u2019s expert determination.\n   EPA\u2019s judgment, we hasten to add, would not escape\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Federal courts, we earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 11, can review agency action (or a final rule\ndeclining to take action) to ensure compliance with the\nstatute Congress enacted. As we have noted, see supra,\nat 10, the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish emis-\nsions standards for categories of stationary sources that,\n\u201cin [the Administrator\u2019s] judgment,\u201d \u201ccaus[e], or contri\nbut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably\nbe anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d\n\u00a77411(b)(1)(A). \u201c[T]he use of the word \u2018judgment,\u2019 \u201d we\nexplained in Massachusetts, \u201cis not a roving license to\nignore the statutory text.\u201d 549 U. S., at 533. \u201cIt is but a\ndirection to exercise discretion within defined statutory\nlimits.\u201d Ibid. EPA may not decline to regulate carbon\ndioxide emissions from power plants if refusal to act would\nbe \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other\nwise not in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9)(A). If the\nplaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome\nof EPA\u2019s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse under\nfederal law is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ulti\nmately, to petition for certiorari in this Court.\n   Indeed, this prescribed order of decisionmaking\u2014the\nfirst decider under the Act is the expert administrative\nagency, the second, federal judges\u2014is yet another reason\nto resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree\nunder federal tort law. The appropriate amount of regula\ntion in any particular greenhouse gas-producing sector\ncannot be prescribed in a vacuum: as with other questions\nof national or international policy, informed assessment of\ncompeting interests is required. Along with the environ\nmental benefit potentially achievable, our Nation\u2019s energy\nneeds and the possibility of economic disruption must\nweigh in the balance.\n   The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to\nEPA in the first instance, in combination with state regu\nlators. Each \u201cstandard of performance\u201d EPA sets must\n14     AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v.

F. R. \u00a760.24(f) (EPA may permit\nstate plans to deviate from generally applicable emissions\nstandards upon demonstration that costs are \u201c[u]n\nreasonable\u201d).     EPA may \u201cdistinguish among classes,\ntypes, and sizes\u201d of stationary sources in apportioning\nresponsibility for emissions reductions. \u00a77411(b)(2), (d);\nsee also 40 C. F. R. \u00a760.22(b)(5). And the agency may\nwaive compliance with emission limits to permit a facility\nto test drive an \u201cinnovative technological system\u201d that has\n\u201cnot [yet] been adequately demonstrated.\u201d \u00a77411(j)(1)(A).\nThe Act envisions extensive cooperation between federal\nand state authorities, see \u00a77401(a), (b), generally permit\nting each State to take the first cut at determining how\nbest to achieve EPA emissions standards within its do\nmain, see \u00a77411(c)(1), (d)(1)\u2013(2).\n   It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an ex\npert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as pri-\nmary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert\nagency is surely better equipped to do the job than indi\nvidual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case injunc\ntions. Federal judges lack the scientific, economic, and\ntechnological resources an agency can utilize in coping\nwith issues of this order. See generally Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 865\u2013866 (1984). Judges may not commission scien\ntific studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or\nissue rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting\ninput by any interested person, or seek the counsel of\nregulators in the States where the defendants are located.\nRather, judges are confined by a record comprising the\nevidence the parties present. Moreover, federal district\njudges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to ren\nder precedential decisions binding other judges, even\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

These determinations would be made\nfor the defendants named in the two lawsuits launched by\nthe plaintiffs. Similar suits could be mounted, counsel for\nthe States and New York City estimated, against \u201cthou\nsands or hundreds or tens\u201d of other defendants fitting the\ndescription \u201clarge contributors\u201d to carbon-dioxide emis\nsions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57.\n  The judgments the plaintiffs would commit to federal\njudges, in suits that could be filed in any federal district,\ncannot be reconciled with the decisionmaking scheme\nCongress enacted. The Second Circuit erred, we hold, in\nruling that federal judges may set limits on greenhouse\ngas emissions in face of a law empowering EPA to set the\nsame limits, subject to judicial review only to ensure\nagainst action \u201carbitrary, capricious, . . . or otherwise not\nin accordance with law.\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9).\n                              V\n   The plaintiffs also sought relief under state law, in\nparticular, the law of each State where the defendants\noperate power plants. See App. 105, 147. The Second\nCircuit did not reach the state law claims because it held\nthat federal common law governed. 582 F. 3d, at 392; see\nInternational Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.

Argued April 19, 2011\u2014Decided June 20, 2011\nIn Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, this Court held that the Clean\n  Air Act authorizes federal regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide\n  and other greenhouse gases, and that the Environmental Protection\n  Agency (EPA) had misread that Act when it denied a rulemaking pe\n  tition seeking controls on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor\n  vehicles. In response, EPA commenced a rulemaking under \u00a7111 of\n  the Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a77411, to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions\n  from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pur\n  suant to a settlement finalized in March 2011, EPA has committed to\n  issuing a final rule by May 2012.\n     The lawsuits considered here began well before EPA initiated ef\n  forts to regulate greenhouse gases. Two groups of plaintiffs, respon\n  dents here, filed separate complaints in a Federal District Court\n  against the same five major electric power companies, petitioners\n  here. One group of plaintiffs included eight States and New York\n  City; the second joined three nonprofit land trusts. According to the\n  complaint, the defendants are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide\n  in the Nation. By contributing to global warming, the plaintiffs as\n  serted, the defendants\u2019 emissions substantially and unreasonably in\n  terfered with public rights, in violation of the federal common law of\n  interstate nuisance, or, in the alternative, of state tort law. All plain\n  tiffs ask for a decree setting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defen\n  dant at an initial cap, to be further reduced annually.\n     The District Court dismissed both suits as presenting nonjusticia\n  ble political questions, but the Second Circuit reversed. On the\n  threshold questions, the Circuit held that the suits were not barred\n  by the political question doctrine and that the plaintiffs had ade\n2          AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v.

On the merits, the court held\n    that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under the \u201cfederal common law\n    of nuisance,\u201d relying on this Court\u2019s decisions holding that States\n    may maintain suits to abate air and water pollution produced by\n    other States or by out-of-state industry, see, e.g., Illinois v. Milwau\n    kee, 406 U. S. 91, 93 (Milwaukee I). The court further determined\n    that the Clean Air Act did not \u201cdisplace\u201d federal common law.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is affirmed by an\n equally divided Court. P. 6.\n    2. The Clean Air Act and the EPA action the Act authorizes dis\n place any federal common-law right to seek abatement of carbon\n dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. Pp. 6\u201316.\n       (a) Since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, recognized\n that there \u201cis no federal general common law,\u201d a new federal common\n law has emerged for subjects of national concern. When dealing\n \u201cwith air and water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a\n federal common law.\u201d Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 103. Decisions of\n this Court predating Erie, but compatible with the emerging distinc\n tion between general common law and the new federal common law,\n have approved federal common-law suits brought by one State to\n abate pollution emanating from another State. See, e.g., Missouri v.\n Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241\u2013243. The plaintiffs contend that their\n right to maintain this suit follows from such cases. But recognition\n that a subject is meet for federal law governance does not necessarily\n mean that federal courts should create the controlling law. The\n Court need not address the question whether, absent the Clean Air\n Act and the EPA actions it authorizes, the plaintiffs could state a\n federal common-law claim for curtailment of greenhouse gas emis\n sions because of their contribution to global warming. Any such\n claim would be displaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA\n to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (b) \u201c[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously governed\n by a decision rested on federal common law the need for such an un\n usual exercise of law-making by federal courts disappears.\u201d Milwau\n kee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 314 (Milwaukee II). Legislative dis\n placement of federal common law does not require the \u201csame sort of\n evidence of a clear and manifest [congressional] purpose\u201d demanded\n for preemption of state law. Id., at 317. Rather, the test is simply\n whether the statute \u201cspeak[s] directly to [the] question\u201d at issue.\n Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625. Here, Massa\n chusetts made plain that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air\n pollution subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. 549 U. S., at\n 528\u2013529. And it is equally plain that the Act \u201cspeaks directly\u201d to\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

The Act di\nrects EPA to establish emissions standards for categories of station\nary sources that, \u201cin [the Administrator\u2019s] judgment,\u201d \u201ccaus[e], or\ncontribut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be\nanticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(A).\nOnce EPA lists a category, it must establish performance standards\nfor emission of pollutants from new or modified sources within that\ncategory, \u00a77411(b)(1)(B), and, most relevant here, must regulate ex\nisting sources within the same category, \u00a77411(d). The Act also pro\nvides multiple avenues for enforcement. If EPA does not set emis\nsions limits for a particular pollutant or source of pollution, States\nand private parties may petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and\nEPA\u2019s response will be reviewable in federal court. See \u00a77607(b)(1).\nThe Act itself thus provides a means to seek limits on emissions of\ncarbon dioxide from domestic power plants\u2014the same relief the\nplaintiffs seek by invoking federal common law. There is no room for\na parallel track. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (c) The Court rejects the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, and the Second\nCircuit\u2019s holding, that federal common law is not displaced until EPA\nactually exercises its regulatory authority by setting emissions stan\ndards for the defendants\u2019 plants. The relevant question for displace\nment purposes is \u201cwhether the field has been occupied, not whether it\nhas been occupied in a particular manner.\u201d Milwaukee II, 451 U. S.,\nat 324. The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the Legislature\u2019s\n\u201cconsidered judgment\u201d concerning air pollution regulation because it\npermits emissions until EPA acts. The critical point is that Congress\ndelegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon\ndioxide emissions from power plants; the delegation displaces federal\ncommon law. If the plaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the\noutcome of EPA\u2019s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse is to seek\nCourt of Appeals review, and, ultimately, to petition for certiorari.\n   The Act\u2019s prescribed order of decisionmaking\u2014first by the expert\nagency, and then by federal judges\u2014is yet another reason to resist\nsetting emissions standards by judicial decree under federal tort law.\nThe appropriate amount of regulation in a particular greenhouse gas\nproducing sector requires informed assessment of competing inter\nests. The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to EPA in\nthe first instance, in combination with state regulators. The expert\nagency is surely better equipped to do the job than federal judges,\nwho lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an\nagency can utilize in coping with issues of this order. The plaintiffs\u2019\nproposal to have federal judges determine, in the first instance, what\namount of carbon-dioxide emissions is \u201cunreasonable\u201d and what level\nof reduction is necessary cannot be reconciled with Congress\u2019 scheme.\n4          AMERICAN ELEC.

In light of the holding here that the\n    Clean Air Act displaces federal common law, the availability vel non\n    of a state lawsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the\n    federal Act. Because none of the parties have briefed preemption or\n    otherwise addressed the availability of a claim under state nuisance\n    law, the matter is left for consideration on remand.

As relief, the plaintiffs ask for a decree\nsetting carbon-dioxide emissions for each defendant at an\ninitial cap, to be further reduced annually. The Clean Air\nAct and the Environmental Protection Agency action the\nAct authorizes, we hold, displace the claims the plaintiffs\nseek to pursue.\n                             I\n    In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), this\nCourt held that the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S.

Reg.\n66499 (2009).1 Massachusetts held that the Environ\nmental Protection Agency (EPA) had misread the Clean\nAir Act when it denied a rulemaking petition seeking\ncontrols on greenhouse gas emissions from new motor\nvehicles. 549 U. S., at 510\u2013511. Greenhouse gases, we\ndetermined, qualify as \u201cair pollutant[s]\u201d within the mean\ning of the governing Clean Air Act provision, id., at 528\u2013\n529 (quoting \u00a77602(g)); they are therefore within EPA\u2019s\nregulatory ken. Because EPA had authority to set green\nhouse gas emission standards and had offered no \u201crea\nsoned explanation\u201d for failing to do so, we concluded that\nthe agency had not acted \u201cin accordance with law\u201d when it\ndenied the requested rulemaking. Id., at 534\u2013535 (quot\ning \u00a77607(d)(9)(A)).\n   Responding to our decision in Massachusetts, EPA un\ndertook greenhouse gas regulation. In December 2009,\nthe agency concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from\nmotor vehicles \u201ccause, or contribute to, air pollution which\nmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health\nor welfare,\u201d the Act\u2019s regulatory trigger. \u00a77521(a)(1); 74\nFed.

Id., at 66524\u2013\n66535.2\n   EPA and the Department of Transportation subse\nquently issued a joint final rule regulating emissions from\nlight-duty vehicles, see 75 Fed. Reg. 25324 (2010), and\ninitiated a joint rulemaking covering medium- and heavy\nduty vehicles, see id., at 74152.

On the threshold questions, the Court of\nAppeals held that the suits were not barred by the politi\ncal question doctrine, id., at 332, and that the plaintiffs\nhad adequately alleged Article III standing, id., at 349.\n   Turning to the merits, the Second Circuit held that all\nplaintiffs had stated a claim under the \u201cfederal common\nlaw of nuisance.\u201d Id., at 358, 371. For this determination,\nthe court relied dominantly on a series of this Court\u2019s\ndecisions holding that States may maintain suits to abate\nair and water pollution produced by other States or by out\nof-state industry. Id., at 350\u2013351; see, e.g., Illinois v.\nMilwaukee, 406 U.

In Mil\nwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 316\u2013319 (1981) (Milwau\nkee II), this Court held that Congress had displaced the\nfederal common law right of action recognized in Milwau\nkee I by adopting amendments to the Clean Water Act, 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71251 et seq. That legislation installed an all\nencompassing regulatory program, supervised by an ex\npert administrative agency, to deal comprehensively with\ninterstate water pollution.

We therefore affirm, by an equally\ndivided Court, the Second Circuit\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction\nand proceed to the merits. See Nye v. United States, 313\nU.

Erie also\nsparked \u201cthe emergence of a federal decisional law in\nareas of national concern.\u201d Id., at 405. The \u201cnew\u201d federal\ncommon law addresses \u201csubjects within national legisla\ntive power where Congress has so directed\u201d or where the\nbasic scheme of the Constitution so demands. Id., at 408,\nn. 119, 421\u2013422. Environmental protection is undoubtedly\nan area \u201cwithin national legislative power,\u201d one in which\nfederal courts may fill in \u201cstatutory interstices,\u201d and, if\nnecessary, even \u201cfashion federal law.\u201d Id., at 421\u2013422. As\nthe Court stated in Milwaukee I: \u201cWhen we deal with air\nand water in their ambient or interstate aspects, there is a\nfederal common law.\u201d 406 U. S., at 103.\n   Decisions of this Court predating Erie, but compatible\nwith the distinction emerging from that decision between\n\u201cgeneral common law\u201d and \u201cspecialized federal common\nlaw,\u201d Friendly, supra, at 405, have approved federal com\nmon law suits brought by one State to abate pollution\nemanating from another State. See, e.g., Missouri v.\nIllinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241\u2013243 (1901) (permitting suit by\nMissouri to enjoin Chicago from discharging untreated\nsewage into interstate waters); New Jersey v. City of\nNew York, 283 U. S. 473, 477, 481\u2013483 (1931) (ordering\nNew York City to stop dumping garbage off New Jersey\ncoast); Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 240 U. S. 650 (1916)\n(ordering private copper companies to curtail sulfur\ndioxide discharges in Tennessee that caused harm in\nGeorgia). See also Milwaukee I, 406 U. S., at 107 (post-\nErie decision upholding suit by Illinois to abate sewage\ndischarges into Lake Michigan). The plaintiffs contend\nthat their right to maintain this suit follows inexorably\nfrom that line of decisions.\n   Recognition that a subject is meet for federal law gov\n8      AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernance, however, does not necessarily mean that federal\ncourts should create the controlling law. Absent a demon\nstrated need for a federal rule of decision, the Court has\ntaken \u201cthe prudent course\u201d of \u201cadopt[ing] the readymade\nbody of state law as the federal rule of decision until Con\ngress strikes a different accommodation.\u201d United States v.\nKimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U. S. 715, 740 (1979); see Bank of\nAmerica Nat. Trust & Sav. Assn. v. Parnell, 352 U. S. 29,\n32\u201334 (1956). And where, as here, borrowing the law of a\nparticular State would be inappropriate, the Court re\nmains mindful that it does not have creative power akin to\nthat vested in Congress. See Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S.\n496, 519 (1906) (\u201cfact that this court must decide does not\nmean, of course, that it takes the place of a legislature\u201d);\ncf. United States v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 332 U. S. 301,\n308, 314 (1947) (holding that federal law determines\nwhether Government could secure indemnity from a com\npany whose truck injured a United States soldier, but\ndeclining to impose such an indemnity absent action by\nCongress, \u201cthe primary and most often the exclusive arbi\nter of federal fiscal affairs\u201d).\n   In the cases on which the plaintiffs heavily rely, States\nwere permitted to sue to challenge activity harmful to\ntheir citizens\u2019 health and welfare. We have not yet de\ncided whether private citizens (here, the land trusts) or\npolitical subdivisions (New York City) of a State may\ninvoke the federal common law of nuisance to abate out-of\nstate pollution. Nor have we ever held that a State may\nsue to abate any and all manner of pollution originating\noutside its borders.\n   The defendants argue that considerations of scale and\ncomplexity distinguish global warming from the more\nbounded pollution giving rise to past federal nuisance\nsuits. Greenhouse gases once emitted \u201cbecome well mixed\nin the atmosphere,\u201d 74 Fed. Reg. 66514; emissions in New\nJersey may contribute no more to flooding in New York\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See Brief for Respondents Open Space In\nstitute et al. 32\u201335. And we have recognized that public\nnuisance law, like common law generally, adapts to chang\ning scientific and factual circumstances. Missouri, 200\nU. S., at 522 (adjudicating claim though it did not concern\n\u201cnuisance of the simple kind that was known to the older\ncommon law\u201d); see also D\u2019Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC,\n315 U. S. 447, 472 (1942) (Jackson, J., concurring) (\u201cfed\neral courts are free to apply the traditional common-law\ntechnique of decision\u201d when fashioning federal common\nlaw).\n  We need not address the parties\u2019 dispute in this regard.\nFor it is an academic question whether, in the absence of\nthe Clean Air Act and the EPA actions the Act authorizes,\nthe plaintiffs could state a federal common law claim for\ncurtailment of greenhouse gas emissions because of their\ncontribution to global warming. Any such claim would be\ndisplaced by the federal legislation authorizing EPA to\nregulate carbon-dioxide emissions.\n                             B\n   \u201c[W]hen Congress addresses a question previously gov\nerned by a decision rested on federal common law,\u201d the\nCourt has explained, \u201cthe need for such an unusual exer\ncise of law-making by federal courts disappears.\u201d Mil\nwaukee II, 451 U. S., at 314 (holding that amendments to\nthe Clean Water Act displaced the nuisance claim recog\nnized in Milwaukee I). Legislative displacement of federal\ncommon law does not require the \u201csame sort of evidence of\na clear and manifest [congressional] purpose\u201d demanded\nfor preemption of state law.

S. 236, 243\n(1959)), does not enter the calculus, for it is primarily\nthe office of Congress, not the federal courts, to prescribe\nnational policy in areas of special federal interest. TVA v.\nHill, 437 U. S. 153, 194 (1978). The test for whether\ncongressional legislation excludes the declaration of fed\neral common law is simply whether the statute \u201cspeak[s]\ndirectly to [the] question\u201d at issue. Mobil Oil Corp. v.\nHigginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); see Milwaukee\nII, 451 U. S., at 315; County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian\nNation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 236\u2013237 (1985).\n   We hold that the Clean Air Act and the EPA actions it\nauthorizes displace any federal common law right to seek\nabatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel\nfired power plants. Massachusetts made plain that emis\nsions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to\nregulation under the Act. 549 U. S., at 528\u2013529. And we\nthink it equally plain that the Act \u201cspeaks directly\u201d to\nemissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants\u2019 plants.\n   Section 111 of the Act directs the EPA Administrator to\nlist \u201ccategories of stationary sources\u201d that \u201cin [her] judg\nment . . . caus[e], or contribut[e] significantly to, air pol\nlution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\npublic health or welfare.\u201d \u00a77411(b)(1)(A). Once EPA lists\na category, the agency must establish standards of per\nformance for emission of pollutants from new or modified\nsources within that category. \u00a77411(b)(1)(B); see also\n\u00a77411(a)(2). And, most relevant here, \u00a77411(d) then re\nquires regulation of existing sources within the same\ncategory.7 For existing sources, EPA issues emissions\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 There is an exception: EPA may not employ \u00a77411(d) if existing\nstationary sources of the pollutant in question are regulated under the\nnational ambient air quality standard program, \u00a7\u00a77408\u20137410, or the\n\u201chazardous air pollutants\u201d program, \u00a77412. See \u00a77411(d)(1).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguidelines, see 40 C. F. R. \u00a760.22, .23 (2009); in compli\nance with those guidelines and subject to federal over\nsight, the States then issue performance standards for\nstationary sources within their jurisdiction, \u00a77411(d)(1).\n   The Act provides multiple avenues for enforcement. See\nCounty of Oneida, 470 U. S., at 237\u2013239 (reach of remedial\nprovisions is important to determination whether statute\ndisplaces federal common law). EPA may delegate im\nplementation and enforcement authority to the States,\n\u00a77411(c)(1), (d)(1), but the agency retains the power to in\nspect and monitor regulated sources, to impose adminis\ntrative penalties for noncompliance, and to commence civil\nactions against polluters in federal court. \u00a7\u00a77411(c)(2),\n(d)(2), 7413, 7414. In specified circumstances, the Act im\nposes criminal penalties on any person who knowingly\nviolates emissions standards issued under \u00a77411. See\n\u00a77413(c). And the Act provides for private enforcement. If\nStates (or EPA) fail to enforce emissions limits against\nregulated sources, the Act permits \u201cany person\u201d to bring a\ncivil enforcement action in federal court. \u00a77604(a).\n   If EPA does not set emissions limits for a particular pol\nlutant or source of pollution, States and private parties\nmay petition for a rulemaking on the matter, and EPA\u2019s\nresponse will be reviewable in federal court.            See\n\u00a77607(b)(1); Massachusetts, 549 U. S., at 516\u2013517, 529. As\nearlier noted, see supra, at 3, EPA is currently engaged in\na \u00a77411 rulemaking to set standards for greenhouse gas\nemissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. To settle\nlitigation brought under \u00a77607(b) by a group that included\nthe majority of the plaintiffs in this very case, the agency\nagreed to complete that rulemaking by May 2012. 75 Fed.\nReg. 82392. The Act itself thus provides a means to seek\nlimits on emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic power\nplants\u2014the same relief the plaintiffs seek by invoking\nfederal common law. We see no room for a parallel track.\n12     AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs argue, as the Second Circuit held, that\nfederal common law is not displaced until EPA actually\nexercises its regulatory authority, i.e., until it sets stan\ndards governing emissions from the defendants\u2019 plants.\nWe disagree.\n   The sewage discharges at issue in Milwaukee II, we do\nnot overlook, were subject to effluent limits set by EPA;\nunder the displacing statute, \u201c[e]very point source dis\ncharge\u201d of water pollution was \u201cprohibited unless covered\nby a permit.\u201d 451 U. S., at 318\u2013320 (emphasis deleted).\nAs Milwaukee II made clear, however, the relevant ques\ntion for purposes of displacement is \u201cwhether the field\nhas been occupied, not whether it has been occupied in a\nparticular manner.\u201d Id., at 324. Of necessity, Congress se\nlects different regulatory regimes to address different\nproblems. Congress could hardly preemptively prohibit\nevery discharge of carbon dioxide unless covered by a\npermit. After all, we each emit carbon dioxide merely by\nbreathing.\n   The Clean Air Act is no less an exercise of the legisla\nture\u2019s \u201cconsidered judgment\u201d concerning the regulation of\nair pollution because it permits emissions until EPA\nacts. See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National\nSea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 22, n. 32 (1981) (finding\ndisplacement although Congress \u201callowed some continued\ndumping of sludge\u201d prior to a certain date). The critical\npoint is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision\nwhether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions\nfrom power plants; the delegation is what displaces federal\ncommon law. Indeed, were EPA to decline to regulate\ncarbon-dioxide emissions altogether at the conclusion of its\nongoing \u00a77411 rulemaking, the federal courts would have\nno warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance\nto upset the agency\u2019s expert determination.\n   EPA\u2019s judgment, we hasten to add, would not escape\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial review. Federal courts, we earlier observed, see\nsupra, at 11, can review agency action (or a final rule\ndeclining to take action) to ensure compliance with the\nstatute Congress enacted. As we have noted, see supra,\nat 10, the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish emis-\nsions standards for categories of stationary sources that,\n\u201cin [the Administrator\u2019s] judgment,\u201d \u201ccaus[e], or contri\nbut[e] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably\nbe anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d\n\u00a77411(b)(1)(A). \u201c[T]he use of the word \u2018judgment,\u2019 \u201d we\nexplained in Massachusetts, \u201cis not a roving license to\nignore the statutory text.\u201d 549 U. S., at 533. \u201cIt is but a\ndirection to exercise discretion within defined statutory\nlimits.\u201d Ibid. EPA may not decline to regulate carbon\ndioxide emissions from power plants if refusal to act would\nbe \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other\nwise not in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9)(A). If the\nplaintiffs in this case are dissatisfied with the outcome\nof EPA\u2019s forthcoming rulemaking, their recourse under\nfederal law is to seek Court of Appeals review, and, ulti\nmately, to petition for certiorari in this Court.\n   Indeed, this prescribed order of decisionmaking\u2014the\nfirst decider under the Act is the expert administrative\nagency, the second, federal judges\u2014is yet another reason\nto resist setting emissions standards by judicial decree\nunder federal tort law. The appropriate amount of regula\ntion in any particular greenhouse gas-producing sector\ncannot be prescribed in a vacuum: as with other questions\nof national or international policy, informed assessment of\ncompeting interests is required. Along with the environ\nmental benefit potentially achievable, our Nation\u2019s energy\nneeds and the possibility of economic disruption must\nweigh in the balance.\n   The Clean Air Act entrusts such complex balancing to\nEPA in the first instance, in combination with state regu\nlators. Each \u201cstandard of performance\u201d EPA sets must\n14     AMERICAN ELEC. POWER CO. v. CONNECTICUT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ctak[e] into account the cost of achieving [emissions] re\nduction and any nonair quality health and environmental\nimpact and energy requirements.\u201d \u00a77411(a)(1), (b)(1)(B),\n(d)(1); see also 40 C. F. R. \u00a760.24(f) (EPA may permit\nstate plans to deviate from generally applicable emissions\nstandards upon demonstration that costs are \u201c[u]n\nreasonable\u201d).     EPA may \u201cdistinguish among classes,\ntypes, and sizes\u201d of stationary sources in apportioning\nresponsibility for emissions reductions. \u00a77411(b)(2), (d);\nsee also 40 C. F. R. \u00a760.22(b)(5). And the agency may\nwaive compliance with emission limits to permit a facility\nto test drive an \u201cinnovative technological system\u201d that has\n\u201cnot [yet] been adequately demonstrated.\u201d \u00a77411(j)(1)(A).\nThe Act envisions extensive cooperation between federal\nand state authorities, see \u00a77401(a), (b), generally permit\nting each State to take the first cut at determining how\nbest to achieve EPA emissions standards within its do\nmain, see \u00a77411(c)(1), (d)(1)\u2013(2).\n   It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an ex\npert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as pri-\nmary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert\nagency is surely better equipped to do the job than indi\nvidual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case injunc\ntions. Federal judges lack the scientific, economic, and\ntechnological resources an agency can utilize in coping\nwith issues of this order. See generally Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 865\u2013866 (1984). Judges may not commission scien\ntific studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or\nissue rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting\ninput by any interested person, or seek the counsel of\nregulators in the States where the defendants are located.\nRather, judges are confined by a record comprising the\nevidence the parties present. Moreover, federal district\njudges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to ren\nder precedential decisions binding other judges, even\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmembers of the same court.\n  Notwithstanding these disabilities, the plaintiffs pro\npose that individual federal judges determine, in the first\ninstance, what amount of carbon-dioxide emissions is\n\u201cunreasonable,\u201d App. 103, 145, and then decide what level\nof reduction is \u201cpractical, feasible and economically vi\nable,\u201d App. 58, 119. These determinations would be made\nfor the defendants named in the two lawsuits launched by\nthe plaintiffs. Similar suits could be mounted, counsel for\nthe States and New York City estimated, against \u201cthou\nsands or hundreds or tens\u201d of other defendants fitting the\ndescription \u201clarge contributors\u201d to carbon-dioxide emis\nsions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57.\n  The judgments the plaintiffs would commit to federal\njudges, in suits that could be filed in any federal district,\ncannot be reconciled with the decisionmaking scheme\nCongress enacted. The Second Circuit erred, we hold, in\nruling that federal judges may set limits on greenhouse\ngas emissions in face of a law empowering EPA to set the\nsame limits, subject to judicial review only to ensure\nagainst action \u201carbitrary, capricious, . . . or otherwise not\nin accordance with law.\u201d \u00a77607(d)(9).\n                              V\n   The plaintiffs also sought relief under state law, in\nparticular, the law of each State where the defendants\noperate power plants. See App. 105, 147. The Second\nCircuit did not reach the state law claims because it held\nthat federal common law governed. 582 F. 3d, at 392; see\nInternational Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 488\n(1987) (if a case \u201cshould be resolved by reference to federal\ncommon law[,] . . . state common law [is] preempted\u201d). In\nlight of our holding that the Clean Air Act displaces fed\neral common law, the availability vel non of a state law\nsuit depends, inter alia, on the preemptive effect of the\nfederal Act.
