Argued March 22, 2011\u2014Decided June 20, 2011\nAfter petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief,\n  he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement. When the\n  borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to\n  perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator or\n  dered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn. Guarni\n  eri then filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that the di\n  rectives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance,\n  thereby violating his First Amendment \u201cright . . . to petition the Gov\n  ernment for a redress of grievances\u201d; he later amended his complaint\n  to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying\n  his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the\n  \u00a71983 suit. The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the\n  suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and\n  the jury found for Guarnieri. Affirming the compensatory damages\n  award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has peti\n  tioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the fil\n  ing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause\n  from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a mat\n  ter of solely private concern. In so ruling, the court rejected the view\n  of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be pro\n  tected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.\nHeld: A government employer\u2019s allegedly retaliatory actions against an\n employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless\n the employee\u2019s petition relates to a matter of public concern. The\n Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the public concern test does not limit\n public employees\u2019 Petition Clause claims is incorrect. Pp. 4\u201319.\n    (a) A public employee suing his employer under the First Amend\n2                BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ment\u2019s Speech Clause must show that he spoke as a citizen on a mat\n    ter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 147. Even\n    where the employee makes that showing, however, courts balance his\n    employee\u2019s right to engage in speech against the government\u2019s inter\n    est in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the public services\n    it performs through its employees. Pickering v. Board of Ed. of\n    Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568. Al\n    though cases might arise in which special Petition Clause concerns\n    would require a distinct analysis, public employees\u2019 retaliation claims\n    do not call for this divergence. The close connection between the\n    rights of speech and petition has led Courts of Appeals other than the\n    Third Circuit to apply the public concern test to public employees\u2019 Pe\n    tition Clause claims. This approach is justified by the substantial\n    common ground in the definition and delineation of these rights. Pp.\n    4\u20138.\n       (b) The substantial government interests that justify a cautious\n    and restrained approach to protecting public employees\u2019 speech are\n    just as relevant in Petition Clause cases. A petition, no less than\n    speech, can interfere with government\u2019s efficient and effective opera\n    tion by, e.g., seeking results that \u201ccontravene governmental policies\n    or impair the proper performance of governmental functions,\u201d Gar\n    cetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419. A petition taking the form of a\n    lawsuit against the government employer may be particularly disrup\n    tive, consuming public officials\u2019 time and attention, burdening their\n    exercise of legitimate authority, and blurring the lines of accountabil\n    ity between them and the public. Here, for example, Guarnieri\u2019s at\n    torney invited the jury to review myriad details of government deci\n    sionmaking. It is precisely to avoid this sort of intrusion into internal\n    governmental affairs that this Court has held that, \u201cwhile the First\n    Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not\n    empower them to \u2018constitutionalize the employee grievance.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n    420. Interpreting the Petition Clause to apply even where matters of\n    public concern are not involved would be unnecessary, or even dis\n    ruptive, when there is already protection for the public employees\u2019\n    rights to file grievances and litigate. Adopting a different rule for Pe\n    tition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employ\n    ees to circumvent the public concern test\u2019s protections and aggravate\n    potential harm to the government\u2019s interests by compounding the\n    costs of complying with the Constitution. Pp. 8\u201313.\n       (c) Guarnieri\u2019s claim that applying the public concern test to the\n    Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of the private nature\n    of many petitions for redress lacks merit. Although the Clause un\n    doubtedly has force and application in the context of a personal\n    grievance addressed to the government, petitions to the government\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political, so\n  cial, or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole. The\n  Clause\u2019s history reveals the frequent use of petitions to address a\n  wide range of political, social, and other matters of great public im\n  port and interest. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     (d) The framework used to govern public employees\u2019 Speech Clause\n  claims, when applied to the Petition Clause, will protect both the\n  government\u2019s interests and the employee\u2019s First Amendment right. If\n  a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of purely pri\n  vate concern, his First Amendment interest must give way, as it does\n  in speech cases. San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82\u201383. If he peti\n  tions as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment\n  interest must be balanced against the government\u2019s countervailing\n  interest in the effective and efficient management of its internal af\n  fairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that balance favors the public em\n  ployee, the First Amendment claim will be sustained. If the balance\n  favors the employer, the employee\u2019s First Amendment claim will fail\n  even though the petition is on a matter of public concern. As under\n  the Speech Clause, whether a petition relates to a matter of public\n  concern will depend on its \u201ccontent, form, and context . . . , as re\n  vealed by the whole record.\u201d Connick, supra, at 147\u2013148, n. 7. The\n  forum in which a petition is lodged will also be relevant. See Snyder\n  v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___. A petition filed with a government em\n  ployer using an internal grievance procedure in many cases will not\n  seek to communicate to the public or to advance a political or social\n  point of view beyond the employment context. Pp. 17\u201318.\n     (e) Absent full briefs by the parties, the Court need not consider\n  how the foregoing framework would apply to this case. P. 19.\n364 Fed.

CHARLES J. GUARNIERI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 20, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the court.\n   Among other rights essential to freedom, the First\nAmendment protects \u201cthe right of the people . . . to peti\u00ad\ntion the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 1. This case concerns the extent of the\nprotection, if any, that the Petition Clause grants public\nemployees in routine disputes with government employ\u00ad\ners. Petitions are a form of expression, and employees\nwho invoke the Petition Clause in most cases could invoke\nas well the Speech Clause of the First Amendment. To\nshow that an employer interfered with rights under the\nSpeech Clause, the employee, as a general rule, must show\nthat his speech was on a matter of public concern, as that\nterm is defined in the precedents of this and other courts.\nHere the issue is whether that test applies when the\nemployee invokes the Petition Clause.\n   Alone among the Courts of Appeals to have addressed\nthe issue, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has\nheld that the public concern test does not limit Petition\nClause claims by public employees. For the reasons stated\nbelow, this conclusion is incorrect.\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n  Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance challenging\nhis termination as chief of police for the borough of\nDuryea, a town of about 4,600 persons in northeastern\nPennsylvania. His grievance proceeded to arbitration\npursuant to the police union collective-bargaining agree\u00ad\nment. The arbitrator found that the borough council,\nDuryea\u2019s legislative body and the entity responsible for\nGuarnieri\u2019s termination, committed procedural errors in\nconnection with the termination; and the arbitrator also\nfound that Guarnieri engaged in misconduct, including\n\u201cattempting to intimidate Council members.\u201d App. 37, 38.\nThe arbitrator ordered Guarnieri reinstated after a disci\u00ad\nplinary suspension. Id., at 38.\n  Upon Guarnieri\u2019s return to the job, the council issued 11\ndirectives instructing Guarnieri in the performance of his\nduties. The council\u2019s attorney explained that the council\n\u201cwanted to be sure that the chief understood what was\ngoing to be expected of him upon his return.\u201d Tr. 19:12\u201314\n(Apr. 16, 2008). One directive prohibited Guarnieri from\nworking overtime without the council\u2019s \u201cexpress permis\u00ad\nsion.\u201d App. 59, \u00b61. Another indicated that \u201c[t]he police\ncar is to be used for official business only.\u201d Id., at 60, \u00b69.\nA third stated that the \u201cDuryea municipal building is a\nsmoke free building\u201d and that the \u201cpolice department is\nnot exempt.\u201d Id., at 61, \u00b610. Guarnieri testified that,\nbecause of these and other directives, his \u201ccoming back\nwasn\u2019t a warm welcome feeling.\u201d Tr. 65:7\u20138 (Apr. 15,\n2008). Guarnieri filed a second union grievance challeng\u00ad\ning the directives. The arbitrator instructed the council to\nmodify or withdraw some of the directives on the grounds\nthat they were vague, interfered with the authority of\nthe mayor, or were contrary to the collective-bargaining\nagreement.\n  Guarnieri filed this lawsuit against the borough, the\nborough council, and individual members of the council\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Guarnieri claimed that his first\nunion grievance was a petition protected by the Petition\nClause of the First Amendment, and he alleged that the\ndirectives issued upon his reinstatement were retaliation\nfor that protected activity.\n  After this suit was filed, the council denied a request\nby Guarnieri for $338 in overtime. The United States\nDepartment of Labor investigated and concluded that\nGuarnieri was entitled to be paid. The council offered\nGuarnieri a check for the amount, but Guarnieri refused\nto accept it. Instead, Guarnieri amended his complaint to\nencompass the denial of overtime. Guarnieri alleged that\nhis \u00a71983 lawsuit was a petition and that the denial of\novertime constituted retaliation for his having filed the\nlawsuit.\n  Under the law of the Circuit, the defendants could not\nobtain judgment as a matter of law on the basis that\nthe lawsuit and grievances were not on a matter of public\nconcern. The case proceeded to a jury. Guarnieri\u2019s attor\u00ad\nney argued that the council was \u201csending a message to\u201d\nGuarnieri through the directives and the denial of over\u00ad\ntime: \u201cYou might have won your arbitration, but we con\u00ad\ntrol you.\u201d Tr. 53:24\u201325 (Apr. 17, 2008). The District Court\ninstructed the jury that the lawsuit and union grievances\nwere \u201cprotected activity . . . under the constitution,\u201d and\nthat the jury could find defendants liable if it found an\nadequate connection between the protected activity and\nthe alleged retaliation. Id., at 61:17\u201320; 62. The jury\nfound in favor of Guarnieri. The jury awarded $45,000 in\ncompensatory damages and $24,000 in punitive damages\nfor the directives, as well as $358 in compensatory dam\u00ad\nages and $28,000 in punitive damages for the denial of\novertime. The District Court awarded $45,000 in attor\u00ad\nney\u2019s fees and denied defendants\u2019 renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law.\n  Defendants appealed on the ground that Guarnieri\u2019s\n4           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngrievances and lawsuit did not address matters of public\nconcern. Courts outside the Third Circuit have held that\nallegedly retaliatory actions by government employers\nagainst government employees may not give rise to liabil\u00ad\nity under the Petition Clause unless the employee\u2019s peti\u00ad\ntion related to a matter of public concern. See, e.g., Kirby\nv. Elizabeth City, 388 F. 3d 440, 448\u2013449 (CA4 2004);\nTang v. Rhode Island, Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F. 3d 7,\n11\u201312 (CA1 1998); White Plains Towing Corp. v. Patter\nson, 991 F. 2d 1049, 1059 (CA2 1993). These courts rely\non a substantial overlap between the rights of speech and\npetition to justify the application of Speech Clause pre\u00ad\ncedents to Petition Clause claims. They reason that,\nwhether the grievance is considered under the Speech\nClause or the Petition Clause, the government employer is\nentitled to take adverse action against the employee\nunless the dispute involves a matter of public concern.\n   Rejecting that view, the Court of Appeals here affirmed\nthe award of compensatory damages, although it found\ninsufficient evidence to sustain the award of punitive\ndamages. The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c \u2018a public\nemployee who has petitioned the government through a\nformal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or griev\u00ad\nance is protected under the Petition Clause from retalia\u00ad\ntion for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter\nof solely private concern.\u2019 \u201d 364 Fed. Appx. 749, 753 (CA3\n2010) (quoting Foraker v. Chaffinch, 501 F. 3d 231, 236\n(CA3 2007)). The decision of the Court of Appeals was\nconsistent with the rule adopted and explained by that\ncourt in San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 30 F. 3d 424, 442\n(1994). This Court granted certiorari to resolve the con\u00ad\nflict in the Courts of Appeals. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                         II\n  When a public employee sues a government employer\nunder the First Amendment\u2019s Speech Clause, the em\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nployee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a\nmatter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138,\n147 (1983). If an employee does not speak as a citizen, or\ndoes not address a matter of public concern, \u201ca federal\ncourt is not the appropriate forum in which to review the\nwisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency\nallegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s behavior.\u201d Ibid.\nEven if an employee does speak as a citizen on a matter of\npublic concern, the employee\u2019s speech is not automatically\nprivileged. Courts balance the First Amendment interest\nof the employee against \u201cthe interest of the State, as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services\nit performs through its employees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of\nEd. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391\nU. S. 563, 568 (1968).\n   This framework \u201creconcile[s] the employee\u2019s right to\nengage in speech and the government employer\u2019s right to\nprotect its own legitimate interests in performing its\nmission.\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82 (2004) (per\ncuriam). There are some rights and freedoms so funda\u00ad\nmental to liberty that they cannot be bargained away in a\ncontract for public employment. \u201cOur responsibility is to\nensure that citizens are not deprived of [these] fundamen\u00ad\ntal rights by virtue of working for the government.\u201d Con\nnick, supra, at 147; see also Keyishian v. Board of Regents\nof Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605\u2013606 (1967).\nNevertheless, a citizen who accepts public employment\n\u201cmust accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.\u201d\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006). The gov\u00ad\nernment has a substantial interest in ensuring that all of\nits operations are efficient and effective. That interest\nmay require broad authority to supervise the conduct of\npublic employees. \u201cWhen someone who is paid a salary so\nthat she will contribute to an agency\u2019s effective operation\nbegins to do or say things that detract from the agency\u2019s\neffective operation, the government employer must have\n6           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome power to restrain her.\u201d Waters v. Churchill, 511\nU. S. 661, 675 (1994) (plurality opinion). Restraints are\njustified by the consensual nature of the employment\nrelationship and by the unique nature of the government\u2019s\ninterest.\n   This case arises under the Petition Clause, not the\nSpeech Clause. The parties litigated the case on the prem\u00ad\nise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and lawsuit are petitions\nprotected by the Petition Clause. This Court\u2019s precedents\nconfirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of in\u00ad\ndividuals to appeal to courts and other forums estab\u00ad\nlished by the government for resolution of legal disputes.\n\u201c[T]he right of access to courts for redress of wrongs is an\naspect of the First Amendment right to petition the gov\u00ad\nernment.\u201d Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 896\u2013\n897 (1984); see also BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S.\n516, 525 (2002); Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,\n461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983); California Motor Transport Co.\nv. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 513 (1972). Al\u00ad\nthough retaliation by a government employer for a public\nemployee\u2019s exercise of the right of access to the courts may\nimplicate the protections of the Petition Clause, this case\nprovides no necessity to consider the correct application of\nthe Petition Clause beyond that context.\n   Although this case proceeds under the Petition Clause,\nGuarnieri just as easily could have alleged that his em\u00ad\nployer retaliated against him for the speech contained\nwithin his grievances and lawsuit. That claim would have\nbeen subject to the public concern test already described.\nBecause Guarnieri chose to proceed under the Petition\nClause, however, the Court of Appeals applied a more\ngenerous rule. Following the decision of the Court of\nAppeals in San Filippo, supra, at 443, Guarnieri was\ndeemed entitled to protection from retaliation so long as\nhis petition was not a \u201csham.\u201d Under that rule, defen\u00ad\ndants and other public employers might be liable under\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Petition Clause even if the same conduct would not\ngive rise to liability under the Speech Clause. The ques\u00ad\ntion presented by this case is whether the history and\npurpose of the Petition Clause justify the imposition of\nbroader liability when an employee invokes its protection\ninstead of the protection afforded by the Speech Clause.\n   It is not necessary to say that the two Clauses are iden\u00ad\ntical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to ac\u00ad\nknowledge that the rights of speech and petition share\nsubstantial common ground. This Court has said that the\nright to speak and the right to petition are \u201ccognate\nrights.\u201d Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530 (1945); see\nalso Wayte v. United States, 470 U. S. 598, 610, n. 11\n(1985). \u201cIt was not by accident or coincidence that the\nrights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a\nsingle guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to\nassemble and to petition for redress of grievances.\u201d Tho\nmas, 323 U. S., at 530. Both speech and petition are\nintegral to the democratic process, although not necessar\u00ad\nily in the same way. The right to petition allows citizens\nto express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their gov\u00ad\nernment and their elected representatives, whereas the\nright to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is\nintegral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole\nrealm of ideas and human affairs. Beyond the political\nsphere, both speech and petition advance personal expres\u00ad\nsion, although the right to petition is generally concerned\nwith expression directed to the government seeking re\u00ad\ndress of a grievance.\n   Courts should not presume there is always an essential\nequivalence in the two Clauses or that Speech Clause\nprecedents necessarily and in every case resolve Petition\nClause claims. See ibid. (rights of speech and petition are\n\u201cnot identical\u201d). Interpretation of the Petition Clause\nmust be guided by the objectives and aspirations that\nunderlie the right. A petition conveys the special concerns\n8           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof its author to the government and, in its usual form, re\u00ad\nquests action by the government to address those con\u00ad\ncerns. See Sure-Tan Inc., supra, at 896\u2013897.\n   This Court\u2019s opinion in McDonald v. Smith, 472 U. S.\n479 (1985), has sometimes been interpreted to mean that\nthe right to petition can extend no further than the right\nto speak; but McDonald held only that speech contained\nwithin a petition is subject to the same standards for\ndefamation and libel as speech outside a petition. In those\ncircumstances the Court found \u201cno sound basis for grant\u00ad\ning greater constitutional protection to statements made\nin a petition . . . than other First Amendment expres\u00ad\nsions.\u201d Id., at 485. There may arise cases where the\nspecial concerns of the Petition Clause would provide a\nsound basis for a distinct analysis; and if that is so, the\nrules and principles that define the two rights might differ\nin emphasis and formulation.\n   As other Courts of Appeals have recognized, however,\nclaims of retaliation by public employees do not call for\nthis divergence. See supra, at 4. The close connection\nbetween these rights has led Courts of Appeals other than\nthe Third Circuit to apply the public concern test devel\u00ad\noped in Speech Clause cases to Petition Clause claims by\npublic employees. As will be explained further, this ap\u00ad\nproach is justified by the extensive common ground in the\ndefinition and delineation of these rights. The considera\u00ad\ntions that shape the application of the Speech Clause to\npublic employees apply with equal force to claims by those\nemployees under the Petition Clause.\n   The substantial government interests that justify a\ncautious and restrained approach to the protection of\nspeech by public employees are just as relevant when\npublic employees proceed under the Petition Clause.\nPetitions, no less than speech, can interfere with the\nefficient and effective operation of government. A petition\nmay seek to achieve results that \u201ccontravene governmen\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntal policies or impair the proper performance of govern\u00ad\nmental functions.\u201d Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 419. Govern\u00ad\nment must have authority, in appropriate circumstances,\nto restrain employees who use petitions to frustrate pro\u00ad\ngress towards the ends they have been hired to achieve. A\npetition, like other forms of speech, can bring the \u201cmission\nof the employer and the professionalism of its officers into\nserious disrepute.\u201d Roe, 543 U. S., at 81. A public em\u00ad\nployee might, for instance, use the courts to pursue per\u00ad\nsonal vendettas or to harass members of the general\npublic. That behavior could cause a serious breakdown in\npublic confidence in the government and its employees.\nAnd if speech or petition were directed at or concerned\nother public employees, it could have a serious and detri\u00ad\nmental effect on morale.\n  When a petition takes the form of a lawsuit against the\ngovernment employer, it may be particularly disruptive.\nUnlike speech of other sorts, a lawsuit demands a re\u00ad\nsponse. Mounting a defense to even frivolous claims may\nconsume the time and resources of the government em\u00ad\nployer. Outside the context of public employment, this\nCourt has recognized that the Petition Clause does not\nprotect \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d litigation that seeks to \u201c \u2018in\u00ad\nterfere directly with the business relationships of a\ncompetitor.\u2019 \u201d Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.\nColumbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, 60\u201361\n(1993) (quoting Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.\nNoerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 144 (1961)). In\nrecognition of the substantial costs imposed by litigation,\nCongress has also required civil rights plaintiffs whose\nsuits are \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d\nto pay attorney\u2019s fees incurred by defendants. Christians\nburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421 (1978); see\nalso Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11 (providing sanctions for claims\nthat are \u201cpresented for [an] improper purpose,\u201d frivolous,\nor lacking evidentiary support). The government likewise\n10          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas a significant interest in disciplining public employees\nwho abuse the judicial process.\n  Unrestrained application of the Petition Clause in the con-\ntext of government employment would subject a wide\nrange of government operations to invasive judicial super\u00ad\nintendence. Employees may file grievances on a variety of\nemployment matters, including working conditions, pay,\ndiscipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and terminations.\nSee Brief for National School Boards Association as\nAmicus Curiae 5. Every government action in response\ncould present a potential federal constitutional issue.\nJudges and juries, asked to determine whether the gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s actions were in fact retaliatory, would be re\u00ad\nquired to give scrutiny to both the government\u2019s response\nto the grievance and the government\u2019s justification for its\nactions. This would occasion review of a host of collateral\nmatters typically left to the discretion of public officials.\nBudget priorities, personnel decisions, and substantive\npolicies might all be laid before the jury. This would raise\nserious federalism and separation-of-powers concerns. It\nwould also consume the time and attention of public offi\u00ad\ncials, burden the exercise of legitimate authority, and blur\nthe lines of accountability between officials and the public.\n  This case illustrates these risks and costs. Guarnieri\u2019s\nattorney invited the jury to review myriad details of gov\u00ad\nernment decisionmaking. She questioned the council\u2019s\ndecision to issue directives in writing, rather than orally,\nTr. 66 (Apr. 14, 2008); the council\u2019s failure to consult the\nmayor before issuing the directives, id., at 105 (Apr. 15,\n2008); the amount of money spent to employ \u201cPhiladelphia\nlawyers\u201d to defend Guarnieri\u2019s legal challenges, id., at\n191\u2013193:7\u201310 (Apr. 14, 2008); 152\u2013153 (Apr. 16, 2008);\nand the wisdom of the council\u2019s decision to spend money to\ninstall Global Positioning System devices on police cars,\nid., at 161\u2013162 (same). Finally, the attorney invited the\njury to evaluate the council\u2019s decisions in light of an emo\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional appeal on behalf of Guarnieri\u2019s \u201clittle dog Hercules,\nlittle white fluffy dog and half Shitsu.\u201d Id., at 49:13\u201314\n(Apr. 14, 2008). It is precisely to avoid this intrusion into\ninternal governmental affairs that this Court has held\nthat, \u201cwhile the First Amendment invests public employ\u00ad\nees with certain rights, it does not empower them to \u2018con\u00ad\nstitutionalize the employee grievance.\u2019 \u201d Garcetti, supra, at\n420 (quoting Connick, 461 U. S., at 154).\n   If the Petition Clause were to apply even where matters\nof public concern are not involved, that would be unneces\u00ad\nsary, or even disruptive, when there is already protection\nfor the rights of public employees to file grievances and to\nlitigate. The government can and often does adopt statu\u00ad\ntory and regulatory mechanisms to protect the rights of\nemployees against improper retaliation or discipline, while\npreserving important government interests. Cf. Garcetti,\nsupra, at 425 (noting a \u201cpowerful network of legislative\nenactments\u201d). Employees who sue under federal and state\nemployment laws often benefit from generous and quite\ndetailed antiretaliation provisions. See, e.g., Pa. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 43, \u00a71101.1201(a)(4) (Purdon 2009); \u00a71101.1302.\nThese statutory protections are subject to legislative revi\u00ad\nsion and can be designed for the unique needs of State,\nlocal, or Federal Governments, as well as the special\ncircumstances of particular governmental offices and\nagencies. The Petition Clause is not an instrument for\npublic employees to circumvent these legislative enact\u00ad\nments when pursuing claims based on ordinary workplace\ngrievances.\n   In light of the government\u2019s interests in the public\nemployment context, it would be surprising if Petition\nClause claims by public employees were not limited as\nnecessary to protect the employer\u2019s functions and respon\u00ad\nsibilities. Even beyond the Speech Clause, this Court has\nexplained that \u201cgovernment has significantly greater\nleeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does\n12          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at\nlarge.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.\n591, 599 (2008); see also NASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___ ,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). The government\u2019s interest in\nmanaging its internal affairs requires proper restraints on\nthe invocation of rights by employees when the workplace\nor the government employer\u2019s responsibilities may be af\u00ad\nfected. There is no reason to think the Petition Clause\nshould be an exception.\n  The public concern test was developed to protect these\nsubstantial government interests. Adoption of a different\nrule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready\nmeans for public employees to circumvent the test\u2019s pro\u00ad\ntections. Consider Sheila Myers, who was the original\nplaintiff in Connick. She circulated \u201ca questionnaire\nsoliciting the views of her fellow staff members\u201d on various\noffice matters. 461 U. S., at 141. The Court held that\nMyers\u2019 claim for retaliation failed the public concern test\nbecause the questionnaire was \u201cmost accurately character\u00ad\nized as an employee grievance concerning internal office\npolicy.\u201d Id., at 154. It would undermine that principle if a\ndifferent result would have obtained had Myers raised\nthose same claims using a formal grievance procedure.\nMyers\u2019 employer \u201creasonably believed [Myers\u2019 complaints]\nwould disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and\ndestroy close working relationships.\u201d Ibid. These con\u00ad\ncerns would be no less significant in the context of a for\u00ad\nmal grievance. Employees should not be able to evade the\nrule articulated in the Connick case by wrapping their\nspeech in the mantle of the Petition Clause.\n  Articulation of a separate test for the Petition Clause\nwould aggravate potential harm to the government\u2019s\ninterests by compounding the costs of compliance with the\nConstitution. A different rule for each First Amendment\nclaim would require employers to separate petitions from\nother speech in order to afford them different treatment;\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand that, in turn, would add to the complexity and ex\u00ad\npense of compliance with the Constitution. Identifying peti\u00ad\ntions might be easy when employees employ formal griev\u00ad\nance procedures, but the right to petition is not limited\nto petitions lodged under formal procedures. See, e.g.,\nBrown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 (1966). Indeed, the\nemployee in Connick could have made a colorable argu\u00ad\nment that her questionnaire ought to be viewed as a peti\u00ad\ntion for redress of grievances.\n   Guarnieri claims application of the public concern test\nto the Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of\nthe private nature of many petitions for redress of griev\u00ad\nances. The Petition Clause undoubtedly does have force\nand application in the context of a personal grievance\naddressed to the government. See, e.g., Trainmen v. Vir\nginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1 (1964); Tho\nmas, 323 U. S., at 530\u2013531. At the founding, citizens\npetitioned on a wide range of subjects, including matters\nof both private and public concern. Petitions to the colo\u00ad\nnial legislatures concerned topics as diverse as debt ac\u00ad\ntions, estate distributions, divorce proceedings, and re\u00ad\nquests for modification of a criminal sentence. Higginson,\nA Short History of the Right to Petition Government for\nthe Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 146 (1986).\nAlthough some claims will be of interest only to the indi\u00ad\nvidual making the appeal, for that individual the need for\na legal remedy may be a vital imperative. See, e.g.,\nM. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102 (1996); Boddie v. Con\nnecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971). Outside the public em\u00ad\nployment context, constitutional protection for petitions\ndoes not necessarily turn on whether those petitions relate\nto a matter of public concern.\n   There is, however, no merit to the suggestion that the\npublic concern test cannot apply under the Petition Clause\nbecause the majority of petitions to colonial legislatures\naddressed matters of purely private concern. In analogous\n14          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases under the Speech Clause, this Court has noted the\n\u201cConstitution\u2019s special concern with threats to the right of\ncitizens to participate in political affairs,\u201d Connick, supra,\nat 145, even though it is likely that, in this and any other\nage, most speech concerns purely private matters. The\nproper scope and application of the Petition Clause like\u00ad\nwise cannot be determined merely by tallying up petitions\nto the colonial legislatures. Some effort must be made to\nidentify the historic and fundamental principles that led\nto the enumeration of the right to petition in the First\nAmendment, among other rights fundamental to liberty.\n   Petitions to the government assume an added dimension\nwhen they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas\nof interest to the community as a whole. Petition, as a\nword, a concept, and an essential safeguard of freedom, is\nof ancient significance in the English law and the Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition. See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *143. The right to petition applied to peti\u00ad\ntions from nobles to the King, from Parliament to the\nKing, and from the people to the Parliament, and it con\u00ad\ncerned both discrete, personal injuries and great matters\nof state.\n   The right to petition traces its origins to Magna Carta,\nwhich confirmed the right of barons to petition the King.\nW. McKechnie, Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great\nCharter of King John 467 (rev. 2d ed. 1958). The Magna\nCarta itself was King John\u2019s answer to a petition from the\nbarons. Id., at 30\u201338. Later, the Petition of Right of 1628\ndrew upon centuries of tradition and Magna Carta as a\nmodel for the Parliament to issue a plea, or even a de\u00ad\nmand, that the Crown refrain from certain actions. 3 Car.\n1, ch. 1 (1627). The Petition of Right stated four principal\ngrievances: taxation without consent of Parliament; arbi\u00ad\ntrary imprisonment; quartering or billeting of soldiers;\nand the imposition of martial law. After its passage by\nboth Houses of Parliament, the Petition received the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKing\u2019s assent and became part of the law of England. See\nS. Gardiner, The First Two Stuarts and the Puritan Revo\u00ad\nlution, 1603\u20131660, pp. 60\u201361 (1886). The Petition of Right\noccupies a place in English constitutional history super\u00ad\nseded in importance, perhaps, only by Magna Carta itself\nand the Declaration of Right of 1689.\n   The following years saw use of mass petitions to address\nmatters of public concern. See 8 D. Hume, History of\nEngland from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolu\u00ad\ntion in 1688, p. 122 (1763) (\u201cTumultuous petitioning . . .\nwas an admirable expedient . . . for spreading discontent,\nand for uniting the nation in any popular clamour\u201d). In\n1680, for instance, more than 15,000 persons signed a\npetition regarding the summoning and dissolution of Par\u00ad\nliament, \u201cone of the major political issues agitating the\nnation.\u201d Knights, London\u2019s \u2018Monster\u2019 Petition, 36 Histori\u00ad\ncal Journal 39, 40\u201343 (1993). Nine years later, the Decla\u00ad\nration of Right listed the illegal acts of the sovereign and\nset forth certain rights of the King\u2019s subjects, one of which\nwas the right to petition the sovereign. It stated that \u201cit\nis the Right of the Subjects to petition the King, and all\nCommitments and Prosecutions for such Petitioning are\nIllegal.\u201d 1 W. & M., ch. 2; see also L. Schwoerer, The\nDeclaration of Rights, 1689, pp. 69\u201371 (1981).\n   The Declaration of Independence of 1776 arose in the\nsame tradition. After listing other specific grievances and\nwrongs, it complained, \u201cIn every stage of these Oppres\u00ad\nsions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble\nterms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by\nrepeated injury.\u201d The Declaration of Independence \u00b630.\n   After independence, petitions on matters of public con\u00ad\ncern continued to be an essential part of contemporary\ndebates in this country\u2019s early history. Two years before\nthe adoption of the Constitution, James Madison\u2019s Memo\u00ad\nrial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, an\nimportant document in the history of the Establishment\n16          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClause, was presented to the General Assembly of the Com\u00ad\nmonwealth of Virginia as a petition. See 1 D. Lay-\ncock, Religious Liberty: Overviews and History 90 (2010);\nArizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.\nWinn, 563 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12\u201313). It\nattracted over 1,000 signatures. Laycock, supra, at 90,\nn. 153. During the ratification debates, Antifederalists\ncirculated petitions urging delegates not to adopt the\nConstitution absent modification by a bill of rights. Boyd,\nAntifederalists and the Acceptance of the Constitution:\nPennsylvania, 1787\u20131792, 9 Publius, No. 2, pp. 123, 128\u2013\n133 (Spring 1979).\n   Petitions to the National Legislature also played a\ncentral part in the legislative debate on the subject of\nslavery in the years before the Civil War. See W. Miller,\nArguing About Slavery (1995). Petitions allowed partici\u00ad\npation in democratic governance even by groups excluded\nfrom the franchise. See Mark, The Vestigial Constitution:\nThe History and Significance of the Right to Petition, 66\nFord. L. Rev. 2153, 2182 (1998). For instance, petitions by\nwomen seeking the vote had a role in the early woman\u2019s\nsuffrage movement. See Cogan & Ginzberg, 1846 Petition\nfor Woman\u2019s Suffrage, New York State Constitutional\nConvention, 22 Signs 427, 437\u2013438 (1997). The right to\npetition is in some sense the source of other fundamental\nrights, for petitions have provided a vital means for citi\u00ad\nzens to request recognition of new rights and to assert\nexisting rights against the sovereign.\n   Petitions to the courts and similar bodies can likewise\naddress matters of great public import. In the context of\nthe civil rights movement, litigation provided a means for\n\u201cthe distinctive contribution of a minority group to the\nideas and beliefs of our society.\u201d NAACP v. Button, 371\nU. S. 415, 431 (1963). Individuals may also \u201cengag[e] in\nlitigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and\nassociation, as well as a means of communicating useful\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Litigation on matters of public concern may\nfacilitate the informed public participation that is a cor\u00ad\nnerstone of democratic society. It also allows individuals\nto pursue desired ends by direct appeal to government\nofficials charged with applying the law.\n   The government may not misuse its role as employer\nunduly to distort this deliberative process. See Garcetti,\n547 U. S., at 419. Public employees are \u201cthe members of a\ncommunity most likely to have informed and definite\nopinions\u201d about a wide range of matters related, directly\nor indirectly, to their employment. Pickering, 391 U. S., at\n572. Just as the public has a right to hear the views of\npublic employees, the public has a right to the benefit\nof those employees\u2019 participation in petitioning activity.\nPetitions may \u201callow the public airing of disputed facts\u201d\nand \u201cpromote the evolution of the law by supporting the\ndevelopment of legal theories,\u201d NLRB, 536 U. S., at 532\n(internal quotation marks omitted), and these and other\nbenefits may not accrue if one class of knowledgeable and\nmotivated citizens is prevented from engaging in petition\u00ad\ning activity. When a public employee seeks to participate,\nas a citizen, in the process of deliberative democracy,\neither through speech or petition, \u201cit is necessary to regard\nthe [employee] as the member of the general public he\nseeks to be.\u201d Pickering, supra, at 574.\n   The framework used to govern Speech Clause claims by\npublic employees, when applied to the Petition Clause,\nwill protect both the interests of the government and the\nFirst Amendment right. If a public employee petitions as\nan employee on a matter of purely private concern, the\nemployee\u2019s First Amendment interest must give way, as it\ndoes in speech cases. Roe, 543 U. S., at 82\u201383. When a\npublic employee petitions as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern, the employee\u2019s First Amendment interest must\nbe balanced against the countervailing interest of the\n18          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngovernment in the effective and efficient management of\nits internal affairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that\nbalance favors the public employee, the employee\u2019s First\nAmendment claim will be sustained. If the interference\nwith the government\u2019s operations is such that the balance\nfavors the employer, the employee\u2019s First Amendment\nclaim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of\npublic concern.\n   As under the Speech Clause, whether an employee\u2019s\npetition relates to a matter of public concern will depend\non \u201cthe content, form, and context of [the petition], as\nrevealed by the whole record.\u201d Connick, 461 U. S., at 147\u2013\n148, and n. 7. The forum in which a petition is lodged will\nbe relevant to the determination of whether the petition\nrelates to a matter of public concern. See Snyder v.\nPhelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139). A peti\u00ad\ntion filed with an employer using an internal grievance\nprocedure in many cases will not seek to communicate to\nthe public or to advance a political or social point of view\nbeyond the employment context.\n   Of course in one sense the public may always be inter\u00ad\nested in how government officers are performing their\nduties. But as the Connick and Pickering test has evolved,\nthat will not always suffice to show a matter of public\nconcern. A petition that \u201cinvolves nothing more than a\ncomplaint about a change in the employee\u2019s own duties\u201d\ndoes not relate to a matter of public concern and accord\u00ad\ningly \u201cmay give rise to discipline without imposing any\nspecial burden of justification on the government em\u00ad\nployer.\u201d United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.\n454, 466 (1995).

Unreasoned statements to the\ncontrary in this Court\u2019s prior decisions do not convince me\notherwise. Like the Court, however, I need not decide that\nquestion today because \u201c[t]he parties litigated the case on\nthe premise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and lawsuit are\npetitions protected by the Petition Clause.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n  I also largely agree with JUSTICE SCALIA about the\nframework for assessing public employees\u2019 retaliation\nclaims under the Petition Clause. The \u201cpublic concern\u201d\ndoctrine of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), is\nrooted in the First Amendment\u2019s core protection of speech\non matters of public concern and has no relation to the\nright to petition. See post, at 3\u20137. I would not import that\ntest into the Petition Clause. Rather, like JUSTICE SCALIA,\nI would hold that \u201cthe Petition Clause protects public\nemployees against retaliation for filing petitions unless\nthose petitions are addressed to the government in its\ncapacity as the petitioners\u2019 employer, rather than its ca\npacity as their sovereign.\u201d Post, at 7.\n  But I would not end the analysis after determining that\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\na petition was addressed to the government as sovereign.\nRecognizing \u201cthe realities of the employment context,\u201d we\nhave held that \u201cgovernment has significantly greater lee\nway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does\nwhen it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at\nlarge.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.\n591, 600, 599 (2008). Even where a public employee peti\ntions the government in its capacity as sovereign, I would\nbalance the employee\u2019s right to petition the sovereign\nagainst the government\u2019s interest as an employer in the ef-\nfective and efficient management of its internal affairs.\nCf. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419 (2006) (noting\nthat employees \u201cspeaking as citizens about matters of pub\nlic concern\u201d still must \u201cface . . . speech restrictions that\nare necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and\neffectively\u201d); United States v. Treasury Employees, 513\nU. S. 454, 492 (1995) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (\u201cIn\nconducting this balance [in the Speech Clause context],\nwe consistently have given substantial weight to govern\nment employers\u2019 reasonable predictions of disruption, even\nwhen the speech involved was on a matter of public con\ncern\u201d); O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.

In assessing a retaliation\nclaim under the Petition Clause, courts should be able to\nconclude that, in instances when the petition is especially\ndisruptive, as some lawsuits might be, the balance of\ninterests may weigh in favor of the government employer.\n   Applying this framework, I would vacate the judgment\nand remand. The Court of Appeals erred with respect to\nboth Guarnieri\u2019s union grievance and his 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983\nsuit. First, even assuming the grievance was a petition, it\nwas addressed to the local government in its capacity as\n                Cite as: 564 U.

Second, Guarnieri addressed his \u00a71983 suit to the\nFederal Government in its capacity as sovereign, not to\nthe local government as his employer. See ibid. But the\nCourt of Appeals did not consider whether the local gov\nernment\u2019s interest as an employer \u201cin achieving its goals\nas effectively and efficiently as possible\u201d nevertheless\noutweighs Guarnieri\u2019s interest in petitioning the Federal\nGovernment regarding his local employment.

Our first opinion clearly saying that lawsuits\nare \u201cPetitions\u201d under the Petition Clause came less than\n40 years ago. In California Motor Transport Co. v. Truck\ning Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508 (1972),1 an opinion by Justice\nDouglas, the Court asserted that \u201c[t]he right of access to\nthe courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\u201d\nId., at 510. As authority it cited two habeas corpus cases,\nJohnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483 (1969), and Ex parte Hull,\n312 U. S. 546 (1941), neither of which even mentioned the\nPetition Clause. The assertion, moreover, was pure dic\ntum. The holding of California Motor Transport was that\nthe Noerr-Pennington doctrine, a judicial gloss on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent would agree, since he cited this case in argument as the\n\nearliest. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. There were, however, three cases in the\n1960\u2019s which adverted vaguely to lawsuits as involving the right to\npetition. See Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S. 217, 222\u2013\n224 (1967); Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n7 (1964); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 430 (1963).\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nSherman Act that had been held to immunize certain\nlobbying (legislature-petitioning) activity, did not apply to\nsham litigation that \u201csought to bar . . . competitors from\nmeaningful access to adjudicatory tribunals,\u201d 404 U. S., at\n510\u2013512. The three other cases cited by the Court as\nholding that lawsuits are petitions, ante, at 6, are all\nstatutory interpretation decisions construing the National\nLabor Relations Act, albeit against the backdrop of the\nPetition Clause. See BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536\nU. S. 516, 534\u2013536 (2002); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467\nU. S. 883, 896\u2013897 (1984) Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc.\nv. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 741\u2013743 (1983). The Court has\nnever actually held that a lawsuit is a constitutionally\nprotected \u201cPetition,\u201d nor does today\u2019s opinion hold that.\nThe Court merely observes that \u201c[t]he parties litigated the\ncase on the premise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and law\nsuit are petitions protected by the Petition Clause,\u201d ante,\nat 6, and concludes that Guarnieri\u2019s 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983\nclaim would fail even if that premise were correct.\n  I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally\nprotected \u201cPetition\u201d quite doubtful. The First Amend\nment\u2019s Petition Clause states that \u201cCongress shall make\nno law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people . . . to\npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d The\nreference to \u201cthe right of the people\u201d indicates that the\nPetition Clause was intended to codify a pre-existing\nindividual right, which means that we must look to\nhistorical practice to determine its scope. See District of\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 579, 592 (2008).\n  There is abundant historical evidence that \u201cPetitions\u201d\nwere directed to the executive and legislative branches of\ngovernment, not to the courts. In 1765, the Stamp Act\nCongress stated \u201c[t]hat it is the right of the British sub\njects in these colonies to petition the King or either House\nof Parliament.\u201d Declaration of Rights and Grievances,\nArt. 13, reprinted in 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nDocumentary History 195, 198 (1971); it made no mention\nof petitions directed to the courts. As of 1781, seven state\nconstitutions protected citizens\u2019 right to apply or petition\nfor redress of grievances; all seven referred only to legisla\ntive petitions. See Andrews, A Right of Access to Court\nUnder the Petition Clause of the First Amendment: De\nfining the Right, 60 Ohio St. L. J. 557, 604\u2013605, n. 159\n(1999). The Judiciary Act of 1789 did not grant federal\ntrial courts jurisdiction to hear lawsuits arising under\nfederal law; there is no indication anyone ever thought\nthat this restriction infringed on the right of citizens to\npetition the Federal Government for redress of grievances.\nThe fact that the Court never affirmed a First Amendment\nright to litigate until its unsupported dictum in 1972\u2014\nafter having heard almost 200 years\u2019 worth of lawsuits,\nuntold numbers of which might have been affected by a\nFirst Amendment right to litigate\u2014should give rise to a\nstrong suspicion that no such right exists. \u201c[A] universal\nand long-established tradition of prohibiting certain con\nduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is\nconstitutional: Principles of liberty fundamental enough to\nhave been embodied within constitutional guarantees are\nnot readily erased from the Nation\u2019s consciousness.\u201d\nNevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, ante, at 4 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   I acknowledge, however, that scholars have made de\ntailed historical arguments to the contrary. See, e.g.,\nAndrews, supra, at 595\u2013625; Pfander, Sovereign Immu\nnity and the Right to Petition: Toward a First Amendment\nRight to Pursue Judicial Claims Against the Government,\n91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 899, 903\u2013962 (1997). As the Court\u2019s\nopinion observes, the parties have not litigated the issue,\nand so I agree we should leave its resolution to another\nday.\n   Second, and of greater practical consequence, I disagree\nwith the Court\u2019s decision to apply the \u201cpublic concern\u201d\n4           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nframework of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), to\nretaliation claims brought under the Petition Clause. The\nCourt correctly holds that the Speech Clause and Petition\nClause are not co-extensive, ante, at 7\u20138. It acknowledges,\nmoreover, that the Petition Clause protects personal\ngrievances addressed to the government, ante, at 13. But\nthat is an understatement\u2014rather like acknowledging\nthat the Speech Clause protects verbal expression. \u201c[T]he\nprimary responsibility of colonial assemblies was the\nsettlement of private disputes raised by petitions.\u201d Hig\nginson, A Short History of the Right to Petition Govern\nment for the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 145\n(1986). \u201c[T]he overwhelming majority of First Congress\npetitions presented private claims.\u201d 8 Documentary His\ntory of the First Federal Congress 1789\u20131791, p. xviii (K.\nBowling, W. DiGiacomantonio, & C. Bickford eds. 1998).\nThe Court nonetheless holds that, at least in public em\nployment cases, the Petition Clause and Speech Clause\nshould be treated identically, so that since the Speech\nClause does not prohibit retaliation against public em\nployees for speaking on matters of private concern, neither\ndoes the Petition Clause. The Court gives two reasons for\nthis: First, \u201c[a] different rule for each First Amendment\nclaim would . . . add to the complexity and expense of\ncompliance with the Constitution\u201d and \u201cwould provide a\nready means for public employees to circumvent the test\u2019s\nprotections,\u201d and second, \u201c[p]etitions to the government\n. . . assume an added dimension when they seek to ad\nvance political, social, or other ideas of interest to the\ncommunity as a whole.\u201d Ante, at 12\u201314.\n    Neither reason is persuasive. As to the former: The\ncomplexity of treating the Petition Clause and Speech\nClause separately is attributable to the inconsiderate\ndisregard for judicial convenience displayed by those who\nratified a First Amendment that included both provisions\nas separate constitutional rights. A plaintiff does not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nengage in pernicious \u201ccircumvention\u201d of our Speech\nClause precedents when he brings a claim premised on a\nseparate enumerated right to which those precedents are\ninapplicable.\n  As to the latter: Perhaps petitions on matters of public\nconcern do in some sense involve an \u201cadded dimension,\u201d\nbut that \u201cadded dimension\u201d does not obliterate what has\ntraditionally been the principal dimension of the Petition\nClause. The public-concern limitation makes sense in the\ncontext of the Speech Clause, because it is speech on mat\nters of public concern that lies \u201cwithin the core of First\nAmendment protection.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agri\nculture, 553 U. S. 591, 600 (2008). The Speech Clause\n\u201chas its fullest and most urgent application to speech\nuttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe unique protection granted to political speech is\ngrounded in the history of the Speech Clause, which \u201cwas\nfashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the\nbringing about of political and social changes desired by\nthe people.\u201d Connick, supra, at 145 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  But the mere fact that we have a longstanding tradition\nof granting heightened protection to speech of public con\ncern does not suggest that a \u201cpublic concern\u201d requirement\nshould be written into other constitutional provisions. We\nwould not say that religious proselytizing is entitled to\nmore protection under the Free Exercise Clause than\nprivate religious worship because public proclamations are\n\u201ccore free exercise activity.\u201d Nor would we say that the\ndue process right to a neutral adjudicator is heightened in\nthe context of litigation of national importance because\nsuch litigation is somehow at the \u201ccore of the due process\nguarantee.\u201d Likewise, given that petitions to redress\nprivate grievances were such a high proportion of petitions\n6           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nat the founding\u2014a proportion that is infinitely higher if\nlawsuits are considered to be petitions\u2014it is ahistorical to\nsay that petitions on matters of public concern constitute\n\u201ccore petitioning activity.\u201d In the Court\u2019s view, if Guar\nnieri had submitted a letter to one of the borough of\nDuryea\u2019s council members protesting a tax assessment\nthat he claimed was mistaken; and if the borough had\nfired him in retaliation for that petition; Guarnieri would\nhave no claim for a Petition Clause violation. That has to\nbe wrong. It takes no account of, and thus frustrates, the\nprincipal purpose of the Petition Clause.\n   The Court responds that \u201c[t]he proper scope and appli\ncation of the Petition Clause . . . cannot be determined\nmerely by tallying up petitions to the colonial legisla\ntures,\u201d ante, at 14, but that misses the point. The text of\nthe Petition Clause does not distinguish petitions of public\nconcern from petitions of private concern. Accordingly,\nthere should be no doctrinal distinction between them\nunless the history or tradition of the Petition Clause justi\nfies it. The mere fact that the Court can enumerate sev\neral historical petitions of public importance, ante, at 14\u2013\n16, does not establish such a tradition, given that peti\ntions for redress of private grievances vastly outnumbered\nthem. Indeed, the Court\u2019s holding is contrary to this\nCourt\u2019s historical treatment of the Petition Clause, assum\ning (as the Court believes) that the Clause embraces liti\ngation: We have decided innumerable cases establishing\nconstitutional rights with respect to litigation, and until\ntoday not a one of them has so much as hinted that litiga\ntion of public concern enjoys more of those rights than\nlitigation of private concern. The Court\u2019s belief in the\nsocial importance of public petitions, and its reminiscences\nof some of the public-petition greats of yesteryear, ibid., do\nnot justify the proclamation of special constitutional rights\nfor public petitions. It is the Constitution that establishes\nconstitutional rights, not the Justices\u2019 notions of what is\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

And there is no basis for believing that the Petition\nClause gives special protection to public petitions.\n   Rather than shoehorning the \u201cpublic concern\u201d doctrine\ninto a Clause where it does not fit, we should hold that\nthe Petition Clause protects public employees against re\ntaliation for filing petitions unless those petitions are ad\ndressed to the government in its capacity as the petition\ners\u2019 employer, rather than its capacity as their sovereign.\nAs the Court states, we have long held that \u201cgovernment\nhas significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citi\nzen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign\npower to bear on citizens at large.\u201d Ante, at 11\u201312 (quot\ning Engquist, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted). To apply to the Petition Clause context what we\nhave said regarding the Speech Clause: When an em\nployee files a petition with the government in its capacity\nas his employer, he is not acting \u201cas [a] citize[n] for First\nAmendment purposes,\u201d because \u201cthere is no relevant\nanalogue to [petitions] by citizens who are not government\nemployees.\u201d Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 421, 423\u2013\n424 (2006). To be sure, the line between a petition ad\ndressed to government as the petitioner\u2019s employer and\none addressed to it as sovereign is not always clear, but it\nis no more fuzzy than the line between matters of private\nand matters of public concern.2 The criterion I suggest\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare,   e.g., Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v. Hansen, 381 F. 3d 917,\n927 (CA9 2004) (testimony concerning claim of employment discrimina\ntion by government contractor constituted matter of public concern\nbecause \u201c[l]itigation seeking to expose . . . wrongful governmental\nactivity is, by its very nature, a matter of public concern\u201d), with Padilla\nv. South Harrison R-II School Dist., 181 F. 3d 992, 997 (CA8 1999)\n(teacher\u2019s testimony approving sexual relationship between teacher and\nminor was matter of private concern because it \u201cdoes not relate to the\nteacher\u2019s legitimate disagreement with a school board\u2019s policies\u201d). And\ncompare, e.g., Voigt v. Savell, 70 F. 3d 1552, 1560 (CA9 1995) (speech\nregarding how judge handled two internal personnel matters was\n8              BOROUGH OF DURYEA v.

The portion of it upholding Guarni\neri\u2019s claim of retaliation for having filed his union griev\nance must be reversed. A union grievance is the epitome\nof a petition addressed to the government in its capacity\nas the petitioner\u2019s employer. No analogous petitions to the\ngovernment could have been filed by private citizens, who\nare not even permitted to avail themselves of Guarnieri\u2019s\nunion grievance procedure. Contrariwise, the portion of\nthe judgment upholding Guarnieri\u2019s claim of retaliation\nfor having filed his \u00a71983 claim must be affirmed. Given\nthat Guarnieri was not an employee of the Federal Gov\nernment, it is impossible to say that the \u00a71983 claim was\naddressed to government in its capacity as his employer. I\nthink it clear that retaliating against a state employee for\nwriting a letter to his Congressman about his state job\nwould run afoul of the Petition Clause.

Argued March 22, 2011\u2014Decided June 20, 2011\nAfter petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief,\n  he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement. When the\n  borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to\n  perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator or\n  dered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn. Guarni\n  eri then filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that the di\n  rectives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance,\n  thereby violating his First Amendment \u201cright . . . to petition the Gov\n  ernment for a redress of grievances\u201d; he later amended his complaint\n  to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying\n  his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the\n  \u00a71983 suit. The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the\n  suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and\n  the jury found for Guarnieri. Affirming the compensatory damages\n  award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has peti\n  tioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the fil\n  ing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause\n  from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a mat\n  ter of solely private concern. In so ruling, the court rejected the view\n  of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be pro\n  tected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.\nHeld: A government employer\u2019s allegedly retaliatory actions against an\n employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless\n the employee\u2019s petition relates to a matter of public concern. The\n Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the public concern test does not limit\n public employees\u2019 Petition Clause claims is incorrect. Pp. 4\u201319.\n    (a) A public employee suing his employer under the First Amend\n2                BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ment\u2019s Speech Clause must show that he spoke as a citizen on a mat\n    ter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 147. Even\n    where the employee makes that showing, however, courts balance his\n    employee\u2019s right to engage in speech against the government\u2019s inter\n    est in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the public services\n    it performs through its employees. Pickering v. Board of Ed. of\n    Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568. Al\n    though cases might arise in which special Petition Clause concerns\n    would require a distinct analysis, public employees\u2019 retaliation claims\n    do not call for this divergence. The close connection between the\n    rights of speech and petition has led Courts of Appeals other than the\n    Third Circuit to apply the public concern test to public employees\u2019 Pe\n    tition Clause claims. This approach is justified by the substantial\n    common ground in the definition and delineation of these rights. Pp.\n    4\u20138.\n       (b) The substantial government interests that justify a cautious\n    and restrained approach to protecting public employees\u2019 speech are\n    just as relevant in Petition Clause cases. A petition, no less than\n    speech, can interfere with government\u2019s efficient and effective opera\n    tion by, e.g., seeking results that \u201ccontravene governmental policies\n    or impair the proper performance of governmental functions,\u201d Gar\n    cetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419. A petition taking the form of a\n    lawsuit against the government employer may be particularly disrup\n    tive, consuming public officials\u2019 time and attention, burdening their\n    exercise of legitimate authority, and blurring the lines of accountabil\n    ity between them and the public. Here, for example, Guarnieri\u2019s at\n    torney invited the jury to review myriad details of government deci\n    sionmaking. It is precisely to avoid this sort of intrusion into internal\n    governmental affairs that this Court has held that, \u201cwhile the First\n    Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not\n    empower them to \u2018constitutionalize the employee grievance.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n    420. Interpreting the Petition Clause to apply even where matters of\n    public concern are not involved would be unnecessary, or even dis\n    ruptive, when there is already protection for the public employees\u2019\n    rights to file grievances and litigate. Adopting a different rule for Pe\n    tition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employ\n    ees to circumvent the public concern test\u2019s protections and aggravate\n    potential harm to the government\u2019s interests by compounding the\n    costs of complying with the Constitution. Pp. 8\u201313.\n       (c) Guarnieri\u2019s claim that applying the public concern test to the\n    Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of the private nature\n    of many petitions for redress lacks merit. Although the Clause un\n    doubtedly has force and application in the context of a personal\n    grievance addressed to the government, petitions to the government\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political, so\n  cial, or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole. The\n  Clause\u2019s history reveals the frequent use of petitions to address a\n  wide range of political, social, and other matters of great public im\n  port and interest. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     (d) The framework used to govern public employees\u2019 Speech Clause\n  claims, when applied to the Petition Clause, will protect both the\n  government\u2019s interests and the employee\u2019s First Amendment right. If\n  a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of purely pri\n  vate concern, his First Amendment interest must give way, as it does\n  in speech cases. San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82\u201383. If he peti\n  tions as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment\n  interest must be balanced against the government\u2019s countervailing\n  interest in the effective and efficient management of its internal af\n  fairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that balance favors the public em\n  ployee, the First Amendment claim will be sustained. If the balance\n  favors the employer, the employee\u2019s First Amendment claim will fail\n  even though the petition is on a matter of public concern. As under\n  the Speech Clause, whether a petition relates to a matter of public\n  concern will depend on its \u201ccontent, form, and context . . . , as re\n  vealed by the whole record.\u201d Connick, supra, at 147\u2013148, n. 7. The\n  forum in which a petition is lodged will also be relevant. See Snyder\n  v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___. A petition filed with a government em\n  ployer using an internal grievance procedure in many cases will not\n  seek to communicate to the public or to advance a political or social\n  point of view beyond the employment context.

CHARLES J. GUARNIERI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 20, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the court.\n   Among other rights essential to freedom, the First\nAmendment protects \u201cthe right of the people . . . to peti\u00ad\ntion the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 1. This case concerns the extent of the\nprotection, if any, that the Petition Clause grants public\nemployees in routine disputes with government employ\u00ad\ners. Petitions are a form of expression, and employees\nwho invoke the Petition Clause in most cases could invoke\nas well the Speech Clause of the First Amendment. To\nshow that an employer interfered with rights under the\nSpeech Clause, the employee, as a general rule, must show\nthat his speech was on a matter of public concern, as that\nterm is defined in the precedents of this and other courts.\nHere the issue is whether that test applies when the\nemployee invokes the Petition Clause.\n   Alone among the Courts of Appeals to have addressed\nthe issue, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has\nheld that the public concern test does not limit Petition\nClause claims by public employees. For the reasons stated\nbelow, this conclusion is incorrect.\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n  Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance challenging\nhis termination as chief of police for the borough of\nDuryea, a town of about 4,600 persons in northeastern\nPennsylvania. His grievance proceeded to arbitration\npursuant to the police union collective-bargaining agree\u00ad\nment. The arbitrator found that the borough council,\nDuryea\u2019s legislative body and the entity responsible for\nGuarnieri\u2019s termination, committed procedural errors in\nconnection with the termination; and the arbitrator also\nfound that Guarnieri engaged in misconduct, including\n\u201cattempting to intimidate Council members.\u201d App. 37, 38.\nThe arbitrator ordered Guarnieri reinstated after a disci\u00ad\nplinary suspension. Id., at 38.\n  Upon Guarnieri\u2019s return to the job, the council issued 11\ndirectives instructing Guarnieri in the performance of his\nduties. The council\u2019s attorney explained that the council\n\u201cwanted to be sure that the chief understood what was\ngoing to be expected of him upon his return.\u201d Tr. 19:12\u201314\n(Apr. 16, 2008). One directive prohibited Guarnieri from\nworking overtime without the council\u2019s \u201cexpress permis\u00ad\nsion.\u201d App. 59, \u00b61. Another indicated that \u201c[t]he police\ncar is to be used for official business only.\u201d Id., at 60, \u00b69.\nA third stated that the \u201cDuryea municipal building is a\nsmoke free building\u201d and that the \u201cpolice department is\nnot exempt.\u201d Id., at 61, \u00b610. Guarnieri testified that,\nbecause of these and other directives, his \u201ccoming back\nwasn\u2019t a warm welcome feeling.\u201d Tr. 65:7\u20138 (Apr. 15,\n2008). Guarnieri filed a second union grievance challeng\u00ad\ning the directives. The arbitrator instructed the council to\nmodify or withdraw some of the directives on the grounds\nthat they were vague, interfered with the authority of\nthe mayor, or were contrary to the collective-bargaining\nagreement.\n  Guarnieri filed this lawsuit against the borough, the\nborough council, and individual members of the council\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Guarnieri claimed that his first\nunion grievance was a petition protected by the Petition\nClause of the First Amendment, and he alleged that the\ndirectives issued upon his reinstatement were retaliation\nfor that protected activity.\n  After this suit was filed, the council denied a request\nby Guarnieri for $338 in overtime. The United States\nDepartment of Labor investigated and concluded that\nGuarnieri was entitled to be paid. The council offered\nGuarnieri a check for the amount, but Guarnieri refused\nto accept it. Instead, Guarnieri amended his complaint to\nencompass the denial of overtime. Guarnieri alleged that\nhis \u00a71983 lawsuit was a petition and that the denial of\novertime constituted retaliation for his having filed the\nlawsuit.\n  Under the law of the Circuit, the defendants could not\nobtain judgment as a matter of law on the basis that\nthe lawsuit and grievances were not on a matter of public\nconcern. The case proceeded to a jury. Guarnieri\u2019s attor\u00ad\nney argued that the council was \u201csending a message to\u201d\nGuarnieri through the directives and the denial of over\u00ad\ntime: \u201cYou might have won your arbitration, but we con\u00ad\ntrol you.\u201d Tr. 53:24\u201325 (Apr. 17, 2008). The District Court\ninstructed the jury that the lawsuit and union grievances\nwere \u201cprotected activity . . . under the constitution,\u201d and\nthat the jury could find defendants liable if it found an\nadequate connection between the protected activity and\nthe alleged retaliation. Id., at 61:17\u201320; 62. The jury\nfound in favor of Guarnieri. The jury awarded $45,000 in\ncompensatory damages and $24,000 in punitive damages\nfor the directives, as well as $358 in compensatory dam\u00ad\nages and $28,000 in punitive damages for the denial of\novertime. The District Court awarded $45,000 in attor\u00ad\nney\u2019s fees and denied defendants\u2019 renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law.\n  Defendants appealed on the ground that Guarnieri\u2019s\n4           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngrievances and lawsuit did not address matters of public\nconcern. Courts outside the Third Circuit have held that\nallegedly retaliatory actions by government employers\nagainst government employees may not give rise to liabil\u00ad\nity under the Petition Clause unless the employee\u2019s peti\u00ad\ntion related to a matter of public concern. See, e.g., Kirby\nv. Elizabeth City, 388 F. 3d 440, 448\u2013449 (CA4 2004);\nTang v. Rhode Island, Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F. 3d 7,\n11\u201312 (CA1 1998); White Plains Towing Corp. v. Patter\nson, 991 F. 2d 1049, 1059 (CA2 1993). These courts rely\non a substantial overlap between the rights of speech and\npetition to justify the application of Speech Clause pre\u00ad\ncedents to Petition Clause claims. They reason that,\nwhether the grievance is considered under the Speech\nClause or the Petition Clause, the government employer is\nentitled to take adverse action against the employee\nunless the dispute involves a matter of public concern.\n   Rejecting that view, the Court of Appeals here affirmed\nthe award of compensatory damages, although it found\ninsufficient evidence to sustain the award of punitive\ndamages. The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c \u2018a public\nemployee who has petitioned the government through a\nformal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or griev\u00ad\nance is protected under the Petition Clause from retalia\u00ad\ntion for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter\nof solely private concern.\u2019 \u201d 364 Fed. Appx. 749, 753 (CA3\n2010) (quoting Foraker v. Chaffinch, 501 F. 3d 231, 236\n(CA3 2007)). The decision of the Court of Appeals was\nconsistent with the rule adopted and explained by that\ncourt in San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 30 F. 3d 424, 442\n(1994). This Court granted certiorari to resolve the con\u00ad\nflict in the Courts of Appeals. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                         II\n  When a public employee sues a government employer\nunder the First Amendment\u2019s Speech Clause, the em\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nployee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a\nmatter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138,\n147 (1983). If an employee does not speak as a citizen, or\ndoes not address a matter of public concern, \u201ca federal\ncourt is not the appropriate forum in which to review the\nwisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency\nallegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s behavior.\u201d Ibid.\nEven if an employee does speak as a citizen on a matter of\npublic concern, the employee\u2019s speech is not automatically\nprivileged. Courts balance the First Amendment interest\nof the employee against \u201cthe interest of the State, as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services\nit performs through its employees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of\nEd. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391\nU. S. 563, 568 (1968).\n   This framework \u201creconcile[s] the employee\u2019s right to\nengage in speech and the government employer\u2019s right to\nprotect its own legitimate interests in performing its\nmission.\u201d San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82 (2004) (per\ncuriam). There are some rights and freedoms so funda\u00ad\nmental to liberty that they cannot be bargained away in a\ncontract for public employment. \u201cOur responsibility is to\nensure that citizens are not deprived of [these] fundamen\u00ad\ntal rights by virtue of working for the government.\u201d Con\nnick, supra, at 147; see also Keyishian v. Board of Regents\nof Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605\u2013606 (1967).\nNevertheless, a citizen who accepts public employment\n\u201cmust accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.\u201d\nGarcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006). The gov\u00ad\nernment has a substantial interest in ensuring that all of\nits operations are efficient and effective. That interest\nmay require broad authority to supervise the conduct of\npublic employees. \u201cWhen someone who is paid a salary so\nthat she will contribute to an agency\u2019s effective operation\nbegins to do or say things that detract from the agency\u2019s\neffective operation, the government employer must have\n6           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome power to restrain her.\u201d Waters v. Churchill, 511\nU. S. 661, 675 (1994) (plurality opinion). Restraints are\njustified by the consensual nature of the employment\nrelationship and by the unique nature of the government\u2019s\ninterest.\n   This case arises under the Petition Clause, not the\nSpeech Clause. The parties litigated the case on the prem\u00ad\nise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and lawsuit are petitions\nprotected by the Petition Clause. This Court\u2019s precedents\nconfirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of in\u00ad\ndividuals to appeal to courts and other forums estab\u00ad\nlished by the government for resolution of legal disputes.\n\u201c[T]he right of access to courts for redress of wrongs is an\naspect of the First Amendment right to petition the gov\u00ad\nernment.\u201d Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 896\u2013\n897 (1984); see also BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S.\n516, 525 (2002); Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,\n461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983); California Motor Transport Co.\nv. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 513 (1972). Al\u00ad\nthough retaliation by a government employer for a public\nemployee\u2019s exercise of the right of access to the courts may\nimplicate the protections of the Petition Clause, this case\nprovides no necessity to consider the correct application of\nthe Petition Clause beyond that context.\n   Although this case proceeds under the Petition Clause,\nGuarnieri just as easily could have alleged that his em\u00ad\nployer retaliated against him for the speech contained\nwithin his grievances and lawsuit. That claim would have\nbeen subject to the public concern test already described.\nBecause Guarnieri chose to proceed under the Petition\nClause, however, the Court of Appeals applied a more\ngenerous rule. Following the decision of the Court of\nAppeals in San Filippo, supra, at 443, Guarnieri was\ndeemed entitled to protection from retaliation so long as\nhis petition was not a \u201csham.\u201d Under that rule, defen\u00ad\ndants and other public employers might be liable under\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Petition Clause even if the same conduct would not\ngive rise to liability under the Speech Clause. The ques\u00ad\ntion presented by this case is whether the history and\npurpose of the Petition Clause justify the imposition of\nbroader liability when an employee invokes its protection\ninstead of the protection afforded by the Speech Clause.\n   It is not necessary to say that the two Clauses are iden\u00ad\ntical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to ac\u00ad\nknowledge that the rights of speech and petition share\nsubstantial common ground. This Court has said that the\nright to speak and the right to petition are \u201ccognate\nrights.\u201d Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530 (1945); see\nalso Wayte v. United States, 470 U. S. 598, 610, n. 11\n(1985). \u201cIt was not by accident or coincidence that the\nrights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a\nsingle guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to\nassemble and to petition for redress of grievances.\u201d Tho\nmas, 323 U. S., at 530. Both speech and petition are\nintegral to the democratic process, although not necessar\u00ad\nily in the same way. The right to petition allows citizens\nto express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their gov\u00ad\nernment and their elected representatives, whereas the\nright to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is\nintegral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole\nrealm of ideas and human affairs. Beyond the political\nsphere, both speech and petition advance personal expres\u00ad\nsion, although the right to petition is generally concerned\nwith expression directed to the government seeking re\u00ad\ndress of a grievance.\n   Courts should not presume there is always an essential\nequivalence in the two Clauses or that Speech Clause\nprecedents necessarily and in every case resolve Petition\nClause claims. See ibid. (rights of speech and petition are\n\u201cnot identical\u201d). Interpretation of the Petition Clause\nmust be guided by the objectives and aspirations that\nunderlie the right. A petition conveys the special concerns\n8           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof its author to the government and, in its usual form, re\u00ad\nquests action by the government to address those con\u00ad\ncerns. See Sure-Tan Inc., supra, at 896\u2013897.\n   This Court\u2019s opinion in McDonald v. Smith, 472 U. S.\n479 (1985), has sometimes been interpreted to mean that\nthe right to petition can extend no further than the right\nto speak; but McDonald held only that speech contained\nwithin a petition is subject to the same standards for\ndefamation and libel as speech outside a petition. In those\ncircumstances the Court found \u201cno sound basis for grant\u00ad\ning greater constitutional protection to statements made\nin a petition . . . than other First Amendment expres\u00ad\nsions.\u201d Id., at 485. There may arise cases where the\nspecial concerns of the Petition Clause would provide a\nsound basis for a distinct analysis; and if that is so, the\nrules and principles that define the two rights might differ\nin emphasis and formulation.\n   As other Courts of Appeals have recognized, however,\nclaims of retaliation by public employees do not call for\nthis divergence. See supra, at 4. The close connection\nbetween these rights has led Courts of Appeals other than\nthe Third Circuit to apply the public concern test devel\u00ad\noped in Speech Clause cases to Petition Clause claims by\npublic employees. As will be explained further, this ap\u00ad\nproach is justified by the extensive common ground in the\ndefinition and delineation of these rights. The considera\u00ad\ntions that shape the application of the Speech Clause to\npublic employees apply with equal force to claims by those\nemployees under the Petition Clause.\n   The substantial government interests that justify a\ncautious and restrained approach to the protection of\nspeech by public employees are just as relevant when\npublic employees proceed under the Petition Clause.\nPetitions, no less than speech, can interfere with the\nefficient and effective operation of government. A petition\nmay seek to achieve results that \u201ccontravene governmen\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Govern\u00ad\nment must have authority, in appropriate circumstances,\nto restrain employees who use petitions to frustrate pro\u00ad\ngress towards the ends they have been hired to achieve. A\npetition, like other forms of speech, can bring the \u201cmission\nof the employer and the professionalism of its officers into\nserious disrepute.\u201d Roe, 543 U. S., at 81. A public em\u00ad\nployee might, for instance, use the courts to pursue per\u00ad\nsonal vendettas or to harass members of the general\npublic. That behavior could cause a serious breakdown in\npublic confidence in the government and its employees.\nAnd if speech or petition were directed at or concerned\nother public employees, it could have a serious and detri\u00ad\nmental effect on morale.\n  When a petition takes the form of a lawsuit against the\ngovernment employer, it may be particularly disruptive.\nUnlike speech of other sorts, a lawsuit demands a re\u00ad\nsponse. Mounting a defense to even frivolous claims may\nconsume the time and resources of the government em\u00ad\nployer. Outside the context of public employment, this\nCourt has recognized that the Petition Clause does not\nprotect \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d litigation that seeks to \u201c \u2018in\u00ad\nterfere directly with the business relationships of a\ncompetitor.\u2019 \u201d Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.\nColumbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, 60\u201361\n(1993) (quoting Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.\nNoerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 144 (1961)). In\nrecognition of the substantial costs imposed by litigation,\nCongress has also required civil rights plaintiffs whose\nsuits are \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d\nto pay attorney\u2019s fees incurred by defendants. Christians\nburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421 (1978); see\nalso Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11 (providing sanctions for claims\nthat are \u201cpresented for [an] improper purpose,\u201d frivolous,\nor lacking evidentiary support). The government likewise\n10          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas a significant interest in disciplining public employees\nwho abuse the judicial process.\n  Unrestrained application of the Petition Clause in the con-\ntext of government employment would subject a wide\nrange of government operations to invasive judicial super\u00ad\nintendence. Employees may file grievances on a variety of\nemployment matters, including working conditions, pay,\ndiscipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and terminations.\nSee Brief for National School Boards Association as\nAmicus Curiae 5. Every government action in response\ncould present a potential federal constitutional issue.\nJudges and juries, asked to determine whether the gov\u00ad\nernment\u2019s actions were in fact retaliatory, would be re\u00ad\nquired to give scrutiny to both the government\u2019s response\nto the grievance and the government\u2019s justification for its\nactions. This would occasion review of a host of collateral\nmatters typically left to the discretion of public officials.\nBudget priorities, personnel decisions, and substantive\npolicies might all be laid before the jury. This would raise\nserious federalism and separation-of-powers concerns. It\nwould also consume the time and attention of public offi\u00ad\ncials, burden the exercise of legitimate authority, and blur\nthe lines of accountability between officials and the public.\n  This case illustrates these risks and costs. Guarnieri\u2019s\nattorney invited the jury to review myriad details of gov\u00ad\nernment decisionmaking. She questioned the council\u2019s\ndecision to issue directives in writing, rather than orally,\nTr. 66 (Apr. 14, 2008); the council\u2019s failure to consult the\nmayor before issuing the directives, id., at 105 (Apr. 15,\n2008); the amount of money spent to employ \u201cPhiladelphia\nlawyers\u201d to defend Guarnieri\u2019s legal challenges, id., at\n191\u2013193:7\u201310 (Apr. 14, 2008); 152\u2013153 (Apr. 16, 2008);\nand the wisdom of the council\u2019s decision to spend money to\ninstall Global Positioning System devices on police cars,\nid., at 161\u2013162 (same). Finally, the attorney invited the\njury to evaluate the council\u2019s decisions in light of an emo\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

It is precisely to avoid this intrusion into\ninternal governmental affairs that this Court has held\nthat, \u201cwhile the First Amendment invests public employ\u00ad\nees with certain rights, it does not empower them to \u2018con\u00ad\nstitutionalize the employee grievance.\u2019 \u201d Garcetti, supra, at\n420 (quoting Connick, 461 U. S., at 154).\n   If the Petition Clause were to apply even where matters\nof public concern are not involved, that would be unneces\u00ad\nsary, or even disruptive, when there is already protection\nfor the rights of public employees to file grievances and to\nlitigate. The government can and often does adopt statu\u00ad\ntory and regulatory mechanisms to protect the rights of\nemployees against improper retaliation or discipline, while\npreserving important government interests. Cf. Garcetti,\nsupra, at 425 (noting a \u201cpowerful network of legislative\nenactments\u201d). Employees who sue under federal and state\nemployment laws often benefit from generous and quite\ndetailed antiretaliation provisions. See, e.g., Pa. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 43, \u00a71101.1201(a)(4) (Purdon 2009); \u00a71101.1302.\nThese statutory protections are subject to legislative revi\u00ad\nsion and can be designed for the unique needs of State,\nlocal, or Federal Governments, as well as the special\ncircumstances of particular governmental offices and\nagencies. The Petition Clause is not an instrument for\npublic employees to circumvent these legislative enact\u00ad\nments when pursuing claims based on ordinary workplace\ngrievances.\n   In light of the government\u2019s interests in the public\nemployment context, it would be surprising if Petition\nClause claims by public employees were not limited as\nnecessary to protect the employer\u2019s functions and respon\u00ad\nsibilities. Even beyond the Speech Clause, this Court has\nexplained that \u201cgovernment has significantly greater\nleeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does\n12          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at\nlarge.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.\n591, 599 (2008); see also NASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___ ,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). The government\u2019s interest in\nmanaging its internal affairs requires proper restraints on\nthe invocation of rights by employees when the workplace\nor the government employer\u2019s responsibilities may be af\u00ad\nfected. There is no reason to think the Petition Clause\nshould be an exception.\n  The public concern test was developed to protect these\nsubstantial government interests. Adoption of a different\nrule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready\nmeans for public employees to circumvent the test\u2019s pro\u00ad\ntections. Consider Sheila Myers, who was the original\nplaintiff in Connick. She circulated \u201ca questionnaire\nsoliciting the views of her fellow staff members\u201d on various\noffice matters. 461 U. S., at 141. The Court held that\nMyers\u2019 claim for retaliation failed the public concern test\nbecause the questionnaire was \u201cmost accurately character\u00ad\nized as an employee grievance concerning internal office\npolicy.\u201d Id., at 154. It would undermine that principle if a\ndifferent result would have obtained had Myers raised\nthose same claims using a formal grievance procedure.\nMyers\u2019 employer \u201creasonably believed [Myers\u2019 complaints]\nwould disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and\ndestroy close working relationships.\u201d Ibid. These con\u00ad\ncerns would be no less significant in the context of a for\u00ad\nmal grievance. Employees should not be able to evade the\nrule articulated in the Connick case by wrapping their\nspeech in the mantle of the Petition Clause.\n  Articulation of a separate test for the Petition Clause\nwould aggravate potential harm to the government\u2019s\ninterests by compounding the costs of compliance with the\nConstitution. A different rule for each First Amendment\nclaim would require employers to separate petitions from\nother speech in order to afford them different treatment;\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand that, in turn, would add to the complexity and ex\u00ad\npense of compliance with the Constitution. Identifying peti\u00ad\ntions might be easy when employees employ formal griev\u00ad\nance procedures, but the right to petition is not limited\nto petitions lodged under formal procedures. See, e.g.,\nBrown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 (1966). Indeed, the\nemployee in Connick could have made a colorable argu\u00ad\nment that her questionnaire ought to be viewed as a peti\u00ad\ntion for redress of grievances.\n   Guarnieri claims application of the public concern test\nto the Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of\nthe private nature of many petitions for redress of griev\u00ad\nances. The Petition Clause undoubtedly does have force\nand application in the context of a personal grievance\naddressed to the government. See, e.g., Trainmen v. Vir\nginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1 (1964); Tho\nmas, 323 U. S., at 530\u2013531. At the founding, citizens\npetitioned on a wide range of subjects, including matters\nof both private and public concern. Petitions to the colo\u00ad\nnial legislatures concerned topics as diverse as debt ac\u00ad\ntions, estate distributions, divorce proceedings, and re\u00ad\nquests for modification of a criminal sentence. Higginson,\nA Short History of the Right to Petition Government for\nthe Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 146 (1986).\nAlthough some claims will be of interest only to the indi\u00ad\nvidual making the appeal, for that individual the need for\na legal remedy may be a vital imperative. See, e.g.,\nM. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102 (1996); Boddie v. Con\nnecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971). Outside the public em\u00ad\nployment context, constitutional protection for petitions\ndoes not necessarily turn on whether those petitions relate\nto a matter of public concern.\n   There is, however, no merit to the suggestion that the\npublic concern test cannot apply under the Petition Clause\nbecause the majority of petitions to colonial legislatures\naddressed matters of purely private concern. In analogous\n14          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases under the Speech Clause, this Court has noted the\n\u201cConstitution\u2019s special concern with threats to the right of\ncitizens to participate in political affairs,\u201d Connick, supra,\nat 145, even though it is likely that, in this and any other\nage, most speech concerns purely private matters. The\nproper scope and application of the Petition Clause like\u00ad\nwise cannot be determined merely by tallying up petitions\nto the colonial legislatures. Some effort must be made to\nidentify the historic and fundamental principles that led\nto the enumeration of the right to petition in the First\nAmendment, among other rights fundamental to liberty.\n   Petitions to the government assume an added dimension\nwhen they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas\nof interest to the community as a whole. Petition, as a\nword, a concept, and an essential safeguard of freedom, is\nof ancient significance in the English law and the Anglo-\nAmerican legal tradition. See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *143. The right to petition applied to peti\u00ad\ntions from nobles to the King, from Parliament to the\nKing, and from the people to the Parliament, and it con\u00ad\ncerned both discrete, personal injuries and great matters\nof state.\n   The right to petition traces its origins to Magna Carta,\nwhich confirmed the right of barons to petition the King.\nW. McKechnie, Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great\nCharter of King John 467 (rev. 2d ed. 1958). The Magna\nCarta itself was King John\u2019s answer to a petition from the\nbarons. Id., at 30\u201338. Later, the Petition of Right of 1628\ndrew upon centuries of tradition and Magna Carta as a\nmodel for the Parliament to issue a plea, or even a de\u00ad\nmand, that the Crown refrain from certain actions. 3 Car.\n1, ch. 1 (1627). The Petition of Right stated four principal\ngrievances: taxation without consent of Parliament; arbi\u00ad\ntrary imprisonment; quartering or billeting of soldiers;\nand the imposition of martial law. After its passage by\nboth Houses of Parliament, the Petition received the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKing\u2019s assent and became part of the law of England. See\nS. Gardiner, The First Two Stuarts and the Puritan Revo\u00ad\nlution, 1603\u20131660, pp. 60\u201361 (1886). The Petition of Right\noccupies a place in English constitutional history super\u00ad\nseded in importance, perhaps, only by Magna Carta itself\nand the Declaration of Right of 1689.\n   The following years saw use of mass petitions to address\nmatters of public concern. See 8 D. Hume, History of\nEngland from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolu\u00ad\ntion in 1688, p. 122 (1763) (\u201cTumultuous petitioning . . .\nwas an admirable expedient . . . for spreading discontent,\nand for uniting the nation in any popular clamour\u201d). In\n1680, for instance, more than 15,000 persons signed a\npetition regarding the summoning and dissolution of Par\u00ad\nliament, \u201cone of the major political issues agitating the\nnation.\u201d Knights, London\u2019s \u2018Monster\u2019 Petition, 36 Histori\u00ad\ncal Journal 39, 40\u201343 (1993). Nine years later, the Decla\u00ad\nration of Right listed the illegal acts of the sovereign and\nset forth certain rights of the King\u2019s subjects, one of which\nwas the right to petition the sovereign. It stated that \u201cit\nis the Right of the Subjects to petition the King, and all\nCommitments and Prosecutions for such Petitioning are\nIllegal.\u201d 1 W. & M., ch. 2; see also L. Schwoerer, The\nDeclaration of Rights, 1689, pp. 69\u201371 (1981).\n   The Declaration of Independence of 1776 arose in the\nsame tradition. After listing other specific grievances and\nwrongs, it complained, \u201cIn every stage of these Oppres\u00ad\nsions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble\nterms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by\nrepeated injury.\u201d The Declaration of Independence \u00b630.\n   After independence, petitions on matters of public con\u00ad\ncern continued to be an essential part of contemporary\ndebates in this country\u2019s early history. Two years before\nthe adoption of the Constitution, James Madison\u2019s Memo\u00ad\nrial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, an\nimportant document in the history of the Establishment\n16          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClause, was presented to the General Assembly of the Com\u00ad\nmonwealth of Virginia as a petition. See 1 D. Lay-\ncock, Religious Liberty: Overviews and History 90 (2010);\nArizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.\nWinn, 563 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12\u201313). It\nattracted over 1,000 signatures. Laycock, supra, at 90,\nn. 153. During the ratification debates, Antifederalists\ncirculated petitions urging delegates not to adopt the\nConstitution absent modification by a bill of rights. Boyd,\nAntifederalists and the Acceptance of the Constitution:\nPennsylvania, 1787\u20131792, 9 Publius, No. 2, pp. 123, 128\u2013\n133 (Spring 1979).\n   Petitions to the National Legislature also played a\ncentral part in the legislative debate on the subject of\nslavery in the years before the Civil War. See W. Miller,\nArguing About Slavery (1995). Petitions allowed partici\u00ad\npation in democratic governance even by groups excluded\nfrom the franchise. See Mark, The Vestigial Constitution:\nThe History and Significance of the Right to Petition, 66\nFord. L. Rev. 2153, 2182 (1998). For instance, petitions by\nwomen seeking the vote had a role in the early woman\u2019s\nsuffrage movement. See Cogan & Ginzberg, 1846 Petition\nfor Woman\u2019s Suffrage, New York State Constitutional\nConvention, 22 Signs 427, 437\u2013438 (1997). The right to\npetition is in some sense the source of other fundamental\nrights, for petitions have provided a vital means for citi\u00ad\nzens to request recognition of new rights and to assert\nexisting rights against the sovereign.\n   Petitions to the courts and similar bodies can likewise\naddress matters of great public import. In the context of\nthe civil rights movement, litigation provided a means for\n\u201cthe distinctive contribution of a minority group to the\nideas and beliefs of our society.\u201d NAACP v. Button, 371\nU. S. 415, 431 (1963). Individuals may also \u201cengag[e] in\nlitigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and\nassociation, as well as a means of communicating useful\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Litigation on matters of public concern may\nfacilitate the informed public participation that is a cor\u00ad\nnerstone of democratic society. It also allows individuals\nto pursue desired ends by direct appeal to government\nofficials charged with applying the law.\n   The government may not misuse its role as employer\nunduly to distort this deliberative process. See Garcetti,\n547 U. S., at 419. Public employees are \u201cthe members of a\ncommunity most likely to have informed and definite\nopinions\u201d about a wide range of matters related, directly\nor indirectly, to their employment. Pickering, 391 U. S., at\n572. Just as the public has a right to hear the views of\npublic employees, the public has a right to the benefit\nof those employees\u2019 participation in petitioning activity.\nPetitions may \u201callow the public airing of disputed facts\u201d\nand \u201cpromote the evolution of the law by supporting the\ndevelopment of legal theories,\u201d NLRB, 536 U. S., at 532\n(internal quotation marks omitted), and these and other\nbenefits may not accrue if one class of knowledgeable and\nmotivated citizens is prevented from engaging in petition\u00ad\ning activity. When a public employee seeks to participate,\nas a citizen, in the process of deliberative democracy,\neither through speech or petition, \u201cit is necessary to regard\nthe [employee] as the member of the general public he\nseeks to be.\u201d Pickering, supra, at 574.\n   The framework used to govern Speech Clause claims by\npublic employees, when applied to the Petition Clause,\nwill protect both the interests of the government and the\nFirst Amendment right. If a public employee petitions as\nan employee on a matter of purely private concern, the\nemployee\u2019s First Amendment interest must give way, as it\ndoes in speech cases. Roe, 543 U. S., at 82\u201383. When a\npublic employee petitions as a citizen on a matter of public\nconcern, the employee\u2019s First Amendment interest must\nbe balanced against the countervailing interest of the\n18          BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngovernment in the effective and efficient management of\nits internal affairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that\nbalance favors the public employee, the employee\u2019s First\nAmendment claim will be sustained. If the interference\nwith the government\u2019s operations is such that the balance\nfavors the employer, the employee\u2019s First Amendment\nclaim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of\npublic concern.\n   As under the Speech Clause, whether an employee\u2019s\npetition relates to a matter of public concern will depend\non \u201cthe content, form, and context of [the petition], as\nrevealed by the whole record.\u201d Connick, 461 U. S., at 147\u2013\n148, and n. 7. The forum in which a petition is lodged will\nbe relevant to the determination of whether the petition\nrelates to a matter of public concern. See Snyder v.\nPhelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139). A peti\u00ad\ntion filed with an employer using an internal grievance\nprocedure in many cases will not seek to communicate to\nthe public or to advance a political or social point of view\nbeyond the employment context.\n   Of course in one sense the public may always be inter\u00ad\nested in how government officers are performing their\nduties. But as the Connick and Pickering test has evolved,\nthat will not always suffice to show a matter of public\nconcern. A petition that \u201cinvolves nothing more than a\ncomplaint about a change in the employee\u2019s own duties\u201d\ndoes not relate to a matter of public concern and accord\u00ad\ningly \u201cmay give rise to discipline without imposing any\nspecial burden of justification on the government em\u00ad\nployer.\u201d United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.\n454, 466 (1995). The right of a public employee under the\nPetition Clause is a right to participate as a citizen,\nthrough petitioning activity, in the democratic process. It\nis not a right to transform everyday employment disputes\ninto matters for constitutional litigation in the federal\ncourts.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Unreasoned statements to the\ncontrary in this Court\u2019s prior decisions do not convince me\notherwise. Like the Court, however, I need not decide that\nquestion today because \u201c[t]he parties litigated the case on\nthe premise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and lawsuit are\npetitions protected by the Petition Clause.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n  I also largely agree with JUSTICE SCALIA about the\nframework for assessing public employees\u2019 retaliation\nclaims under the Petition Clause. The \u201cpublic concern\u201d\ndoctrine of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), is\nrooted in the First Amendment\u2019s core protection of speech\non matters of public concern and has no relation to the\nright to petition. See post, at 3\u20137. I would not import that\ntest into the Petition Clause. Rather, like JUSTICE SCALIA,\nI would hold that \u201cthe Petition Clause protects public\nemployees against retaliation for filing petitions unless\nthose petitions are addressed to the government in its\ncapacity as the petitioners\u2019 employer, rather than its ca\npacity as their sovereign.\u201d Post, at 7.\n  But I would not end the analysis after determining that\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\na petition was addressed to the government as sovereign.\nRecognizing \u201cthe realities of the employment context,\u201d we\nhave held that \u201cgovernment has significantly greater lee\nway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does\nwhen it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at\nlarge.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.\n591, 600, 599 (2008). Even where a public employee peti\ntions the government in its capacity as sovereign, I would\nbalance the employee\u2019s right to petition the sovereign\nagainst the government\u2019s interest as an employer in the ef-\nfective and efficient management of its internal affairs.\nCf. Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419 (2006) (noting\nthat employees \u201cspeaking as citizens about matters of pub\nlic concern\u201d still must \u201cface . . . speech restrictions that\nare necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and\neffectively\u201d); United States v. Treasury Employees, 513\nU. S. 454, 492 (1995) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (\u201cIn\nconducting this balance [in the Speech Clause context],\nwe consistently have given substantial weight to govern\nment employers\u2019 reasonable predictions of disruption, even\nwhen the speech involved was on a matter of public con\ncern\u201d); O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 721\u2013722 (1987)\n(plurality opinion) (balancing the \u201cthe realities of the\nworkplace\u201d against the \u201clegitimate privacy interests of\npublic employees\u201d to conclude that a warrant requirement\nwould \u201cseriously disrupt the routine conduct of business\u201d\nand \u201cbe unduly burdensome\u201d). In assessing a retaliation\nclaim under the Petition Clause, courts should be able to\nconclude that, in instances when the petition is especially\ndisruptive, as some lawsuits might be, the balance of\ninterests may weigh in favor of the government employer.\n   Applying this framework, I would vacate the judgment\nand remand. The Court of Appeals erred with respect to\nboth Guarnieri\u2019s union grievance and his 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983\nsuit. First, even assuming the grievance was a petition, it\nwas addressed to the local government in its capacity as\n                Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          3\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nGuarnieri\u2019s employer. See post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). Second, Guarnieri addressed his \u00a71983 suit to the\nFederal Government in its capacity as sovereign, not to\nthe local government as his employer. See ibid. But the\nCourt of Appeals did not consider whether the local gov\nernment\u2019s interest as an employer \u201cin achieving its goals\nas effectively and efficiently as possible\u201d nevertheless\noutweighs Guarnieri\u2019s interest in petitioning the Federal\nGovernment regarding his local employment. Engquist,\nsupra, at 598 (internal quotation marks omitted). I would\nvacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to conduct\nthat analysis in the first instance.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Our first opinion clearly saying that lawsuits\nare \u201cPetitions\u201d under the Petition Clause came less than\n40 years ago. In California Motor Transport Co. v. Truck\ning Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508 (1972),1 an opinion by Justice\nDouglas, the Court asserted that \u201c[t]he right of access to\nthe courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\u201d\nId., at 510. As authority it cited two habeas corpus cases,\nJohnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483 (1969), and Ex parte Hull,\n312 U. S. 546 (1941), neither of which even mentioned the\nPetition Clause. The assertion, moreover, was pure dic\ntum. The holding of California Motor Transport was that\nthe Noerr-Pennington doctrine, a judicial gloss on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent would agree, since he cited this case in argument as the\n\nearliest. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. There were, however, three cases in the\n1960\u2019s which adverted vaguely to lawsuits as involving the right to\npetition. See Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S. 217, 222\u2013\n224 (1967); Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n7 (1964); NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 430 (1963).\n2           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nSherman Act that had been held to immunize certain\nlobbying (legislature-petitioning) activity, did not apply to\nsham litigation that \u201csought to bar . . . competitors from\nmeaningful access to adjudicatory tribunals,\u201d 404 U. S., at\n510\u2013512. The three other cases cited by the Court as\nholding that lawsuits are petitions, ante, at 6, are all\nstatutory interpretation decisions construing the National\nLabor Relations Act, albeit against the backdrop of the\nPetition Clause. See BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536\nU. S. 516, 534\u2013536 (2002); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467\nU. S. 883, 896\u2013897 (1984) Bill Johnson\u2019s Restaurants, Inc.\nv. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 741\u2013743 (1983). The Court has\nnever actually held that a lawsuit is a constitutionally\nprotected \u201cPetition,\u201d nor does today\u2019s opinion hold that.\nThe Court merely observes that \u201c[t]he parties litigated the\ncase on the premise that Guarnieri\u2019s grievances and law\nsuit are petitions protected by the Petition Clause,\u201d ante,\nat 6, and concludes that Guarnieri\u2019s 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983\nclaim would fail even if that premise were correct.\n  I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally\nprotected \u201cPetition\u201d quite doubtful. The First Amend\nment\u2019s Petition Clause states that \u201cCongress shall make\nno law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people . . . to\npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d The\nreference to \u201cthe right of the people\u201d indicates that the\nPetition Clause was intended to codify a pre-existing\nindividual right, which means that we must look to\nhistorical practice to determine its scope. See District of\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 579, 592 (2008).\n  There is abundant historical evidence that \u201cPetitions\u201d\nwere directed to the executive and legislative branches of\ngovernment, not to the courts. In 1765, the Stamp Act\nCongress stated \u201c[t]hat it is the right of the British sub\njects in these colonies to petition the King or either House\nof Parliament.\u201d Declaration of Rights and Grievances,\nArt. 13, reprinted in 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nDocumentary History 195, 198 (1971); it made no mention\nof petitions directed to the courts. As of 1781, seven state\nconstitutions protected citizens\u2019 right to apply or petition\nfor redress of grievances; all seven referred only to legisla\ntive petitions. See Andrews, A Right of Access to Court\nUnder the Petition Clause of the First Amendment: De\nfining the Right, 60 Ohio St. L. J. 557, 604\u2013605, n. 159\n(1999). The Judiciary Act of 1789 did not grant federal\ntrial courts jurisdiction to hear lawsuits arising under\nfederal law; there is no indication anyone ever thought\nthat this restriction infringed on the right of citizens to\npetition the Federal Government for redress of grievances.\nThe fact that the Court never affirmed a First Amendment\nright to litigate until its unsupported dictum in 1972\u2014\nafter having heard almost 200 years\u2019 worth of lawsuits,\nuntold numbers of which might have been affected by a\nFirst Amendment right to litigate\u2014should give rise to a\nstrong suspicion that no such right exists. \u201c[A] universal\nand long-established tradition of prohibiting certain con\nduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is\nconstitutional: Principles of liberty fundamental enough to\nhave been embodied within constitutional guarantees are\nnot readily erased from the Nation\u2019s consciousness.\u201d\nNevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, ante, at 4 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   I acknowledge, however, that scholars have made de\ntailed historical arguments to the contrary. See, e.g.,\nAndrews, supra, at 595\u2013625; Pfander, Sovereign Immu\nnity and the Right to Petition: Toward a First Amendment\nRight to Pursue Judicial Claims Against the Government,\n91 Nw. U. L. Rev. 899, 903\u2013962 (1997). As the Court\u2019s\nopinion observes, the parties have not litigated the issue,\nand so I agree we should leave its resolution to another\nday.\n   Second, and of greater practical consequence, I disagree\nwith the Court\u2019s decision to apply the \u201cpublic concern\u201d\n4           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nframework of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), to\nretaliation claims brought under the Petition Clause. The\nCourt correctly holds that the Speech Clause and Petition\nClause are not co-extensive, ante, at 7\u20138. It acknowledges,\nmoreover, that the Petition Clause protects personal\ngrievances addressed to the government, ante, at 13. But\nthat is an understatement\u2014rather like acknowledging\nthat the Speech Clause protects verbal expression. \u201c[T]he\nprimary responsibility of colonial assemblies was the\nsettlement of private disputes raised by petitions.\u201d Hig\nginson, A Short History of the Right to Petition Govern\nment for the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 145\n(1986). \u201c[T]he overwhelming majority of First Congress\npetitions presented private claims.\u201d 8 Documentary His\ntory of the First Federal Congress 1789\u20131791, p. xviii (K.\nBowling, W. DiGiacomantonio, & C. Bickford eds. 1998).\nThe Court nonetheless holds that, at least in public em\nployment cases, the Petition Clause and Speech Clause\nshould be treated identically, so that since the Speech\nClause does not prohibit retaliation against public em\nployees for speaking on matters of private concern, neither\ndoes the Petition Clause. The Court gives two reasons for\nthis: First, \u201c[a] different rule for each First Amendment\nclaim would . . . add to the complexity and expense of\ncompliance with the Constitution\u201d and \u201cwould provide a\nready means for public employees to circumvent the test\u2019s\nprotections,\u201d and second, \u201c[p]etitions to the government\n. . . assume an added dimension when they seek to ad\nvance political, social, or other ideas of interest to the\ncommunity as a whole.\u201d Ante, at 12\u201314.\n    Neither reason is persuasive. As to the former: The\ncomplexity of treating the Petition Clause and Speech\nClause separately is attributable to the inconsiderate\ndisregard for judicial convenience displayed by those who\nratified a First Amendment that included both provisions\nas separate constitutional rights. A plaintiff does not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nengage in pernicious \u201ccircumvention\u201d of our Speech\nClause precedents when he brings a claim premised on a\nseparate enumerated right to which those precedents are\ninapplicable.\n  As to the latter: Perhaps petitions on matters of public\nconcern do in some sense involve an \u201cadded dimension,\u201d\nbut that \u201cadded dimension\u201d does not obliterate what has\ntraditionally been the principal dimension of the Petition\nClause. The public-concern limitation makes sense in the\ncontext of the Speech Clause, because it is speech on mat\nters of public concern that lies \u201cwithin the core of First\nAmendment protection.\u201d Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agri\nculture, 553 U. S. 591, 600 (2008). The Speech Clause\n\u201chas its fullest and most urgent application to speech\nuttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe unique protection granted to political speech is\ngrounded in the history of the Speech Clause, which \u201cwas\nfashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the\nbringing about of political and social changes desired by\nthe people.\u201d Connick, supra, at 145 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  But the mere fact that we have a longstanding tradition\nof granting heightened protection to speech of public con\ncern does not suggest that a \u201cpublic concern\u201d requirement\nshould be written into other constitutional provisions. We\nwould not say that religious proselytizing is entitled to\nmore protection under the Free Exercise Clause than\nprivate religious worship because public proclamations are\n\u201ccore free exercise activity.\u201d Nor would we say that the\ndue process right to a neutral adjudicator is heightened in\nthe context of litigation of national importance because\nsuch litigation is somehow at the \u201ccore of the due process\nguarantee.\u201d Likewise, given that petitions to redress\nprivate grievances were such a high proportion of petitions\n6           BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nat the founding\u2014a proportion that is infinitely higher if\nlawsuits are considered to be petitions\u2014it is ahistorical to\nsay that petitions on matters of public concern constitute\n\u201ccore petitioning activity.\u201d In the Court\u2019s view, if Guar\nnieri had submitted a letter to one of the borough of\nDuryea\u2019s council members protesting a tax assessment\nthat he claimed was mistaken; and if the borough had\nfired him in retaliation for that petition; Guarnieri would\nhave no claim for a Petition Clause violation. That has to\nbe wrong. It takes no account of, and thus frustrates, the\nprincipal purpose of the Petition Clause.\n   The Court responds that \u201c[t]he proper scope and appli\ncation of the Petition Clause . . . cannot be determined\nmerely by tallying up petitions to the colonial legisla\ntures,\u201d ante, at 14, but that misses the point. The text of\nthe Petition Clause does not distinguish petitions of public\nconcern from petitions of private concern. Accordingly,\nthere should be no doctrinal distinction between them\nunless the history or tradition of the Petition Clause justi\nfies it. The mere fact that the Court can enumerate sev\neral historical petitions of public importance, ante, at 14\u2013\n16, does not establish such a tradition, given that peti\ntions for redress of private grievances vastly outnumbered\nthem. Indeed, the Court\u2019s holding is contrary to this\nCourt\u2019s historical treatment of the Petition Clause, assum\ning (as the Court believes) that the Clause embraces liti\ngation: We have decided innumerable cases establishing\nconstitutional rights with respect to litigation, and until\ntoday not a one of them has so much as hinted that litiga\ntion of public concern enjoys more of those rights than\nlitigation of private concern. The Court\u2019s belief in the\nsocial importance of public petitions, and its reminiscences\nof some of the public-petition greats of yesteryear, ibid., do\nnot justify the proclamation of special constitutional rights\nfor public petitions. It is the Constitution that establishes\nconstitutional rights, not the Justices\u2019 notions of what is\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

And there is no basis for believing that the Petition\nClause gives special protection to public petitions.\n   Rather than shoehorning the \u201cpublic concern\u201d doctrine\ninto a Clause where it does not fit, we should hold that\nthe Petition Clause protects public employees against re\ntaliation for filing petitions unless those petitions are ad\ndressed to the government in its capacity as the petition\ners\u2019 employer, rather than its capacity as their sovereign.\nAs the Court states, we have long held that \u201cgovernment\nhas significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citi\nzen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign\npower to bear on citizens at large.\u201d Ante, at 11\u201312 (quot\ning Engquist, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks\nomitted). To apply to the Petition Clause context what we\nhave said regarding the Speech Clause: When an em\nployee files a petition with the government in its capacity\nas his employer, he is not acting \u201cas [a] citize[n] for First\nAmendment purposes,\u201d because \u201cthere is no relevant\nanalogue to [petitions] by citizens who are not government\nemployees.\u201d Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 421, 423\u2013\n424 (2006). To be sure, the line between a petition ad\ndressed to government as the petitioner\u2019s employer and\none addressed to it as sovereign is not always clear, but it\nis no more fuzzy than the line between matters of private\nand matters of public concern.2 The criterion I suggest\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare,   e.g., Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v. Hansen, 381 F. 3d 917,\n927 (CA9 2004) (testimony concerning claim of employment discrimina\ntion by government contractor constituted matter of public concern\nbecause \u201c[l]itigation seeking to expose . . . wrongful governmental\nactivity is, by its very nature, a matter of public concern\u201d), with Padilla\nv. South Harrison R-II School Dist., 181 F. 3d 992, 997 (CA8 1999)\n(teacher\u2019s testimony approving sexual relationship between teacher and\nminor was matter of private concern because it \u201cdoes not relate to the\nteacher\u2019s legitimate disagreement with a school board\u2019s policies\u201d). And\ncompare, e.g., Voigt v. Savell, 70 F. 3d 1552, 1560 (CA9 1995) (speech\nregarding how judge handled two internal personnel matters was\n8              BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nwould largely resolve the legitimate practical concerns\nidentified by the Court, ante, at 10\u201312, while recognizing\nand giving effect to the difference between the Speech and\nPetition Clauses.\n   Under what I think to be the proper test, the Third\nCircuit judgment before us here should be reversed in part\nand affirmed in part. The portion of it upholding Guarni\neri\u2019s claim of retaliation for having filed his union griev\nance must be reversed. A union grievance is the epitome\nof a petition addressed to the government in its capacity\nas the petitioner\u2019s employer. No analogous petitions to the\ngovernment could have been filed by private citizens, who\nare not even permitted to avail themselves of Guarnieri\u2019s\nunion grievance procedure. Contrariwise, the portion of\nthe judgment upholding Guarnieri\u2019s claim of retaliation\nfor having filed his \u00a71983 claim must be affirmed. Given\nthat Guarnieri was not an employee of the Federal Gov\nernment, it is impossible to say that the \u00a71983 claim was\naddressed to government in its capacity as his employer. I\nthink it clear that retaliating against a state employee for\nwriting a letter to his Congressman about his state job\nwould run afoul of the Petition Clause. Assuming that the\n\u00a71983 lawsuit should be treated like a letter to a Con\ngressman for Petition Clause purposes\u2014a proposition\nwhich, I again emphasize, is doubtful, but which the par\nties do not dispute in this case\u2014retaliation for having filed\nhis lawsuit also violates the Clause.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmatter of public concern because \u201c[t]he public has an interest in know\ning whether the court treats its job applicants fairly\u201d), with Maggio v.\nSipple, 211 F. 3d 1346, 1353 (CA11 2000) (testimony at hearing con\ncerning employee grievance was matter of private concern because it\ndid \u201cnot allege . . . fraud or corruption in [defendant\u2019s] implementation\nof its personnel policies and appeal procedures\u201d).\n</pre>",
