Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n          CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u2013235.      Argued March 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nRespondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX\n  Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating\n  hand injury while switching railroad cars. He filed suit under the\n  Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable\n  for employees\u2019 injuries \u201cresulting in whole or in part from [carrier]\n  negligence.\u201d 45 U. S. C. \u00a751. McBride alleged that CSX negligently\n  (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to\n  train him to operate that equipment. A verdict for McBride would be\n  in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX\u2019s\n  negligence \u201ccaused or contributed to\u201d his injury. The court declined\n  CSX\u2019s request for additional charges requiring McBride to \u201cshow that\n  . . . [CSX\u2019s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury\u201d and de\n  fining \u201cproximate cause\u201d as \u201cany cause which, in natural or probable\n  sequence, produced the injury complained of.\u201d Instead, relying on\n  Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the\n  Seventh Circuit\u2019s pattern FELA instruction: \u201cDefendant \u2018caused or\n  contributed to\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s injury if Defendant\u2019s negligence played a\n  part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d The jury\n  returned a verdict for McBride.\n      On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on\n  proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a \u201cdirect relation\n  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d The\n  appeals court, however, approved the District Court\u2019s instruction and\n  affirmed its judgment for McBride. Because Rogers had relaxed the\n  proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an in\n  struction that simply paraphrased Rogers\u2019 language could not be de\n  clared erroneous.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.\n            JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to all but Part III\u2013A, concluding, in accord with FELA\u2019s text\n  and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate\n  courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock \u201cproximate cause\u201d stan\n  dards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The\n  charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress\n  employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad \u201ccaused or con\n  tributed to\u201d a railroad worker\u2019s injury \u201cif [the railroad\u2019s] negligence\n  played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d\n  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation\n  in FELA cases. Pp. 4\u201314, 16\u201319.\n     (a) CSX\u2019s interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (1) Given FELA\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d causation language, Urie v. Thompson,\n  337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress\u2019 \u201chumanitarian\u201d and \u201cremedial\n  goal[s]\u201d in enacting the statute, FELA\u2019s causation standard is \u201cre\n  laxed\u201d compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation,\n  Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542\u2013543.\n  Rogers described that relaxed standard as \u201cwhether the proofs justify\n  with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,\n  even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which dam\n  ages are sought.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506. Because the District Court\u2019s in\n  struction tracked Rogers\u2019 language, the instruction was plainly\n  proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition\n  applicable under FELA. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\n  U. S. 164, 172. CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly\n  focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of\n  \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Drawing largely on Justice Souter\u2019s concurrence\n  in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges\n  that Rogers\u2019 \u201cany part . . . in producing the injury\u201d test displaced only\n  common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contribu\n  tory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the req\n  uisite directness of a cause. Pp. 4\u20136.\n     (2) In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his\n  employer\u2019s railroad tracks. A passing train fanned the flames, which\n  spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing. Attempting\n  to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the cul\n  vert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501\u2013503. The state\n  court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme\n  Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to\n  maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault\n  because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. As the fire \u201cwas\n  something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the in\n  cline of the gravel,\u201d the court found that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s injury was not the\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nnatural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.\u201d\nIbid. This Court reversed. FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incor\nporate any traditional common-law formulation of \u201cproximate causa\ntion[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant\u2019s negli\ngence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\u201d Id., at 506.\nWhether the railroad\u2019s negligent act was the \u201cimmediate reason\u201d for\nthe fall, the Court added, was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Id., at 503. The Court\nthen announced its \u201cany part . . . in producing the injury\u201d test, id., at\n506.\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of\nFELA\u2019s causation standard. The State Supreme Court there ac\nknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but con\nsidered the respondent railroad\u2019s part too indirect to establish the\nrequisite causation. That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in\nRogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.\nThe interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory his\ntory, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern\nPacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523\u2013524, this Court\u2019s subsequent deci\nsions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S.\n521, 523\u2013524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews\nFELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and\nscholars. This understanding of Rogers \u201chas been accepted as settled\nlaw for several decades.\u201d IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32. To\ndiscard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.\nPp. 6\u201312.\n   (b) CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers \u201cany part\u201d instruction\nopens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability\non the basis of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. A half century\u2019s experience with\nRogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one\ntrial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward\naward.\n          FELA\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language is straightforward.\n\u201c[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of\n[FELA] negligence,\u201d Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S.\n108, 117 (emphasis added). If negligence is proved, however, and is\nshown to have \u201cplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury,\u201d Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in\ndamages even if \u201c \u2018the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it\noccurred\u2019 \u201d was not \u201c[p]robable\u201d or \u201cforeseeable.\u201d Gallick, 372 U. S.,\nat 120\u2013121, and n. 8. Properly instructed on negligence and causa\ntion, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no war\nrant to award damages in far out \u201cbut for\u201d scenarios, and judges\n4                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

S. C. \u00a751 et seq. FELA renders rail\u00ad\nroads liable for employees\u2019 injuries or deaths \u201cresulting in\nwhole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\u201d \u00a751. In accord\nwith the text and purpose of the Act, this Court\u2019s decision\nin Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),\nand the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we con\u00ad\nclude that the Act does not incorporate \u201cproximate cause\u201d\nstandards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort\nactions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, sim\u00ad\nply tracks the language Congress employed, informing\njuries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a\nplaintiff employee\u2019s injury if the railroad\u2019s negligence\nplayed any part in bringing about the injury.\n                        I\n  Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III\u2013A of this opinion.\n2               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nengineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which\noperates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12,\n2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be\u00ad\ntween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.\nThe run involved frequent starts and stops to add and\nremove individual rail cars, a process known as \u201cswitch\u00ad\ning.\u201d The train McBride was to operate had an unusual\nengine configuration: two \u201cwide-body\u201d engines followed\nby three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested\nthat the configuration was unsafe, because switching with\nheavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand\u00ad\noperated independent brake. But he was told to take the\ntrain as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured\nhis hand while using the independent brake. Despite two\nsurgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re\u00ad\ngained full use of the hand.\n  Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com\u00ad\nmenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that\nCSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him\nto use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed\nto train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a\u201326a. A\nverdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court\ninstructed, if the jury found that CSX \u201cwas negligent\u201d and\nthat the \u201cnegligence caused or contributed to\u201d McBride\u2019s\ninjury. Id., at 23a.\n  CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to\ngive. One of the rejected instructions would have required\n\u201cthe plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant\u2019s negligence\nwas a proximate cause of the injury.\u201d Id., at 34a. Another\nwould have defined \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean \u201cany cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of,\u201d with the qualification that a proxi\u00ad\nmate cause \u201cneed not be the only cause, nor the last or\nnearest cause.\u201d Id., at 32a.\n  Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquested, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s pattern instruction for\nFELA cases, which reads:\n    \u201cDefendant \u2018caused or contributed to\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s injury\n    if Defendant\u2019s negligence played a part\u2014no matter\n    how small\u2014in bringing about the injury. The mere\n    fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean\n    that the injury was caused by negligence.\u201d Id., at 31a.\nFor this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352\nU. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,\nsetting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that\namount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to\nplaintiff\u2019s negligence. App. 29a.\n   CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob\u00ad\njection to the failure to instruct on \u201cproximate cause.\u201d\nBefore the appellate court, CSX \u201cmaintain[ed] that the\ncorrect definition of proximate causation is a \u2018direct rela\u00ad\ntion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.\u2019 \u201d 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes\nv. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.\n258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con\u00ad\ntended, might have found that the chain of causation was\ntoo indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe\nbecause of its propensity to cause crashes during switch\u00ad\ning, not because of any risk to an engineer\u2019s hands. Brief\nfor Defendant-Appellant in No. 08\u20133557 (CA7), pp. 49\u201352.\n   The Court of Appeals approved the District Court\u2019s\ninstruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the\njury\u2019s verdict. Rogers had \u201crelaxed the proximate cause\nrequirement\u201d in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con\u00ad\ncluded, a view of Rogers \u201cechoed by every other court of\nappeals.\u201d 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a\nhandful of state courts \u201cstill appl[ied] traditional formula\u00ad\ntions of proximate cause in FELA cases,\u201d id., at 404, n. 7,\nthe Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous\n4              CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

Enacted that same\nyear in an effort to \u201cshif[t] part of the human overhead of\ndoing business from employees to their employers,\u201d Gott\nshall, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted), FELA prescribes:\n       \u201cEvery common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li\u00ad\n    able in damages to any person suffering injury while\n    he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or\n    death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence\n    of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car\u00ad\n    rier . . . .\u201d 45 U. S. C. \u00a751 (emphasis added).\n  Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects:\nRailroads are liable only to their employees, and only for\ninjuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA\u2019s\nlanguage on causation, however, \u201cis as broad as could be\nframed.\u201d Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.

S., at 542\u2013543. In our 1957 decision in\nRogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:\n    \u201cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply\n    whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion\n    that employer negligence played any part, even the\n    slightest, in producing the injury or death for which\n    damages are sought.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506.\n    As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the\nDistrict Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for\nMcBride if \u201c[railroad] negligence played a part\u2014no matter\nhow small\u2014in bringing about the injury,\u201d tracked the\nlanguage of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of\ncausation applicable under FELA, that instruction was\nplainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,\n491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (\u201cConsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\n. . . .\u201d). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the\nrailroad contends that lower courts have overread that\nopinion. In CSX\u2019s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9\u2013\n10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not\ntouch, concern, much less displace common-law formula\u00ad\ntions of \u201cproximate cause.\u201d\n    Understanding this argument requires some back\u00ad\nground. The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is shorthand for a\nconcept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should\ngive rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of\nTorts \u00a742, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). \u201cWhat we . . . mean by the word \u2018proximate,\u2019 \u201d one\nnoted jurist has explained, is simply this: \u201c[B]ecause of\nconvenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,\n6                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events\nbeyond a certain point.\u201d Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,\n248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,\ndissenting). Common-law \u201cproximate cause\u201d formulations\nvaried, and were often both constricted and difficult to\ncomprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73\u201377, 812\u2013813\n(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre\u00ad\ncluding recovery in the event of any \u201cintervening\u201d cause or\nany contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability\nif a \u201cproximate cause\u201d was not the sole proximate cause.\nProsser and Keeton \u00a765, p. 452 (noting \u201ctendency . . . to\nlook for some single, principal, dominant, \u2018proximate\u2019\ncause of every injury\u201d). Many used definitions resembling\nthose CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the\nCourt of Appeals. See supra, at 2\u20133 (CSX proposed key\nwords \u201cnatural or probable\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d to describe required\nrelationship between injury and alleged negligent con\u00ad\nduct); Prosser and Keeton \u00a743, pp. 282\u2013283.\n   Drawing largely on Justice Souter\u2019s concurring opinion\nin Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173\n(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers \u201cany part\u201d test\ndisplaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for\ninjuries involving contributory negligence or other \u201cmulti\u00ad\nple causes.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).1 Rogers \u201cdid not address the requisite\ndirectness of a cause,\u201d CSX argues, hence that question\ncontinues to be governed by restrictive common-law for\u00ad\nmulations. Ibid.\n                          B\n  To evaluate CSX\u2019s argument, we turn first to the facts of\nRogers. The employee in that case was injured while\nburning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same\n\nfor railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said\nnothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164\u2013165.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndant\u2019s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the\nflames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a\nculvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to\nescape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel\ncovering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352\nU. S., at 501\u2013503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a\nverdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail\u00ad\ning to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the\nemployee was at fault because of his lack of attention to\nthe spreading fire. Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d\n467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire \u201cwas something extraordi\u00ad\nnary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of\nthe gravel,\u201d the court felt \u201cobliged to say [that] plaintiff\u2019s\ninjury was not the natural and probable consequence of\nany negligence of defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   We held that the jury\u2019s verdict should not have been\nupset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion, we condemned both. First, the\ncourt erred in concluding that the employee\u2019s negligence\nwas the \u201csole\u201d cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably\nfound that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 504\u2013505. Second, the court erred insofar as it\nheld that the railroad\u2019s negligence was not a sufficient\ncause unless it was the more \u201cprobable\u201d cause of the in\u00ad\njury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate\nany traditional common-law formulation of \u201cproximate\ncausation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the\ndefendant\u2019s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing\ncause of injury.\u201d Id., at 506. Whether the railroad\u2019s negli\u00ad\ngent act was the \u201cimmediate reason\u201d for the fall, we added,\nwas \u201can irrelevant consideration.\u201d Id., at 503. We then\nannounced the \u201cany part\u201d test, id., at 506, and reiterated it\nseveral times. See, e.g., id., at 507 (\u201cnarro[w]\u201d and \u201csingle\ninquiry\u201d is whether \u201cnegligence of the employer played\nany part at all\u201d in bringing about the injury); id., at 508\n8                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(FELA case \u201crarely presents more than the single question\nwhether negligence of the employer played any part, how\u00ad\never small, in the injury\u201d).2\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive state\u00ad\nment of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Mis\u00ad\nsouri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA\ninjury might have multiple causes, including railroad\nnegligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at\n472 (reciting FELA\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language). But\nthe railroad\u2019s part, according to the state court, was too\nindirect, not sufficiently \u201cnatural and probable,\u201d to estab\u00ad\nlish the requisite causation. Ibid. That is the very reason\u00ad\ning the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning\nCSX asks us to resurrect.\n   Our understanding is informed by the statutory history\nand precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was\nenacted, the \u201charsh and technical\u201d rules of state common\nlaw had \u201cmade recovery difficult or even impossible\u201d for in\u00ad\njured railroad workers. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Vir\nginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3 (1964). \u201c[D]issatisfied with\nthe [railroad\u2019s] common-law duty,\u201d Congress sought to \u201csup\u00ad\nplan[t] that duty with [FELA\u2019s] far more drastic duty of\npaying damages for injury or death at work due in\nwhole or in part to the employer\u2019s negligence.\u201d Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 507. Yet, Rogers observed, the Missouri court\nand other lower courts continued to ignore FELA\u2019s \u201csig\u00ad\nnifican[t]\u201d departures from the \u201cordinary common-law\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In face of Rogers\u2019 repeated admonition that the \u201cany part . . . in pro\u00ad\n\nducing the injury\u201d test was the single test for causation under FELA,\nthe dissent speculates that Rogers was simply making a veiled ref\u00ad\nerence to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, i.e.,\nallowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was \u201cslight\u201d\nwhile the railroad\u2019s was \u201cgross.\u201d Post, at 9\u201310. That is not what Rogers\nconveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that \u201cthe test of a jury case\n[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnegligence\u201d scheme, to reinsert common-law formulations\nof causation involving \u201cprobabilities,\u201d and consequently to\n\u201cdeprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.\u201d\nId., at 507, 509\u2013510. Aiming to end lower court disre-\ngard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly\ncalled the \u201cany part\u201d test the \u201csingle\u201d inquiry determining\ncausation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis\nadded). In short, CSX\u2019s argument that the Rogers stan\u00ad\ndard concerns only division of responsibility among multi\u00ad\nple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the\nthrust of our decision in that case.\n   Tellingly, in announcing the \u201cany part . . . in producing\nthe injury\u201d test, Rogers cited Coray v. Southern Pacific\nCo., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that\nFELA had parted from traditional common-law formula\u00ad\ntions of causation. What qualified as a \u201cproximate\u201d or\nlegally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex\u00ad\nplained, was determined by the statutory phrase \u201cresult\u00ad\ning in whole or in part,\u201d which Congress \u201cselected . . . to fix\nliability\u201d in language that was \u201csimple and direct.\u201d Id., at\n524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was\nincompatible with \u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d that common-law\ncourts employed to determine whether a particular cause\nwas sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to constitute a proximate\ncause. Id., at 523\u2013524.3\n   Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent, while recognizing \u201cthe variety of formulations\u201d courts\nhave employed to define \u201cproximate cause,\u201d post, at 2, does not say\nwhich of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA\ncases. We regard the phrase \u201cnegligence played a part\u2014no matter how\nsmall,\u201d see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with \u201cnegligence\nplayed any part, even the slightest,\u201d see id., at 506, and the phrase \u201cin\nproducing the injury\u201d as synonymous with the phrase \u201cin bringing\nabout the injury.\u201d We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\ninstruction and the \u201cany part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury\u201d formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in\ncontrast, are hardly synonymous.\n10                CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nannounced a general standard for causation in FELA\ncases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involv-\ning multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day\nRogers was announced, we applied its \u201cany part\u201d instruc\u00ad\ntion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the\ndirectness or foreseeability of the connection between the\ncarrier\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. See Fergu\nson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523\u2013\n524 (1957) (plurality opinion).\n   A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff\nproper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,\nthe railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing \u201cdead and\ndecayed rats and pigeons,\u201d to accumulate near its right-of\u00ad\nway; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee\nsuffered an insect bite that became infected and required\namputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court\nhad concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation\nto warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at\n112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers\nannounced. Id., at 116\u2013117, 120\u2013121. See also Crane v.\nCedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166\u2013167\n(1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who \u201cis not\nrequired to prove common-law proximate causation but\nonly that his injury resulted \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 from the\nrailroad\u2019s violation,\u201d with suit by nonemployee, where\n\u201cdefinition of causation . . .

See,\ne.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must\nbe \u201cthe natural and probable consequence of the negligence\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the \u201cnatural or probable\u201d charge\nthat CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a\npre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In reliance on Rogers, every Court of Appeals that re\u00ad\nviews judgments in FELA cases has approved jury in\u00ad\nstructions on causation identical or substantively equiva\u00ad\nlent to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s instruction.5 Each appellate\ncourt has rejected common-law formulations of proximate\ncause of the kind CSX requested in this case. See supra,\nat 2\u20133. The current model federal instruction, recognizing\nthat the \u201cFELA causation standard is distinct from the\nusual proximate cause standard,\u201d reads:\n     \u201cThe fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an\n     injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from\n     the negligence of the railroad or its employees or\n     agents. In other words, did such negligence play any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common\u00ad\nlaw formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.\n535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence \u201ccon\u00ad\ntribute[d] \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 to cause the death\u201d); Coray v. South-\nern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law\n\u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d concerning the term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d and ap\u00ad\nproving use of \u201csimple and direct\u201d statutory language). We rely on\nRogers not because \u201ctime begins in 1957,\u201d post, at 7, but because Rogers\nstated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad\u2019s\n\u201cnegligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain\u00ad\ntiff \u2019s] injury\u201d? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the\narray of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers\ninstruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it\nfor over 50 years.

The dissent shares\nthese fears. Post, at 5\u20136, 15\u201316. But a half century\u2019s\nexperience with Rogers gives us little cause for concern:\nCSX\u2019s briefs did not identify even one trial in which the\ninstruction generated an absurd or untoward award.9 Nor\nhas the dissent managed to uncover such a case. Post, at\n13\u201314 (citing no actual case but conjuring up images of\nfalling pianos and spilled coffee).\n   While some courts have said that Rogers eliminated the\nconcept of proximate cause in FELA cases,10 we think it\n\u201cmore accurate . . . to recognize that Rogers describes the\ntest for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.\u201d\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 178 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in\njudgment). That understanding was expressed by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Pressed on this point at oral argument, CSX directed us to two cases\n\ncited by its amicus. In Richards v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 330 F. 3d\n428, 431, 437 (CA6 2003), a defective brake malfunctioned en route,\nand the employee was injured while inspecting underneath the train to\nlocate the problem; the Sixth Circuit sent the case to a jury.

E. 2d\n236, 238\u2013239 (2004), the employee was injured while replacing a\ncoupling device that fell to the ground because of a negligently absent\npin; the court upheld a jury award. In our view, the causal link in\nthese cases is hardly farfetched; in fact, in both, the lower courts\nobserved that the evidence did not show mere \u201cbut for\u201d causation.

S., at 524, the Rogers instruction uses the everyday\nwords contained in the statute itself. Jurors can compre\u00ad\nhend those words and apply them in light of their ex\u00ad\nperience and common sense. Unless and until Congress\norders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an\ninstruction tied to FELA\u2019s text, long employed by lower\ncourts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable.\n                              A\n   As we have noted, see supra, at 5\u20136, the phrase \u201cproxi\u00ad\nmate cause\u201d is shorthand for the policy-based judgment\nthat not all factual causes contributing to an injury should\nbe legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Keeton explain:\n\u201cIn a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go\nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to\nthe dawn of human events, and beyond.\u201d \u00a741, p. 264. To\nprevent \u201cinfinite liability,\u201d ibid., courts and legislatures\nappropriately place limits on the chain of causation that\nmay support recovery on any particular claim.\n   The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d itself is hardly essential to\nthe imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously\nconfusing. See, e.g., Prosser and Keeton \u00a742, p. 273 (\u201cThe\nword \u2019proximate\u2019 is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who\nin his time committed other sins. . . . It is an unfortunate\nword, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the\nfactor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason\n\u2018legal cause\u2019 or perhaps even \u2018responsible cause\u2019 would be a\nmore appropriate term.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\n   And the lack of consensus on any one definition of\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d is manifest.

In light of the potential of\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is\nnot surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts avoided the term altogether.

See Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), 25 Harv. L. Rev. 223, 235\n(1912).\n                              B\n   FELA\u2019s language is straightforward: railroads are made\nanswerable in damages for an employee\u2019s \u201cinjury or death\nresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\u201d 45\nU. S. C. \u00a751. The argument for importing into FELA\u2019s text\n\u201cprevious judicial definitions or dicta\u201d originating in non\u00ad\nstatutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends\nhow foreseeability figures in FELA cases.\n   \u201c[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d we clarified in\nGallick, is indeed \u201can essential ingredient of [FELA] neg\nligence.\u201d 372 U.

The jury,\ntherefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier \u201cfai[l] to\nobserve that degree of care which people of ordinary pru\u00ad\ndence and sagacity would use under the same or similar\ncircumstances[?]\u201d Id., at 118.

But under\nRogers and the pattern instructions based on Rogers, the jury must find\nthat defendant\u2019s negligence in fact \u201cplayed a part\u2014no matter how\nsmall\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d See supra, at 2\u20133, 11\u201312 (Sev\u00ad\nenth Circuit pattern instruction and model federal instructions).\n18                CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

See also supra, at 13 (Rogers has generated no\nextravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions).\n  In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA\u2019s\nlimitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk\nof exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see supra, at 4,\nthe statute confines the universe of compensable injuries\nto those sustained by employees, during employment. \u00a751.\nHence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases.\nAnd the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear\nonly a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely,\nthose occurring outside the workplace.14\n  There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the \u201cin\nnatural or probable sequence\u201d charge sought by CSX\nwould mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiff\u2019s injury\nmust probably (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) follow from the\nrailroad\u2019s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA\u2019s\n\u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d language would be blunted.\nRailroad negligence would \u201cprobably\u201d cause a worker\u2019s in\u00ad\njury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to\nthe injury, not merely a contributor in any part.\n                       *      *    *\n  For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to\nrefuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause termi\u00ad\nnology. Juries in such cases are properly instructed that a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 CSX observes, as does the dissent, post, at 4, that we have applied\n\ntraditional notions of proximate causation under the RICO, antitrust,\nand securities fraud statutes. But those statutes cover broader classes\nof potential injuries and complainants. And none assign liability in\nlanguage akin to FELA\u2019s \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d standard. \u00a751\n(emphasis added). See Holmes v.

This even though we have held that\nFELA generally follows the common law, unless the Act\nexpressly provides otherwise; even though FELA expressly\nabrogated common law rules in four other respects, but\nsaid nothing about proximate cause; and even though our\nown cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA, repeat\u00ad\nedly recognized that proximate cause was required for\nrecovery under that statute.\n   The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar ele\u00ad\nment of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an ele\u00ad\nment \u201cgenerally thought to be a necessary limitation on\nliability,\u201d Exxon Co., U.

The Court\u2019s theory seems to be that\nthe words \u201cin whole or in part\u201d signal a departure from the\nhistoric requirement of proximate cause. But those words\nserved a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an\nimportant departure from a common law principle, but it\nwas the principle of contributory negligence\u2014not proxi\u00ad\nmate cause.\n   As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory\nnegligence; the \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language simply re\u00ad\nflected the fact that the railroad would remain liable\neven if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 170. The Congress that was so clear\nwhen it was abolishing common law limits on recovery\nelsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental\nprinciple of proximate cause in the oblique manner the\nCourt suggests. \u201c[I]f Congress had intended such a sea\nchange\u201d in negligence principles \u201cit would have said so\nclearly.\u201d Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior\nUniv. v.

In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA\u2019s\nelimination of the common law contributory negligence\nrule.

We noted that \u201c[c]ommon experi\u00ad\nence teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames\nof a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames\nand smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the\ndanger.\u201d Ibid. In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we described\u2014in familiar terms\u2014sufficient evi\u00ad\ndence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the\nrailroad\u2019s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers\u2019s\ninjury regardless of whether \u201cthe immediate reason\u201d why\nRogers slipped was the railroad\u2019s negligence in permitting\ngravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   Rogers thereby clarified that, under a statute in which\nemployer and employee could both be proximate causes of\nan injury, a railroad\u2019s negligence need not be the sole or\nlast cause in order to be proximate. That is an application\nof proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111\n(\u201ca cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to\nbe considered its effective legal cause without by any\nmeans being the nearest or most proximate to the causes\nwhich contribute of the injury\u201d); 1 D.

The question was simply\nwhether \u201cemployer negligence played any part, even the\nslightest, in producing the injury.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIt does not\nmatter,\u201d we continued, \u201cthat, from the evidence, the jury\nmay also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute\nthe result to other causes, including the employee\u2019s con\ntributory negligence.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Court today takes the \u201cany part, even the slightest\u201d\nlanguage out of context and views it as a rejection of proxi\u00ad\nmate cause. But Rogers was talking about contributory\nnegligence\u2014it said so\u2014and the language it chose confirms\njust that. \u201cSlight\u201d negligence was familiar usage in this\ncontext. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed\njust two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from con\u00ad\ntributory to comparative negligence. It provided that \u201cthe\nfact that the employee may have been guilty of contribu\u00ad\ntory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib\u00ad\nutory negligence was slight and that of the employer\nwas gross in comparison.\u201d Act of June 11, 1906, \u00a72, 34\nStat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway\nstop on the road from contributory to pure comparative\nnegligence, again using the term \u201cslight.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a7201,\nat 503 (\u201cOne earlier [version of comparative fault] . . .\nallowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff\u2019s\nnegligence was slight and the defendant\u2019s gross. . . .

See\nSorrell, 549 U.

See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as \u201cthe\ntest of a jury case\u201d (emphasis added)). Rogers did not set\nforth a novel standard for proximate cause\u2014much less an\ninstruction designed to guide jurors in determining causa\u00ad\ntion. Indeed, the trial court in Rogers used the term\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d in its jury instruction and directed the\njury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries\n\u201cwere not directly . . . caused by\u201d the railroad\u2019s negligence.\nId., at 505, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion quoted that instruction, ibid., but \u201ctook no issue\nwith [it] in this respect,\u201d Sorrell, supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   A few of our cases have characterized Rogers as hold-\ning that \u201ca relaxed standard of causation applies under\nFELA.\u201d Gottshall, 512 U.

FELA did, of course, change common law\nrules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a\nrailroad\u2019s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause\nof an injury. See Gottshall, supra, at 542\u2013543 (\u201cCongress\ndid away with several common-law tort defenses . . . .\nSpecifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of con\u00ad\ntributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli\u00ad\ngence\u201d).

Foreseeability as a test for\nproximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability\nhas, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But\nthat is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits\nthe foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was\nnegligent in the first place.\n   The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a\ndefendant\u2019s negligence depends on \u201cwhat a reasonably\nprudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a\npotential for harm.\u201d 5 L.

That\u2019s all fine and good when a defendant\u2019s negligence\nresults directly in the plaintiff\u2019s injury (nevermind that no\n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d instruction was given in this\ncase). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it\nfalls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent\nand could have foreseen that the piano would hit some\u00ad\none\u2014as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court\u2019s test\narises when the negligence does not directly produce the\ninjury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the side\u00ad\nwalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling\ndown the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen\nhave placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was\nI negligent in dropping the piano because I could have\nforeseen \u201ca mishap and injury,\u201d ante, at 17 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my\nnegligence cause \u201c[the] mishap and injury\u201d that resulted?\nIt depends on what is meant by cause.

And if the jury is simply supposed\nto intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain\nof causation\u2014and that \u201cbut for\u201d cause is not enough\u2014why\nhide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if\nthe Court intends \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d to be a kind\nof poorman\u2019s proximate cause, then where does the Court\nfind that requirement in the test Rogers\u2014or FELA\u2014pre\u00ad\nscribes? Could it be derived from the common law?\n    Where does \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d as the sole protec\u00ad\ntion against limitless liability run out of steam?

MCBRIDE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10\u2013235.      Argued March 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nRespondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX\n  Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating\n  hand injury while switching railroad cars. He filed suit under the\n  Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable\n  for employees\u2019 injuries \u201cresulting in whole or in part from [carrier]\n  negligence.\u201d 45 U. S. C. \u00a751. McBride alleged that CSX negligently\n  (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to\n  train him to operate that equipment. A verdict for McBride would be\n  in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX\u2019s\n  negligence \u201ccaused or contributed to\u201d his injury. The court declined\n  CSX\u2019s request for additional charges requiring McBride to \u201cshow that\n  . . . [CSX\u2019s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury\u201d and de\n  fining \u201cproximate cause\u201d as \u201cany cause which, in natural or probable\n  sequence, produced the injury complained of.\u201d Instead, relying on\n  Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the\n  Seventh Circuit\u2019s pattern FELA instruction: \u201cDefendant \u2018caused or\n  contributed to\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s injury if Defendant\u2019s negligence played a\n  part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d The jury\n  returned a verdict for McBride.\n      On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on\n  proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a \u201cdirect relation\n  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d The\n  appeals court, however, approved the District Court\u2019s instruction and\n  affirmed its judgment for McBride. Because Rogers had relaxed the\n  proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an in\n  struction that simply paraphrased Rogers\u2019 language could not be de\n  clared erroneous.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.\n            JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to all but Part III\u2013A, concluding, in accord with FELA\u2019s text\n  and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate\n  courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock \u201cproximate cause\u201d stan\n  dards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The\n  charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress\n  employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad \u201ccaused or con\n  tributed to\u201d a railroad worker\u2019s injury \u201cif [the railroad\u2019s] negligence\n  played a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d\n  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation\n  in FELA cases. Pp. 4\u201314, 16\u201319.\n     (a) CSX\u2019s interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (1) Given FELA\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d causation language, Urie v. Thompson,\n  337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress\u2019 \u201chumanitarian\u201d and \u201cremedial\n  goal[s]\u201d in enacting the statute, FELA\u2019s causation standard is \u201cre\n  laxed\u201d compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation,\n  Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542\u2013543.\n  Rogers described that relaxed standard as \u201cwhether the proofs justify\n  with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,\n  even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which dam\n  ages are sought.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506. Because the District Court\u2019s in\n  struction tracked Rogers\u2019 language, the instruction was plainly\n  proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition\n  applicable under FELA. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\n  U. S. 164, 172. CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly\n  focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of\n  \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Drawing largely on Justice Souter\u2019s concurrence\n  in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges\n  that Rogers\u2019 \u201cany part . . . in producing the injury\u201d test displaced only\n  common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contribu\n  tory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the req\n  uisite directness of a cause. Pp. 4\u20136.\n     (2) In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his\n  employer\u2019s railroad tracks. A passing train fanned the flames, which\n  spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing. Attempting\n  to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the cul\n  vert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501\u2013503. The state\n  court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme\n  Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to\n  maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault\n  because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. As the fire \u201cwas\n  something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the in\n  cline of the gravel,\u201d the court found that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s injury was not the\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nnatural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.\u201d\nIbid. This Court reversed. FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incor\nporate any traditional common-law formulation of \u201cproximate causa\ntion[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant\u2019s negli\ngence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.\u201d Id., at 506.\nWhether the railroad\u2019s negligent act was the \u201cimmediate reason\u201d for\nthe fall, the Court added, was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Id., at 503. The Court\nthen announced its \u201cany part . . . in producing the injury\u201d test, id., at\n506.\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of\nFELA\u2019s causation standard. The State Supreme Court there ac\nknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but con\nsidered the respondent railroad\u2019s part too indirect to establish the\nrequisite causation. That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in\nRogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.\nThe interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory his\ntory, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern\nPacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523\u2013524, this Court\u2019s subsequent deci\nsions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S.\n521, 523\u2013524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews\nFELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and\nscholars. This understanding of Rogers \u201chas been accepted as settled\nlaw for several decades.\u201d IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32. To\ndiscard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.\nPp. 6\u201312.\n   (b) CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers \u201cany part\u201d instruction\nopens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability\non the basis of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. A half century\u2019s experience with\nRogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one\ntrial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward\naward.\n          FELA\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language is straightforward.\n\u201c[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of\n[FELA] negligence,\u201d Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S.\n108, 117 (emphasis added). If negligence is proved, however, and is\nshown to have \u201cplayed any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury,\u201d Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in\ndamages even if \u201c \u2018the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it\noccurred\u2019 \u201d was not \u201c[p]robable\u201d or \u201cforeseeable.\u201d Gallick, 372 U. S.,\nat 120\u2013121, and n. 8. Properly instructed on negligence and causa\ntion, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no war\nrant to award damages in far out \u201cbut for\u201d scenarios, and judges\n4                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

MCBRIDE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nengineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which\noperates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12,\n2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be\u00ad\ntween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.\nThe run involved frequent starts and stops to add and\nremove individual rail cars, a process known as \u201cswitch\u00ad\ning.\u201d The train McBride was to operate had an unusual\nengine configuration: two \u201cwide-body\u201d engines followed\nby three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested\nthat the configuration was unsafe, because switching with\nheavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand\u00ad\noperated independent brake. But he was told to take the\ntrain as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured\nhis hand while using the independent brake. Despite two\nsurgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re\u00ad\ngained full use of the hand.\n  Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com\u00ad\nmenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that\nCSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him\nto use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed\nto train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a\u201326a. A\nverdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court\ninstructed, if the jury found that CSX \u201cwas negligent\u201d and\nthat the \u201cnegligence caused or contributed to\u201d McBride\u2019s\ninjury. Id., at 23a.\n  CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to\ngive. One of the rejected instructions would have required\n\u201cthe plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant\u2019s negligence\nwas a proximate cause of the injury.\u201d Id., at 34a. Another\nwould have defined \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean \u201cany cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of,\u201d with the qualification that a proxi\u00ad\nmate cause \u201cneed not be the only cause, nor the last or\nnearest cause.\u201d Id., at 32a.\n  Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The mere\n    fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean\n    that the injury was caused by negligence.\u201d Id., at 31a.\nFor this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352\nU. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,\nsetting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that\namount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to\nplaintiff\u2019s negligence. App. 29a.\n   CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob\u00ad\njection to the failure to instruct on \u201cproximate cause.\u201d\nBefore the appellate court, CSX \u201cmaintain[ed] that the\ncorrect definition of proximate causation is a \u2018direct rela\u00ad\ntion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.\u2019 \u201d 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes\nv. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.\n258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con\u00ad\ntended, might have found that the chain of causation was\ntoo indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe\nbecause of its propensity to cause crashes during switch\u00ad\ning, not because of any risk to an engineer\u2019s hands.

S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted), FELA prescribes:\n       \u201cEvery common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li\u00ad\n    able in damages to any person suffering injury while\n    he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or\n    death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence\n    of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car\u00ad\n    rier . . . .\u201d 45 U.

S., at 542\u2013543. In our 1957 decision in\nRogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:\n    \u201cUnder [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply\n    whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion\n    that employer negligence played any part, even the\n    slightest, in producing the injury or death for which\n    damages are sought.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506.\n    As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the\nDistrict Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for\nMcBride if \u201c[railroad] negligence played a part\u2014no matter\nhow small\u2014in bringing about the injury,\u201d tracked the\nlanguage of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of\ncausation applicable under FELA, that instruction was\nplainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,\n491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (\u201cConsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\n. . . .\u201d). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the\nrailroad contends that lower courts have overread that\nopinion. In CSX\u2019s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9\u2013\n10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not\ntouch, concern, much less displace common-law formula\u00ad\ntions of \u201cproximate cause.\u201d\n    Understanding this argument requires some back\u00ad\nground. The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is shorthand for a\nconcept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should\ngive rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of\nTorts \u00a742, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). \u201cWhat we . . . mean by the word \u2018proximate,\u2019 \u201d one\nnoted jurist has explained, is simply this: \u201c[B]ecause of\nconvenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,\n6                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events\nbeyond a certain point.\u201d Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,\n248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,\ndissenting). Common-law \u201cproximate cause\u201d formulations\nvaried, and were often both constricted and difficult to\ncomprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73\u201377, 812\u2013813\n(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre\u00ad\ncluding recovery in the event of any \u201cintervening\u201d cause or\nany contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability\nif a \u201cproximate cause\u201d was not the sole proximate cause.\nProsser and Keeton \u00a765, p. 452 (noting \u201ctendency . . . to\nlook for some single, principal, dominant, \u2018proximate\u2019\ncause of every injury\u201d). Many used definitions resembling\nthose CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the\nCourt of Appeals. See supra, at 2\u20133 (CSX proposed key\nwords \u201cnatural or probable\u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d to describe required\nrelationship between injury and alleged negligent con\u00ad\nduct); Prosser and Keeton \u00a743, pp. 282\u2013283.\n   Drawing largely on Justice Souter\u2019s concurring opinion\nin Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173\n(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers \u201cany part\u201d test\ndisplaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for\ninjuries involving contributory negligence or other \u201cmulti\u00ad\nple causes.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).1 Rogers \u201cdid not address the requisite\ndirectness of a cause,\u201d CSX argues, hence that question\ncontinues to be governed by restrictive common-law for\u00ad\nmulations. Ibid.\n                          B\n  To evaluate CSX\u2019s argument, we turn first to the facts of\nRogers. The employee in that case was injured while\nburning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same\n\nfor railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said\nnothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164\u2013165.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndant\u2019s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the\nflames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a\nculvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to\nescape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel\ncovering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352\nU. S., at 501\u2013503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a\nverdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail\u00ad\ning to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the\nemployee was at fault because of his lack of attention to\nthe spreading fire. Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d\n467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire \u201cwas something extraordi\u00ad\nnary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of\nthe gravel,\u201d the court felt \u201cobliged to say [that] plaintiff\u2019s\ninjury was not the natural and probable consequence of\nany negligence of defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   We held that the jury\u2019s verdict should not have been\nupset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion, we condemned both. First, the\ncourt erred in concluding that the employee\u2019s negligence\nwas the \u201csole\u201d cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably\nfound that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 504\u2013505. Second, the court erred insofar as it\nheld that the railroad\u2019s negligence was not a sufficient\ncause unless it was the more \u201cprobable\u201d cause of the in\u00ad\njury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate\nany traditional common-law formulation of \u201cproximate\ncausation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the\ndefendant\u2019s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing\ncause of injury.\u201d Id., at 506. Whether the railroad\u2019s negli\u00ad\ngent act was the \u201cimmediate reason\u201d for the fall, we added,\nwas \u201can irrelevant consideration.\u201d Id., at 503. We then\nannounced the \u201cany part\u201d test, id., at 506, and reiterated it\nseveral times. See, e.g., id., at 507 (\u201cnarro[w]\u201d and \u201csingle\ninquiry\u201d is whether \u201cnegligence of the employer played\nany part at all\u201d in bringing about the injury); id., at 508\n8                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(FELA case \u201crarely presents more than the single question\nwhether negligence of the employer played any part, how\u00ad\never small, in the injury\u201d).2\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive state\u00ad\nment of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Mis\u00ad\nsouri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA\ninjury might have multiple causes, including railroad\nnegligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at\n472 (reciting FELA\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language). But\nthe railroad\u2019s part, according to the state court, was too\nindirect, not sufficiently \u201cnatural and probable,\u201d to estab\u00ad\nlish the requisite causation. Ibid. That is the very reason\u00ad\ning the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning\nCSX asks us to resurrect.\n   Our understanding is informed by the statutory history\nand precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was\nenacted, the \u201charsh and technical\u201d rules of state common\nlaw had \u201cmade recovery difficult or even impossible\u201d for in\u00ad\njured railroad workers. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Vir\nginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3 (1964). \u201c[D]issatisfied with\nthe [railroad\u2019s] common-law duty,\u201d Congress sought to \u201csup\u00ad\nplan[t] that duty with [FELA\u2019s] far more drastic duty of\npaying damages for injury or death at work due in\nwhole or in part to the employer\u2019s negligence.\u201d Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 507. Yet, Rogers observed, the Missouri court\nand other lower courts continued to ignore FELA\u2019s \u201csig\u00ad\nnifican[t]\u201d departures from the \u201cordinary common-law\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In face of Rogers\u2019 repeated admonition that the \u201cany part . . . in pro\u00ad\n\nducing the injury\u201d test was the single test for causation under FELA,\nthe dissent speculates that Rogers was simply making a veiled ref\u00ad\nerence to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, i.e.,\nallowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was \u201cslight\u201d\nwhile the railroad\u2019s was \u201cgross.\u201d Post, at 9\u201310. That is not what Rogers\nconveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that \u201cthe test of a jury case\n[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.\u201d 352 U. S., at 506.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnegligence\u201d scheme, to reinsert common-law formulations\nof causation involving \u201cprobabilities,\u201d and consequently to\n\u201cdeprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.\u201d\nId., at 507, 509\u2013510. Aiming to end lower court disre-\ngard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly\ncalled the \u201cany part\u201d test the \u201csingle\u201d inquiry determining\ncausation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis\nadded). In short, CSX\u2019s argument that the Rogers stan\u00ad\ndard concerns only division of responsibility among multi\u00ad\nple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the\nthrust of our decision in that case.\n   Tellingly, in announcing the \u201cany part . . . in producing\nthe injury\u201d test, Rogers cited Coray v. Southern Pacific\nCo., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that\nFELA had parted from traditional common-law formula\u00ad\ntions of causation. What qualified as a \u201cproximate\u201d or\nlegally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex\u00ad\nplained, was determined by the statutory phrase \u201cresult\u00ad\ning in whole or in part,\u201d which Congress \u201cselected . . . to fix\nliability\u201d in language that was \u201csimple and direct.\u201d Id., at\n524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was\nincompatible with \u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d that common-law\ncourts employed to determine whether a particular cause\nwas sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to constitute a proximate\ncause. Id., at 523\u2013524.3\n   Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent, while recognizing \u201cthe variety of formulations\u201d courts\nhave employed to define \u201cproximate cause,\u201d post, at 2, does not say\nwhich of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA\ncases. We regard the phrase \u201cnegligence played a part\u2014no matter how\nsmall,\u201d see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with \u201cnegligence\nplayed any part, even the slightest,\u201d see id., at 506, and the phrase \u201cin\nproducing the injury\u201d as synonymous with the phrase \u201cin bringing\nabout the injury.\u201d We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\ninstruction and the \u201cany part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury\u201d formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in\ncontrast, are hardly synonymous.\n10                CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nannounced a general standard for causation in FELA\ncases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involv-\ning multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day\nRogers was announced, we applied its \u201cany part\u201d instruc\u00ad\ntion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the\ndirectness or foreseeability of the connection between the\ncarrier\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. See Fergu\nson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523\u2013\n524 (1957) (plurality opinion).\n   A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff\nproper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,\nthe railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing \u201cdead and\ndecayed rats and pigeons,\u201d to accumulate near its right-of\u00ad\nway; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee\nsuffered an insect bite that became infected and required\namputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court\nhad concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation\nto warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at\n112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers\nannounced. Id., at 116\u2013117, 120\u2013121. See also Crane v.\nCedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166\u2013167\n(1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who \u201cis not\nrequired to prove common-law proximate causation but\nonly that his injury resulted \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 from the\nrailroad\u2019s violation,\u201d with suit by nonemployee, where\n\u201cdefinition of causation . . .

See,\ne.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must\nbe \u201cthe natural and probable consequence of the negligence\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the \u201cnatural or probable\u201d charge\nthat CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a\npre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  In reliance on Rogers, every Court of Appeals that re\u00ad\nviews judgments in FELA cases has approved jury in\u00ad\nstructions on causation identical or substantively equiva\u00ad\nlent to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s instruction.5 Each appellate\ncourt has rejected common-law formulations of proximate\ncause of the kind CSX requested in this case. See supra,\nat 2\u20133. The current model federal instruction, recognizing\nthat the \u201cFELA causation standard is distinct from the\nusual proximate cause standard,\u201d reads:\n     \u201cThe fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an\n     injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from\n     the negligence of the railroad or its employees or\n     agents. In other words, did such negligence play any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common\u00ad\nlaw formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.\n535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence \u201ccon\u00ad\ntribute[d] \u2018in whole or in part\u2019 to cause the death\u201d); Coray v. South-\nern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law\n\u201cdialectical subtleties\u201d concerning the term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d and ap\u00ad\nproving use of \u201csimple and direct\u201d statutory language). We rely on\nRogers not because \u201ctime begins in 1957,\u201d post, at 7, but because Rogers\nstated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad\u2019s\n\u201cnegligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain\u00ad\ntiff \u2019s] injury\u201d? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the\narray of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers\ninstruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it\nfor over 50 years.

The dissent shares\nthese fears. Post, at 5\u20136, 15\u201316. But a half century\u2019s\nexperience with Rogers gives us little cause for concern:\nCSX\u2019s briefs did not identify even one trial in which the\ninstruction generated an absurd or untoward award.9 Nor\nhas the dissent managed to uncover such a case. Post, at\n13\u201314 (citing no actual case but conjuring up images of\nfalling pianos and spilled coffee).\n   While some courts have said that Rogers eliminated the\nconcept of proximate cause in FELA cases,10 we think it\n\u201cmore accurate . . . to recognize that Rogers describes the\ntest for proximate causation applicable in FELA suits.\u201d\nSorrell, 549 U.

That understanding was expressed by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Pressed on this point at oral argument, CSX directed us to two cases\n\ncited by its amicus. In Richards v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 330 F. 3d\n428, 431, 437 (CA6 2003), a defective brake malfunctioned en route,\nand the employee was injured while inspecting underneath the train to\nlocate the problem; the Sixth Circuit sent the case to a jury.

In our view, the causal link in\nthese cases is hardly farfetched; in fact, in both, the lower courts\nobserved that the evidence did not show mere \u201cbut for\u201d causation.

S., at 524, the Rogers instruction uses the everyday\nwords contained in the statute itself. Jurors can compre\u00ad\nhend those words and apply them in light of their ex\u00ad\nperience and common sense. Unless and until Congress\norders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an\ninstruction tied to FELA\u2019s text, long employed by lower\ncourts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable.\n                              A\n   As we have noted, see supra, at 5\u20136, the phrase \u201cproxi\u00ad\nmate cause\u201d is shorthand for the policy-based judgment\nthat not all factual causes contributing to an injury should\nbe legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Keeton explain:\n\u201cIn a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go\nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to\nthe dawn of human events, and beyond.\u201d \u00a741, p. 264. To\nprevent \u201cinfinite liability,\u201d ibid., courts and legislatures\nappropriately place limits on the chain of causation that\nmay support recovery on any particular claim.\n   The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d itself is hardly essential to\nthe imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously\nconfusing. See, e.g., Prosser and Keeton \u00a742, p. 273 (\u201cThe\nword \u2019proximate\u2019 is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who\nin his time committed other sins. . . . It is an unfortunate\nword, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the\nfactor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason\n\u2018legal cause\u2019 or perhaps even \u2018responsible cause\u2019 would be a\nmore appropriate term.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\n   And the lack of consensus on any one definition of\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d is manifest.

In the District Court, CSX requested a jury\ninstruction defining \u201cproximate cause\u201d to mean \u201cany cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of.\u201d App. 32a. On appeal, \u201cCSX main\u00ad\ntain[ed] that the correct definition . . . is a \u2018direct relation\nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.\u2019 \u201d 598 F. 3d, at 393, n. 3.

See Steele & Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A\nPersistent Failure to Communicate, 67 N. C. L.

In light of the potential of\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is\nnot surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts avoided the term altogether. See 1 Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional\nHarm \u00a729 (2005) (confining liability to \u201charms that result\nfrom the risks that made the actor\u2019s conduct tortious\u201d); id.,\n16                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

See Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), 25 Harv. L. Rev. 223, 235\n(1912).\n                              B\n   FELA\u2019s language is straightforward: railroads are made\nanswerable in damages for an employee\u2019s \u201cinjury or death\nresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.\u201d 45\nU. S. C. \u00a751. The argument for importing into FELA\u2019s text\n\u201cprevious judicial definitions or dicta\u201d originating in non\u00ad\nstatutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends\nhow foreseeability figures in FELA cases.\n   \u201c[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d we clarified in\nGallick, is indeed \u201can essential ingredient of [FELA] neg\nligence.\u201d 372 U.

The jury,\ntherefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier \u201cfai[l] to\nobserve that degree of care which people of ordinary pru\u00ad\ndence and sagacity would use under the same or similar\ncircumstances[?]\u201d Id., at 118.

Indeed, judges\nwould have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.\nSee Nicholson v. Erie R.

But under\nRogers and the pattern instructions based on Rogers, the jury must find\nthat defendant\u2019s negligence in fact \u201cplayed a part\u2014no matter how\nsmall\u2014in bringing about the injury.\u201d See supra, at 2\u20133, 11\u201312 (Sev\u00ad\nenth Circuit pattern instruction and model federal instructions).\n18                CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

See also supra, at 13 (Rogers has generated no\nextravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions).\n  In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA\u2019s\nlimitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk\nof exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see supra, at 4,\nthe statute confines the universe of compensable injuries\nto those sustained by employees, during employment. \u00a751.\nHence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases.\nAnd the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear\nonly a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely,\nthose occurring outside the workplace.14\n  There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the \u201cin\nnatural or probable sequence\u201d charge sought by CSX\nwould mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiff\u2019s injury\nmust probably (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) follow from the\nrailroad\u2019s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA\u2019s\n\u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d language would be blunted.\nRailroad negligence would \u201cprobably\u201d cause a worker\u2019s in\u00ad\njury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to\nthe injury, not merely a contributor in any part.\n                       *      *    *\n  For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to\nrefuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause termi\u00ad\nnology. Juries in such cases are properly instructed that a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 CSX observes, as does the dissent, post, at 4, that we have applied\n\ntraditional notions of proximate causation under the RICO, antitrust,\nand securities fraud statutes. But those statutes cover broader classes\nof potential injuries and complainants. And none assign liability in\nlanguage akin to FELA\u2019s \u201cresulting in whole or in part\u201d standard. \u00a751\n(emphasis added). See Holmes v.

Recognizing that liability must not attach to\n\u201cevery conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged\nwrongdoing,\u201d proximate cause requires a \u201ccausal connec\u00ad\ntion between the wrong and the injury,\u201d Associated Gen.\nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 536,\n533, n. 26 (1983), that is not so \u201ctenuous . . . that what is\nclaimed to be consequence is only fortuity,\u201d Exxon, supra,\nat 838 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liabil\u00ad\nity at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of\nthe kingdom. When FELA was passed, as now, \u201c[t]he\nquestion whether damage in a given case is proximate or\nremote [was] one of great importance. . . .

Street, Founda\u00ad\ntions of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).\n   FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles\nin four specific ways. See Sorrell, supra, at 166, 168; Con\nsolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,\n542\u2013543 (1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the\ncommon law contributory negligence rule, which barred\nplaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their inju\u00ad\nries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act\nof Apr. 22, \u00a73, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so\u00ad\ncalled fellow-servant rule, \u00a71, prohibited an assumption of\nrisk defense in certain cases, \u00a74, and barred employees\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

J., dissenting\n\nfrom contractually releasing their employers from liability,\n\u00a75.\n  But \u201c[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory\nalterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of\nthe common law.\u201d Gottshall, supra, at 544 (internal quo\u00ad\ntation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar\nrequirement of proximate cause. Because \u201cCongress ex\u00ad\npressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines\u201d\nin FELA but \u201cdid not deal at all with [other] equally well\u00ad\nestablished doctrine[s],\u201d I do not believe that \u201cCongress\nintended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] sub silentio.\u201d\nMonessen Southwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330,\n337\u2013338 (1988).\n  We have applied the standard requirement of proximate\ncause to actions under federal statutes where the text did\nnot expressly provide for it. See Dura Pharmaceuticals,\nInc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342\u2013346 (2005) (securities\nfraud); Holmes, supra, at 268\u2013270 (Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act); Associated Gen. Contrac\ntors of Cal., Inc., supra, at 529\u2013535 (Clayton Act); cf.\nMetropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy,\n460 U.

The jury instruction on cau\u00ad\nsation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of\nFELA, 45 U. S. C. \u00a751. See ante, at 1, 16\u201317. But nothing\nin Section 1 is similar to the \u201cexpress language\u201d Congress\nemployed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate\na common law rule, Sorrell, supra, at 165\u2013166.

It provides that \u201c[e]very common carrier by\nrailroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suf\u00ad\nfering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for\nsuch injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the\nnegligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of\nsuch carrier.\u201d \u00a751. The Court\u2019s theory seems to be that\nthe words \u201cin whole or in part\u201d signal a departure from the\nhistoric requirement of proximate cause. But those words\nserved a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an\nimportant departure from a common law principle, but it\nwas the principle of contributory negligence\u2014not proxi\u00ad\nmate cause.\n   As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory\nnegligence; the \u201cin whole or in part\u201d language simply re\u00ad\nflected the fact that the railroad would remain liable\neven if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 170. The Congress that was so clear\nwhen it was abolishing common law limits on recovery\nelsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental\nprinciple of proximate cause in the oblique manner the\nCourt suggests. \u201c[I]f Congress had intended such a sea\nchange\u201d in negligence principles \u201cit would have said so\nclearly.\u201d Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior\nUniv. v.

Roberts, Federal Li\u00ad\nabilities of Carriers \u00a7538, p. 942 (1918). As Justice Souter\nhas explained, for the half century after the enactment\nof FELA, the Court \u201cconsistently recognized and applied\nproximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.\u201d\nSorrell, supra, at 174 (concurring opinion).\n   No matter. For the Court, time begins in 1957, with our\nopinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.

A jury in that\ncase awarded Rogers damages against his railroad em\u00ad\nployer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the\njury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested in\nRogers that there were \u201ctwo potential readings\u201d of the\nlower court\u2019s opinion and that both were wrong. Ante, at\n7. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA\u2019s\nelimination of the common law contributory negligence\nrule. We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and\nabrogate the rule of proximate cause.\n   First, we rejected the idea \u201cthat [Rogers\u2019s] conduct was\nthe sole cause of his mishap.\u201d 352 U. S., at 504 (emphasis\nadded); contra, Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d 467, 472\n(Mo. 1955) (while \u201c[Rogers] was confronted by an emer\u00ad\n8              CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

There were, we explained, \u201cprobative facts from\nwhich the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should\nhave been aware of conditions which created a likelihood\nthat [Rogers] . . . would suffer just such an injury as he\ndid.\u201d 352 U. S., at 503. We noted that \u201c[c]ommon experi\u00ad\nence teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames\nof a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames\nand smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the\ndanger.\u201d Ibid. In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we described\u2014in familiar terms\u2014sufficient evi\u00ad\ndence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the\nrailroad\u2019s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers\u2019s\ninjury regardless of whether \u201cthe immediate reason\u201d why\nRogers slipped was the railroad\u2019s negligence in permitting\ngravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   Rogers thereby clarified that, under a statute in which\nemployer and employee could both be proximate causes of\nan injury, a railroad\u2019s negligence need not be the sole or\nlast cause in order to be proximate. That is an application\nof proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111\n(\u201ca cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to\nbe considered its effective legal cause without by any\nmeans being the nearest or most proximate to the causes\nwhich contribute of the injury\u201d); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts\n\u00a7180, p. 445 (2001).\n   We then considered a second interpretation. The Mis\u00ad\nsouri Supreme Court\u2019s opinion could alternatively be read\nas having held that Rogers\u2019s \u201cconduct was at least as\nprobable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the\n[railroad],\u201d and that\u2014in those circumstances\u2014\u201cthere was\nno case for the jury.\u201d 352 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).\nIf this was the principle the court applied below, it was\nalso wrong and for many of the same reasons.\n   Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multi\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The question was simply\nwhether \u201cemployer negligence played any part, even the\nslightest, in producing the injury.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIt does not\nmatter,\u201d we continued, \u201cthat, from the evidence, the jury\nmay also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute\nthe result to other causes, including the employee\u2019s con\ntributory negligence.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Court today takes the \u201cany part, even the slightest\u201d\nlanguage out of context and views it as a rejection of proxi\u00ad\nmate cause. But Rogers was talking about contributory\nnegligence\u2014it said so\u2014and the language it chose confirms\njust that. \u201cSlight\u201d negligence was familiar usage in this\ncontext. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed\njust two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from con\u00ad\ntributory to comparative negligence. It provided that \u201cthe\nfact that the employee may have been guilty of contribu\u00ad\ntory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib\u00ad\nutory negligence was slight and that of the employer\nwas gross in comparison.\u201d Act of June 11, 1906, \u00a72, 34\nStat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway\nstop on the road from contributory to pure comparative\nnegligence, again using the term \u201cslight.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a7201,\nat 503 (\u201cOne earlier [version of comparative fault] . . .\nallowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff\u2019s\nnegligence was slight and the defendant\u2019s gross. . . . Mod\u00ad\nern comparative negligence law works differently, reduc\u00ad\ning the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in proportion to the plaintiff\u2019s\nfault\u201d); V.

In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure com\u00ad\nparative negligence with respect to rail workers. See\nDobbs \u00a7201, at 503.

J., dissenting\n\n\u201ceven the slightest\u201d in Rogers makes perfect sense when\nthe decision is understood to be about multiple causes\u2014\nnot about how direct any particular cause must be. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 175 (Souter, J., concurring) (perti\u00ad\nnent language concerned \u201cmultiplicity of causations,\u201d not\n\u201cthe necessary directness of . . . causation\u201d).\n   The Court views Rogers as \u201cdescrib[ing] the test for\nproximate causation\u201d under FELA, ante, at 13 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but Rogers itself says nothing of\nthe sort. See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as \u201cthe\ntest of a jury case\u201d (emphasis added)). Rogers did not set\nforth a novel standard for proximate cause\u2014much less an\ninstruction designed to guide jurors in determining causa\u00ad\ntion. Indeed, the trial court in Rogers used the term\n\u201cproximate cause\u201d in its jury instruction and directed the\njury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries\n\u201cwere not directly . . . caused by\u201d the railroad\u2019s negligence.\nId., at 505, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion quoted that instruction, ibid., but \u201ctook no issue\nwith [it] in this respect,\u201d Sorrell, supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   A few of our cases have characterized Rogers as hold-\ning that \u201ca relaxed standard of causation applies under\nFELA.\u201d Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 543; see Crane v. Cedar\nRapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166 (1969). Fair\nenough; but these passing summations of Rogers do not\nalter its holding. FELA did, of course, change common law\nrules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a\nrailroad\u2019s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause\nof an injury. See Gottshall, supra, at 542\u2013543 (\u201cCongress\ndid away with several common-law tort defenses . . . .\nSpecifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of con\u00ad\ntributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli\u00ad\ngence\u201d). And, unlike under FELA\u2019s predecessor, the pro\u00ad\nportionate degree of the employee\u2019s negligence would not\nnecessarily bar his recovery.

But we do not resolve questions\nsuch as the one before us by a show of hands. See Buck\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of\nHealth and Human Resources, 532 U.

Under these circumstances, it seems important to\ncorrect an interpretation of our own case law that has run,\nso to speak, off its own rails.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The Court\u2019s contention that our position would unsettle the law\ncontrary to principles of stare decisis exaggerates the state of the law.\nAs the court below noted, \u201c[s]ince Rogers, the Supreme Court has not\nexplained in detail how broadly or narrowly Rogers should be read by\nthe lower federal courts.\u201d 598 F. 3d 388, 397 (CA7 2010). See also\nNorfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173 (2007) (Souter, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cRogers did not address, much less alter, existing law\ngoverning the degree of causation necessary for redressing negligence\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)      13\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   Even the Court seems to appreciate that it is creating a\ntroubling gap in the FELA negligence action and ought to\ndo something to patch it over. The something it proposes\nis \u201c[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,\u201d ante, at 16 (inter\u00ad\nnal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for\nproximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability\nhas, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But\nthat is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits\nthe foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was\nnegligent in the first place.\n   The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a\ndefendant\u2019s negligence depends on \u201cwhat a reasonably\nprudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a\npotential for harm.\u201d 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury\nInstructions\u2013Civil \u00b689.10, p. 89\u201321 (2010); see ante, at 16\u2013\n17. That\u2019s all fine and good when a defendant\u2019s negligence\nresults directly in the plaintiff\u2019s injury (nevermind that no\n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d instruction was given in this\ncase). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it\nfalls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent\nand could have foreseen that the piano would hit some\u00ad\none\u2014as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court\u2019s test\narises when the negligence does not directly produce the\ninjury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the side\u00ad\nwalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling\ndown the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen\nhave placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was\nI negligent in dropping the piano because I could have\nforeseen \u201ca mishap and injury,\u201d ante, at 17 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my\nnegligence cause \u201c[the] mishap and injury\u201d that resulted?\nIt depends on what is meant by cause. My negligence was\na \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the injury: If I had not dropped the\npiano, the bicyclist would not have crashed. But is it a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nas the cause of negligently inflicted harm\u201d). \n\n14              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlegal cause? No.\n    In one respect the Court\u2019s test is needlessly rigid. If\ncourts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect\nof negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as\nan aspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed\nto intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain\nof causation\u2014and that \u201cbut for\u201d cause is not enough\u2014why\nhide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if\nthe Court intends \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d to be a kind\nof poorman\u2019s proximate cause, then where does the Court\nfind that requirement in the test Rogers\u2014or FELA\u2014pre\u00ad\nscribes? Could it be derived from the common law?\n    Where does \u201cforeseeability of harm\u201d as the sole protec\u00ad\ntion against limitless liability run out of steam? An an\u00ad\nswer would seem only fair to the common law.\n    A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which\noverheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it\nand removes his jacket. When finished with the repairs,\nhe grabs a thermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare\narm, burning it. Was the risk that someone would be\nharmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable?\nWas the risk that an employee would be burned while\nrepairing the overheated boiler foreseeable? Can the\nrailroad be liable under the Court\u2019s test for the coffee\nburn? According to the Court\u2019s opinion, it does not matter\nthat the \u201cmanner in which [the injury] occurred was not\n. . . foreseeable,\u201d ante, at 17 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), so long as some negligence\u2014any negligence at\nall\u2014can be established.\n    The Court\u2019s opinion fails to settle on a single test for\nanswering these questions: Is it that the railroad\u2019s negli\u00ad\ngence \u201cpla[y] a part\u2014no matter how small\u2014in bringing\nabout the [plaintiff\u2019s] injury,\u201d as the Court indicates on\npages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that \u201cnegligence play any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury,\u201d as sug\u00ad\ngested at pages 8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17? The Court\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsays there is no difference, see ante, at 9, n. 3, but I sus\u00ad\npect lawyers litigating FELA cases will prefer one instruc\u00ad\ntion over the other, depending on whether they represent\nthe employer or the employee. In any event, if the Court\u2019s\ntest\u2014whichever version\u2014provides answers to these hypo\u00ad\ntheticals, the Court keeps them to itself.\n   Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering\nsuch questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that\nresulted was within the scope of the risk created by the\ndefendant\u2019s negligent act; whether the injury was a natu\u00ad\nral or probable consequence of the negligence; whether\nthere was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the\nnegligence was anything more than an antecedent event\nwithout which the harm would not have occurred.\n   The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test\nand have been criticized for that. But they do \u201cfurnish\nillustrations of situations which judicious men upon care\u00ad\nful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the\nline or the other.\u201d Exxon, 517 U. S., at 839 (internal quo\u00ad\ntation marks omitted).\n   The Court forswears all these inquiries and\u2014with\nthem\u2014an accumulated common law history that might\nprovide guidance for courts and juries faced with causa\u00ad\ntion questions. See ante, at 1 (FELA \u201cdoes not incorporate\n\u2018proximate cause\u2019 standards developed in nonstatutory\ncommon-law tort actions\u201d); ante, at 18 (\u201cit is not error in a\nFELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate\ncause terminology\u201d). It is not necessary to accept every\nverbal formulation of proximate cause ever articulated to\nrecognize that these standards provide useful guidance\u2014\nand that juries should receive some instruction\u2014on the\ntype of link required between a railroad\u2019s negligence and\nan employee\u2019s injury.\n                      *    *     *\n  Law has its limits. But no longer when it comes to the\n16           CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                ROBERTS, C.
