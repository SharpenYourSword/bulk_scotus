MCBRIDE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 10–235.      Argued March 28, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011\nRespondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX\n  Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating\n  hand injury while switching railroad cars. He filed suit under the\n  Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable\n  for employees’ injuries “resulting in whole or in part from [carrier]\n  negligence.” 45 U. S. C. §51. McBride alleged that CSX negligently\n  (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to\n  train him to operate that equipment. A verdict for McBride would be\n  in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX’s\n  negligence “caused or contributed to” his injury. The court declined\n  CSX’s request for additional charges requiring McBride to “show that\n  . . . [CSX’s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury” and de\n  fining “proximate cause” as “any cause which, in natural or probable\n  sequence, produced the injury complained of.” Instead, relying on\n  Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the\n  Seventh Circuit’s pattern FELA instruction: “Defendant ‘caused or\n  contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury if Defendant’s negligence played a\n  part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.” The jury\n  returned a verdict for McBride.\n      On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on\n  proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a “direct relation\n  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” The\n  appeals court, however, approved the District Court’s instruction and\n  affirmed its judgment for McBride. Because Rogers had relaxed the\n  proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an in\n  struction that simply paraphrased Rogers’ language could not be de\n  clared erroneous.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.\n            JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to all but Part III–A, concluding, in accord with FELA’s text\n  and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate\n  courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock “proximate cause” stan\n  dards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The\n  charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress\n  employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad “caused or con\n  tributed to” a railroad worker’s injury “if [the railroad’s] negligence\n  played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.”\n  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation\n  in FELA cases. Pp. 4–14, 16–19.\n     (a) CSX’s interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive. Pp. 4–12.\n       (1) Given FELA’s “broad” causation language, Urie v. Thompson,\n  337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress’ “humanitarian” and “remedial\n  goal[s]” in enacting the statute, FELA’s causation standard is “re\n  laxed” compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation,\n  Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542–543.\n  Rogers described that relaxed standard as “whether the proofs justify\n  with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,\n  even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which dam\n  ages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506. Because the District Court’s in\n  struction tracked Rogers’ language, the instruction was plainly\n  proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition\n  applicable under FELA. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\n  U. S. 164, 172. CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly\n  focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of\n  “proximate cause.” Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurrence\n  in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges\n  that Rogers’ “any part . . . in producing the injury” test displaced only\n  common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contribu\n  tory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the req\n  uisite directness of a cause. Pp. 4–6.\n     (2) In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his\n  employer’s railroad tracks. A passing train fanned the flames, which\n  spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing. Attempting\n  to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the cul\n  vert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501–503. The state\n  court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme\n  Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to\n  maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault\n  because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. As the fire “was\n  something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the in\n  cline of the gravel,” the court found that “plaintiff’s injury was not the\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nnatural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.”\nIbid. This Court reversed. FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incor\nporate any traditional common-law formulation of “proximate causa\ntion[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant’s negli\ngence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.” Id., at 506.\nWhether the railroad’s negligent act was the “immediate reason” for\nthe fall, the Court added, was “irrelevant.” Id., at 503. The Court\nthen announced its “any part . . . in producing the injury” test, id., at\n506.\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of\nFELA’s causation standard. The State Supreme Court there ac\nknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but con\nsidered the respondent railroad’s part too indirect to establish the\nrequisite causation. That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in\nRogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.\nThe interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory his\ntory, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern\nPacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523–524, this Court’s subsequent deci\nsions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S.\n521, 523–524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews\nFELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and\nscholars. This understanding of Rogers “has been accepted as settled\nlaw for several decades.” IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32. To\ndiscard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.\nPp. 6–12.\n   (b) CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers “any part” instruction\nopens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability\non the basis of “but for” causation. A half century’s experience with\nRogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one\ntrial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward\naward.\n          FELA’s “in whole or in part” language is straightforward.\n“[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of\n[FELA] negligence,” Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S.\n108, 117 (emphasis added). If negligence is proved, however, and is\nshown to have “played any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in\ndamages even if “ ‘the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it\noccurred’ ” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick, 372 U. S.,\nat 120–121, and n. 8. Properly instructed on negligence and causa\ntion, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their\n“common sense” in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no war\nrant to award damages in far out “but for” scenarios, and judges\n4                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

S. C. §51 et seq. FELA renders rail­\nroads liable for employees’ injuries or deaths “resulting in\nwhole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” §51. In accord\nwith the text and purpose of the Act, this Court’s decision\nin Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),\nand the uniform view of federal appellate courts, we con­\nclude that the Act does not incorporate “proximate cause”\nstandards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort\nactions. The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, sim­\nply tracks the language Congress employed, informing\njuries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a\nplaintiff employee’s injury if the railroad’s negligence\nplayed any part in bringing about the injury.\n                        I\n  Respondent Robert McBride worked as a locomotive\n——————\n * JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III–A of this opinion.\n2               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nengineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which\noperates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12,\n2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be­\ntween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.\nThe run involved frequent starts and stops to add and\nremove individual rail cars, a process known as “switch­\ning.” The train McBride was to operate had an unusual\nengine configuration: two “wide-body” engines followed\nby three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested\nthat the configuration was unsafe, because switching with\nheavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand­\noperated independent brake. But he was told to take the\ntrain as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured\nhis hand while using the independent brake. Despite two\nsurgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re­\ngained full use of the hand.\n  Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com­\nmenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that\nCSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him\nto use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed\nto train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a–26a. A\nverdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court\ninstructed, if the jury found that CSX “was negligent” and\nthat the “negligence caused or contributed to” McBride’s\ninjury. Id., at 23a.\n  CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to\ngive. One of the rejected instructions would have required\n“the plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant’s negligence\nwas a proximate cause of the injury.” Id., at 34a. Another\nwould have defined “proximate cause” to mean “any cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of,” with the qualification that a proxi­\nmate cause “need not be the only cause, nor the last or\nnearest cause.” Id., at 32a.\n  Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquested, the Seventh Circuit’s pattern instruction for\nFELA cases, which reads:\n    “Defendant ‘caused or contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury\n    if Defendant’s negligence played a part—no matter\n    how small—in bringing about the injury. The mere\n    fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean\n    that the injury was caused by negligence.” Id., at 31a.\nFor this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this\nCourt’s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352\nU. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,\nsetting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that\namount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to\nplaintiff’s negligence. App. 29a.\n   CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob­\njection to the failure to instruct on “proximate cause.”\nBefore the appellate court, CSX “maintain[ed] that the\ncorrect definition of proximate causation is a ‘direct rela­\ntion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes\nv. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.\n258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con­\ntended, might have found that the chain of causation was\ntoo indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe\nbecause of its propensity to cause crashes during switch­\ning, not because of any risk to an engineer’s hands. Brief\nfor Defendant-Appellant in No. 08–3557 (CA7), pp. 49–52.\n   The Court of Appeals approved the District Court’s\ninstruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the\njury’s verdict. Rogers had “relaxed the proximate cause\nrequirement” in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con­\ncluded, a view of Rogers “echoed by every other court of\nappeals.” 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a\nhandful of state courts “still appl[ied] traditional formula­\ntions of proximate cause in FELA cases,” id., at 404, n. 7,\nthe Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous\n4              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan instruction that “simply paraphrase[d] the Supreme\nCourt’s own words in Rogers,” id., at 406.\n  We granted certiorari to decide whether the causation\ninstruction endorsed by the Seventh Circuit is proper in\nFELA cases. 562 U. S. ___ (2010). That instruction does\nnot include the term “proximate cause,” but does tell the\njury defendant’s negligence must “pla[y] a part—no matter\nhow small—in bringing about the [plaintiff’s] injury.” App.\n31a.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at\nthe dawn of the twentieth century. As we have recounted,\n“the physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the\ndeath or maiming of thousands of workers every year,”\nConsolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,\n542 (1994), including 281,645 casualties in the year 1908\nalone, S. Rep. No. 61–432, p. 2 (1910). Enacted that same\nyear in an effort to “shif[t] part of the human overhead of\ndoing business from employees to their employers,” Gott\nshall, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted), FELA prescribes:\n       “Every common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li­\n    able in damages to any person suffering injury while\n    he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or\n    death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence\n    of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car­\n    rier . . . .” 45 U. S. C. §51 (emphasis added).\n  Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects:\nRailroads are liable only to their employees, and only for\ninjuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA’s\nlanguage on causation, however, “is as broad as could be\nframed.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181 (1949).\nGiven the breadth of the phrase “resulting in whole or in\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npart from the [railroad’s] negligence,” and Congress’ “hu­\nmanitarian” and “remedial goal[s],” we have recognized\nthat, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, “a\nrelaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.”\nGottshall, 512 U. S., at 542–543. In our 1957 decision in\nRogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:\n    “Under [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply\n    whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion\n    that employer negligence played any part, even the\n    slightest, in producing the injury or death for which\n    damages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506.\n    As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the\nDistrict Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for\nMcBride if “[railroad] negligence played a part—no matter\nhow small—in bringing about the injury,” tracked the\nlanguage of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of\ncausation applicable under FELA, that instruction was\nplainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,\n491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (“Considerations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\n. . . .”). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the\nrailroad contends that lower courts have overread that\nopinion. In CSX’s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9–\n10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not\ntouch, concern, much less displace common-law formula­\ntions of “proximate cause.”\n    Understanding this argument requires some back­\nground. The term “proximate cause” is shorthand for a\nconcept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should\ngive rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of\nTorts §42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). “What we . . . mean by the word ‘proximate,’ ” one\nnoted jurist has explained, is simply this: “[B]ecause of\nconvenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,\n6                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events\nbeyond a certain point.” Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,\n248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,\ndissenting). Common-law “proximate cause” formulations\nvaried, and were often both constricted and difficult to\ncomprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73–77, 812–813\n(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre­\ncluding recovery in the event of any “intervening” cause or\nany contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability\nif a “proximate cause” was not the sole proximate cause.\nProsser and Keeton §65, p. 452 (noting “tendency . . . to\nlook for some single, principal, dominant, ‘proximate’\ncause of every injury”). Many used definitions resembling\nthose CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the\nCourt of Appeals. See supra, at 2–3 (CSX proposed key\nwords “natural or probable” or “direct” to describe required\nrelationship between injury and alleged negligent con­\nduct); Prosser and Keeton §43, pp. 282–283.\n   Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurring opinion\nin Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173\n(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers “any part” test\ndisplaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for\ninjuries involving contributory negligence or other “multi­\nple causes.” Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).1 Rogers “did not address the requisite\ndirectness of a cause,” CSX argues, hence that question\ncontinues to be governed by restrictive common-law for­\nmulations. Ibid.\n                          B\n  To evaluate CSX’s argument, we turn first to the facts of\nRogers. The employee in that case was injured while\nburning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen­\n——————\n  1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same\n\nfor railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said\nnothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164–165.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndant’s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the\nflames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a\nculvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to\nescape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel\ncovering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352\nU. S., at 501–503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a\nverdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail­\ning to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the\nemployee was at fault because of his lack of attention to\nthe spreading fire. Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d\n467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire “was something extraordi­\nnary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of\nthe gravel,” the court felt “obliged to say [that] plaintiff’s\ninjury was not the natural and probable consequence of\nany negligence of defendant.” Ibid.\n   We held that the jury’s verdict should not have been\nupset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri\nSupreme Court’s opinion, we condemned both. First, the\ncourt erred in concluding that the employee’s negligence\nwas the “sole” cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably\nfound that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 504–505. Second, the court erred insofar as it\nheld that the railroad’s negligence was not a sufficient\ncause unless it was the more “probable” cause of the in­\njury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate\nany traditional common-law formulation of “proximate\ncausation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the\ndefendant’s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing\ncause of injury.” Id., at 506. Whether the railroad’s negli­\ngent act was the “immediate reason” for the fall, we added,\nwas “an irrelevant consideration.” Id., at 503. We then\nannounced the “any part” test, id., at 506, and reiterated it\nseveral times. See, e.g., id., at 507 (“narro[w]” and “single\ninquiry” is whether “negligence of the employer played\nany part at all” in bringing about the injury); id., at 508\n8                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(FELA case “rarely presents more than the single question\nwhether negligence of the employer played any part, how­\never small, in the injury”).2\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive state­\nment of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Mis­\nsouri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA\ninjury might have multiple causes, including railroad\nnegligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at\n472 (reciting FELA’s “in whole or in part” language). But\nthe railroad’s part, according to the state court, was too\nindirect, not sufficiently “natural and probable,” to estab­\nlish the requisite causation. Ibid. That is the very reason­\ning the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning\nCSX asks us to resurrect.\n   Our understanding is informed by the statutory history\nand precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was\nenacted, the “harsh and technical” rules of state common\nlaw had “made recovery difficult or even impossible” for in­\njured railroad workers. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Vir\nginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3 (1964). “[D]issatisfied with\nthe [railroad’s] common-law duty,” Congress sought to “sup­\nplan[t] that duty with [FELA’s] far more drastic duty of\npaying damages for injury or death at work due in\nwhole or in part to the employer’s negligence.” Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 507. Yet, Rogers observed, the Missouri court\nand other lower courts continued to ignore FELA’s “sig­\nnifican[t]” departures from the “ordinary common-law\n\n——————\n  2 In face of Rogers’ repeated admonition that the “any part . . . in pro­\n\nducing the injury” test was the single test for causation under FELA,\nthe dissent speculates that Rogers was simply making a veiled ref­\nerence to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, i.e.,\nallowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was “slight”\nwhile the railroad’s was “gross.” Post, at 9–10. That is not what Rogers\nconveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that “the test of a jury case\n[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.” 352 U. S., at 506.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Aiming to end lower court disre-\ngard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly\ncalled the “any part” test the “single” inquiry determining\ncausation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis\nadded). In short, CSX’s argument that the Rogers stan­\ndard concerns only division of responsibility among multi­\nple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the\nthrust of our decision in that case.\n   Tellingly, in announcing the “any part . . . in producing\nthe injury” test, Rogers cited Coray v. Southern Pacific\nCo., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that\nFELA had parted from traditional common-law formula­\ntions of causation. What qualified as a “proximate” or\nlegally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex­\nplained, was determined by the statutory phrase “result­\ning in whole or in part,” which Congress “selected . . . to fix\nliability” in language that was “simple and direct.” Id., at\n524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was\nincompatible with “dialectical subtleties” that common-law\ncourts employed to determine whether a particular cause\nwas sufficiently “substantial” to constitute a proximate\ncause. Id., at 523–524.3\n   Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers\n——————\n  3 The dissent, while recognizing “the variety of formulations” courts\nhave employed to define “proximate cause,” post, at 2, does not say\nwhich of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA\ncases. We regard the phrase “negligence played a part—no matter how\nsmall,” see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with “negligence\nplayed any part, even the slightest,” see id., at 506, and the phrase “in\nproducing the injury” as synonymous with the phrase “in bringing\nabout the injury.” We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit’s\ninstruction and the “any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury” formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in\ncontrast, are hardly synonymous.\n10                CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nannounced a general standard for causation in FELA\ncases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involv-\ning multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day\nRogers was announced, we applied its “any part” instruc­\ntion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the\ndirectness or foreseeability of the connection between the\ncarrier’s negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. See Fergu\nson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523–\n524 (1957) (plurality opinion).\n   A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff\nproper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,\nthe railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing “dead and\ndecayed rats and pigeons,” to accumulate near its right-of­\nway; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee\nsuffered an insect bite that became infected and required\namputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court\nhad concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation\nto warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at\n112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers\nannounced. Id., at 116–117, 120–121. See also Crane v.\nCedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166–167\n(1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who “is not\nrequired to prove common-law proximate causation but\nonly that his injury resulted ‘in whole or in part’ from the\nrailroad’s violation,” with suit by nonemployee, where\n“definition of causation . . . [is] left to state law”); Gott\nshall, 512 U. S., at 543 (“relaxed standard of causation\napplies under FELA”).4\n——————\n   4 CSX and the dissent observe, correctly, that some of our pre-Rogers\n\ndecisions invoked common-law formulations of proximate cause. See,\ne.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must\nbe “the natural and probable consequence of the negligence” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the “natural or probable” charge\nthat CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a\npre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

See supra,\nat 2–3. The current model federal instruction, recognizing\nthat the “FELA causation standard is distinct from the\nusual proximate cause standard,” reads:\n     “The fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an\n     injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from\n     the negligence of the railroad or its employees or\n     agents. In other words, did such negligence play any\n——————\n475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common­\nlaw formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.\n535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence “con­\ntribute[d] ‘in whole or in part’ to cause the death”); Coray v. South-\nern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law\n“dialectical subtleties” concerning the term “proximate cause,” and ap­\nproving use of “simple and direct” statutory language). We rely on\nRogers not because “time begins in 1957,” post, at 7, but because Rogers\nstated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad’s\n“negligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain­\ntiff ’s] injury”? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the\narray of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers\ninstruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it\nfor over 50 years.

S., at 524, the Rogers instruction uses the everyday\nwords contained in the statute itself. Jurors can compre­\nhend those words and apply them in light of their ex­\nperience and common sense. Unless and until Congress\norders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an\ninstruction tied to FELA’s text, long employed by lower\ncourts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable.\n                              A\n   As we have noted, see supra, at 5–6, the phrase “proxi­\nmate cause” is shorthand for the policy-based judgment\nthat not all factual causes contributing to an injury should\nbe legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Keeton explain:\n“In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go\nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to\nthe dawn of human events, and beyond.” §41, p. 264. To\nprevent “infinite liability,” ibid., courts and legislatures\nappropriately place limits on the chain of causation that\nmay support recovery on any particular claim.\n   The term “proximate cause” itself is hardly essential to\nthe imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously\nconfusing. See, e.g., Prosser and Keeton §42, p. 273 (“The\nword ’proximate’ is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who\nin his time committed other sins. . . . It is an unfortunate\nword, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the\nfactor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason\n‘legal cause’ or perhaps even ‘responsible cause’ would be a\nmore appropriate term.” (footnotes omitted)).\n   And the lack of consensus on any one definition of\n“proximate cause” is manifest.

In the District Court, CSX requested a jury\ninstruction defining “proximate cause” to mean “any cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of.” App. 32a. On appeal, “CSX main­\ntain[ed] that the correct definition . . . is a ‘direct relation\nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d, at 393, n. 3. Before this Court, CSX\ncalled for “a demonstration that the plaintiff’s injury\nresulted from the wrongful conduct in a way that was\nnatural, probable, and foreseeable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9–10.\n   Lay triers, studies show, are scarcely aided by charges\nso phrased. See Steele & Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A\nPersistent Failure to Communicate, 67 N. C. L.

In light of the potential of\n“proximate cause” instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is\nnot surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts avoided the term altogether.

See Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), 25 Harv. L. Rev. 223, 235\n(1912).\n                              B\n   FELA’s language is straightforward: railroads are made\nanswerable in damages for an employee’s “injury or death\nresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” 45\nU. S. C. §51. The argument for importing into FELA’s text\n“previous judicial definitions or dicta” originating in non­\nstatutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends\nhow foreseeability figures in FELA cases.\n   “[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,” we clarified in\nGallick, is indeed “an essential ingredient of [FELA] neg\nligence.” 372 U. S., at 117 (emphasis added). The jury,\ntherefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier “fai[l] to\nobserve that degree of care which people of ordinary pru­\ndence and sagacity would use under the same or similar\ncircumstances[?]” Id., at 118.

See also supra, at 13 (Rogers has generated no\nextravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions).\n  In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA’s\nlimitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk\nof exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see supra, at 4,\nthe statute confines the universe of compensable injuries\nto those sustained by employees, during employment. §51.\nHence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases.\nAnd the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear\nonly a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely,\nthose occurring outside the workplace.14\n  There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the “in\nnatural or probable sequence” charge sought by CSX\nwould mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiff’s injury\nmust probably (“more likely than not”) follow from the\nrailroad’s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA’s\n“resulting in whole or in part” language would be blunted.\nRailroad negligence would “probably” cause a worker’s in­\njury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to\nthe injury, not merely a contributor in any part.\n                       *      *    *\n  For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to\nrefuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause termi­\nnology.

But those statutes cover broader classes\nof potential injuries and complainants. And none assign liability in\nlanguage akin to FELA’s “resulting in whole or in part” standard. §51\n(emphasis added). See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corpo\nration, 503 U.

The Court\ntoday holds that this principle does not apply to actions\nunder the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), and\nthat those suing under that statute may recover for inju­\nries that were not proximately caused by the negligence\nof their employers. This even though we have held that\nFELA generally follows the common law, unless the Act\nexpressly provides otherwise; even though FELA expressly\nabrogated common law rules in four other respects, but\nsaid nothing about proximate cause; and even though our\nown cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA, repeat­\nedly recognized that proximate cause was required for\nrecovery under that statute.\n   The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar ele­\nment of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an ele­\nment “generally thought to be a necessary limitation on\nliability,” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830,\n838 (1996). The test the Court would substitute—whether\nnegligence played any part, even the slightest, in produc­\n2              CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.

FELA provides\na statutory cause of action sounding in negligence.” Nor\nfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U.

S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). With respect to FELA in par­\nticular, we have explained that “[a]bsent express language\nto the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are deter­\nmined by reference to the common law.” Sorrell, supra, at\n165–166; see Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 182 (1949).\n   Recovery for negligence has always required a showing\nof proximate cause. “ ‘In a philosophical sense, the con­\nsequences of an act go forward to eternity.’ ” Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,\n266, n. 10 (1992) (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,\n& D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §41, p.\n264 (5th ed. 1984)). Law, however, is not philosophy, and\nthe concept of proximate cause developed at common law\nin response to the perceived need to distinguish “but for”\ncause from those more direct causes of injury that can\nform the basis for liability at law.\n   The plurality breaks no new ground in criticizing the\nvariety of formulations of the concept of proximate cause,\nante, at 14–15; courts, commentators, and first-year law\nstudents have been doing that for generations. See Exxon,\nsupra, at 838. But it is often easier to disparage the prod­\nuct of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsubstitute—which may explain why Congress did not at­\ntempt to do so in FELA. Proximate cause is hardly the\nonly enduring common law concept that is useful despite\nits imprecision, see ante, at 14. It is in good company with\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness,\nand unconscionability—to name just a few.\n   Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that\nbefore recovery is allowed in tort, there must be “some\ndirect relation between the injury asserted and the injuri­\nous conduct alleged,” Holmes, 503 U. S., at 268. It ex­\ncludes from the scope of liability injuries that are “too\nremote,” “purely contingent,” or “indirect[ ].” Id., at 268,\n271, 274. Recognizing that liability must not attach to\n“every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged\nwrongdoing,” proximate cause requires a “causal connec­\ntion between the wrong and the injury,” Associated Gen.\nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 536,\n533, n. 26 (1983), that is not so “tenuous . . . that what is\nclaimed to be consequence is only fortuity,” Exxon, supra,\nat 838 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liabil­\nity at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of\nthe kingdom. When FELA was passed, as now, “[t]he\nquestion whether damage in a given case is proximate or\nremote [was] one of great importance. . . . [T]he determi­\nnation of it determines legal right,” 1 T. Street, Founda­\ntions of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).\n   FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles\nin four specific ways. See Sorrell, supra, at 166, 168; Con\nsolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,\n542–543 (1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the\ncommon law contributory negligence rule, which barred\nplaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their inju­\nries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act\nof Apr. 22, §3, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so­\ncalled fellow-servant rule, §1, prohibited an assumption of\nrisk defense in certain cases, §4, and barred employees\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfrom contractually releasing their employers from liability,\n§5.\n  But “[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory\nalterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of\nthe common law.” Gottshall, supra, at 544 (internal quo­\ntation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar\nrequirement of proximate cause. Because “Congress ex­\npressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines”\nin FELA but “did not deal at all with [other] equally well­\nestablished doctrine[s],” I do not believe that “Congress\nintended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] sub silentio.”\nMonessen Southwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330,\n337–338 (1988).\n  We have applied the standard requirement of proximate\ncause to actions under federal statutes where the text did\nnot expressly provide for it. See Dura Pharmaceuticals,\nInc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342–346 (2005) (securities\nfraud); Holmes, supra, at 268–270 (Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act); Associated Gen. Contrac\ntors of Cal., Inc., supra, at 529–535 (Clayton Act); cf.\nMetropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy,\n460 U. S. 766, 774 (1983) (“the terms ‘environmental ef­\nfect’ and ‘environmental impact’ in [the National Envi­\nronmental Policy Act of 1969 should] be read to include a\nrequirement of a reasonably close causal relationship\nbetween a change in the physical environment and the\neffect at issue . . . . like the familiar doctrine of proximate\ncause from tort law”).\n  The Court does not explicitly rest its argument on its\nown reading of FELA’s text. The jury instruction on cau­\nsation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of\nFELA, 45 U. S. C. §51. See ante, at 1, 16–17. But nothing\nin Section 1 is similar to the “express language” Congress\nemployed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate\na common law rule, Sorrell, supra, at 165–166. See, e.g.,\n§53 (“the fact that the employee may have been guilty of\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncontributory negligence shall not bar a recovery”); §54\n(“employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of\nhis employment”).\n   As the very first section of the statute, Section 1 simply\noutlines who could be sued by whom and for what types\nof injuries. It provides that “[e]very common carrier by\nrailroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suf­\nfering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for\nsuch injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the\nnegligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of\nsuch carrier.” §51. The Court’s theory seems to be that\nthe words “in whole or in part” signal a departure from the\nhistoric requirement of proximate cause. But those words\nserved a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an\nimportant departure from a common law principle, but it\nwas the principle of contributory negligence—not proxi­\nmate cause.\n   As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory\nnegligence; the “in whole or in part” language simply re­\nflected the fact that the railroad would remain liable\neven if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 170. The Congress that was so clear\nwhen it was abolishing common law limits on recovery\nelsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental\nprinciple of proximate cause in the oblique manner the\nCourt suggests. “[I]f Congress had intended such a sea\nchange” in negligence principles “it would have said so\nclearly.” Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior\nUniv. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 14).\n   The language the Court adopts as an instruction on\ncausation requires only that negligence have “ ‘played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.’ ” Ante, at\n17 (quoting Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506; emphasis deleted);\nsee also ante, at 18–19 (“Juries in such cases are properly\ninstructed that a defendant railroad ‘caused or contributed\n6               CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

If that is proved, “then the carrier is an­\nswerable in damages even if the extent of the [injury] or\nthe manner in which it occurred was not ‘[p]robable’ or\n‘foreseeable.’ ” Ante, at 17 (some internal quotation marks\nomitted). There is nothing in that language that requires\nanything other than “but for” cause. The terms “even the\nslightest” and “no matter how small” make clear to juries\nthat even the faintest whisper of “but for” causation will\ndo.\n   At oral argument, counsel for McBride explained that\nthe correct standard for recovery under FELA is “but-for\nplus a relaxed form of legal cause.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.\nThere is no “plus” in the rule the Court announces today.\nIn this very case defense counsel was free to argue “but\nfor” cause pure and simple to the jury. In closing, counsel\ninformed the jury: “What we also have to show is defen­\ndant’s negligence caused or contributed to [McBride’s]\ninjury. It never would have happened but for [CSX] giving\nhim that train.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a (emphasis\nadded).\n   At certain points in its opinion, the Court acknowledges\nthat “[i]njuries have countless causes,” not all of which\n“should give rise to legal liability.” Ante, at 5.

S. 384, 394\n(1949) (“plaintiff was entitled to a[n] . . . instruction . . .\nwhich rendered defendant liable for injuries proximately\nresulting therefrom”).\n   A comprehensive treatise written shortly after Congress\nenacted FELA confirmed that “the plaintiff must . . . show\nthat the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of\nthe damage” in order to recover. 1 M. Roberts, Federal Li­\nabilities of Carriers §538, p. 942 (1918). As Justice Souter\nhas explained, for the half century after the enactment\nof FELA, the Court “consistently recognized and applied\nproximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.”\nSorrell, supra, at 174 (concurring opinion).\n   No matter. For the Court, time begins in 1957, with our\nopinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500.\n   That opinion, however, “left this law where it was.” Sor\nrell, supra, at 174 (Souter, J., concurring). A jury in that\ncase awarded Rogers damages against his railroad em­\nployer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the\njury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested in\nRogers that there were “two potential readings” of the\nlower court’s opinion and that both were wrong. Ante, at\n7. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA’s\nelimination of the common law contributory negligence\nrule. We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and\nabrogate the rule of proximate cause.\n   First, we rejected the idea “that [Rogers’s] conduct was\nthe sole cause of his mishap.” 352 U. S., at 504 (emphasis\nadded); contra, Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d 467, 472\n(Mo. 1955) (while “[Rogers] was confronted by an emer­\n8              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngency[,] . . . it was an emergency brought about by him­\nself”). There were, we explained, “probative facts from\nwhich the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should\nhave been aware of conditions which created a likelihood\nthat [Rogers] . . . would suffer just such an injury as he\ndid.” 352 U. S., at 503. We noted that “[c]ommon experi­\nence teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames\nof a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames\nand smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the\ndanger.” Ibid. In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we described—in familiar terms—sufficient evi­\ndence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the\nrailroad’s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers’s\ninjury regardless of whether “the immediate reason” why\nRogers slipped was the railroad’s negligence in permitting\ngravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   Rogers thereby clarified that, under a statute in which\nemployer and employee could both be proximate causes of\nan injury, a railroad’s negligence need not be the sole or\nlast cause in order to be proximate. That is an application\nof proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111\n(“a cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to\nbe considered its effective legal cause without by any\nmeans being the nearest or most proximate to the causes\nwhich contribute of the injury”); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts\n§180, p. 445 (2001).\n   We then considered a second interpretation. The Mis­\nsouri Supreme Court’s opinion could alternatively be read\nas having held that Rogers’s “conduct was at least as\nprobable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the\n[railroad],” and that—in those circumstances—“there was\nno case for the jury.” 352 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).\nIf this was the principle the court applied below, it was\nalso wrong and for many of the same reasons.\n   Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multi­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a rail­\nroad’s negligence need not be the “sole, efficient, produc-\ning cause of injury,” id., at 506. The question was simply\nwhether “employer negligence played any part, even the\nslightest, in producing the injury.” Ibid. “It does not\nmatter,” we continued, “that, from the evidence, the jury\nmay also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute\nthe result to other causes, including the employee’s con\ntributory negligence.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Court today takes the “any part, even the slightest”\nlanguage out of context and views it as a rejection of proxi­\nmate cause. But Rogers was talking about contributory\nnegligence—it said so—and the language it chose confirms\njust that. “Slight” negligence was familiar usage in this\ncontext. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed\njust two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from con­\ntributory to comparative negligence. It provided that “the\nfact that the employee may have been guilty of contribu­\ntory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib­\nutory negligence was slight and that of the employer\nwas gross in comparison.” Act of June 11, 1906, §2, 34\nStat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway\nstop on the road from contributory to pure comparative\nnegligence, again using the term “slight.” See Dobbs §201,\nat 503 (“One earlier [version of comparative fault] . . .\nallowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff’s\nnegligence was slight and the defendant’s gross. . . . Mod­\nern comparative negligence law works differently, reduc­\ning the plaintiff’s recovery in proportion to the plaintiff’s\nfault”); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence §2.01[b][2],\np. 33 (5th ed. 2010) (a “major form of modified comparative\nnegligence is the ‘slight-gross’ system”); id. §3.04[b], at\n75. In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure com­\nparative negligence with respect to rail workers. See\nDobbs §201, at 503. Under FELA, it does not matter\nwhose negligence was “slight” or “gross.” The use of the term\n10              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n“even the slightest” in Rogers makes perfect sense when\nthe decision is understood to be about multiple causes—\nnot about how direct any particular cause must be. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 175 (Souter, J., concurring) (perti­\nnent language concerned “multiplicity of causations,” not\n“the necessary directness of . . . causation”).\n   The Court views Rogers as “describ[ing] the test for\nproximate causation” under FELA, ante, at 13 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but Rogers itself says nothing of\nthe sort. See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as “the\ntest of a jury case” (emphasis added)). Rogers did not set\nforth a novel standard for proximate cause—much less an\ninstruction designed to guide jurors in determining causa­\ntion. Indeed, the trial court in Rogers used the term\n“proximate cause” in its jury instruction and directed the\njury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries\n“were not directly . . . caused by” the railroad’s negligence.\nId., at 505, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion quoted that instruction, ibid., but “took no issue\nwith [it] in this respect,” Sorrell, supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   A few of our cases have characterized Rogers as hold-\ning that “a relaxed standard of causation applies under\nFELA.” Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 543; see Crane v. Cedar\nRapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166 (1969). Fair\nenough; but these passing summations of Rogers do not\nalter its holding. FELA did, of course, change common law\nrules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a\nrailroad’s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause\nof an injury. See Gottshall, supra, at 542–543 (“Congress\ndid away with several common-law tort defenses . . . .\nSpecifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of con­\ntributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli­\ngence”). And, unlike under FELA’s predecessor, the pro­\nportionate degree of the employee’s negligence would not\nnecessarily bar his recovery. But we have never held—\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

But we do not resolve questions\nsuch as the one before us by a show of hands. See Buck\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of\nHealth and Human Resources, 532 U.

The something it proposes\nis “[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,” ante, at 16 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for\nproximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability\nhas, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But\nthat is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits\nthe foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was\nnegligent in the first place.\n   The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a\ndefendant’s negligence depends on “what a reasonably\nprudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a\npotential for harm.” 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury\nInstructions–Civil ¶89.10, p. 89–21 (2010); see ante, at 16–\n17. That’s all fine and good when a defendant’s negligence\nresults directly in the plaintiff’s injury (nevermind that no\n“reasonable foreseeability” instruction was given in this\ncase). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it\nfalls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent\nand could have foreseen that the piano would hit some­\none—as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court’s test\narises when the negligence does not directly produce the\ninjury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the side­\nwalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling\ndown the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen\nhave placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was\nI negligent in dropping the piano because I could have\nforeseen “a mishap and injury,” ante, at 17 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my\nnegligence cause “[the] mishap and injury” that resulted?\nIt depends on what is meant by cause. My negligence was\na “but for” cause of the injury: If I had not dropped the\npiano, the bicyclist would not have crashed. But is it a\n—————— \n\nas the cause of negligently inflicted harm”). \n\n14              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlegal cause? No.\n    In one respect the Court’s test is needlessly rigid. If\ncourts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect\nof negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as\nan aspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed\nto intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain\nof causation—and that “but for” cause is not enough—why\nhide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if\nthe Court intends “foreseeability of harm” to be a kind\nof poorman’s proximate cause, then where does the Court\nfind that requirement in the test Rogers—or FELA—pre­\nscribes? Could it be derived from the common law?\n    Where does “foreseeability of harm” as the sole protec­\ntion against limitless liability run out of steam? An an­\nswer would seem only fair to the common law.\n    A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which\noverheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it\nand removes his jacket. When finished with the repairs,\nhe grabs a thermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare\narm, burning it. Was the risk that someone would be\nharmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable?\nWas the risk that an employee would be burned while\nrepairing the overheated boiler foreseeable? Can the\nrailroad be liable under the Court’s test for the coffee\nburn? According to the Court’s opinion, it does not matter\nthat the “manner in which [the injury] occurred was not\n. . . foreseeable,” ante, at 17 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), so long as some negligence—any negligence at\nall—can be established.\n    The Court’s opinion fails to settle on a single test for\nanswering these questions: Is it that the railroad’s negli­\ngence “pla[y] a part—no matter how small—in bringing\nabout the [plaintiff’s] injury,” as the Court indicates on\npages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that “negligence play any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury,” as sug­\ngested at pages 8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17?

In any event, if the Court’s\ntest—whichever version—provides answers to these hypo­\ntheticals, the Court keeps them to itself.\n   Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering\nsuch questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that\nresulted was within the scope of the risk created by the\ndefendant’s negligent act; whether the injury was a natu­\nral or probable consequence of the negligence; whether\nthere was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the\nnegligence was anything more than an antecedent event\nwithout which the harm would not have occurred.\n   The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test\nand have been criticized for that. But they do “furnish\nillustrations of situations which judicious men upon care­\nful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the\nline or the other.” Exxon, 517 U. S., at 839 (internal quo­\ntation marks omitted).\n   The Court forswears all these inquiries and—with\nthem—an accumulated common law history that might\nprovide guidance for courts and juries faced with causa­\ntion questions. See ante, at 1 (FELA “does not incorporate\n‘proximate cause’ standards developed in nonstatutory\ncommon-law tort actions”); ante, at 18 (“it is not error in a\nFELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate\ncause terminology”). It is not necessary to accept every\nverbal formulation of proximate cause ever articulated to\nrecognize that these standards provide useful guidance—\nand that juries should receive some instruction—on the\ntype of link required between a railroad’s negligence and\nan employee’s injury.\n                      *    *     *\n  Law has its limits.

Argued March 28, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011\nRespondent McBride, a locomotive engineer with petitioner CSX\n  Transportation, Inc., an interstate railroad, sustained a debilitating\n  hand injury while switching railroad cars. He filed suit under the\n  Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which holds railroads liable\n  for employees’ injuries “resulting in whole or in part from [carrier]\n  negligence.” 45 U. S. C. §51. McBride alleged that CSX negligently\n  (1) required him to use unsafe switching equipment and (2) failed to\n  train him to operate that equipment. A verdict for McBride would be\n  in order, the District Court instructed, if the jury found that CSX’s\n  negligence “caused or contributed to” his injury. The court declined\n  CSX’s request for additional charges requiring McBride to “show that\n  . . . [CSX’s] negligence was a proximate cause of the injury” and de\n  fining “proximate cause” as “any cause which, in natural or probable\n  sequence, produced the injury complained of.” Instead, relying on\n  Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, the court gave the\n  Seventh Circuit’s pattern FELA instruction: “Defendant ‘caused or\n  contributed to’ Plaintiff’s injury if Defendant’s negligence played a\n  part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.” The jury\n  returned a verdict for McBride.\n      On appeal, CSX renewed its objection to the failure to instruct on\n  proximate cause, now defining the phrase to require a “direct relation\n  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” The\n  appeals court, however, approved the District Court’s instruction and\n  affirmed its judgment for McBride. Because Rogers had relaxed the\n  proximate cause requirement in FELA cases, the court said, an in\n  struction that simply paraphrased Rogers’ language could not be de\n  clared erroneous.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n598 F. 3d 388, affirmed.\n            JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to all but Part III–A, concluding, in accord with FELA’s text\n  and purpose, Rogers, and the uniform view of the federal appellate\n  courts, that FELA does not incorporate stock “proximate cause” stan\n  dards developed in nonstatutory common-law tort actions. The\n  charge proper in FELA cases simply tracks the language Congress\n  employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad “caused or con\n  tributed to” a railroad worker’s injury “if [the railroad’s] negligence\n  played a part—no matter how small—in bringing about the injury.”\n  That, indeed, is the test Congress prescribed for proximate causation\n  in FELA cases. Pp. 4–14, 16–19.\n     (a) CSX’s interpretation of Rogers is not persuasive. Pp. 4–12.\n       (1) Given FELA’s “broad” causation language, Urie v. Thompson,\n  337 U. S. 163, 181, and Congress’ “humanitarian” and “remedial\n  goal[s]” in enacting the statute, FELA’s causation standard is “re\n  laxed” compared to that applicable in common-law tort litigation,\n  Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 542–543.\n  Rogers described that relaxed standard as “whether the proofs justify\n  with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,\n  even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which dam\n  ages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506. Because the District Court’s in\n  struction tracked Rogers’ language, the instruction was plainly\n  proper so long as Rogers actually prescribes the causation definition\n  applicable under FELA. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\n  U. S. 164, 172. CSX, however, contends that Rogers was a narrowly\n  focused decision that did not displace common-law formulations of\n  “proximate cause.” Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurrence\n  in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173, CSX urges\n  that Rogers’ “any part . . . in producing the injury” test displaced only\n  common-law restrictions on recovery for injuries involving contribu\n  tory negligence or other multiple causes, but did not address the req\n  uisite directness of a cause. Pp. 4–6.\n     (2) In Rogers, the employee was burning vegetation that lined his\n  employer’s railroad tracks. A passing train fanned the flames, which\n  spread to the top of the culvert where he was standing. Attempting\n  to escape, he slipped and fell on the sloping gravel covering the cul\n  vert, sustaining serious injuries. 352 U. S., at 501–503. The state\n  court jury returned a verdict for him, but the Missouri Supreme\n  Court reversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in failing to\n  maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the employee was at fault\n  because of his lack of attention to the spreading fire. As the fire “was\n  something extraordinary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the in\n  cline of the gravel,” the court found that “plaintiff’s injury was not the\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nnatural and probable consequence of any negligence of defendant.”\nIbid. This Court reversed. FELA, this Court affirmed, did not incor\nporate any traditional common-law formulation of “proximate causa\ntion[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the defendant’s negli\ngence was the sole, efficient, producing cause of injury.” Id., at 506.\nWhether the railroad’s negligent act was the “immediate reason” for\nthe fall, the Court added, was “irrelevant.” Id., at 503. The Court\nthen announced its “any part . . . in producing the injury” test, id., at\n506.\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive statement of\nFELA’s causation standard. The State Supreme Court there ac\nknowledged that a FELA injury might have multiple causes, but con\nsidered the respondent railroad’s part too indirect to establish the\nrequisite causation. That is the very reasoning this Court rejected in\nRogers. It is also the reasoning CSX asks this Court to resurrect.\nThe interpretation adopted today is informed by the statutory his\ntory, see Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,\n3, the precedents on which Rogers drew, see, e.g., Coray v. Southern\nPacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 523–524, this Court’s subsequent deci\nsions, see, e.g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S.\n521, 523–524, the decisions of every Court of Appeals that reviews\nFELA cases, and the overwhelming majority of state courts and\nscholars. This understanding of Rogers “has been accepted as settled\nlaw for several decades.” IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 32. To\ndiscard or restrict the instruction now would ill serve stare decisis.\nPp. 6–12.\n   (b) CSX nonetheless worries that the Rogers “any part” instruction\nopens the door to unlimited liability, inviting juries to impose liability\non the basis of “but for” causation. A half century’s experience with\nRogers gives little cause for concern: CSX has not identified even one\ntrial in which the instruction generated an absurd or untoward\naward.\n          FELA’s “in whole or in part” language is straightforward.\n“[R]easonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of\n[FELA] negligence,” Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U. S.\n108, 117 (emphasis added). If negligence is proved, however, and is\nshown to have “played any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, then the carrier is answerable in\ndamages even if “ ‘the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it\noccurred’ ” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick, 372 U. S.,\nat 120–121, and n. 8. Properly instructed on negligence and causa\ntion, and told, as is standard practice in FELA cases, to use their\n“common sense” in reviewing the evidence, juries would have no war\nrant to award damages in far out “but for” scenarios, and judges\n4                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

MCBRIDE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nengineer for petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc., which\noperates an interstate system of railroads. On April 12,\n2004, CSX assigned McBride to assist on a local run be­\ntween Evansville, Indiana, and Mount Vernon, Illinois.\nThe run involved frequent starts and stops to add and\nremove individual rail cars, a process known as “switch­\ning.” The train McBride was to operate had an unusual\nengine configuration: two “wide-body” engines followed\nby three smaller conventional cabs. McBride protested\nthat the configuration was unsafe, because switching with\nheavy, wide-body engines required constant use of a hand­\noperated independent brake. But he was told to take the\ntrain as is. About ten hours into the run, McBride injured\nhis hand while using the independent brake. Despite two\nsurgeries and extensive physical therapy, he never re­\ngained full use of the hand.\n  Seeking compensation for his injury, McBride com­\nmenced a FELA action against CSX in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Illinois. He alleged that\nCSX was twice negligent: First, the railroad required him\nto use equipment unsafe for switching; second, CSX failed\nto train him to operate that equipment. App. 24a–26a. A\nverdict for McBride would be in order, the District Court\ninstructed, if the jury found that CSX “was negligent” and\nthat the “negligence caused or contributed to” McBride’s\ninjury. Id., at 23a.\n  CSX sought additional charges that the court declined to\ngive. One of the rejected instructions would have required\n“the plaintiff [to] show that . . . the defendant’s negligence\nwas a proximate cause of the injury.” Id., at 34a. Another\nwould have defined “proximate cause” to mean “any cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of,” with the qualification that a proxi­\nmate cause “need not be the only cause, nor the last or\nnearest cause.” Id., at 32a.\n  Instead, the District Court employed, as McBride re­\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The mere\n    fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean\n    that the injury was caused by negligence.” Id., at 31a.\nFor this instruction, the Seventh Circuit relied upon this\nCourt’s decision in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352\nU. S. 500 (1957). The jury returned a verdict for McBride,\nsetting total damages at $275,000, but reducing that\namount by one-third, the percentage the jury attributed to\nplaintiff’s negligence. App. 29a.\n   CSX appealed to the Seventh Circuit, renewing its ob­\njection to the failure to instruct on “proximate cause.”\nBefore the appellate court, CSX “maintain[ed] that the\ncorrect definition of proximate causation is a ‘direct rela­\ntion between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d 388, 393, n. 3 (2010) (quoting Holmes\nv. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S.\n258, 268 (1992)). A properly instructed jury, CSX con­\ntended, might have found that the chain of causation was\ntoo indirect, or that the engine configuration was unsafe\nbecause of its propensity to cause crashes during switch­\ning, not because of any risk to an engineer’s hands. Brief\nfor Defendant-Appellant in No. 08–3557 (CA7), pp. 49–52.\n   The Court of Appeals approved the District Court’s\ninstruction and affirmed the judgment entered on the\njury’s verdict. Rogers had “relaxed the proximate cause\nrequirement” in FELA cases, the Seventh Circuit con­\ncluded, a view of Rogers “echoed by every other court of\nappeals.” 598 F. 3d, at 399. While acknowledging that a\nhandful of state courts “still appl[ied] traditional formula­\ntions of proximate cause in FELA cases,” id., at 404, n. 7,\nthe Seventh Circuit said it could hardly declare erroneous\n4              CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

S. ___ (2010). That instruction does\nnot include the term “proximate cause,” but does tell the\njury defendant’s negligence must “pla[y] a part—no matter\nhow small—in bringing about the [plaintiff’s] injury.” App.\n31a.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  The railroad business was exceptionally hazardous at\nthe dawn of the twentieth century. As we have recounted,\n“the physical dangers of railroading . . . resulted in the\ndeath or maiming of thousands of workers every year,”\nConsolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,\n542 (1994), including 281,645 casualties in the year 1908\nalone, S. Rep. No. 61–432, p. 2 (1910). Enacted that same\nyear in an effort to “shif[t] part of the human overhead of\ndoing business from employees to their employers,” Gott\nshall, 512 U. S., at 542 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted), FELA prescribes:\n       “Every common carrier by railroad . . . shall be li­\n    able in damages to any person suffering injury while\n    he is employed by such carrier . . . for such injury or\n    death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence\n    of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such car­\n    rier . . . .” 45 U. S. C. §51 (emphasis added).\n  Liability under FELA is limited in these key respects:\nRailroads are liable only to their employees, and only for\ninjuries sustained in the course of employment. FELA’s\nlanguage on causation, however, “is as broad as could be\nframed.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181 (1949).\nGiven the breadth of the phrase “resulting in whole or in\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npart from the [railroad’s] negligence,” and Congress’ “hu­\nmanitarian” and “remedial goal[s],” we have recognized\nthat, in comparison to tort litigation at common law, “a\nrelaxed standard of causation applies under FELA.”\nGottshall, 512 U. S., at 542–543. In our 1957 decision in\nRogers, we described that relaxed standard as follows:\n    “Under [FELA] the test of a jury case is simply\n    whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion\n    that employer negligence played any part, even the\n    slightest, in producing the injury or death for which\n    damages are sought.” 352 U. S., at 506.\n    As the Seventh Circuit emphasized, the instruction the\nDistrict Court gave in this case, permitting a verdict for\nMcBride if “[railroad] negligence played a part—no matter\nhow small—in bringing about the injury,” tracked the\nlanguage of Rogers. If Rogers prescribes the definition of\ncausation applicable under FELA, that instruction was\nplainly proper. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,\n491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (“Considerations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation\n. . . .”). While CSX does not ask us to disturb Rogers, the\nrailroad contends that lower courts have overread that\nopinion. In CSX’s view, shared by the dissent, post, at 9–\n10, Rogers was a narrowly focused decision that did not\ntouch, concern, much less displace common-law formula­\ntions of “proximate cause.”\n    Understanding this argument requires some back­\nground. The term “proximate cause” is shorthand for a\nconcept: Injuries have countless causes, and not all should\ngive rise to legal liability. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of\nTorts §42, p. 273 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and\nKeeton). “What we . . . mean by the word ‘proximate,’ ” one\nnoted jurist has explained, is simply this: “[B]ecause of\nconvenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice,\n6                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events\nbeyond a certain point.” Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co.,\n248 N. Y. 339, 352, 162 N. E. 99, 103 (1928) (Andrews, J.,\ndissenting). Common-law “proximate cause” formulations\nvaried, and were often both constricted and difficult to\ncomprehend. See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 73–77, 812–813\n(2d ed. 1888) (describing, for example, prescriptions pre­\ncluding recovery in the event of any “intervening” cause or\nany contributory negligence). Some courts cut off liability\nif a “proximate cause” was not the sole proximate cause.\nProsser and Keeton §65, p. 452 (noting “tendency . . . to\nlook for some single, principal, dominant, ‘proximate’\ncause of every injury”). Many used definitions resembling\nthose CSX proposed to the District Court or urged in the\nCourt of Appeals. See supra, at 2–3 (CSX proposed key\nwords “natural or probable” or “direct” to describe required\nrelationship between injury and alleged negligent con­\nduct); Prosser and Keeton §43, pp. 282–283.\n   Drawing largely on Justice Souter’s concurring opinion\nin Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 173\n(2007), CSX contends that the Rogers “any part” test\ndisplaced only common-law restrictions on recovery for\ninjuries involving contributory negligence or other “multi­\nple causes.” Brief for Petitioner 35 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).1 Rogers “did not address the requisite\ndirectness of a cause,” CSX argues, hence that question\ncontinues to be governed by restrictive common-law for­\nmulations. Ibid.\n                          B\n  To evaluate CSX’s argument, we turn first to the facts of\nRogers. The employee in that case was injured while\nburning off weeds and vegetation that lined the defen­\n——————\n  1 In Sorrell, the Court held that the causation standard was the same\n\nfor railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, but said\nnothing about what that standard should be. 549 U. S., at 164–165.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndant’s railroad tracks. A passing train had fanned the\nflames, which spread from the vegetation to the top of a\nculvert where the employee was standing. Attempting to\nescape, the employee slipped and fell on the sloping gravel\ncovering the culvert, sustaining serious injuries. 352\nU. S., at 501–503. A Missouri state-court jury returned a\nverdict for the employee, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed. Even if the railroad had been negligent in fail­\ning to maintain a flat surface, the court reasoned, the\nemployee was at fault because of his lack of attention to\nthe spreading fire. Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d\n467, 472 (Mo. 1955). As the fire “was something extraordi­\nnary, unrelated to, and disconnected from the incline of\nthe gravel,” the court felt “obliged to say [that] plaintiff’s\ninjury was not the natural and probable consequence of\nany negligence of defendant.” Ibid.\n   We held that the jury’s verdict should not have been\nupset. Describing two potential readings of the Missouri\nSupreme Court’s opinion, we condemned both. First, the\ncourt erred in concluding that the employee’s negligence\nwas the “sole” cause of the injury, for the jury reasonably\nfound that railroad negligence played a part. Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 504–505. Second, the court erred insofar as it\nheld that the railroad’s negligence was not a sufficient\ncause unless it was the more “probable” cause of the in­\njury. Id., at 505. FELA, we affirmed, did not incorporate\nany traditional common-law formulation of “proximate\ncausation[,] which [requires] the jury [to] find that the\ndefendant’s negligence was the sole, efficient, producing\ncause of injury.” Id., at 506. Whether the railroad’s negli­\ngent act was the “immediate reason” for the fall, we added,\nwas “an irrelevant consideration.” Id., at 503. We then\nannounced the “any part” test, id., at 506, and reiterated it\nseveral times. See, e.g., id., at 507 (“narro[w]” and “single\ninquiry” is whether “negligence of the employer played\nany part at all” in bringing about the injury); id., at 508\n8                  CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(FELA case “rarely presents more than the single question\nwhether negligence of the employer played any part, how­\never small, in the injury”).2\n   Rogers is most sensibly read as a comprehensive state­\nment of the FELA causation standard. Notably, the Mis­\nsouri Supreme Court in Rogers did not doubt that a FELA\ninjury might have multiple causes, including railroad\nnegligence and employee negligence. See 284 S. W. 2d, at\n472 (reciting FELA’s “in whole or in part” language). But\nthe railroad’s part, according to the state court, was too\nindirect, not sufficiently “natural and probable,” to estab­\nlish the requisite causation. Ibid. That is the very reason­\ning the Court rejected in Rogers. It is also the reasoning\nCSX asks us to resurrect.\n   Our understanding is informed by the statutory history\nand precedent on which Rogers drew. Before FELA was\nenacted, the “harsh and technical” rules of state common\nlaw had “made recovery difficult or even impossible” for in­\njured railroad workers. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Vir\nginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, 3 (1964). “[D]issatisfied with\nthe [railroad’s] common-law duty,” Congress sought to “sup­\nplan[t] that duty with [FELA’s] far more drastic duty of\npaying damages for injury or death at work due in\nwhole or in part to the employer’s negligence.” Rogers, 352\nU. S., at 507. Yet, Rogers observed, the Missouri court\nand other lower courts continued to ignore FELA’s “sig­\nnifican[t]” departures from the “ordinary common-law\n\n——————\n  2 In face of Rogers’ repeated admonition that the “any part . . . in pro­\n\nducing the injury” test was the single test for causation under FELA,\nthe dissent speculates that Rogers was simply making a veiled ref­\nerence to a particular form of modified comparative negligence, i.e.,\nallowing plaintiff to prevail on showing that her negligence was “slight”\nwhile the railroad’s was “gross.” Post, at 9–10. That is not what Rogers\nconveyed. To repeat, Rogers instructed that “the test of a jury case\n[under FELA] is simply whether . . . employer negligence played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.” 352 U. S., at 506.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnegligence” scheme, to reinsert common-law formulations\nof causation involving “probabilities,” and consequently to\n“deprive litigants of their right to a jury determination.”\nId., at 507, 509–510. Aiming to end lower court disre-\ngard of congressional purpose, the Rogers Court repeatedly\ncalled the “any part” test the “single” inquiry determining\ncausation in FELA cases. Id., at 507, 508 (emphasis\nadded). In short, CSX’s argument that the Rogers stan­\ndard concerns only division of responsibility among multi­\nple actors, and not causation more generally, misses the\nthrust of our decision in that case.\n   Tellingly, in announcing the “any part . . . in producing\nthe injury” test, Rogers cited Coray v. Southern Pacific\nCo., 335 U. S. 520 (1949), a decision emphasizing that\nFELA had parted from traditional common-law formula­\ntions of causation. What qualified as a “proximate” or\nlegally sufficient cause in FELA cases, Coray had ex­\nplained, was determined by the statutory phrase “result­\ning in whole or in part,” which Congress “selected . . . to fix\nliability” in language that was “simple and direct.” Id., at\n524. That straightforward phrase, Coray observed, was\nincompatible with “dialectical subtleties” that common-law\ncourts employed to determine whether a particular cause\nwas sufficiently “substantial” to constitute a proximate\ncause. Id., at 523–524.3\n   Our subsequent decisions have confirmed that Rogers\n——————\n  3 The dissent, while recognizing “the variety of formulations” courts\nhave employed to define “proximate cause,” post, at 2, does not say\nwhich of the many formulations it would declare applicable in FELA\ncases. We regard the phrase “negligence played a part—no matter how\nsmall,” see Rogers, 352 U. S., at 508, as synonymous with “negligence\nplayed any part, even the slightest,” see id., at 506, and the phrase “in\nproducing the injury” as synonymous with the phrase “in bringing\nabout the injury.” We therefore approve both the Seventh Circuit’s\ninstruction and the “any part, even the slightest, in producing the\ninjury” formulation. The host of definitions of proximate cause, in\ncontrast, are hardly synonymous.\n10                CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nannounced a general standard for causation in FELA\ncases, not one addressed exclusively to injuries involv-\ning multiple potentially cognizable causes. The very day\nRogers was announced, we applied its “any part” instruc­\ntion in a case in which the sole causation issue was the\ndirectness or foreseeability of the connection between the\ncarrier’s negligence and the plaintiff’s injury. See Fergu\nson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 523–\n524 (1957) (plurality opinion).\n   A few years later, in Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108 (1963), we held jury findings for the plaintiff\nproper in a case presenting the following facts: For years,\nthe railroad had allowed a fetid pool, containing “dead and\ndecayed rats and pigeons,” to accumulate near its right-of­\nway; while standing near the pool, the plaintiff-employee\nsuffered an insect bite that became infected and required\namputation of his legs. Id., at 109. The appellate court\nhad concluded there was insufficient evidence of causation\nto warrant submission of the case to the jury. Id., at\n112. We reversed, reciting the causation standard Rogers\nannounced. Id., at 116–117, 120–121. See also Crane v.\nCedar Rapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166–167\n(1969) (contrasting suit by railroad employee, who “is not\nrequired to prove common-law proximate causation but\nonly that his injury resulted ‘in whole or in part’ from the\nrailroad’s violation,” with suit by nonemployee, where\n“definition of causation . . . [is] left to state law”); Gott\nshall, 512 U. S., at 543 (“relaxed standard of causation\napplies under FELA”).4\n——————\n   4 CSX and the dissent observe, correctly, that some of our pre-Rogers\n\ndecisions invoked common-law formulations of proximate cause. See,\ne.g., Brady v. Southern R. Co., 320 U. S. 476, 483 (1943) (injury must\nbe “the natural and probable consequence of the negligence” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the “natural or probable” charge\nthat CSX requested was drawn from Brady, which in turn relied on a\npre-FELA case, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469,\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

See supra,\nat 2–3. The current model federal instruction, recognizing\nthat the “FELA causation standard is distinct from the\nusual proximate cause standard,” reads:\n     “The fourth element [of a FELA action] is whether an\n     injury to the plaintiff resulted in whole or part from\n     the negligence of the railroad or its employees or\n     agents. In other words, did such negligence play any\n——————\n475 (1877). But other pre-Rogers FELA decisions invoked no common­\nlaw formulations. See, e.g., Union Pacific R. Co. v. Huxoll, 245 U. S.\n535, 537 (1918) (approving instruction asking whether negligence “con­\ntribute[d] ‘in whole or in part’ to cause the death”); Coray v. South-\nern Pacific Co., 335 U. S. 520, 524 (1949) (rejecting use of common-law\n“dialectical subtleties” concerning the term “proximate cause,” and ap­\nproving use of “simple and direct” statutory language). We rely on\nRogers not because “time begins in 1957,” post, at 7, but because Rogers\nstated a clear instruction, comprehensible by juries: Did the railroad’s\n“negligence pla[y] any part, even the slightest, in producing [the plain­\ntiff ’s] injury”? 352 U. S., at 506. In so instructing, Rogers replaced the\narray of formulations then prevalent. We have repeated the Rogers\ninstruction in subsequent opinions, and lower courts have employed it\nfor over 50 years.

In Norfolk\nSouthern R. Co. v. Schumpert, 270 Ga. App. 782, 783–786, 608 S. E. 2d\n236, 238–239 (2004), the employee was injured while replacing a\ncoupling device that fell to the ground because of a negligently absent\npin; the court upheld a jury award. In our view, the causal link in\nthese cases is hardly farfetched; in fact, in both, the lower courts\nobserved that the evidence did not show mere “but for” causation. See\nRichards, 330 F. 3d, at 437, and n. 5; Schumpert, 270 Ga. App., at 784,\n608 S. E. 2d, at 239.\n   10 See, e.g., Summers, 132 F. 3d, at 606; Oglesby v. Southern Pacific\n\nTransp.

S., at 524, the Rogers instruction uses the everyday\nwords contained in the statute itself. Jurors can compre­\nhend those words and apply them in light of their ex­\nperience and common sense. Unless and until Congress\norders otherwise, we see no good reason to tamper with an\ninstruction tied to FELA’s text, long employed by lower\ncourts, and hardly shown to be unfair or unworkable.\n                              A\n   As we have noted, see supra, at 5–6, the phrase “proxi­\nmate cause” is shorthand for the policy-based judgment\nthat not all factual causes contributing to an injury should\nbe legally cognizable causes. Prosser and Keeton explain:\n“In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go\nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to\nthe dawn of human events, and beyond.” §41, p. 264. To\nprevent “infinite liability,” ibid., courts and legislatures\nappropriately place limits on the chain of causation that\nmay support recovery on any particular claim.\n   The term “proximate cause” itself is hardly essential to\nthe imposition of such limits. It is a term notoriously\nconfusing. See, e.g., Prosser and Keeton §42, p. 273 (“The\nword ’proximate’ is a legacy of Lord Chancellor Bacon, who\nin his time committed other sins. . . . It is an unfortunate\nword, which places an entirely wrong emphasis upon the\nfactor of physical or mechanical closeness. For this reason\n‘legal cause’ or perhaps even ‘responsible cause’ would be a\nmore appropriate term.” (footnotes omitted)).\n   And the lack of consensus on any one definition of\n“proximate cause” is manifest.

Rev. 303, 311 (1912).\n   Notably, CSX itself did not settle on a uniform definition\nof the term “proximate cause” in this litigation, nor does\nthe dissent. In the District Court, CSX requested a jury\ninstruction defining “proximate cause” to mean “any cause\nwhich, in natural or probable sequence, produced the\ninjury complained of.” App. 32a. On appeal, “CSX main­\ntain[ed] that the correct definition . . . is a ‘direct relation\nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.’ ” 598 F. 3d, at 393, n. 3. Before this Court, CSX\ncalled for “a demonstration that the plaintiff’s injury\nresulted from the wrongful conduct in a way that was\nnatural, probable, and foreseeable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 9–10.\n   Lay triers, studies show, are scarcely aided by charges\nso phrased. See Steele & Thornburg, Jury Instructions: A\nPersistent Failure to Communicate, 67 N. C. L. Rev. 77,\n88–92, 110 (1988) (85% of actual and potential jurors were\nunable to understand a pattern proximate cause instruc­\ntion similar to the one requested by CSX); Charrow &\nCharrow, Making Legal Language Understandable: A\nPsycholinguistic Study of Jury Instructions, 79 Colum.\nL. Rev. 1306, 1353 (1979) (nearly one quarter of subjects\nmisunderstood proximate cause to mean “approximate\ncause” or “estimated cause”). In light of the potential of\n“proximate cause” instructions to leave jurors at sea, it is\nnot surprising that the drafters of the Restatement (Third)\nof Torts avoided the term altogether. See 1 Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional\nHarm §29 (2005) (confining liability to “harms that result\nfrom the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious”); id.,\n16                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nComment b.\n   Congress, it is true, has written the words “proximate\ncause” into a number of statutes.11 But when the legisla­\ntive text uses less legalistic language, e.g., “caused by,”\n“occasioned by,” “in consequence of,” or, as in FELA,\n“resulting in whole or in part from,” and the legislative\npurpose is to loosen constraints on recovery, there is\nlittle reason for courts to hark back to stock, judge-made\nproximate-cause formulations. See Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), 25 Harv. L. Rev. 223, 235\n(1912).\n                              B\n   FELA’s language is straightforward: railroads are made\nanswerable in damages for an employee’s “injury or death\nresulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence.” 45\nU. S. C. §51. The argument for importing into FELA’s text\n“previous judicial definitions or dicta” originating in non­\nstatutory common-law actions, see Smith, Legal Cause in\nActions of Tort (Continued), supra, at 235, misapprehends\nhow foreseeability figures in FELA cases.\n   “[R]easonable foreseeability of harm,” we clarified in\nGallick, is indeed “an essential ingredient of [FELA] neg\nligence.” 372 U. S., at 117 (emphasis added). The jury,\ntherefore, must be asked, initially: Did the carrier “fai[l] to\nobserve that degree of care which people of ordinary pru­\ndence and sagacity would use under the same or similar\ncircumstances[?]” Id., at 118. In that regard, the jury\nmay be told that “[the railroad’s] duties are measured by\n\n——————\n   11 See, e.g., Act of Sept. 7, 1916, ch. 458, §1, 39 Stat. 742–743 (United\n\nStates not liable to injured employee whose “intoxication . . . is the\nproximate cause of the injury”); Act of Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 105, §306, 40\nStat. 407 (United States liable to member of Armed Forces for post­\ndischarge disability that “proximately result[ed] from [a pre-discharge]\ninjury”); Act of June 5, 1924, ch. 261, §2, 43 Stat. 389 (United States\nliable for “any disease proximately caused” by federal employment).\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

Thus, “[i]f a per­\nson has no reasonable ground to anticipate that a par­\nticular condition . . . would or might result in a mishap\nand injury, then the party is not required to do anything\nto correct [the] condition.” Id., at 118, n. 7 (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted).12 If negligence is proved, however,\nand is shown to have “played any part, even the slightest,\nin producing the injury,” Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506 (empha­\nsis added),13 then the carrier is answerable in damages\neven if “the extent of the [injury] or the manner in which it\noccurred” was not “[p]robable” or “foreseeable.” Gallick,\n372 U.

Indeed, judges\nwould have no warrant to submit such cases to the jury.\nSee Nicholson v. Erie R.

But under\nRogers and the pattern instructions based on Rogers, the jury must find\nthat defendant’s negligence in fact “played a part—no matter how\nsmall—in bringing about the injury.” See supra, at 2–3, 11–12 (Sev­\nenth Circuit pattern instruction and model federal instructions).\n18                CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

See also supra, at 13 (Rogers has generated no\nextravagant jury awards or appellate court decisions).\n  In addition to the constraints of common sense, FELA’s\nlimitations on who may sue, and for what, reduce the risk\nof exorbitant liability. As earlier noted, see supra, at 4,\nthe statute confines the universe of compensable injuries\nto those sustained by employees, during employment. §51.\nHence there are no unforeseeable plaintiffs in FELA cases.\nAnd the statute weeds out the injuries most likely to bear\nonly a tenuous relationship to railroad negligence, namely,\nthose occurring outside the workplace.14\n  There is a real risk, on the other hand, that the “in\nnatural or probable sequence” charge sought by CSX\nwould mislead. If taken to mean the plaintiff’s injury\nmust probably (“more likely than not”) follow from the\nrailroad’s negligent conduct, then the force of FELA’s\n“resulting in whole or in part” language would be blunted.\nRailroad negligence would “probably” cause a worker’s in­\njury only if that negligence was a dominant contributor to\nthe injury, not merely a contributor in any part.\n                       *      *    *\n  For the reasons stated, it is not error in a FELA case to\nrefuse a charge embracing stock proximate cause termi­\nnology.

Merchants’ Louisville\nIns. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837) (Story, J.). The Court\ntoday holds that this principle does not apply to actions\nunder the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), and\nthat those suing under that statute may recover for inju­\nries that were not proximately caused by the negligence\nof their employers. This even though we have held that\nFELA generally follows the common law, unless the Act\nexpressly provides otherwise; even though FELA expressly\nabrogated common law rules in four other respects, but\nsaid nothing about proximate cause; and even though our\nown cases, for 50 years after the passage of FELA, repeat­\nedly recognized that proximate cause was required for\nrecovery under that statute.\n   The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar ele­\nment of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an ele­\nment “generally thought to be a necessary limitation on\nliability,” Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830,\n838 (1996). The test the Court would substitute—whether\nnegligence played any part, even the slightest, in produc­\n2              CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957),\nsupports such a boundless theory of liability.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                                I\n   “Unlike a typical workers’ compensation scheme, which\nprovides relief without regard to fault, . . . FELA provides\na statutory cause of action sounding in negligence.” Nor\nfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 165 (2007).\nWhen Congress creates such a federal tort, “we start from\nthe premise” that Congress “adopts the background of\ngeneral tort law.” Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). With respect to FELA in par­\nticular, we have explained that “[a]bsent express language\nto the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are deter­\nmined by reference to the common law.” Sorrell, supra, at\n165–166; see Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 182 (1949).\n   Recovery for negligence has always required a showing\nof proximate cause. “ ‘In a philosophical sense, the con­\nsequences of an act go forward to eternity.’ ” Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258,\n266, n. 10 (1992) (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,\n& D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §41, p.\n264 (5th ed. 1984)). Law, however, is not philosophy, and\nthe concept of proximate cause developed at common law\nin response to the perceived need to distinguish “but for”\ncause from those more direct causes of injury that can\nform the basis for liability at law.\n   The plurality breaks no new ground in criticizing the\nvariety of formulations of the concept of proximate cause,\nante, at 14–15; courts, commentators, and first-year law\nstudents have been doing that for generations. See Exxon,\nsupra, at 838. But it is often easier to disparage the prod­\nuct of centuries of common law than to devise a plausible\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Proximate cause is hardly the\nonly enduring common law concept that is useful despite\nits imprecision, see ante, at 14. It is in good company with\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, necessity, willfulness,\nand unconscionability—to name just a few.\n   Proximate cause refers to the basic requirement that\nbefore recovery is allowed in tort, there must be “some\ndirect relation between the injury asserted and the injuri­\nous conduct alleged,” Holmes, 503 U. S., at 268. It ex­\ncludes from the scope of liability injuries that are “too\nremote,” “purely contingent,” or “indirect[ ].” Id., at 268,\n271, 274. Recognizing that liability must not attach to\n“every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged\nwrongdoing,” proximate cause requires a “causal connec­\ntion between the wrong and the injury,” Associated Gen.\nContractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 536,\n533, n. 26 (1983), that is not so “tenuous . . . that what is\nclaimed to be consequence is only fortuity,” Exxon, supra,\nat 838 (internal quotation marks omitted). It limits liabil­\nity at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of\nthe kingdom. When FELA was passed, as now, “[t]he\nquestion whether damage in a given case is proximate or\nremote [was] one of great importance. . . . [T]he determi­\nnation of it determines legal right,” 1 T. Street, Founda­\ntions of Legal Liability 110 (1906) (reprint 1980).\n   FELA expressly abrogated common law tort principles\nin four specific ways. See Sorrell, supra, at 166, 168; Con\nsolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532,\n542–543 (1994). As enacted in 1908, the Act abolished the\ncommon law contributory negligence rule, which barred\nplaintiffs whose negligence had contributed to their inju­\nries from recovering for the negligence of another. See Act\nof Apr. 22, §3, 35 Stat. 66. FELA also abandoned the so­\ncalled fellow-servant rule, §1, prohibited an assumption of\nrisk defense in certain cases, §4, and barred employees\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfrom contractually releasing their employers from liability,\n§5.\n  But “[o]nly to the extent of these explicit statutory\nalterations is FELA an avowed departure from the rules of\nthe common law.” Gottshall, supra, at 544 (internal quo­\ntation marks omitted). FELA did not abolish the familiar\nrequirement of proximate cause. Because “Congress ex­\npressly dispensed with [certain] common-law doctrines”\nin FELA but “did not deal at all with [other] equally well­\nestablished doctrine[s],” I do not believe that “Congress\nintended to abrogate [the other] doctrine[s] sub silentio.”\nMonessen Southwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330,\n337–338 (1988).\n  We have applied the standard requirement of proximate\ncause to actions under federal statutes where the text did\nnot expressly provide for it. See Dura Pharmaceuticals,\nInc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 342–346 (2005) (securities\nfraud); Holmes, supra, at 268–270 (Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act); Associated Gen. Contrac\ntors of Cal., Inc., supra, at 529–535 (Clayton Act); cf.\nMetropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy,\n460 U. S. 766, 774 (1983) (“the terms ‘environmental ef­\nfect’ and ‘environmental impact’ in [the National Envi­\nronmental Policy Act of 1969 should] be read to include a\nrequirement of a reasonably close causal relationship\nbetween a change in the physical environment and the\neffect at issue . . . . like the familiar doctrine of proximate\ncause from tort law”).\n  The Court does not explicitly rest its argument on its\nown reading of FELA’s text. The jury instruction on cau­\nsation it approves, however, derives from Section 1 of\nFELA, 45 U. S. C. §51. See ante, at 1, 16–17. But nothing\nin Section 1 is similar to the “express language” Congress\nemployed elsewhere in FELA when it wanted to abrogate\na common law rule, Sorrell, supra, at 165–166. See, e.g.,\n§53 (“the fact that the employee may have been guilty of\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncontributory negligence shall not bar a recovery”); §54\n(“employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of\nhis employment”).\n   As the very first section of the statute, Section 1 simply\noutlines who could be sued by whom and for what types\nof injuries. It provides that “[e]very common carrier by\nrailroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suf­\nfering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . . for\nsuch injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the\nnegligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of\nsuch carrier.” §51. The Court’s theory seems to be that\nthe words “in whole or in part” signal a departure from the\nhistoric requirement of proximate cause. But those words\nserved a very different purpose. They did indeed mark an\nimportant departure from a common law principle, but it\nwas the principle of contributory negligence—not proxi­\nmate cause.\n   As noted, FELA abolished the defense of contributory\nnegligence; the “in whole or in part” language simply re­\nflected the fact that the railroad would remain liable\neven if its negligence was not the sole cause of injury. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 170. The Congress that was so clear\nwhen it was abolishing common law limits on recovery\nelsewhere in FELA did not abrogate the fundamental\nprinciple of proximate cause in the oblique manner the\nCourt suggests. “[I]f Congress had intended such a sea\nchange” in negligence principles “it would have said so\nclearly.” Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior\nUniv. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 14).\n   The language the Court adopts as an instruction on\ncausation requires only that negligence have “ ‘played any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury.’ ” Ante, at\n17 (quoting Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506; emphasis deleted);\nsee also ante, at 18–19 (“Juries in such cases are properly\ninstructed that a defendant railroad ‘caused or contributed\n6               CSX TRANSP., INC. v.

S. 430, 435\n(1949) (“if the jury determines that the defendant’s breach\nis a contributory proximate cause of injury, it may find for\nthe plaintiff” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nO’Donnell v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 338 U. S. 384, 394\n(1949) (“plaintiff was entitled to a[n] . . . instruction . . .\nwhich rendered defendant liable for injuries proximately\nresulting therefrom”).\n   A comprehensive treatise written shortly after Congress\nenacted FELA confirmed that “the plaintiff must . . . show\nthat the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of\nthe damage” in order to recover. 1 M. Roberts, Federal Li­\nabilities of Carriers §538, p. 942 (1918). As Justice Souter\nhas explained, for the half century after the enactment\nof FELA, the Court “consistently recognized and applied\nproximate cause as the proper standard in FELA suits.”\nSorrell, supra, at 174 (concurring opinion).\n   No matter. For the Court, time begins in 1957, with our\nopinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500.\n   That opinion, however, “left this law where it was.” Sor\nrell, supra, at 174 (Souter, J., concurring). A jury in that\ncase awarded Rogers damages against his railroad em­\nployer, but the Supreme Court of Missouri reversed the\njury verdict. As the Court explains today, we suggested in\nRogers that there were “two potential readings” of the\nlower court’s opinion and that both were wrong. Ante, at\n7. In doing so, we clarified the consequences of FELA’s\nelimination of the common law contributory negligence\nrule. We did not do what Congress chose not to do, and\nabrogate the rule of proximate cause.\n   First, we rejected the idea “that [Rogers’s] conduct was\nthe sole cause of his mishap.” 352 U. S., at 504 (emphasis\nadded); contra, Rogers v. Thompson, 284 S. W. 2d 467, 472\n(Mo. 1955) (while “[Rogers] was confronted by an emer­\n8              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngency[,] . . . it was an emergency brought about by him­\nself”). There were, we explained, “probative facts from\nwhich the jury could find that [the railroad] was or should\nhave been aware of conditions which created a likelihood\nthat [Rogers] . . . would suffer just such an injury as he\ndid.” 352 U. S., at 503. We noted that “[c]ommon experi­\nence teaches both that a passing train will fan the flames\nof a fire, and that a person suddenly enveloped in flames\nand smoke will instinctively react by retreating from the\ndanger.” Ibid. In referring to this predictable sequence\nof events, we described—in familiar terms—sufficient evi­\ndence of proximate cause. We therefore held that the\nrailroad’s negligence could have been a cause of Rogers’s\ninjury regardless of whether “the immediate reason” why\nRogers slipped was the railroad’s negligence in permitting\ngravel to remain on the surface or some other cause. Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   Rogers thereby clarified that, under a statute in which\nemployer and employee could both be proximate causes of\nan injury, a railroad’s negligence need not be the sole or\nlast cause in order to be proximate. That is an application\nof proximate cause, not a repudiation of it. See Street 111\n(“a cause may be sufficiently near in law to the damage to\nbe considered its effective legal cause without by any\nmeans being the nearest or most proximate to the causes\nwhich contribute of the injury”); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Torts\n§180, p. 445 (2001).\n   We then considered a second interpretation. The Mis­\nsouri Supreme Court’s opinion could alternatively be read\nas having held that Rogers’s “conduct was at least as\nprobable a cause for his mishap as any negligence of the\n[railroad],” and that—in those circumstances—“there was\nno case for the jury.” 352 U. S., at 505 (emphasis added).\nIf this was the principle the court applied below, it was\nalso wrong and for many of the same reasons.\n   Under a comparative negligence scheme in which multi­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nple causes may act concurrently, we clarified that a rail­\nroad’s negligence need not be the “sole, efficient, produc-\ning cause of injury,” id., at 506. The question was simply\nwhether “employer negligence played any part, even the\nslightest, in producing the injury.” Ibid. “It does not\nmatter,” we continued, “that, from the evidence, the jury\nmay also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute\nthe result to other causes, including the employee’s con\ntributory negligence.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   The Court today takes the “any part, even the slightest”\nlanguage out of context and views it as a rejection of proxi­\nmate cause. But Rogers was talking about contributory\nnegligence—it said so—and the language it chose confirms\njust that. “Slight” negligence was familiar usage in this\ncontext. The statute immediately preceding FELA, passed\njust two years earlier in 1906, moved part way from con­\ntributory to comparative negligence. It provided that “the\nfact that the employee may have been guilty of contribu­\ntory negligence shall not bar a recovery where his contrib­\nutory negligence was slight and that of the employer\nwas gross in comparison.” Act of June 11, 1906, §2, 34\nStat. 232. Other statutes similarly made this halfway\nstop on the road from contributory to pure comparative\nnegligence, again using the term “slight.” See Dobbs §201,\nat 503 (“One earlier [version of comparative fault] . . .\nallowed the negligent plaintiff to recover if the plaintiff’s\nnegligence was slight and the defendant’s gross. . . . Mod­\nern comparative negligence law works differently, reduc­\ning the plaintiff’s recovery in proportion to the plaintiff’s\nfault”); V. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence §2.01[b][2],\np. 33 (5th ed. 2010) (a “major form of modified comparative\nnegligence is the ‘slight-gross’ system”); id. §3.04[b], at\n75. In 1908, FELA completed the transition to pure com­\nparative negligence with respect to rail workers. See\nDobbs §201, at 503. Under FELA, it does not matter\nwhose negligence was “slight” or “gross.” The use of the term\n10              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n“even the slightest” in Rogers makes perfect sense when\nthe decision is understood to be about multiple causes—\nnot about how direct any particular cause must be. See\nSorrell, 549 U. S., at 175 (Souter, J., concurring) (perti­\nnent language concerned “multiplicity of causations,” not\n“the necessary directness of . . . causation”).\n   The Court views Rogers as “describ[ing] the test for\nproximate causation” under FELA, ante, at 13 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but Rogers itself says nothing of\nthe sort. See 352 U. S., at 506 (describing its test as “the\ntest of a jury case” (emphasis added)). Rogers did not set\nforth a novel standard for proximate cause—much less an\ninstruction designed to guide jurors in determining causa­\ntion. Indeed, the trial court in Rogers used the term\n“proximate cause” in its jury instruction and directed the\njury to find that Rogers could not recover if his injuries\n“were not directly . . . caused by” the railroad’s negligence.\nId., at 505, n. 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion quoted that instruction, ibid., but “took no issue\nwith [it] in this respect,” Sorrell, supra, at 176 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n   A few of our cases have characterized Rogers as hold-\ning that “a relaxed standard of causation applies under\nFELA.” Gottshall, 512 U. S., at 543; see Crane v. Cedar\nRapids & Iowa City R. Co., 395 U. S. 164, 166 (1969). Fair\nenough; but these passing summations of Rogers do not\nalter its holding. FELA did, of course, change common law\nrules relating to causation in one respect: Under FELA, a\nrailroad’s negligence did not have to be the exclusive cause\nof an injury. See Gottshall, supra, at 542–543 (“Congress\ndid away with several common-law tort defenses . . . .\nSpecifically, the statute . . . rejected the doctrine of con­\ntributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli­\ngence”). And, unlike under FELA’s predecessor, the pro­\nportionate degree of the employee’s negligence would not\nnecessarily bar his recovery. But we have never held—\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

J., dissenting\n\nuntil today—that FELA entirely eliminates proximate\ncause as a limit on liability.\n                             III\n   The Court is correct that the federal courts of appeals\nhave read Rogers to support the adoption of instructions\nlike the one given here. But we do not resolve questions\nsuch as the one before us by a show of hands. See Buck\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of\nHealth and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 605 (2001);\nid., at 621 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“The dissent’s insis­\ntence that we defer to the ‘clear majority’ of Circuit opin­\nion is particularly peculiar in the present case, since that\nmajority has been nurtured and preserved by our own\nmisleading dicta”); cf. McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.\n350, 365 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (pointing out that\n“[e]very court to consider the matter” had disagreed with\nthe majority’s holding).\n   In addition, the Court discounts the views of those state\ncourts of last resort that agree FELA did not relegate\nproximate cause to the dustbin. Those courts either reject\nthe position the Court adopts today or suggest that FELA\ndoes not entirely eliminate proximate cause. See Ballard\nv. Union Pacific R. Co., 279 Neb. 638, 644, 781 N.

See also\nNorfolk Southern R. Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U.

J., dissenting\n\n   Even the Court seems to appreciate that it is creating a\ntroubling gap in the FELA negligence action and ought to\ndo something to patch it over. The something it proposes\nis “[r]easonable foreseeability of harm,” ante, at 16 (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). Foreseeability as a test for\nproximate causation would be one thing; foreseeability\nhas, after all, long been an aspect of proximate cause. But\nthat is not the test the Court prescribes. It instead limits\nthe foreseeability inquiry to whether the defendant was\nnegligent in the first place.\n   The Court observes that juries may be instructed that a\ndefendant’s negligence depends on “what a reasonably\nprudent person would anticipate or foresee as creating a\npotential for harm.” 5 L. Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury\nInstructions–Civil ¶89.10, p. 89–21 (2010); see ante, at 16–\n17. That’s all fine and good when a defendant’s negligence\nresults directly in the plaintiff’s injury (nevermind that no\n“reasonable foreseeability” instruction was given in this\ncase). For instance, if I drop a piano from a window and it\nfalls on a person, there is no question that I was negligent\nand could have foreseen that the piano would hit some­\none—as, in fact, it did. The problem for the Court’s test\narises when the negligence does not directly produce the\ninjury to the plaintiff: I drop a piano; it cracks the side­\nwalk; during sidewalk repairs weeks later a man barreling\ndown the sidewalk on a bicycle hits a cone that repairmen\nhave placed around their worksite, and is injured. Was\nI negligent in dropping the piano because I could have\nforeseen “a mishap and injury,” ante, at 17 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted)? Yes. Did my\nnegligence cause “[the] mishap and injury” that resulted?\nIt depends on what is meant by cause. My negligence was\na “but for” cause of the injury: If I had not dropped the\npiano, the bicyclist would not have crashed. But is it a\n—————— \n\nas the cause of negligently inflicted harm”). \n\n14              CSX TRANSP., INC. v. MCBRIDE\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlegal cause? No.\n    In one respect the Court’s test is needlessly rigid. If\ncourts must instruct juries on foreseeability as an aspect\nof negligence, why not instruct them on foreseeability as\nan aspect of causation? And if the jury is simply supposed\nto intuit that there should also be limits on the legal chain\nof causation—and that “but for” cause is not enough—why\nhide the ball? Why not simply tell the jury? Finally, if\nthe Court intends “foreseeability of harm” to be a kind\nof poorman’s proximate cause, then where does the Court\nfind that requirement in the test Rogers—or FELA—pre­\nscribes? Could it be derived from the common law?\n    Where does “foreseeability of harm” as the sole protec­\ntion against limitless liability run out of steam? An an­\nswer would seem only fair to the common law.\n    A railroad negligently fails to maintain its boiler, which\noverheats. An employee becomes hot while repairing it\nand removes his jacket. When finished with the repairs,\nhe grabs a thermos of coffee, which spills on his now-bare\narm, burning it. Was the risk that someone would be\nharmed by the failure to maintain the boiler foreseeable?\nWas the risk that an employee would be burned while\nrepairing the overheated boiler foreseeable? Can the\nrailroad be liable under the Court’s test for the coffee\nburn? According to the Court’s opinion, it does not matter\nthat the “manner in which [the injury] occurred was not\n. . . foreseeable,” ante, at 17 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), so long as some negligence—any negligence at\nall—can be established.\n    The Court’s opinion fails to settle on a single test for\nanswering these questions: Is it that the railroad’s negli­\ngence “pla[y] a part—no matter how small—in bringing\nabout the [plaintiff’s] injury,” as the Court indicates on\npages 5, 17 note 13, and 19, or that “negligence play any\npart, even the slightest, in producing the injury,” as sug­\ngested at pages 8 note 2, 11 note 4, and 17?

In any event, if the Court’s\ntest—whichever version—provides answers to these hypo­\ntheticals, the Court keeps them to itself.\n   Proximate cause supplies the vocabulary for answering\nsuch questions. It is useful to ask whether the injury that\nresulted was within the scope of the risk created by the\ndefendant’s negligent act; whether the injury was a natu­\nral or probable consequence of the negligence; whether\nthere was a superseding or intervening cause; whether the\nnegligence was anything more than an antecedent event\nwithout which the harm would not have occurred.\n   The cases do not provide a mechanical or uniform test\nand have been criticized for that. But they do “furnish\nillustrations of situations which judicious men upon care­\nful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the\nline or the other.” Exxon, 517 U. S., at 839 (internal quo­\ntation marks omitted).\n   The Court forswears all these inquiries and—with\nthem—an accumulated common law history that might\nprovide guidance for courts and juries faced with causa­\ntion questions. See ante, at 1 (FELA “does not incorporate\n‘proximate cause’ standards developed in nonstatutory\ncommon-law tort actions”); ante, at 18 (“it is not error in a\nFELA case to refuse a charge embracing stock proximate\ncause terminology”). It is not necessary to accept every\nverbal formulation of proximate cause ever articulated to\nrecognize that these standards provide useful guidance—\nand that juries should receive some instruction—on the\ntype of link required between a railroad’s negligence and\nan employee’s injury.\n                      *    *     *\n  Law has its limits.
