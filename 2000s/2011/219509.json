NEW MEXICO\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW MEXICO\n\n     No. 09\u201310876.       Argued March 2, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause gives the accused \u201c[i]n\n  all criminal prosecutions, . . . the right . . . to be confronted with the\n  witnesses against him.\u201d In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59,\n  this Court held that the Clause permits admission of \u201c[t]estimonial\n  statements of witnesses absent from trial . . . only where the decla\n  rant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior\n  opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\n  setts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a \u201cforensic evidence\u201d\n  exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, cre\n  ated specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked\n  as \u201ctestimonial\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes. Absent stipula\n  tion, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a re\n  port without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth\n  of the report\u2019s statements. 557 U. S., at ___.\n     Petitioner Bullcoming\u2019s jury trial on charges of driving while in\n  toxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.\n  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certi\n  fying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the thresh\n  old for aggravated DWI. Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample had been tested\n  at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Divi\n  sion (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed,\n  signed, and certified the report. However, the prosecution neither\n  called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record\n  showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undis\n  closed reason. In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst,\n  Razatos, to validate the report. Razatos was familiar with the testing\n  device used to analyze Bullcoming\u2019s blood and with the laboratory\u2019s\n  testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the\n  test on Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample. Bullcoming\u2019s counsel objected, as\n2                   BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    serting that introduction of Caylor\u2019s report without his testimony\n    would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled\n    the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and\n    permitted Razatos to testify. Bullcoming was convicted, and, while\n    his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this\n    Court decided Melendez-Diaz. The state high court acknowledged\n    that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under\n    Melendez-Diaz, but held that the report\u2019s admission did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a\n    mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test re\n    sults, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in\n    testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood, qualified as an expert witness with re\n    spect to the testing machine and SLD procedures. The court affirmed\n    Bullcoming\u2019s conviction.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n147 N. M. 487, 226 P. 3d 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to all but Part IV and footnote 6. The Confrontation Clause, the opin\n  ion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic\n  laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in or\n  der to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony\n  of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform\n  or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.\n  The accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the\n  certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the ac\n  cused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular\n  scientist. Pp. 8\u201316.\n     (a) If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be intro\n  duced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the\n  statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity\n  to confront that witness. Pp. 8\u201314.\n       (i) Caylor\u2019s certification reported more than a machine-generated\n  number: It represented that he received Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample\n  intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the\n  forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he\n  performed a particular test on Bullcoming\u2019s sample, adhering to a\n  precise protocol; and that he left the report\u2019s remarks section blank,\n  indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample\u2019s in\n  tegrity or the analysis\u2019 validity. These representations, relating to\n  past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine\n  produced data, are meet for cross-examination. The potential ramifi\n  cations of the state court\u2019s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags. Most\n  witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.\n  Where, for example, a police officer\u2019s report recorded an objective fact\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsuch as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court\u2019s reasoning would\npermit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or\nshe was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer\ndeployed and the police department\u2019s standard operating procedures.\nAs, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, how\never, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause. The\ncomparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report does not\ndispense with the Clause. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62. The analysts\nwho write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for\nconfrontation even if they have \u201cthe scientific acumen of Mme. Curie\nand the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___,\nn. 6. Pp. 10\u201311.\n     (ii) Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply be\ncause he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine\nand the SLD\u2019s laboratory procedures. Surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor\nknew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses\nor lies on Caylor\u2019s part. Significantly, Razatos did not know why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand,\nBullcoming\u2019s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to\nreveal whether Caylor\u2019s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty ac\ncounted for his removal from work. And the State did not assert that\nRazatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming\u2019s blood\nalcohol content. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does\nnot tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court\nbelieves that questioning one witness about another\u2019s testimonial\nstatements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\nAlthough the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair\ntrial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because,\non the whole, the trial is fair. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 145. If a \u201cparticular guarantee\u201d is violated, no substitute\nprocedure can cure the violation. Id., at 146. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   (b) Melendez-Diaz precluded the State\u2019s argument that introduc\ntion of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause be\ncause the report is nontestimonial. Like the certificates in Melendez-\nDiaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an \u201caffirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d in a criminal proceed\ning. 557 U. S., at ___. Created solely for an \u201cevidentiary purpose,\u201d\nid., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial. In all material respects,\nthe SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as\nthere, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory re\nquired by law to assist in police investigations. Like the Melendez-\nDiaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate\nconcerning the result of his analysis. And like the Melendez-Diaz\n4                    BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    certificates, Caylor\u2019s report here is \u201cformalized\u201d in a signed document,\n    Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form\n    contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts\u2019 rules\n    that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n    Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at\n    tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor\u2019s as\n    sertions as testimonial.

Massachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009),\nthis Court held that a forensic laboratory report stating\nthat a suspect substance was cocaine ranked as testimo\u00ad\nnial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation\nClause. The report had been created specifically to serve\nas evidence in a criminal proceeding. Absent stipulation,\nthe Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a\nreport without offering a live witness competent to testify\nto the truth of the statements made in the report.\n  In the case before us, petitioner Donald Bullcoming\nwas arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated\n(DWI). Principal evidence against Bullcoming was a foren\u00ad\nsic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming\u2019s blood\u00ad\nalcohol concentration was well above the threshold for\naggravated DWI. At trial, the prosecution did not call as a\nwitness the analyst who signed the certification. Instead,\nthe State called another analyst who was familiar with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN join all but Part IV of this\nopinion. JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV and footnote 6.\n2               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither partici\u00ad\npated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming\u2019s blood sam\u00ad\nple. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,\nalthough the blood-alcohol analysis was \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the\nConfrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana\u00ad\nlyst\u2019s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico\u2019s high\ncourt held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the\nconstitutional requirements.\n  The question presented is whether the Confrontation\nClause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic\nlaboratory report containing a testimonial certification\u2014\nmade for the purpose of proving a particular fact\u2014through\nthe in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the\ncertification or perform or observe the test reported in the\ncertification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that\norder does not meet the constitutional requirement. The\naccused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who\nmade the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable\nat trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to\ncross-examine that particular scientist.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald\nBullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection\nin Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited\nhis vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur\u00ad\nance information, he noticed that Bullcoming\u2019s eyes were\nbloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming\u2019s breath, the\ntruckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left\nthe scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre\u00ad\nhended by an officer who observed his performance of field\nsobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was\narrested for driving a vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of\nintoxicating liquor\u201d (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a766\u20138\u2013102 (2004).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the\npolice obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy\u00ad\nsis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming\u2019s\nblood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull\u00ad\ncoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police\nsent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD\nform titled \u201cReport of Blood Alcohol Analysis,\u201d partici\u00ad\npants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana\u00ad\nlyst certified his finding. App. 62.\n   SLD\u2019s report contained in the top block \u201cinformation . . .\nfilled in by [the] arresting officer.\u201d Ibid. (capitalization\nomitted). This information included the \u201creason [the]\nsuspect [was] stopped\u201d (the officer checked \u201cAccident\u201d),\nand the date (\u201c8.14.05\u201d) and time (\u201c18:25 PM\u201d) the blood\nsample was drawn. Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The\narresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull\u00ad\ncoming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two\nblocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew\nBullcoming\u2019s blood and the SLD intake employee who\nreceived the blood sample sent to the laboratory. Ibid.\n   Following these segments, the report presented the\n\u201ccertificate of analyst,\u201d ibid. (capitalization omitted), com\u00ad\npleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic\nanalyst assigned to test Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample. Id., at\n62, 64\u201365. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming\u2019s\nsample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordi\u00ad\nnately high level. Id., at 62. Caylor also affirmed that\n\u201c[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken\nin the laboratory,\u201d that \u201cthe statements in [the analyst\u2019s\nblock of the report] are correct,\u201d and that he had \u201cfollowed\nthe procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u201d Ibid.\nThose \u201cprocedures\u201d instructed analysts, inter alia, to \u201cre\u00ad\ntai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the\nanalysis,\u201d and to \u201cnot[e] any circumstance or condition\nwhich might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise\n4                 BULLCOMING v.

Finally, in a\nblock headed \u201ccertificate of reviewer,\u201d the SLD examiner\nwho reviewed Caylor\u2019s analysis certified that Caylor was\nqualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the \u201cestab\u00ad\nlished procedure\u201d for handling and analyzing Bullcoming\u2019s\nsample \u201cha[d] been followed.\u201d Id., at 62 (capitalization\nomitted).\n   SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to de\u00ad\ntermine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires\nspecialized knowledge and training. Several steps are\ninvolved in the gas chromatograph process, and human\nerror can occur at each step.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Gaschromatography is a widely used scientific method of quan\u00ad\ntitatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H.\nMcNair & J. Miller, Basic Gas Chromatography (2d ed. 2009) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter McNair). Under SLD\u2019s standard testing protocol, the analyst ex\u00ad\ntracts two blood samples and inserts them into vials containing an\n\u201cinternal standard\u201d\u2014a chemical additive. App. 53. See McNair 141\u2013\n142. The analyst then \u201ccap[s] the [two] sample[s],\u201d \u201ccrimp[s] them with\nan aluminum top,\u201d and places the vials into the gas chromatograph\nmachine. App. 53\u201354. Within a few hours, this device produces a\nprinted graph\u2014a chromatogram\u2014along with calculations representing\na software-generated interpretation of the data. See Brief for State of\nNew Mexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\n   Although the State presented testimony that obtaining an accurate\nBAC measurement merely entails \u201clook[ing] at the [gas chromatograph]\nmachine and record[ing] the results,\u201d App. 54, authoritative sources re\u00ad\nveal that the matter is not so simple or certain. \u201cIn order to perform\nquantitative analyses satisfactorily and . . . support the results under\nrigorous examination in court, the analyst must be aware of, and\nadhere to, good analytical practices and understand what is being done\nand why.\u201d Stafford, Chromatography, in Principles of Forensic Toxicol\u00ad\nogy 92, 114 (B. Levine 2d ed. 2006). See also McNair 137 (\u201cErrors that\noccur in any step can invalidate the best chromatographic analysis, so\nattention must be paid to all steps.\u201d); D. Bartell, M.

The State accordingly charged Bullcoming\nwith this more serious crime.\n                             B\n  The case was tried to a jury in November 2005, after our\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004),\nbut before Melendez-Diaz. On the day of trial, the State\nannounced that it would not be calling SLD analyst Curtis\nCaylor as a witness because he had \u201cvery recently [been]\nput on unpaid leave\u201d for a reason not revealed. 2010\u2013\nNMSC\u2013007, \u00b68, 226 P. 3d 1, 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); App. 58. A startled defense counsel objected.\nThe prosecution, she complained, had never disclosed,\nuntil trial commenced, that the witness \u201cout there . . .\n[was] not the analyst [of Bullcoming\u2019s sample].\u201d Id., at 46.\nCounsel stated that, \u201chad [she] known that the analyst\n[who tested Bullcoming\u2019s blood] was not available,\u201d her\nopening, indeed, her entire defense \u201cmay very well have\nbeen dramatically different.\u201d Id., at 47. The State, how\u00ad\never, proposed to introduce Caylor\u2019s finding as a \u201cbusiness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvalid. See McNair 207\u2013214.\n   Nor is the risk of human error so remote as to be negligible. Amici\ninform us, for example, that in neighboring Colorado, a single forensic\nlaboratory produced at least 206 flawed blood-alcohol readings over a\nthree-year span, prompting the dismissal of several criminal prosecu\u00ad\ntions. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net al. as Amici Curiae 32\u201333.

Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court\nobserved, the report was \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in\u00ad\ncourt testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on\ndirect examination.\u201d 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for\ntwo reasons, the court held that admission of the report\ndid not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n  First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor \u201cwas a\nmere scrivener,\u201d who \u201csimply transcribed the results gen\u00ad\nerated by the gas chromatograph machine.\u201d 226 P. 3d,\nat 8\u20139. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not\nparticipate in testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood, \u201cqualified as\nan expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph\nmachine.\u201d Id., at 9. \u201cRazatos provided live, in-court tes\u00ad\ntimony,\u201d the court stated, \u201cand, thus, was available for\ncross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma\u00ad\nchine, the results of [Bullcoming\u2019s] BAC test, and the\nSLD\u2019s established laboratory procedures.\u201d Ibid. Razatos\u2019\ntestimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull\u00ad\ncoming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ\u00ad\nten report. Id., at 10. But \u201c[Bullcoming\u2019s] right of con\u00ad\nfrontation was preserved,\u201d the court concluded, because\nRazatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro\u00ad\ngate for Caylor. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the\nConfrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In so ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court explicitly overruled\nState v. Dedman, 2004\u2013NMSC\u2013037, 102 P. 3d 628 (2004), which had\nclassified blood-alcohol reports as public records neither \u201cinvestigative\nnor prosecutorial\u201d in nature. 226 P. 3d, at 7\u20138.\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certi\u00ad\nfication, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial,\nthrough the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not\nsign the certification or personally perform or observe the\nperformance of the test reported in the certification. 561\nU. S. ___ (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling\nprecedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testi\u00ad\nmonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the\naccused at trial unless the witness who made the state\u00ad\nment is unavailable and the accused has had a prior op\u00ad\nportunity to confront that witness. Because the New\nMexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial state\u00ad\nment of one witness, i.e., Caylor, to enter into evidence\nthrough the in-court testimony of a second person, i.e.,\nRazatos, we reverse that court\u2019s judgment.\n                               II\n   The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause confers\nupon the accused \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, . . . the\nright . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d\nIn a pathmarking 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington,\nwe overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which\nhad interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admis\u00ad\nsion of absent witnesses\u2019 testimonial statements based on\na judicial determination of reliability. See Roberts, 448\nU. S., at 66. Rejecting Roberts\u2019 \u201camorphous notions of \u2018re\u00ad\nliability,\u2019 \u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 61, Crawford held\nthat fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admis\u00ad\nsion of \u201c[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from\ntrial . . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\nwhere the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross\u00ad\nexamine,\u201d id., at 59. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (\u201c[F]or testimonial evidence\nto be admissible, the Sixth Amendment \u2018demands what\nthe common law required: unavailability [of the witness]\nand a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d (quoting\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Melendez-Diaz, relying on\nCrawford\u2019s rationale, refused to create a \u201cforensic evi\u00ad\ndence\u201d exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 11\u201315).5 An analyst\u2019s certification prepared in\nconnection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,\nthe Court held, is \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and therefore within the\ncompass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 15\u201318).6\n  The State in the instant case never asserted that the\nanalyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was\nunavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was\nplaced on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See\nsupra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity\nto cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,\ntherefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming\u2019s favor. The New\nMexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing\nthat the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an\nadequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why\nRazatos\u2019 appearance did not meet the Confrontation\nClause requirement. We next address the State\u2019s argu\u00ad\nment that the SLD report ranks as \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application\n\nof the Court\u2019s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case\nthan to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti\u00ad\ncizing the \u201cCrawford line of cases\u201d for rejecting \u201creliable evidence\u201d);\npost, at 8\u20139, 11 (deploring \u201cCrawford\u2019s rejection of the [reliability\u00ad\ncentered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts\u201d).\n  6 To rank as \u201ctestimonial,\u201d a statement must have a \u201cprimary pur\u00ad\n\npose\u201d of \u201cestablish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to\nlater criminal prosecution.\u201d Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822\n(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating\non the purpose for which a \u201ctestimonial report\u201d is created, we observed\nin Melendez-Diaz that business and public records \u201care generally\nadmissible absent confrontation . . . because\u2014having been created for\nthe administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial\u2014they are not testimonial.\u201d\n557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore \u201c[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause\u201d\nin the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization\nomitted).\n                               A\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi\u00ad\nmony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in\nthis case because analyst Caylor \u201csimply transcribed the\nresul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,\u201d\npresenting no interpretation and exercising no independ\u00ad\nent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming\u2019s \u201ctrue \u2018ac\u00ad\ncuser,\u2019 \u201d the court said, was the machine, while testing\nanalyst Caylor\u2019s role was that of \u201cmere scrivener.\u201d Id., at\n9. Caylor\u2019s certification, however, reported more than a\nmachine-generated number. See supra, at 3\u20134.\n   Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming\u2019s blood\nsample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to\nmake sure that the forensic report number and the sample\nnumber \u201ccorrespond[ed],\u201d and that he performed on Bull\u00ad\ncoming\u2019s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise\nprotocol. App. 62\u201365. He further represented, by leaving\nthe \u201c[r]emarks\u201d section of the report blank, that no \u201ccir\u00ad\ncumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the\nsample or . . . the validity of the analysis.\u201d Id., at 62, 65.\nThese representations, relating to past events and human\nactions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are\nmeet for cross-examination.\n   The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme\nCourt\u2019s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit\u00ad\nnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual\nconditions or events, e.g., \u201cthe light was green,\u201d \u201cthe hour\nwas noon.\u201d Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what\nthey observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec\u00ad\ntive fact\u2014Bullcoming\u2019s counsel posited the address above\nthe front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35.

As our precedent makes plain, the answer is\nemphatically \u201cNo.\u201d See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be \u201cevaded\nby having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes\u00ad\ntimony of the declarant\u201d (emphasis deleted)); Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis\u00ad\nsenting) (\u201cThe Court made clear in Davis that it will not\npermit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter\ninto evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.\u201d).\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number\nregistered by the gas chromatograph machine called for\nno interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on\nCaylor\u2019s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8\u20139. We have already ex\u00ad\nplained that Caylor certified to more than a machine\u00ad\ngenerated number. See supra, at 3\u20134. In any event, the\ncomparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report\ndrawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the\nSixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford\nthat the \u201cobviou[s] reliab[ility]\u201d of a testimonial statement\ndoes not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541\nU. S., at 62; see id., at 61 (Clause \u201ccommands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the cruci\u00ad\nble of cross-examination\u201d). Accordingly, the analysts who\nwrite reports that the prosecution introduces must be\nmade available for confrontation even if they possess \u201cthe\nscientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of\nMother Teresa.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 6\n(slip op., at 14, n. 6).\n                           B\n  Recognizing that admission of the blood-alcohol analysis\n12                BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndepended on \u201clive, in-court testimony [by] a qualified ana\u00ad\nlyst,\u201d 226 P. 3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nbelieved that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because\nRazatos \u201cqualified as an expert witness with respect to the\ngas chromatograph machine and the SLD\u2019s labora\u00ad\ntory procedures,\u201d id., at 9. But surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what\nCaylor knew or observed about the events his certification\nconcerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he\nemployed.7 Nor could such surrogate testimony expose\nany lapses or lies on the certifying analyst\u2019s part.8 Signifi\u00ad\ncant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on\nthe stand, Bullcoming\u2019s counsel could have asked ques\u00ad\ntions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasive\u00ad\nness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor\u2019s removal from\nhis work station. Notable in this regard, the State never\nasserted that Caylor was \u201cunavailable\u201d; the prosecution\nconveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.\nNor did the State assert that Razatos had any \u201cindepend\u00ad\nent opinion\u201d concerning Bullcoming\u2019s BAC. See Brief for\nRespondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor\u2019s live testimony\ncould hardly be typed \u201ca hollow formality,\u201d post, at 4.\n   More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in Craw\nford, \u201c[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not sug\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 We do not question that analyst Caylor, in common with other ana\u00ad\n\nlysts employed by SLD, likely would not recall a particular test, given\nthe number of tests each analyst conducts and the standard procedure\nfollowed in testing. Even so, Caylor\u2019s testimony under oath would have\nenabled Bullcoming\u2019s counsel to raise before a jury questions concern\u00ad\ning Caylor\u2019s proficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and\nhis veracity. In particular, Bullcoming\u2019s counsel likely would have\ninquired on cross-examination why Caylor had been placed on unpaid\nleave.\n   8 At Bullcoming\u2019s trial, Razatos acknowledged that \u201cyou don\u2019t know\n\nunless you actually observe the analysis that someone else conducts,\nwhether they followed th[e] protocol in every instance.\u201d App. 59.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation re\u00ad\nquirement to be developed by the courts.\u201d 541 U. S., at 54.\nNor is it \u201cthe role of courts to extrapolate from the words\nof the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and\nthen to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve\n(in the courts\u2019 views) those underlying values.\u201d Giles v.\nCalifornia, 554 U. S. 353, 375 (2008). Accordingly, the\nClause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation\nsimply because the court believes that questioning one\nwitness about another\u2019s testimonial statements provides a\nfair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\n     A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment\nright\u2014the right to counsel\u2014is instructive. In United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), the Gov\u00ad\nernment argued that illegitimately denying a defendant\nhis counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amend-\nment where \u201csubstitute counsel\u2019s performance\u201d did not\ndemonstrably prejudice the defendant. Id., at 144\u2013145.\nThis Court rejected the Government\u2019s argument. \u201c[T]rue\nenough,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthe purpose of the rights\nset forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair\ntrial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disre\u00ad\ngarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\u201d Id., at\n145. If a \u201cparticular guarantee\u201d of the Sixth Amendment\nis violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation,\nand \u201c[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to\nmake the violation \u2018complete.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 146. If repre\u00ad\nsentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth\nAmendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a\nsubstitute witness.\n   In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor\u2019s\ncertification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the\nright to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read\nany other way. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Court\u2019s holding means\n\u201cthe . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed\n14               BULLCOMING v.

Melendez-Diaz left no room for that\nargument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,\nsee 226 P. 3d, at 7\u20138; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find\ninescapable.\n   In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police\nrequest, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re\u00ad\nported the laboratory\u2019s analysis to the police (the sub\u00ad\nstance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2). The \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d prepared\nby the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,\nthis Court held, were \u201cincontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d\nin a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter\u00ad\nnal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was\nserved by the certificate in question here.\n   The State maintains that the affirmations made by\nanalyst Caylor were not \u201cadversarial\u201d or \u201cinquisitorial,\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 27\u201333; instead, they were simply\nobservations of an \u201cindependent scientis[t]\u201d made \u201caccord\u00ad\ning to a non-adversarial public duty,\u201d id., at 32\u201333.

Noteworthy as\nwell, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to\nmunicipal and magistrate courts\u2019 rules that provide for the\nadmission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n   In sum, the formalities attending the \u201creport of blood\nalcohol analysis\u201d are more than adequate to qualify Cay\u00ad\nlor\u2019s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notariza\u00ad\ntion does not remove his certification from Confrontation\nClause governance.

This argu\u00ad\nment, also advanced in the dissent, post, at 10\u201311, largely\nrepeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in Melendez-Diaz.\nSee 557 U.

Moreover, New Mexico\u2019s Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division, has attributed the \u201cchaotic\u201d conditions\nnoted by the dissent, ibid., to several favors, among them, staff attri\u00ad\ntion, a state hiring freeze, a 15% increase in the number of blood\nsamples received for testing, and \u201cwildly\u201d divergent responses by New\nMexico District Attorneys to Melendez-Diaz.

The hearsay rule\u2019s recognition of the\ncertificates\u2019 evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci\u00ad\nsion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri\u00ad\nmary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation\nClause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that\nunder Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the\n\u201csole purpose of the affidavits was to provide\u201d evidence).\n   Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets\nforth the BAC report and Caylor\u2019s certification on it\nclearly have a \u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony.\u201d Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC\nreport is not materially distinguishable from the certifi\u00ad\ncates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2, 4\u20135). 2\n   The formality inherent in the certification further sug\u00ad\ngests its evidentiary purpose. Although \u201c[f]ormality is not\nthe sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,\u201d a\nstatement\u2019s formality or informality can shed light on\nwhether a particular statement has a primary purpose\nof use at trial.

As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the\ncase \u201cthat anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the\nchain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing\ndevice, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case . . . .

Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil\u00ad\nity, the dissent\u2019s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron\u00ad\ntation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi\u00ad\n4                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nI agree with the Court\u2019s assessment that the certificate at\nissue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of\nnotarization. Ante, at 14\u201315; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\n(\u201c[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive\u201d). The\nformality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to\nsign his name and \u201ccertify\u201d to both the result and the\nstatements on the form. A \u201ccertification\u201d requires one\n\u201c[t]o attest\u201d that the accompanying statements are true.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of\n\u201ccertify\u201d); see also id., at 147 (defining \u201cattest\u201d as \u201c[t]o bear\nwitness; testify,\u201d or \u201c[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to\nauthenticate by signing as a witness\u201d).\n   In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a\n\u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for\ntrial testimony,\u201d Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nwhich renders it testimonial.\n                            B\n  After holding that the report was testimonial, the New\nMexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis\u00ad\nsion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for\ntwo reasons: because Caylor was a \u201cmere scrivener,\u201d and\nbecause Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings\nof the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226\nP. 3d, at 8\u201310. The Court convincingly explains why those\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmonial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial\nnature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has\nlong been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality\nsuggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex\u00ad\nplained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, \u201cdoes not necessarily\nindicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.\u201d 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the\ntestimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic\nunconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial.

Therefore, the\nNew Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding\nthat the report was admissible via Razatos\u2019 testimony.\n                                 II\n   Although this case is materially indistinguishable from\nthe facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight\nsome of the factual circumstances that this case does not\npresent.\n   First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an\nalternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur\u00ad\npose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not\nclaimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom\u00ad\ning with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing \u201cStatements for Purposes\nof Medical Diagnosis or Treatment\u201d under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are\n\u201cby their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a\nprosecution\u201d); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.

S. 353, 376 (2008)\n(\u201c[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving\ntreatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay\nrules\u201d).\n   Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying\nis a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,\nalbeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\nRazatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no\nrole in producing the BAC report and did not observe any\nportion of Curtis Caylor\u2019s conduct of the testing. App. 58.\nThe court below also recognized Razatos\u2019 total lack of\nconnection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would\nbe a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob\u00ad\nserved an analyst conducting a test testified about the\nresults or a report about such results.

See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or\ndata of a type upon which experts in the field would rea\u00ad\nsonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible\nin order for the expert\u2019s opinion based on the facts and\ndata to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the\nState does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,\nexpert opinion about Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentra\u00ad\ntion. Rather, the State explains, \u201c[a]side from reading a\nreport that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos\noffered no opinion about Petitioner\u2019s blood alcohol content\n. . . .\u201d Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).\nHere the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor\u2019s\ntestimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a\ndifferent question if asked to determine the constitutional\u00ad\nity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019 testi\u00ad\nmonial statements if the testimonial statements were not\nthemselves admitted as evidence.\n    Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced\nonly machine-generated results, such as a printout from a\ngas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor\u2019s\nstatements, which included his transcription of a blood\nalcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro\u00ad\nmatograph printout, along with other statements about\nthe procedures used in handling the blood sample. See\nante, at 10; App. 62 (\u201cI certify that I followed the proce\u00ad\ndures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state\u00ad\nments in this block are correct\u201d).

Pointer v. Texas,\n380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965). Two Terms ago, in a case aris\ning from a state criminal prosecution, the Court inter\npreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory\nreport sought to be introduced based on the authority of\nthat report\u2019s own sworn statement that a test had been\nperformed yielding the results as shown. Melendez-Diaz v.\nMassachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009). The Court\u2019s opinion\nin that case held the report inadmissible because no one\nwas present at trial to testify to its contents.\n   Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the\nresult in Melendez-Diaz, the Court today takes the new\nand serious misstep of extending that holding to instances\nlike this one. Here a knowledgeable representative of the\nlaboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab\u2019s\nprocesses and the details of the report; but because he was\nnot the analyst who filled out part of the form and tran\nscribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the\nCourt finds a confrontation violation. Some of the princi\npal objections to the Court\u2019s underlying theory have been\nset out earlier and need not be repeated here. See id., at\n___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Additional reasons, appli\n2               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new\nruling in this case, are now explained in support of this\nrespectful dissent.\n                              I\n   Before today, the Court had not held that the Confron\ntation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when\nan employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the\nfindings, testifies to the laboratory\u2019s methods and prac\ntices, and is cross-examined at trial. Far from replacing\nlive testimony with \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cextrajudicial\u201d ex\naminations, Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 835, 836\n(2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis deleted and internal quota\ntion marks omitted), these procedures are fully consistent\nwith the Confrontation Clause and with well-established\nprinciples for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted\nin full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability\nand with the confrontation guarantee. They do not \u201cre\nsemble Marian proceedings.\u201d Id., at 837.\n   The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by\nthe Court, make live testimony rather than the \u201csolem\nnity\u201d of a document the primary reason to credit the labo\nratory\u2019s scientific results. Id., at 838. Unlike Melendez-\nDiaz, where the jury was asked to credit a labora-\ntory\u2019s findings based solely on documents that were\n\u201cquite plainly affidavits,\u201d 557 U.

App. 56 (laboratory employee\u2019s testimony agree\ning that \u201conce the material is prepared and placed in the\nmachine, you don\u2019t need any particular expertise to record\nthe results\u201d). The information contained in the report was\nthe result of a scientific process comprising multiple par\nticipants\u2019 acts, each with its own evidentiary significance.\nThese acts included receipt of the sample at the labora\ntory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample\ninto the testing device; transposing the printout of the\nresults of the test onto the report; and review of the re\nsults. See Id., at 48\u201356; see also Brief for State of New\nMexico Dept. of Health Scientific Laboratory Division as\nAmicus Curiae 4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Labo\nratory Brief) (\u201cEach blood sample has original testing\nwork by . . . as many as seve[n] analysts . . . .\u201d); App. 62\n(indicating that this case involved three laboratory ana\nlysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed\nanalysis of the sample); cf. Brief for State of Indiana et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Briscoe v. Virginia, O. T. 2009, No. 07\u2013\n11191, p. 10 (hereinafter Indiana Brief) (explaining that\nDNA analysis can involve the combined efforts of up to 40\nanalysts).\n   In the New Mexico scientific laboratory where the blood\nsample was processed, analyses are run in batches involv\ning 40\u201360 samples. Each sample is identified by a com\nputer-generated number that is not linked back to the file\ncontaining the name of the person from whom the sample\ncame until after all testing is completed. See New Mexico\nScientific Laboratory Brief 26. The analysis is mechani\ncally performed by the gas chromatograph, which may\noperate\u2014as in this case\u2014after all the laboratory employ\nees leave for the day. See id., at 17. And whatever the\nresult, it is reported to both law enforcement and the\ndefense. See id., at 36.\n   The representative of the testing laboratory whom the\nprosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr.\n4              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nRazatos. He testified that he \u201chelp[ed] in overseeing the\nadministration of these programs throughout the State,\u201d\nand he was qualified to answer questions concerning each\nof these steps. App. 49. The Court has held that the\ngovernment need not produce at trial \u201ceveryone who laid\nhands on the evidence,\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, n. 1\n(slip op., at 5, n. 1). Here, the defense used the opportu\nnity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial\nof certain laboratory employees. Under questioning by\nBullcoming\u2019s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his\nname did not appear on the report; that he did not receive\nthe sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review;\nand that he did not know the reason for some personnel\ndecisions. App. 58. After weighing arguments from de\nfense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con\nsidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the\nlaboratory\u2019s protocols and processes, the jury found no\nreasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\n   In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the\ntechnician who filled out a form and recorded the results\nof a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to\nchallenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and\nexamine the technician who performed a test. And it may\ncall other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not\nalways reliable or that the technician might have made a\nmistake. The jury can then decide whether to credit the\ntest, as it did here. The States, furthermore, can assess\nthe progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt stat\nutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is\nadmitted. Rejecting these commonsense arguments and\nthe concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the\nCourt today takes a different course. It once more as\nsumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evi\ndentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming\nMelendez-Diaz\u2019s \u201cvast potential to disrupt criminal proce\ndures.\u201d 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (KENNEDY, J.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ndissenting).\n                               II\n   The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed\nthe Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure\na fair trial with reliable evidence. But the Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated\nthe reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at\n61\u201362. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a\nlab report because it \u201cis formalized in a signed document.\u201d\nAnte, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt\u2019s unconventional and unstated premise is that\nthe State\u2014by acting to ensure a statement\u2019s reliability\u2014\nmakes the statement more formal and therefore less likely\nto be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?\n19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the\nCourt insists, because reliability does not animate the\nConfrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312); Crawford, supra, at 61\u201362. Yet\njust this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta\ntion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti\ntutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___, ___\u2013___ (2010) (slip op., at 11\u201312, 14\u201315).\n   Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out\nof the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes\nbeen dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur\nring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834\u2013837,\n841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction\nbetween utterances aimed at proving past events, and\nthose calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare\nDavis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n24\u201330), with id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20139) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n   It is not even clear which witnesses\u2019 testimony could\n6               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrender a scientific report admissible under the Court\u2019s\napproach. Melendez-Diaz stated an inflexible rule: Where\n\u201canalysts\u2019 affidavits\u201d included \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d\ndefendants were \u201centitled to be confronted with the ana\nlysts\u201d themselves. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,\nthis rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too\nstrict to be followed. A report is admissible, today\u2019s opin\nion states, if a \u201clive witness competent to testify to the\ntruth of the statements made in the report\u201d appears. Ante,\nat 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana\nlyst, but also any \u201cscientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob\nserve[d] the test reported in the certification.\u201d Ante, at 2.\n   Today\u2019s majority is not committed in equal shares to a\ncommon set of principles in applying the holding of Craw\nford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,\nsupra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,\nat ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the\nCourt), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has\nhad such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case\u2019s\nmeaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in\nevery criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court\nin the Nation. This Court\u2019s prior decisions leave trial\njudges to \u201cguess what future rules this Court will distill\nfrom the sparse constitutional text,\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug\ngle to apply an \u201camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\u201d\n\u201chighly context-dependent inquiry\u201d involving \u201copen-ended\nbalancing.\u201d Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority\u2019s approach).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   The persistent ambiguities in the Court\u2019s approach are\nsymptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica\ntions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus\ntrate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted\nthat its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of\ncustody to testify but then qualified that \u201cwhat testimony\nis introduced must . . . be introduced live.\u201d 557 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This\ncould mean that a statement that evidence remained in\nlaw-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement\u2019s\nmaker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head\nquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain\nof custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also\nbe that that the intern\u2019s statement\u2014which draws on\nstatements in the evidence log\u2014is inadmissible unless\nevery officer who signed the log appears at trial. That\nrule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis\nsibility of the report on the testimony of three or more\nidentified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or\neven 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt has thus\u2014in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz\u2014boxed\nitself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation\nClause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are\nunworkable.\n                            III\n  Crawford itself does not compel today\u2019s conclusion. It\nis true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation\nClause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat\ning trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,\nat 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312). Crawford\nexplained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to\naddress the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious\ntreason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On\nthis view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of\ncourt statements obtained through formal interrogation in\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npreparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defen\ndants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, un\ntested statements by those who observed\u2014or claimed to\nhave observed\u2014preparation for or commission of the\ncrime. And, of course, those statements might not have\nbeen uttered at all or\u2014even if spoken\u2014might not have\nbeen true.\n   A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, pro\nvides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitu\ntional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like\nthe instant one, reports prepared by experienced techni\ncians in laboratories that follow professional norms and\nscientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right\nto call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this\ncase was already protected by checks on potential prosecu\ntorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result\nblind issuance of reports; testing by an independent\nagency; routine processes performed en masse, which\nreduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating\npursuant to scientific and professional norms and over\nsight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14\u201315, 41, 54; New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.\n   In addition to preventing the State from conducting ex\nparte trials, Crawford\u2019s rejection of the regime of Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), seemed to have two under\nlying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the\nintricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate;\nand the other was to allow the States, in their own courts\nand legislatures and without this Court\u2019s supervision, to\nexplore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules\npertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.\nThese results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks\nthe experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial\nprocess to suit it well to assume the role of national tribu\nnal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these\nobjectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their oppo\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsites.\n   Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay\ndoctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear\nsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined\nformulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta\ntion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge\nof Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.\n691, 739\u2013740, 742, 744\u2013746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern\nEvidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502\u2013503, 514\u2013515,\n533\u2013537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,\nthe Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen\ntury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to\nmake those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay\u2019s Last\nHurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5\u20136, 36. As a result, the Court\nhas taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap\nplication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court\nstatements by unconfronted and available witnesses who\nobserved the crime and do not appear at trial.\n   Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of\ntheir hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are\nforeclosed now from contributing to the formulation and\nenactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli\nable. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission\nof well-documented and supported reports of abuse by\nwomen whose abusers later murdered them must give\nway, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur\npose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554\nU. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14\u201315. Whether\nthose statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability\nand other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation\nClause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open\nquestion. The point is that the States cannot now partici\npate in the development of this difficult part of the law.\n   In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic\ndisplacement of the States and dislocation of the federal\nstructure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nop., at 2\u20133, 22\u201323). If this Court persists in applying\nwooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony of\nfered by the prosecution\u2014testimony thought proper for\nmany decades in state and federal courts committed to\ndevising fair trial processes\u2014then the States might find it\nnecessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommo\ndate this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those\nrules could remain on State statute books for decades,\neven if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better\nimplement the objectives of Crawford. This underscores\nthe disruptive, long-term structural consequences of deci\nsions like the one the Court announces today.\n   States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to\nenact statutes that require defense counsel to give ad\nvance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a\nreport without the presence in court of the technician who\nprepared it. Indeed, today\u2019s opinion relies upon laws of\nthat sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.\nAnte, at 17 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic,\nhowever, to think that this will take away from the de\nfense the incentives to insist on having the certifying\nanalyst present. There is in the ordinary case that pro\nceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive\nthe right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.\n   Today\u2019s opinion repeats an assertion from Melendez-\nDiaz that its decision will not \u201cimpose an undue burden on\nthe prosecution.\u201d Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion). But\nevidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See,\ne.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 7\n(explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles\nPolice Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appear\nances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District\nAttorneys Assocation et al. as Amici Curiae 23 (observing\nthat each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes\n3,220 cases per year on average).

From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re\nquiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving\ncases rose 71%, to 1,600\u2014or 8 or 9 every workday. New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the\nNation\u2019s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10\ntotal analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases\nrecently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The\nanalysts now must travel great distances on most working\ndays. The result has been, in the laboratory\u2019s words,\n\u201cchaotic.\u201d Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection\nand the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or\non leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer\nemployed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a\nwindfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in\never-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability\nto produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant\nincreases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo\nratory\u2019s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce\nstate resources could be committed to other urgent needs\nin the criminal justice system.\n                       *     *     *\n   Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering\nthat the Crawford approach was not preordained.

Argued March 2, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause gives the accused \u201c[i]n\n  all criminal prosecutions, . . . the right . . . to be confronted with the\n  witnesses against him.\u201d In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59,\n  this Court held that the Clause permits admission of \u201c[t]estimonial\n  statements of witnesses absent from trial . . . only where the decla\n  rant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior\n  opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\n  setts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a \u201cforensic evidence\u201d\n  exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, cre\n  ated specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked\n  as \u201ctestimonial\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes. Absent stipula\n  tion, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a re\n  port without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth\n  of the report\u2019s statements. 557 U. S., at ___.\n     Petitioner Bullcoming\u2019s jury trial on charges of driving while in\n  toxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.\n  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certi\n  fying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the thresh\n  old for aggravated DWI. Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample had been tested\n  at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Divi\n  sion (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed,\n  signed, and certified the report. However, the prosecution neither\n  called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record\n  showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undis\n  closed reason. In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst,\n  Razatos, to validate the report. Razatos was familiar with the testing\n  device used to analyze Bullcoming\u2019s blood and with the laboratory\u2019s\n  testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the\n  test on Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample. Bullcoming\u2019s counsel objected, as\n2                   BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    serting that introduction of Caylor\u2019s report without his testimony\n    would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled\n    the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and\n    permitted Razatos to testify. Bullcoming was convicted, and, while\n    his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this\n    Court decided Melendez-Diaz. The state high court acknowledged\n    that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under\n    Melendez-Diaz, but held that the report\u2019s admission did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a\n    mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test re\n    sults, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in\n    testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood, qualified as an expert witness with re\n    spect to the testing machine and SLD procedures. The court affirmed\n    Bullcoming\u2019s conviction.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n147 N. M. 487, 226 P. 3d 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to all but Part IV and footnote 6. The Confrontation Clause, the opin\n  ion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic\n  laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in or\n  der to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony\n  of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform\n  or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.\n  The accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the\n  certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the ac\n  cused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular\n  scientist. Pp. 8\u201316.\n     (a) If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be intro\n  duced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the\n  statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity\n  to confront that witness. Pp. 8\u201314.\n       (i) Caylor\u2019s certification reported more than a machine-generated\n  number: It represented that he received Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample\n  intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the\n  forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he\n  performed a particular test on Bullcoming\u2019s sample, adhering to a\n  precise protocol; and that he left the report\u2019s remarks section blank,\n  indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample\u2019s in\n  tegrity or the analysis\u2019 validity. These representations, relating to\n  past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine\n  produced data, are meet for cross-examination. The potential ramifi\n  cations of the state court\u2019s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags. Most\n  witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.\n  Where, for example, a police officer\u2019s report recorded an objective fact\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsuch as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court\u2019s reasoning would\npermit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or\nshe was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer\ndeployed and the police department\u2019s standard operating procedures.\nAs, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, how\never, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause. The\ncomparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report does not\ndispense with the Clause. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62. The analysts\nwho write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for\nconfrontation even if they have \u201cthe scientific acumen of Mme. Curie\nand the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___,\nn. 6. Pp. 10\u201311.\n     (ii) Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply be\ncause he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine\nand the SLD\u2019s laboratory procedures. Surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor\nknew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses\nor lies on Caylor\u2019s part. Significantly, Razatos did not know why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand,\nBullcoming\u2019s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to\nreveal whether Caylor\u2019s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty ac\ncounted for his removal from work. And the State did not assert that\nRazatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming\u2019s blood\nalcohol content. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does\nnot tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court\nbelieves that questioning one witness about another\u2019s testimonial\nstatements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\nAlthough the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair\ntrial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because,\non the whole, the trial is fair. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 145. If a \u201cparticular guarantee\u201d is violated, no substitute\nprocedure can cure the violation. Id., at 146. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   (b) Melendez-Diaz precluded the State\u2019s argument that introduc\ntion of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause be\ncause the report is nontestimonial. Like the certificates in Melendez-\nDiaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an \u201caffirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d in a criminal proceed\ning. 557 U. S., at ___. Created solely for an \u201cevidentiary purpose,\u201d\nid., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial. In all material respects,\nthe SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as\nthere, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory re\nquired by law to assist in police investigations. Like the Melendez-\nDiaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate\nconcerning the result of his analysis. And like the Melendez-Diaz\n4                    BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    certificates, Caylor\u2019s report here is \u201cformalized\u201d in a signed document,\n    Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form\n    contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts\u2019 rules\n    that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n    Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at\n    tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor\u2019s as\n    sertions as testimonial.

Massachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009),\nthis Court held that a forensic laboratory report stating\nthat a suspect substance was cocaine ranked as testimo\u00ad\nnial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation\nClause. The report had been created specifically to serve\nas evidence in a criminal proceeding. Absent stipulation,\nthe Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a\nreport without offering a live witness competent to testify\nto the truth of the statements made in the report.\n  In the case before us, petitioner Donald Bullcoming\nwas arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated\n(DWI). Principal evidence against Bullcoming was a foren\u00ad\nsic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming\u2019s blood\u00ad\nalcohol concentration was well above the threshold for\naggravated DWI. At trial, the prosecution did not call as a\nwitness the analyst who signed the certification. Instead,\nthe State called another analyst who was familiar with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN join all but Part IV of this\nopinion. JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV and footnote 6.\n2               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither partici\u00ad\npated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming\u2019s blood sam\u00ad\nple. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,\nalthough the blood-alcohol analysis was \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the\nConfrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana\u00ad\nlyst\u2019s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico\u2019s high\ncourt held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the\nconstitutional requirements.\n  The question presented is whether the Confrontation\nClause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic\nlaboratory report containing a testimonial certification\u2014\nmade for the purpose of proving a particular fact\u2014through\nthe in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the\ncertification or perform or observe the test reported in the\ncertification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that\norder does not meet the constitutional requirement. The\naccused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who\nmade the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable\nat trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to\ncross-examine that particular scientist.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald\nBullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection\nin Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited\nhis vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur\u00ad\nance information, he noticed that Bullcoming\u2019s eyes were\nbloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming\u2019s breath, the\ntruckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left\nthe scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre\u00ad\nhended by an officer who observed his performance of field\nsobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was\narrested for driving a vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of\nintoxicating liquor\u201d (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat.

Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming\u2019s\nblood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull\u00ad\ncoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police\nsent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD\nform titled \u201cReport of Blood Alcohol Analysis,\u201d partici\u00ad\npants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana\u00ad\nlyst certified his finding.

Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The\narresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull\u00ad\ncoming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two\nblocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew\nBullcoming\u2019s blood and the SLD intake employee who\nreceived the blood sample sent to the laboratory.

Finally, in a\nblock headed \u201ccertificate of reviewer,\u201d the SLD examiner\nwho reviewed Caylor\u2019s analysis certified that Caylor was\nqualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the \u201cestab\u00ad\nlished procedure\u201d for handling and analyzing Bullcoming\u2019s\nsample \u201cha[d] been followed.\u201d Id., at 62 (capitalization\nomitted).\n   SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to de\u00ad\ntermine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires\nspecialized knowledge and training. Several steps are\ninvolved in the gas chromatograph process, and human\nerror can occur at each step.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Gaschromatography is a widely used scientific method of quan\u00ad\ntitatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H.\nMcNair & J. Miller, Basic Gas Chromatography (2d ed. 2009) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter McNair). Under SLD\u2019s standard testing protocol, the analyst ex\u00ad\ntracts two blood samples and inserts them into vials containing an\n\u201cinternal standard\u201d\u2014a chemical additive. App. 53. See McNair 141\u2013\n142. The analyst then \u201ccap[s] the [two] sample[s],\u201d \u201ccrimp[s] them with\nan aluminum top,\u201d and places the vials into the gas chromatograph\nmachine. App. 53\u201354. Within a few hours, this device produces a\nprinted graph\u2014a chromatogram\u2014along with calculations representing\na software-generated interpretation of the data. See Brief for State of\nNew Mexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\n   Although the State presented testimony that obtaining an accurate\nBAC measurement merely entails \u201clook[ing] at the [gas chromatograph]\nmachine and record[ing] the results,\u201d App. 54, authoritative sources re\u00ad\nveal that the matter is not so simple or certain. \u201cIn order to perform\nquantitative analyses satisfactorily and . . . support the results under\nrigorous examination in court, the analyst must be aware of, and\nadhere to, good analytical practices and understand what is being done\nand why.\u201d Stafford, Chromatography, in Principles of Forensic Toxicol\u00ad\nogy 92, 114 (B.

Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court\nobserved, the report was \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in\u00ad\ncourt testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on\ndirect examination.\u201d 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for\ntwo reasons, the court held that admission of the report\ndid not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n  First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor \u201cwas a\nmere scrivener,\u201d who \u201csimply transcribed the results gen\u00ad\nerated by the gas chromatograph machine.\u201d 226 P. 3d,\nat 8\u20139. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not\nparticipate in testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood, \u201cqualified as\nan expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph\nmachine.\u201d Id., at 9. \u201cRazatos provided live, in-court tes\u00ad\ntimony,\u201d the court stated, \u201cand, thus, was available for\ncross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma\u00ad\nchine, the results of [Bullcoming\u2019s] BAC test, and the\nSLD\u2019s established laboratory procedures.\u201d Ibid. Razatos\u2019\ntestimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull\u00ad\ncoming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ\u00ad\nten report. Id., at 10. But \u201c[Bullcoming\u2019s] right of con\u00ad\nfrontation was preserved,\u201d the court concluded, because\nRazatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro\u00ad\ngate for Caylor. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the\nConfrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In so ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court explicitly overruled\nState v. Dedman, 2004\u2013NMSC\u2013037, 102 P. 3d 628 (2004), which had\nclassified blood-alcohol reports as public records neither \u201cinvestigative\nnor prosecutorial\u201d in nature. 226 P. 3d, at 7\u20138.\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certi\u00ad\nfication, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial,\nthrough the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not\nsign the certification or personally perform or observe the\nperformance of the test reported in the certification. 561\nU. S. ___ (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling\nprecedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testi\u00ad\nmonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the\naccused at trial unless the witness who made the state\u00ad\nment is unavailable and the accused has had a prior op\u00ad\nportunity to confront that witness. Because the New\nMexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial state\u00ad\nment of one witness, i.e., Caylor, to enter into evidence\nthrough the in-court testimony of a second person, i.e.,\nRazatos, we reverse that court\u2019s judgment.\n                               II\n   The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause confers\nupon the accused \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, . . . the\nright . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d\nIn a pathmarking 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington,\nwe overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which\nhad interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admis\u00ad\nsion of absent witnesses\u2019 testimonial statements based on\na judicial determination of reliability. See Roberts, 448\nU. S., at 66. Rejecting Roberts\u2019 \u201camorphous notions of \u2018re\u00ad\nliability,\u2019 \u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 61, Crawford held\nthat fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admis\u00ad\nsion of \u201c[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from\ntrial . . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\nwhere the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross\u00ad\nexamine,\u201d id., at 59. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (\u201c[F]or testimonial evidence\nto be admissible, the Sixth Amendment \u2018demands what\nthe common law required: unavailability [of the witness]\nand a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d (quoting\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCrawford, 541 U. S., at 68)). Melendez-Diaz, relying on\nCrawford\u2019s rationale, refused to create a \u201cforensic evi\u00ad\ndence\u201d exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 11\u201315).5 An analyst\u2019s certification prepared in\nconnection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,\nthe Court held, is \u201ctestimonial,\u201d and therefore within the\ncompass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip\nop., at 15\u201318).6\n  The State in the instant case never asserted that the\nanalyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was\nunavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was\nplaced on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See\nsupra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity\nto cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,\ntherefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming\u2019s favor. The New\nMexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing\nthat the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an\nadequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why\nRazatos\u2019 appearance did not meet the Confrontation\nClause requirement. We next address the State\u2019s argu\u00ad\nment that the SLD report ranks as \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application\n\nof the Court\u2019s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case\nthan to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti\u00ad\ncizing the \u201cCrawford line of cases\u201d for rejecting \u201creliable evidence\u201d);\npost, at 8\u20139, 11 (deploring \u201cCrawford\u2019s rejection of the [reliability\u00ad\ncentered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts\u201d).\n  6 To rank as \u201ctestimonial,\u201d a statement must have a \u201cprimary pur\u00ad\n\npose\u201d of \u201cestablish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to\nlater criminal prosecution.\u201d Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822\n(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating\non the purpose for which a \u201ctestimonial report\u201d is created, we observed\nin Melendez-Diaz that business and public records \u201care generally\nadmissible absent confrontation . . . because\u2014having been created for\nthe administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial\u2014they are not testimonial.\u201d\n557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore \u201c[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause\u201d\nin the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization\nomitted).\n                               A\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi\u00ad\nmony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in\nthis case because analyst Caylor \u201csimply transcribed the\nresul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,\u201d\npresenting no interpretation and exercising no independ\u00ad\nent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming\u2019s \u201ctrue \u2018ac\u00ad\ncuser,\u2019 \u201d the court said, was the machine, while testing\nanalyst Caylor\u2019s role was that of \u201cmere scrivener.\u201d Id., at\n9. Caylor\u2019s certification, however, reported more than a\nmachine-generated number. See supra, at 3\u20134.\n   Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming\u2019s blood\nsample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to\nmake sure that the forensic report number and the sample\nnumber \u201ccorrespond[ed],\u201d and that he performed on Bull\u00ad\ncoming\u2019s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise\nprotocol. App. 62\u201365. He further represented, by leaving\nthe \u201c[r]emarks\u201d section of the report blank, that no \u201ccir\u00ad\ncumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the\nsample or . . . the validity of the analysis.\u201d Id., at 62, 65.\nThese representations, relating to past events and human\nactions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are\nmeet for cross-examination.\n   The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme\nCourt\u2019s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit\u00ad\nnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual\nconditions or events, e.g., \u201cthe light was green,\u201d \u201cthe hour\nwas noon.\u201d Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what\nthey observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec\u00ad\ntive fact\u2014Bullcoming\u2019s counsel posited the address above\nthe front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35.

As our precedent makes plain, the answer is\nemphatically \u201cNo.\u201d See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be \u201cevaded\nby having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes\u00ad\ntimony of the declarant\u201d (emphasis deleted)); Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis\u00ad\nsenting) (\u201cThe Court made clear in Davis that it will not\npermit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter\ninto evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.\u201d).\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number\nregistered by the gas chromatograph machine called for\nno interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on\nCaylor\u2019s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8\u20139. We have already ex\u00ad\nplained that Caylor certified to more than a machine\u00ad\ngenerated number. See supra, at 3\u20134. In any event, the\ncomparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report\ndrawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the\nSixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford\nthat the \u201cobviou[s] reliab[ility]\u201d of a testimonial statement\ndoes not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541\nU. S., at 62; see id., at 61 (Clause \u201ccommands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the cruci\u00ad\nble of cross-examination\u201d). Accordingly, the analysts who\nwrite reports that the prosecution introduces must be\nmade available for confrontation even if they possess \u201cthe\nscientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of\nMother Teresa.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 6\n(slip op., at 14, n. 6).\n                           B\n  Recognizing that admission of the blood-alcohol analysis\n12                BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndepended on \u201clive, in-court testimony [by] a qualified ana\u00ad\nlyst,\u201d 226 P. 3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nbelieved that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because\nRazatos \u201cqualified as an expert witness with respect to the\ngas chromatograph machine and the SLD\u2019s labora\u00ad\ntory procedures,\u201d id., at 9. But surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what\nCaylor knew or observed about the events his certification\nconcerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he\nemployed.7 Nor could such surrogate testimony expose\nany lapses or lies on the certifying analyst\u2019s part.8 Signifi\u00ad\ncant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on\nthe stand, Bullcoming\u2019s counsel could have asked ques\u00ad\ntions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasive\u00ad\nness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor\u2019s removal from\nhis work station. Notable in this regard, the State never\nasserted that Caylor was \u201cunavailable\u201d; the prosecution\nconveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.\nNor did the State assert that Razatos had any \u201cindepend\u00ad\nent opinion\u201d concerning Bullcoming\u2019s BAC. See Brief for\nRespondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor\u2019s live testimony\ncould hardly be typed \u201ca hollow formality,\u201d post, at 4.\n   More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in Craw\nford, \u201c[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not sug\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 We do not question that analyst Caylor, in common with other ana\u00ad\n\nlysts employed by SLD, likely would not recall a particular test, given\nthe number of tests each analyst conducts and the standard procedure\nfollowed in testing. Even so, Caylor\u2019s testimony under oath would have\nenabled Bullcoming\u2019s counsel to raise before a jury questions concern\u00ad\ning Caylor\u2019s proficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and\nhis veracity. In particular, Bullcoming\u2019s counsel likely would have\ninquired on cross-examination why Caylor had been placed on unpaid\nleave.\n   8 At Bullcoming\u2019s trial, Razatos acknowledged that \u201cyou don\u2019t know\n\nunless you actually observe the analysis that someone else conducts,\nwhether they followed th[e] protocol in every instance.\u201d App. 59.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation re\u00ad\nquirement to be developed by the courts.\u201d 541 U. S., at 54.\nNor is it \u201cthe role of courts to extrapolate from the words\nof the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and\nthen to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve\n(in the courts\u2019 views) those underlying values.\u201d Giles v.\nCalifornia, 554 U. S. 353, 375 (2008). Accordingly, the\nClause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation\nsimply because the court believes that questioning one\nwitness about another\u2019s testimonial statements provides a\nfair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\n     A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment\nright\u2014the right to counsel\u2014is instructive. In United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), the Gov\u00ad\nernment argued that illegitimately denying a defendant\nhis counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amend-\nment where \u201csubstitute counsel\u2019s performance\u201d did not\ndemonstrably prejudice the defendant. Id., at 144\u2013145.\nThis Court rejected the Government\u2019s argument. \u201c[T]rue\nenough,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthe purpose of the rights\nset forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair\ntrial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disre\u00ad\ngarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.\u201d Id., at\n145. If a \u201cparticular guarantee\u201d of the Sixth Amendment\nis violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation,\nand \u201c[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to\nmake the violation \u2018complete.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 146. If repre\u00ad\nsentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth\nAmendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a\nsubstitute witness.\n   In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor\u2019s\ncertification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the\nright to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read\nany other way. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Court\u2019s holding means\n\u201cthe . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed\n14               BULLCOMING v.

Melendez-Diaz left no room for that\nargument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,\nsee 226 P. 3d, at 7\u20138; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find\ninescapable.\n   In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police\nrequest, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re\u00ad\nported the laboratory\u2019s analysis to the police (the sub\u00ad\nstance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2). The \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d prepared\nby the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,\nthis Court held, were \u201cincontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact\u201d\nin a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter\u00ad\nnal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was\nserved by the certificate in question here.\n   The State maintains that the affirmations made by\nanalyst Caylor were not \u201cadversarial\u201d or \u201cinquisitorial,\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 27\u201333; instead, they were simply\nobservations of an \u201cindependent scientis[t]\u201d made \u201caccord\u00ad\ning to a non-adversarial public duty,\u201d id., at 32\u201333.

Noteworthy as\nwell, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to\nmunicipal and magistrate courts\u2019 rules that provide for the\nadmission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n   In sum, the formalities attending the \u201creport of blood\nalcohol analysis\u201d are more than adequate to qualify Cay\u00ad\nlor\u2019s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notariza\u00ad\ntion does not remove his certification from Confrontation\nClause governance.

This argu\u00ad\nment, also advanced in the dissent, post, at 10\u201311, largely\nrepeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in Melendez-Diaz.\nSee 557 U.

Moreover, New Mexico\u2019s Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division, has attributed the \u201cchaotic\u201d conditions\nnoted by the dissent, ibid., to several favors, among them, staff attri\u00ad\ntion, a state hiring freeze, a 15% increase in the number of blood\nsamples received for testing, and \u201cwildly\u201d divergent responses by New\nMexico District Attorneys to Melendez-Diaz.

The hearsay rule\u2019s recognition of the\ncertificates\u2019 evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci\u00ad\nsion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri\u00ad\nmary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation\nClause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that\nunder Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the\n\u201csole purpose of the affidavits was to provide\u201d evidence).\n   Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets\nforth the BAC report and Caylor\u2019s certification on it\nclearly have a \u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony.\u201d Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC\nreport is not materially distinguishable from the certifi\u00ad\ncates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2, 4\u20135). 2\n   The formality inherent in the certification further sug\u00ad\ngests its evidentiary purpose. Although \u201c[f]ormality is not\nthe sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,\u201d a\nstatement\u2019s formality or informality can shed light on\nwhether a particular statement has a primary purpose\nof use at trial.

As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the\ncase \u201cthat anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the\nchain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing\ndevice, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case . . . .

Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil\u00ad\nity, the dissent\u2019s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron\u00ad\ntation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi\u00ad\n4                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nI agree with the Court\u2019s assessment that the certificate at\nissue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of\nnotarization. Ante, at 14\u201315; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\n(\u201c[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive\u201d). The\nformality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to\nsign his name and \u201ccertify\u201d to both the result and the\nstatements on the form. A \u201ccertification\u201d requires one\n\u201c[t]o attest\u201d that the accompanying statements are true.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of\n\u201ccertify\u201d); see also id., at 147 (defining \u201cattest\u201d as \u201c[t]o bear\nwitness; testify,\u201d or \u201c[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to\nauthenticate by signing as a witness\u201d).\n   In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a\n\u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for\ntrial testimony,\u201d Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nwhich renders it testimonial.\n                            B\n  After holding that the report was testimonial, the New\nMexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis\u00ad\nsion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for\ntwo reasons: because Caylor was a \u201cmere scrivener,\u201d and\nbecause Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings\nof the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226\nP. 3d, at 8\u201310. The Court convincingly explains why those\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmonial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial\nnature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has\nlong been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality\nsuggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex\u00ad\nplained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, \u201cdoes not necessarily\nindicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.\u201d 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the\ntestimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic\nunconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial.

Therefore, the\nNew Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding\nthat the report was admissible via Razatos\u2019 testimony.\n                                 II\n   Although this case is materially indistinguishable from\nthe facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight\nsome of the factual circumstances that this case does not\npresent.\n   First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an\nalternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur\u00ad\npose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not\nclaimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom\u00ad\ning with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing \u201cStatements for Purposes\nof Medical Diagnosis or Treatment\u201d under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are\n\u201cby their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a\nprosecution\u201d); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.

S. 353, 376 (2008)\n(\u201c[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving\ntreatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay\nrules\u201d).\n   Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying\nis a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,\nalbeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\nRazatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no\nrole in producing the BAC report and did not observe any\nportion of Curtis Caylor\u2019s conduct of the testing. App. 58.\nThe court below also recognized Razatos\u2019 total lack of\nconnection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would\nbe a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob\u00ad\nserved an analyst conducting a test testified about the\nresults or a report about such results.

See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or\ndata of a type upon which experts in the field would rea\u00ad\nsonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible\nin order for the expert\u2019s opinion based on the facts and\ndata to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the\nState does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,\nexpert opinion about Bullcoming\u2019s blood alcohol concentra\u00ad\ntion. Rather, the State explains, \u201c[a]side from reading a\nreport that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos\noffered no opinion about Petitioner\u2019s blood alcohol content\n. . . .\u201d Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).\nHere the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor\u2019s\ntestimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a\ndifferent question if asked to determine the constitutional\u00ad\nity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019 testi\u00ad\nmonial statements if the testimonial statements were not\nthemselves admitted as evidence.\n    Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced\nonly machine-generated results, such as a printout from a\ngas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor\u2019s\nstatements, which included his transcription of a blood\nalcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro\u00ad\nmatograph printout, along with other statements about\nthe procedures used in handling the blood sample. See\nante, at 10; App. 62 (\u201cI certify that I followed the proce\u00ad\ndures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state\u00ad\nments in this block are correct\u201d).

Pointer v. Texas,\n380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965). Two Terms ago, in a case aris\ning from a state criminal prosecution, the Court inter\npreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory\nreport sought to be introduced based on the authority of\nthat report\u2019s own sworn statement that a test had been\nperformed yielding the results as shown. Melendez-Diaz v.\nMassachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009). The Court\u2019s opinion\nin that case held the report inadmissible because no one\nwas present at trial to testify to its contents.\n   Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the\nresult in Melendez-Diaz, the Court today takes the new\nand serious misstep of extending that holding to instances\nlike this one. Here a knowledgeable representative of the\nlaboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab\u2019s\nprocesses and the details of the report; but because he was\nnot the analyst who filled out part of the form and tran\nscribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the\nCourt finds a confrontation violation. Some of the princi\npal objections to the Court\u2019s underlying theory have been\nset out earlier and need not be repeated here. See id., at\n___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Additional reasons, appli\n2               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new\nruling in this case, are now explained in support of this\nrespectful dissent.\n                              I\n   Before today, the Court had not held that the Confron\ntation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when\nan employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the\nfindings, testifies to the laboratory\u2019s methods and prac\ntices, and is cross-examined at trial. Far from replacing\nlive testimony with \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cextrajudicial\u201d ex\naminations, Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 835, 836\n(2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis deleted and internal quota\ntion marks omitted), these procedures are fully consistent\nwith the Confrontation Clause and with well-established\nprinciples for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted\nin full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability\nand with the confrontation guarantee. They do not \u201cre\nsemble Marian proceedings.\u201d Id., at 837.\n   The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by\nthe Court, make live testimony rather than the \u201csolem\nnity\u201d of a document the primary reason to credit the labo\nratory\u2019s scientific results. Id., at 838. Unlike Melendez-\nDiaz, where the jury was asked to credit a labora-\ntory\u2019s findings based solely on documents that were\n\u201cquite plainly affidavits,\u201d 557 U.

App. 56 (laboratory employee\u2019s testimony agree\ning that \u201conce the material is prepared and placed in the\nmachine, you don\u2019t need any particular expertise to record\nthe results\u201d). The information contained in the report was\nthe result of a scientific process comprising multiple par\nticipants\u2019 acts, each with its own evidentiary significance.\nThese acts included receipt of the sample at the labora\ntory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample\ninto the testing device; transposing the printout of the\nresults of the test onto the report; and review of the re\nsults. See Id., at 48\u201356; see also Brief for State of New\nMexico Dept. of Health Scientific Laboratory Division as\nAmicus Curiae 4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Labo\nratory Brief) (\u201cEach blood sample has original testing\nwork by . . . as many as seve[n] analysts . . . .\u201d); App. 62\n(indicating that this case involved three laboratory ana\nlysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed\nanalysis of the sample); cf. Brief for State of Indiana et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Briscoe v. Virginia, O. T. 2009, No. 07\u2013\n11191, p. 10 (hereinafter Indiana Brief) (explaining that\nDNA analysis can involve the combined efforts of up to 40\nanalysts).\n   In the New Mexico scientific laboratory where the blood\nsample was processed, analyses are run in batches involv\ning 40\u201360 samples. Each sample is identified by a com\nputer-generated number that is not linked back to the file\ncontaining the name of the person from whom the sample\ncame until after all testing is completed. See New Mexico\nScientific Laboratory Brief 26. The analysis is mechani\ncally performed by the gas chromatograph, which may\noperate\u2014as in this case\u2014after all the laboratory employ\nees leave for the day. See id., at 17. And whatever the\nresult, it is reported to both law enforcement and the\ndefense. See id., at 36.\n   The representative of the testing laboratory whom the\nprosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr.\n4              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nRazatos. He testified that he \u201chelp[ed] in overseeing the\nadministration of these programs throughout the State,\u201d\nand he was qualified to answer questions concerning each\nof these steps. App. 49. The Court has held that the\ngovernment need not produce at trial \u201ceveryone who laid\nhands on the evidence,\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, n. 1\n(slip op., at 5, n. 1). Here, the defense used the opportu\nnity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial\nof certain laboratory employees. Under questioning by\nBullcoming\u2019s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his\nname did not appear on the report; that he did not receive\nthe sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review;\nand that he did not know the reason for some personnel\ndecisions. App. 58. After weighing arguments from de\nfense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con\nsidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the\nlaboratory\u2019s protocols and processes, the jury found no\nreasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\n   In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the\ntechnician who filled out a form and recorded the results\nof a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to\nchallenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and\nexamine the technician who performed a test. And it may\ncall other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not\nalways reliable or that the technician might have made a\nmistake. The jury can then decide whether to credit the\ntest, as it did here. The States, furthermore, can assess\nthe progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt stat\nutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is\nadmitted. Rejecting these commonsense arguments and\nthe concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the\nCourt today takes a different course. It once more as\nsumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evi\ndentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming\nMelendez-Diaz\u2019s \u201cvast potential to disrupt criminal proce\ndures.\u201d 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (KENNEDY, J.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ndissenting).\n                               II\n   The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed\nthe Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure\na fair trial with reliable evidence. But the Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated\nthe reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at\n61\u201362. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a\nlab report because it \u201cis formalized in a signed document.\u201d\nAnte, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt\u2019s unconventional and unstated premise is that\nthe State\u2014by acting to ensure a statement\u2019s reliability\u2014\nmakes the statement more formal and therefore less likely\nto be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?\n19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the\nCourt insists, because reliability does not animate the\nConfrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312); Crawford, supra, at 61\u201362. Yet\njust this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta\ntion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti\ntutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___, ___\u2013___ (2010) (slip op., at 11\u201312, 14\u201315).\n   Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out\nof the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes\nbeen dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur\nring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834\u2013837,\n841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction\nbetween utterances aimed at proving past events, and\nthose calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare\nDavis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n24\u201330), with id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20139) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n   It is not even clear which witnesses\u2019 testimony could\n6               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrender a scientific report admissible under the Court\u2019s\napproach. Melendez-Diaz stated an inflexible rule: Where\n\u201canalysts\u2019 affidavits\u201d included \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d\ndefendants were \u201centitled to be confronted with the ana\nlysts\u201d themselves. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,\nthis rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too\nstrict to be followed. A report is admissible, today\u2019s opin\nion states, if a \u201clive witness competent to testify to the\ntruth of the statements made in the report\u201d appears. Ante,\nat 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana\nlyst, but also any \u201cscientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob\nserve[d] the test reported in the certification.\u201d Ante, at 2.\n   Today\u2019s majority is not committed in equal shares to a\ncommon set of principles in applying the holding of Craw\nford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,\nsupra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,\nat ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the\nCourt), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has\nhad such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case\u2019s\nmeaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in\nevery criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court\nin the Nation. This Court\u2019s prior decisions leave trial\njudges to \u201cguess what future rules this Court will distill\nfrom the sparse constitutional text,\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug\ngle to apply an \u201camorphous, if not entirely subjective,\u201d\n\u201chighly context-dependent inquiry\u201d involving \u201copen-ended\nbalancing.\u201d Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority\u2019s approach).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   The persistent ambiguities in the Court\u2019s approach are\nsymptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica\ntions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus\ntrate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted\nthat its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of\ncustody to testify but then qualified that \u201cwhat testimony\nis introduced must . . . be introduced live.\u201d 557 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This\ncould mean that a statement that evidence remained in\nlaw-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement\u2019s\nmaker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head\nquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain\nof custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also\nbe that that the intern\u2019s statement\u2014which draws on\nstatements in the evidence log\u2014is inadmissible unless\nevery officer who signed the log appears at trial. That\nrule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis\nsibility of the report on the testimony of three or more\nidentified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or\neven 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt has thus\u2014in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz\u2014boxed\nitself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation\nClause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are\nunworkable.\n                            III\n  Crawford itself does not compel today\u2019s conclusion. It\nis true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation\nClause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat\ning trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,\nat 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312). Crawford\nexplained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to\naddress the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious\ntreason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On\nthis view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of\ncourt statements obtained through formal interrogation in\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npreparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defen\ndants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, un\ntested statements by those who observed\u2014or claimed to\nhave observed\u2014preparation for or commission of the\ncrime. And, of course, those statements might not have\nbeen uttered at all or\u2014even if spoken\u2014might not have\nbeen true.\n   A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, pro\nvides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitu\ntional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like\nthe instant one, reports prepared by experienced techni\ncians in laboratories that follow professional norms and\nscientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right\nto call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this\ncase was already protected by checks on potential prosecu\ntorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result\nblind issuance of reports; testing by an independent\nagency; routine processes performed en masse, which\nreduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating\npursuant to scientific and professional norms and over\nsight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14\u201315, 41, 54; New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.\n   In addition to preventing the State from conducting ex\nparte trials, Crawford\u2019s rejection of the regime of Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), seemed to have two under\nlying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the\nintricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate;\nand the other was to allow the States, in their own courts\nand legislatures and without this Court\u2019s supervision, to\nexplore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules\npertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.\nThese results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks\nthe experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial\nprocess to suit it well to assume the role of national tribu\nnal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these\nobjectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their oppo\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsites.\n   Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay\ndoctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear\nsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined\nformulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta\ntion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge\nof Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.\n691, 739\u2013740, 742, 744\u2013746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern\nEvidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502\u2013503, 514\u2013515,\n533\u2013537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,\nthe Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen\ntury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to\nmake those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay\u2019s Last\nHurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5\u20136, 36. As a result, the Court\nhas taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap\nplication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court\nstatements by unconfronted and available witnesses who\nobserved the crime and do not appear at trial.\n   Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of\ntheir hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are\nforeclosed now from contributing to the formulation and\nenactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli\nable. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission\nof well-documented and supported reports of abuse by\nwomen whose abusers later murdered them must give\nway, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur\npose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554\nU. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14\u201315. Whether\nthose statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability\nand other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation\nClause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open\nquestion. The point is that the States cannot now partici\npate in the development of this difficult part of the law.\n   In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic\ndisplacement of the States and dislocation of the federal\nstructure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nop., at 2\u20133, 22\u201323). If this Court persists in applying\nwooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony of\nfered by the prosecution\u2014testimony thought proper for\nmany decades in state and federal courts committed to\ndevising fair trial processes\u2014then the States might find it\nnecessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommo\ndate this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those\nrules could remain on State statute books for decades,\neven if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better\nimplement the objectives of Crawford. This underscores\nthe disruptive, long-term structural consequences of deci\nsions like the one the Court announces today.\n   States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to\nenact statutes that require defense counsel to give ad\nvance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a\nreport without the presence in court of the technician who\nprepared it. Indeed, today\u2019s opinion relies upon laws of\nthat sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.\nAnte, at 17 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic,\nhowever, to think that this will take away from the de\nfense the incentives to insist on having the certifying\nanalyst present. There is in the ordinary case that pro\nceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive\nthe right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.\n   Today\u2019s opinion repeats an assertion from Melendez-\nDiaz that its decision will not \u201cimpose an undue burden on\nthe prosecution.\u201d Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion). But\nevidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See,\ne.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 7\n(explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles\nPolice Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appear\nances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District\nAttorneys Assocation et al. as Amici Curiae 23 (observing\nthat each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes\n3,220 cases per year on average).

From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re\nquiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving\ncases rose 71%, to 1,600\u2014or 8 or 9 every workday. New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the\nNation\u2019s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10\ntotal analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases\nrecently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The\nanalysts now must travel great distances on most working\ndays. The result has been, in the laboratory\u2019s words,\n\u201cchaotic.\u201d Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection\nand the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or\non leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer\nemployed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a\nwindfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in\never-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability\nto produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant\nincreases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo\nratory\u2019s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce\nstate resources could be committed to other urgent needs\nin the criminal justice system.\n                       *     *     *\n   Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering\nthat the Crawford approach was not preordained. This\nCourt\u2019s missteps have produced an interpretation of the\nword \u201cwitness\u201d at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the\nConstitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amend\nment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84\nGeo. L. J. 641, 647, 691\u2013696 (1996), and at odds with\nthe sound administration of justice. It is time to return\nto solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to\ndecline to extend Melendez-Diaz to bar the reliable, com\nmonsense evidentiary framework the State sought to\nfollow in this case.\n</pre>",
