NEW MEXICO\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW MEXICO\n\n     No. 09–10876.       Argued March 2, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011\nThe Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause gives the accused “[i]n\n  all criminal prosecutions, . . . the right . . . to be confronted with the\n  witnesses against him.” In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59,\n  this Court held that the Clause permits admission of “[t]estimonial\n  statements of witnesses absent from trial . . . only where the decla\n  rant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior\n  opportunity to cross-examine.” Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\n  setts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a “forensic evidence”\n  exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, cre\n  ated specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked\n  as “testimonial” for Confrontation Clause purposes. Absent stipula\n  tion, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a re\n  port without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth\n  of the report’s statements. 557 U. S., at ___.\n     Petitioner Bullcoming’s jury trial on charges of driving while in\n  toxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.\n  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certi\n  fying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the thresh\n  old for aggravated DWI. Bullcoming’s blood sample had been tested\n  at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Divi\n  sion (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed,\n  signed, and certified the report. However, the prosecution neither\n  called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record\n  showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undis\n  closed reason. In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst,\n  Razatos, to validate the report. Razatos was familiar with the testing\n  device used to analyze Bullcoming’s blood and with the laboratory’s\n  testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the\n  test on Bullcoming’s blood sample. Bullcoming’s counsel objected, as\n2                   BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    serting that introduction of Caylor’s report without his testimony\n    would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled\n    the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and\n    permitted Razatos to testify. Bullcoming was convicted, and, while\n    his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this\n    Court decided Melendez-Diaz. The state high court acknowledged\n    that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under\n    Melendez-Diaz, but held that the report’s admission did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a\n    mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test re\n    sults, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in\n    testing Bullcoming’s blood, qualified as an expert witness with re\n    spect to the testing machine and SLD procedures. The court affirmed\n    Bullcoming’s conviction.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n147 N. M. 487, 226 P. 3d 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to all but Part IV and footnote 6. The Confrontation Clause, the opin\n  ion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic\n  laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in or\n  der to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony\n  of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform\n  or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.\n  The accused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the\n  certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the ac\n  cused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular\n  scientist. Pp. 8–16.\n     (a) If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be intro\n  duced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the\n  statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity\n  to confront that witness. Pp. 8–14.\n       (i) Caylor’s certification reported more than a machine-generated\n  number: It represented that he received Bullcoming’s blood sample\n  intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the\n  forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he\n  performed a particular test on Bullcoming’s sample, adhering to a\n  precise protocol; and that he left the report’s remarks section blank,\n  indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample’s in\n  tegrity or the analysis’ validity. These representations, relating to\n  past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine\n  produced data, are meet for cross-examination. The potential ramifi\n  cations of the state court’s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags. Most\n  witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.\n  Where, for example, a police officer’s report recorded an objective fact\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsuch as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court’s reasoning would\npermit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or\nshe was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer\ndeployed and the police department’s standard operating procedures.\nAs, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, how\never, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause. The\ncomparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report does not\ndispense with the Clause. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62. The analysts\nwho write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for\nconfrontation even if they have “the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie\nand the veracity of Mother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___,\nn. 6. Pp. 10–11.\n     (ii) Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply be\ncause he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine\nand the SLD’s laboratory procedures. Surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor\nknew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses\nor lies on Caylor’s part. Significantly, Razatos did not know why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand,\nBullcoming’s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to\nreveal whether Caylor’s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty ac\ncounted for his removal from work. And the State did not assert that\nRazatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming’s blood\nalcohol content. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does\nnot tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court\nbelieves that questioning one witness about another’s testimonial\nstatements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\nAlthough the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair\ntrial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because,\non the whole, the trial is fair. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 145. If a “particular guarantee” is violated, no substitute\nprocedure can cure the violation. Id., at 146. Pp. 11–14.\n   (b) Melendez-Diaz precluded the State’s argument that introduc\ntion of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause be\ncause the report is nontestimonial. Like the certificates in Melendez-\nDiaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an “affirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact” in a criminal proceed\ning. 557 U. S., at ___. Created solely for an “evidentiary purpose,”\nid., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial. In all material respects,\nthe SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as\nthere, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory re\nquired by law to assist in police investigations. Like the Melendez-\nDiaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate\nconcerning the result of his analysis. And like the Melendez-Diaz\n4                    BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    certificates, Caylor’s report here is “formalized” in a signed document,\n    Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form\n    contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts’ rules\n    that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n    Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at\n    tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor’s as\n    sertions as testimonial.

The report had been created specifically to serve\nas evidence in a criminal proceeding. Absent stipulation,\nthe Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a\nreport without offering a live witness competent to testify\nto the truth of the statements made in the report.\n  In the case before us, petitioner Donald Bullcoming\nwas arrested on charges of driving while intoxicated\n(DWI). Principal evidence against Bullcoming was a foren­\nsic laboratory report certifying that Bullcoming’s blood­\nalcohol concentration was well above the threshold for\naggravated DWI. At trial, the prosecution did not call as a\nwitness the analyst who signed the certification. Instead,\nthe State called another analyst who was familiar with the\n——————\n  * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE KAGAN join all but Part IV of this\nopinion.

NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaboratory’s testing procedures, but had neither partici­\npated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming’s blood sam­\nple. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,\nalthough the blood-alcohol analysis was “testimonial,” the\nConfrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana­\nlyst’s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico’s high\ncourt held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the\nconstitutional requirements.\n  The question presented is whether the Confrontation\nClause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic\nlaboratory report containing a testimonial certification—\nmade for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through\nthe in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the\ncertification or perform or observe the test reported in the\ncertification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that\norder does not meet the constitutional requirement. The\naccused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who\nmade the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable\nat trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to\ncross-examine that particular scientist.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald\nBullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection\nin Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited\nhis vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur­\nance information, he noticed that Bullcoming’s eyes were\nbloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming’s breath, the\ntruckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left\nthe scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre­\nhended by an officer who observed his performance of field\nsobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was\narrested for driving a vehicle while “under the influence of\nintoxicating liquor” (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat. Ann.\n§66–8–102 (2004).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the\npolice obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy­\nsis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming’s\nblood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull­\ncoming’s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police\nsent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD\nform titled “Report of Blood Alcohol Analysis,” partici­\npants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana­\nlyst certified his finding. App. 62.\n   SLD’s report contained in the top block “information . . .\nfilled in by [the] arresting officer.” Ibid. (capitalization\nomitted). This information included the “reason [the]\nsuspect [was] stopped” (the officer checked “Accident”),\nand the date (“8.14.05”) and time (“18:25 PM”) the blood\nsample was drawn. Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The\narresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull­\ncoming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two\nblocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew\nBullcoming’s blood and the SLD intake employee who\nreceived the blood sample sent to the laboratory. Ibid.\n   Following these segments, the report presented the\n“certificate of analyst,” ibid. (capitalization omitted), com­\npleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic\nanalyst assigned to test Bullcoming’s blood sample. Id., at\n62, 64–65. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming’s\nsample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordi­\nnately high level. Id., at 62. Caylor also affirmed that\n“[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken\nin the laboratory,” that “the statements in [the analyst’s\nblock of the report] are correct,” and that he had “followed\nthe procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.” Ibid.\nThose “procedures” instructed analysts, inter alia, to “re­\ntai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the\nanalysis,” and to “not[e] any circumstance or condition\nwhich might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise\n4                 BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\naffect the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 65. Finally, in a\nblock headed “certificate of reviewer,” the SLD examiner\nwho reviewed Caylor’s analysis certified that Caylor was\nqualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the “estab­\nlished procedure” for handling and analyzing Bullcoming’s\nsample “ha[d] been followed.” Id., at 62 (capitalization\nomitted).\n   SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to de­\ntermine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires\nspecialized knowledge and training. Several steps are\ninvolved in the gas chromatograph process, and human\nerror can occur at each step.1\n——————\n    1 Gaschromatography is a widely used scientific method of quan­\ntitatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H.\nMcNair & J. Miller, Basic Gas Chromatography (2d ed. 2009) (hereinaf­\nter McNair). Under SLD’s standard testing protocol, the analyst ex­\ntracts two blood samples and inserts them into vials containing an\n“internal standard”—a chemical additive. App. 53. See McNair 141–\n142. The analyst then “cap[s] the [two] sample[s],” “crimp[s] them with\nan aluminum top,” and places the vials into the gas chromatograph\nmachine. App. 53–54. Within a few hours, this device produces a\nprinted graph—a chromatogram—along with calculations representing\na software-generated interpretation of the data. See Brief for State of\nNew Mexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 16–17.\n   Although the State presented testimony that obtaining an accurate\nBAC measurement merely entails “look[ing] at the [gas chromatograph]\nmachine and record[ing] the results,” App. 54, authoritative sources re­\nveal that the matter is not so simple or certain. “In order to perform\nquantitative analyses satisfactorily and . . . support the results under\nrigorous examination in court, the analyst must be aware of, and\nadhere to, good analytical practices and understand what is being done\nand why.” Stafford, Chromatography, in Principles of Forensic Toxicol­\nogy 92, 114 (B. Levine 2d ed. 2006). See also McNair 137 (“Errors that\noccur in any step can invalidate the best chromatographic analysis, so\nattention must be paid to all steps.”); D. Bartell, M. McMurray, &\nA.

The State accordingly charged Bullcoming\nwith this more serious crime.\n                             B\n  The case was tried to a jury in November 2005, after our\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004),\nbut before Melendez-Diaz. On the day of trial, the State\nannounced that it would not be calling SLD analyst Curtis\nCaylor as a witness because he had “very recently [been]\nput on unpaid leave” for a reason not revealed. 2010–\nNMSC–007, ¶8, 226 P. 3d 1, 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); App. 58. A startled defense counsel objected.\nThe prosecution, she complained, had never disclosed,\nuntil trial commenced, that the witness “out there . . .\n[was] not the analyst [of Bullcoming’s sample].” Id., at 46.\nCounsel stated that, “had [she] known that the analyst\n[who tested Bullcoming’s blood] was not available,” her\nopening, indeed, her entire defense “may very well have\nbeen dramatically different.” Id., at 47. The State, how­\never, proposed to introduce Caylor’s finding as a “business\n——————\nvalid. See McNair 207–214.\n   Nor is the risk of human error so remote as to be negligible. Amici\ninform us, for example, that in neighboring Colorado, a single forensic\nlaboratory produced at least 206 flawed blood-alcohol readings over a\nthree-year span, prompting the dismissal of several criminal prosecu­\ntions. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net al. as Amici Curiae 32–33. An analyst had used improper amounts\nof the internal standard, causing the chromatograph machine system­\natically to inflate BAC measurements. The analyst’s error, a supervi­\nsor said, was “fairly complex.” Ensslin, Final Tally on Flawed DUI:\n206 Errors, 9 Tossed or Reduced, Colorado Springs Gazette, Apr. 19,\n2010, p. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted), available at http://\nwww.gazette.com/articles/report-97354-police-discuss.html.

Id., at 44.\n  Bullcoming’s counsel opposed the State’s proposal. Id.,\nat 44–45. Without Caylor’s testimony, defense counsel\nmaintained, introduction of the analyst’s finding would\nviolate Bullcoming’s Sixth Amendment right “to be con­\nfronted with the witnesses against him.” Ibid.2 The trial\ncourt overruled the objection, id., at 46–47, and admitted\nthe SLD report as a business record, id., at 44–46, 57.3\nThe jury convicted Bullcoming of aggravated DWI, and the\nNew Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, con­\ncluding that “the blood alcohol report in the present case\nwas non-testimonial and prepared routinely with guaran­\ntees of trustworthiness.” 2008–NMCA–097, §17, 189 P. 3d\n679, 685.\n                              C\n    While Bullcoming’s appeal was pending before the New\nMexico Supreme Court, this Court decided Melendez-Diaz.\nIn that case, “[t]he Massachusetts courts [had] admitted\ninto evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic\nanalysis which showed that material seized by the police\nand connected to the defendant was cocaine.” 557 U.

Massa\nchusetts, 557 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2009) (slip op., at 5, n. 1), “to decide\nwhat steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence;\nbut what testimony is introduced must (if the defendant objects) be\nintroduced live.”\n   3 The trial judge noted that, when he started out in law practice,\n\n“there were no breath tests or blood tests.

Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court\nobserved, the report was “functionally identical to live, in­\ncourt testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on\ndirect examination.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for\ntwo reasons, the court held that admission of the report\ndid not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n  First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor “was a\nmere scrivener,” who “simply transcribed the results gen­\nerated by the gas chromatograph machine.” 226 P. 3d,\nat 8–9. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not\nparticipate in testing Bullcoming’s blood, “qualified as\nan expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph\nmachine.” Id., at 9. “Razatos provided live, in-court tes­\ntimony,” the court stated, “and, thus, was available for\ncross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma­\nchine, the results of [Bullcoming’s] BAC test, and the\nSLD’s established laboratory procedures.” Ibid. Razatos’\ntestimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull­\ncoming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ­\nten report. Id., at 10. But “[Bullcoming’s] right of con­\nfrontation was preserved,” the court concluded, because\nRazatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro­\ngate for Caylor. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the\nConfrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce\n\n——————\n  4 In so ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court explicitly overruled\nState v. Dedman, 2004–NMSC–037, 102 P. 3d 628 (2004), which had\nclassified blood-alcohol reports as public records neither “investigative\nnor prosecutorial” in nature. 226 P. 3d, at 7–8.\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certi­\nfication, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial,\nthrough the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not\nsign the certification or personally perform or observe the\nperformance of the test reported in the certification. 561\nU. S. ___ (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling\nprecedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testi­\nmonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the\naccused at trial unless the witness who made the state­\nment is unavailable and the accused has had a prior op­\nportunity to confront that witness. Because the New\nMexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial state­\nment of one witness, i.e., Caylor, to enter into evidence\nthrough the in-court testimony of a second person, i.e.,\nRazatos, we reverse that court’s judgment.\n                               II\n   The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause confers\nupon the accused “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, . . . the\nright . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”\nIn a pathmarking 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington,\nwe overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which\nhad interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admis­\nsion of absent witnesses’ testimonial statements based on\na judicial determination of reliability. See Roberts, 448\nU. S., at 66. Rejecting Roberts’ “amorphous notions of ‘re­\nliability,’ ” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 61, Crawford held\nthat fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admis­\nsion of “[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from\ntrial . . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\nwhere the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross­\nexamine,” id., at 59. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (“[F]or testimonial evidence\nto be admissible, the Sixth Amendment ‘demands what\nthe common law required: unavailability [of the witness]\nand a prior opportunity for cross-examination.’ ” (quoting\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Melendez-Diaz, relying on\nCrawford’s rationale, refused to create a “forensic evi­\ndence” exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 11–15).5 An analyst’s certification prepared in\nconnection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,\nthe Court held, is “testimonial,” and therefore within the\ncompass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 15–18).6\n  The State in the instant case never asserted that the\nanalyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was\nunavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was\nplaced on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See\nsupra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity\nto cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,\ntherefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming’s favor. The New\nMexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing\nthat the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an\nadequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why\nRazatos’ appearance did not meet the Confrontation\nClause requirement. We next address the State’s argu­\nment that the SLD report ranks as “nontestimonial,” and\n——————\n  5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application\n\nof the Court’s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case\nthan to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti­\ncizing the “Crawford line of cases” for rejecting “reliable evidence”);\npost, at 8–9, 11 (deploring “Crawford’s rejection of the [reliability­\ncentered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts”).\n  6 To rank as “testimonial,” a statement must have a “primary pur­\n\npose” of “establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to\nlater criminal prosecution.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822\n(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating\non the purpose for which a “testimonial report” is created, we observed\nin Melendez-Diaz that business and public records “are generally\nadmissible absent confrontation . . . because—having been created for\nthe administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”\n557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore “[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause”\nin the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization\nomitted).\n                               A\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi­\nmony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in\nthis case because analyst Caylor “simply transcribed the\nresul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,”\npresenting no interpretation and exercising no independ­\nent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming’s “true ‘ac­\ncuser,’ ” the court said, was the machine, while testing\nanalyst Caylor’s role was that of “mere scrivener.” Id., at\n9. Caylor’s certification, however, reported more than a\nmachine-generated number. See supra, at 3–4.\n   Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming’s blood\nsample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to\nmake sure that the forensic report number and the sample\nnumber “correspond[ed],” and that he performed on Bull­\ncoming’s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise\nprotocol. App. 62–65. He further represented, by leaving\nthe “[r]emarks” section of the report blank, that no “cir­\ncumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the\nsample or . . . the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 62, 65.\nThese representations, relating to past events and human\nactions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are\nmeet for cross-examination.\n   The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit­\nnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual\nconditions or events, e.g., “the light was green,” “the hour\nwas noon.” Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what\nthey observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec­\ntive fact—Bullcoming’s counsel posited the address above\nthe front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35. Could an officer other than the\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\none who saw the number on the house or gun present the\ninformation in court—so long as that officer was equipped\nto testify about any technology the observing officer de­\nployed and the police department’s standard operating\nprocedures? As our precedent makes plain, the answer is\nemphatically “No.” See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be “evaded\nby having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes­\ntimony of the declarant” (emphasis deleted)); Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis­\nsenting) (“The Court made clear in Davis that it will not\npermit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter\ninto evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.”).\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number\nregistered by the gas chromatograph machine called for\nno interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on\nCaylor’s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8–9. We have already ex­\nplained that Caylor certified to more than a machine­\ngenerated number. See supra, at 3–4. In any event, the\ncomparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report\ndrawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the\nSixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford\nthat the “obviou[s] reliab[ility]” of a testimonial statement\ndoes not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541\nU. S., at 62; see id., at 61 (Clause “commands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the cruci­\nble of cross-examination”). Accordingly, the analysts who\nwrite reports that the prosecution introduces must be\nmade available for confrontation even if they possess “the\nscientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of\nMother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 6\n(slip op., at 14, n. 6).\n                           B\n  Recognizing that admission of the blood-alcohol analysis\n12                BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndepended on “live, in-court testimony [by] a qualified ana­\nlyst,” 226 P. 3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nbelieved that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because\nRazatos “qualified as an expert witness with respect to the\ngas chromatograph machine and the SLD’s labora­\ntory procedures,” id., at 9. But surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what\nCaylor knew or observed about the events his certification\nconcerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he\nemployed.7 Nor could such surrogate testimony expose\nany lapses or lies on the certifying analyst’s part.8 Signifi­\ncant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on\nthe stand, Bullcoming’s counsel could have asked ques­\ntions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasive­\nness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor’s removal from\nhis work station. Notable in this regard, the State never\nasserted that Caylor was “unavailable”; the prosecution\nconveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.\nNor did the State assert that Razatos had any “independ­\nent opinion” concerning Bullcoming’s BAC. See Brief for\nRespondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor’s live testimony\ncould hardly be typed “a hollow formality,” post, at 4.\n   More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in Craw\nford, “[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not sug­\n——————\n   7 We do not question that analyst Caylor, in common with other ana­\n\nlysts employed by SLD, likely would not recall a particular test, given\nthe number of tests each analyst conducts and the standard procedure\nfollowed in testing. Even so, Caylor’s testimony under oath would have\nenabled Bullcoming’s counsel to raise before a jury questions concern­\ning Caylor’s proficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and\nhis veracity. In particular, Bullcoming’s counsel likely would have\ninquired on cross-examination why Caylor had been placed on unpaid\nleave.\n   8 At Bullcoming’s trial, Razatos acknowledged that “you don’t know\n\nunless you actually observe the analysis that someone else conducts,\nwhether they followed th[e] protocol in every instance.” App. 59.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation re­\nquirement to be developed by the courts.” 541 U. S., at 54.\nNor is it “the role of courts to extrapolate from the words\nof the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and\nthen to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve\n(in the courts’ views) those underlying values.” Giles v.\nCalifornia, 554 U. S. 353, 375 (2008). Accordingly, the\nClause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation\nsimply because the court believes that questioning one\nwitness about another’s testimonial statements provides a\nfair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\n     A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment\nright—the right to counsel—is instructive. In United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), the Gov­\nernment argued that illegitimately denying a defendant\nhis counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amend-\nment where “substitute counsel’s performance” did not\ndemonstrably prejudice the defendant. Id., at 144–145.\nThis Court rejected the Government’s argument. “[T]rue\nenough,” the Court explained, “the purpose of the rights\nset forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair\ntrial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disre­\ngarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.” Id., at\n145. If a “particular guarantee” of the Sixth Amendment\nis violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation,\nand “[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to\nmake the violation ‘complete.’ ” Id., at 146. If repre­\nsentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth\nAmendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a\nsubstitute witness.\n   In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor’s\ncertification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the\nright to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read\nany other way. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Court’s holding means\n“the . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed\n14               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe certificate”).\n                              III\n   We turn, finally, to the State’s contention that the SLD’s\nblood-alcohol analysis reports are nontestimonial in char­\nacter, therefore no Confrontation Clause question even\narises in this case. Melendez-Diaz left no room for that\nargument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,\nsee 226 P. 3d, at 7–8; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find\ninescapable.\n   In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police\nrequest, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re­\nported the laboratory’s analysis to the police (the sub­\nstance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2). The “certificates of analysis” prepared\nby the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,\nthis Court held, were “incontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact”\nin a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was\nserved by the certificate in question here.\n   The State maintains that the affirmations made by\nanalyst Caylor were not “adversarial” or “inquisitorial,”\nBrief for Respondent 27–33; instead, they were simply\nobservations of an “independent scientis[t]” made “accord­\ning to a non-adversarial public duty,” id., at 32–33. That\nargument fares no better here than it did in Melendez-\nDiaz. A document created solely for an “evidentiary pur­\npose,” Melendez-Diaz clarified, made in aid of a police\ninvestigation, ranks as testimonial. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5) (forensic reports available for use at trial are\n“testimonial statements” and certifying analyst is a\n“ ‘witness’ for purposes of the Sixth Amendment”).\n   Distinguishing Bullcoming’s case from Melendez-Diaz,\nwhere the analysts’ findings were contained in certificates\n“sworn to before a notary public,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 2),\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe State emphasizes that the SLD report of Bullcoming’s\nBAC was “unsworn.” Brief for Respondent 13; post, at 2\n(“only sworn statement” here was that of Razatos, “who\nwas present and [did] testif[y]”). As the New Mexico\nSupreme Court recognized, “ ‘the absence of [an] oath [i]s\nnot dispositive’ in determining if a statement is testimo­\nnial.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52).\nIndeed, in Crawford, this Court rejected as untenable any\nconstruction of the Confrontation Clause that would ren­\nder inadmissible only sworn ex parte affidavits, while\nleaving admission of formal, but unsworn statements\n“perfectly OK.” Id., at 52–53, n. 3. Reading the Clause in\nthis “implausible” manner, ibid., the Court noted, would\nmake the right to confrontation easily erasable. See\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 830–831, n. 5; id., at 838 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n   In all material respects, the laboratory report in this\ncase resembles those in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as in\nMelendez-Diaz, a law-enforcement officer provided seized\nevidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in\npolice investigations, N. M. Stat. Ann. §29–3–4 (2004).\nLike the analysts in Melendez-Diaz, analyst Caylor tested\nthe evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the\nresult of his analysis. App. 62. Like the Melendez-Diaz\ncertificates, Caylor’s certificate is “formalized” in a signed\ndocument, Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.), headed a “report,” App. 62. Noteworthy as\nwell, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to\nmunicipal and magistrate courts’ rules that provide for the\nadmission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n   In sum, the formalities attending the “report of blood\nalcohol analysis” are more than adequate to qualify Cay­\nlor’s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notariza­\ntion does not remove his certification from Confrontation\nClause governance. The New Mexico Supreme Court,\nguided by Melendez-Diaz, correctly recognized that Cay­\n16              BULLCOMING v.

S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4); Davis, 547 U. S., at 830; Crawford,\n541 U. S., at 51–52.\n                              IV\n   The State and its amici urge that unbending applica­\ntion of the Confrontation Clause to forensic evidence would\nimpose an undue burden on the prosecution. This argu­\nment, also advanced in the dissent, post, at 10–11, largely\nrepeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in Melendez-Diaz.\nSee 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–23). The con­\nstitutional requirement, we reiterate, “may not [be] disre­\ngard[ed] . . . at our convenience,” id., at ___ (slip op., at\n19), and the predictions of dire consequences, we again\nobserve, are dubious, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).\n   New Mexico law, it bears emphasis, requires the lab­\noratory to preserve samples, which can be retested by\nother analysts, see N. M. Admin. Code §7.33.2.15(A)(4)–(6)\n(2010), available at http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/\n_title07/T07C033.htm, and neither party questions SLD’s\ncompliance with that requirement. Retesting “is almost\nalways an option . . . in [DWI] cases,” Brief for Public\nDefender Service for District of Columbia et al. as Amici\nCuriae 25 (hereinafter PDS Brief), and the State had that\noption here: New Mexico could have avoided any Confron­\ntation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the\nsample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather\nthan to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.\n   Notably, New Mexico advocates retesting as an effective\nmeans to preserve a defendant’s confrontation right “when\nthe [out-of-court] statement is raw data or a mere tran­\nscription of raw data onto a public record.” Brief for Re­\nspondent 53–54. But the State would require the defen­\ndant to initiate retesting. Id., at 55; post, at 4 (defense\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The prosecution, however, bears the bur­\nden of proof. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19) (“[T]he Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the\nprosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant\nto bring those adverse witnesses into court.”). Hence the\nobligation to propel retesting when the original analyst is\nunavailable is the State’s, not the defendant’s. See Taylor\nv. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 410, n. 14 (1988) (Confrontation\nClause’s requirements apply “in every case, whether or not\nthe defendant seeks to rebut the case against him or to\npresent a case of his own”).\n   Furthermore, notice-and-demand procedures, long in ef­\nfect in many jurisdictions, can reduce burdens on foren-\nsic laboratories. Statutes governing these procedures\ntypically “render . . . otherwise hearsay forensic reports\nadmissible[,] while specifically preserving a defendant’s\nright to demand that the prosecution call the author/\nanalyst of [the] report.” PDS Brief 9; see Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (observing that\nnotice-and-demand statutes “permit the defendant to\nassert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right\nafter receiving notice of the prosecution’s intent to use a\nforensic analyst’s report”).\n   Even before this Court’s decision in Crawford, moreover,\nit was common prosecutorial practice to call the forensic\nanalyst to testify. Prosecutors did so “to bolster the per­\nsuasive power of [the State’s] case[,] . . . [even] when the\ndefense would have preferred that the analyst did not\ntestify.” PDS Brief 8.\n   We note also the “small fraction of . . . cases” that “actu­\nally proceed to trial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 20) (citing estimate that “nearly 95% of convic­\ntions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty\nplea”). And, “when cases in which forensic analysis has\n18                  BULLCOMING v.

Moreover, New Mexico’s Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division, has attributed the “chaotic” conditions\nnoted by the dissent, ibid., to several favors, among them, staff attri­\ntion, a state hiring freeze, a 15% increase in the number of blood\nsamples received for testing, and “wildly” divergent responses by New\nMexico District Attorneys to Melendez-Diaz.

I\nwrite separately first to highlight why I view the report at\nissue to be testimonial—specifically because its “primary\npurpose” is evidentiary—and second to emphasize the\nlimited reach of the Court’s opinion.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n   Under our precedents, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nwas correct to hold that the certified BAC report in this\ncase is testimonial. 2010–NMSC–007, ¶18, 226 P. 3d 1, 8.\n   To determine if a statement is testimonial, we must\ndecide whether it has “a primary purpose of creating an\nout-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” Michigan v.\nBryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11). When\nthe “primary purpose” of a statement is “not to create a\nrecord for trial,” ibid., “the admissibility of [the] statement\nis the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not\nthe Confrontation Clause,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   This is not the first time the Court has faced the ques­\ntion of whether a scientific report is testimonial. As the\nCourt explains, ante, at 14–15, in Melendez-Diaz v. Mas\nsachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), we held that “certificates\n2                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nof analysis,” completed by employees of the State Labora­\ntory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public\nHealth, id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), were testimonial because\nthey were “incontrovertibly . . . ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or\naffirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or\nproving some fact,” ’ ” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 51 (2004), in turn\nquoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (1828)).\n   As we explained earlier this Term in Michigan v. Bry\nant, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), “[i]n making the primary pur­\npose determination, standard rules of hearsay . . . will be\nrelevant.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).1 As applied to a\nscientific report, Melendez-Diaz explained that pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Evidence 803, “[d]ocuments kept in the\nregular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at\ntrial despite their hearsay status,” except “if the regularly\nconducted business activity is the production of evidence\nfor use at trial.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)\n(citing Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6)). In that circumstance, the\nhearsay rules bar admission of even business records. Re­\nlatedly, in the Confrontation Clause context, business\nand public records “are generally admissible absent con­\nfrontation . . . because—having been created for the ad­\nministration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose\nof establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not\ntestimonial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n18). We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of\nthe certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not\n——————\n   1 Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, Bryant deemed reliabil­\n\nity, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be “relevant,” 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12), not “essential,” post, at 5 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\nThe rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause, are designed\nprimarily to police reliability; the purpose of the Confrontation Clause\nis to determine whether statements are testimonial and therefore re­\nquire confrontation.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nproperly admissible as business or public records under\nthe hearsay rules, id., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16), nor were\nthey admissible under the Confrontation Clause, id., at\n___ (slip op., at 18). The hearsay rule’s recognition of the\ncertificates’ evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci­\nsion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri­\nmary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation\nClause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that\nunder Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the\n“sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide” evidence).\n   Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets\nforth the BAC report and Caylor’s certification on it\nclearly have a “primary purpose of creating an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony.” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC\nreport is not materially distinguishable from the certifi­\ncates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2, 4–5). 2\n   The formality inherent in the certification further sug­\ngests its evidentiary purpose. Although “[f]ormality is not\nthe sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,” a\nstatement’s formality or informality can shed light on\nwhether a particular statement has a primary purpose\nof use at trial. Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). 3\n——————\n   2 This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC\n\nreport must testify. As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the\ncase “that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the\nchain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing\ndevice, must appear in person as part of the prosecution’s case . . . . It\nis up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are\nso crucial as to require evidence . . . .” 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op.,\nat 5, n. 1).\n   3 By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not “trea[t] the\n\nreliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.” Post, at 5 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil­\nity, the dissent’s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron­\ntation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi­\n4                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nI agree with the Court’s assessment that the certificate at\nissue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of\nnotarization. Ante, at 14–15; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\n(“[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive”). The\nformality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to\nsign his name and “certify” to both the result and the\nstatements on the form. A “certification” requires one\n“[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of\n“certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear\nwitness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to\nauthenticate by signing as a witness”).\n   In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a\n“primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for\ntrial testimony,” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nwhich renders it testimonial.\n                            B\n  After holding that the report was testimonial, the New\nMexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis­\nsion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for\ntwo reasons: because Caylor was a “mere scrivener,” and\nbecause Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings\nof the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226\nP. 3d, at 8–10. The Court convincingly explains why those\n——————\nmonial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial\nnature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has\nlong been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality\nsuggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex­\nplained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, “does not necessarily\nindicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the\ntestimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic\nunconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. Post, at 7–8\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nrationales are incorrect. Ante, at 9–13. Therefore, the\nNew Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding\nthat the report was admissible via Razatos’ testimony.\n                                 II\n   Although this case is materially indistinguishable from\nthe facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight\nsome of the factual circumstances that this case does not\npresent.\n   First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an\nalternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur­\npose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not\nclaimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom­\ning with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing “Statements for Purposes\nof Medical Diagnosis or Treatment” under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are\n“by their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a\nprosecution”); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip\nop., at 6, n. 2) (“[M]edical reports created for treatment\npurposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision\ntoday”); Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 376 (2008)\n(“[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving\ntreatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay\nrules”).\n   Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying\nis a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,\nalbeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\nRazatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no\nrole in producing the BAC report and did not observe any\nportion of Curtis Caylor’s conduct of the testing. App. 58.\nThe court below also recognized Razatos’ total lack of\nconnection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would\nbe a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob­\nserved an analyst conducting a test testified about the\nresults or a report about such results. We need not ad­\n6               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\ndress what degree of involvement is sufficient because\nhere Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the rele­\nvant test and report.\n    Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was\nasked for his independent opinion about underlying testi­\nmonial reports that were not themselves admitted into\nevidence. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or\ndata of a type upon which experts in the field would rea­\nsonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible\nin order for the expert’s opinion based on the facts and\ndata to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the\nState does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,\nexpert opinion about Bullcoming’s blood alcohol concentra­\ntion. Rather, the State explains, “[a]side from reading a\nreport that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos\noffered no opinion about Petitioner’s blood alcohol content\n. . . .” Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).\nHere the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor’s\ntestimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a\ndifferent question if asked to determine the constitutional­\nity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others’ testi­\nmonial statements if the testimonial statements were not\nthemselves admitted as evidence.\n    Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced\nonly machine-generated results, such as a printout from a\ngas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor’s\nstatements, which included his transcription of a blood\nalcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro­\nmatograph printout, along with other statements about\nthe procedures used in handling the blood sample. See\nante, at 10; App. 62 (“I certify that I followed the proce­\ndures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state­\nments in this block are correct”). Thus, we do not decide\nwhether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 226\nP. 3d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an ade­\nquate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, n. 5.\n  This case does not present, and thus the Court’s opinion\ndoes not address, any of these factual scenarios.\n                        *     *    *\n  As in Melendez-Diaz, the primary purpose of the BAC\nreport is clearly to serve as evidence. It is therefore tes­\ntimonial, and the trial court erred in allowing the State\nto introduce it into evidence via Razatos’ testimony. I\nrespectfully concur.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Pointer v. Texas,\n380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965). Two Terms ago, in a case aris\ning from a state criminal prosecution, the Court inter\npreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory\nreport sought to be introduced based on the authority of\nthat report’s own sworn statement that a test had been\nperformed yielding the results as shown. Melendez-Diaz v.\nMassachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009). The Court’s opinion\nin that case held the report inadmissible because no one\nwas present at trial to testify to its contents.\n   Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the\nresult in Melendez-Diaz, the Court today takes the new\nand serious misstep of extending that holding to instances\nlike this one. Here a knowledgeable representative of the\nlaboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab’s\nprocesses and the details of the report; but because he was\nnot the analyst who filled out part of the form and tran\nscribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the\nCourt finds a confrontation violation. Some of the princi\npal objections to the Court’s underlying theory have been\nset out earlier and need not be repeated here. See id., at\n___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Additional reasons, appli\n2               BULLCOMING v.

Far from replacing\nlive testimony with “systematic” and “extrajudicial” ex\naminations, Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 835, 836\n(2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis deleted and internal quota\ntion marks omitted), these procedures are fully consistent\nwith the Confrontation Clause and with well-established\nprinciples for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted\nin full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability\nand with the confrontation guarantee. They do not “re\nsemble Marian proceedings.” Id., at 837.\n   The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by\nthe Court, make live testimony rather than the “solem\nnity” of a document the primary reason to credit the labo\nratory’s scientific results. Id., at 838. Unlike Melendez-\nDiaz, where the jury was asked to credit a labora-\ntory’s findings based solely on documents that were\n“quite plainly affidavits,” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), here the signature, heading, or legend on the docu\nment were routine authentication elements for a report\nthat would be assessed and explained by in-court testi\nmony subject to full cross-examination. The only sworn\nstatement at issue was that of the witness who was pre\nsent and who testified.\n   The record reveals that the certifying analyst’s role here\nwas no greater than that of anyone else in the chain of\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

App. 56 (laboratory employee’s testimony agree\ning that “once the material is prepared and placed in the\nmachine, you don’t need any particular expertise to record\nthe results”). The information contained in the report was\nthe result of a scientific process comprising multiple par\nticipants’ acts, each with its own evidentiary significance.\nThese acts included receipt of the sample at the labora\ntory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample\ninto the testing device; transposing the printout of the\nresults of the test onto the report; and review of the re\nsults. See Id., at 48–56; see also Brief for State of New\nMexico Dept. of Health Scientific Laboratory Division as\nAmicus Curiae 4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Labo\nratory Brief) (“Each blood sample has original testing\nwork by . . . as many as seve[n] analysts . . . .”); App. 62\n(indicating that this case involved three laboratory ana\nlysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed\nanalysis of the sample); cf. Brief for State of Indiana et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Briscoe v. Virginia, O. T. 2009, No. 07–\n11191, p. 10 (hereinafter Indiana Brief) (explaining that\nDNA analysis can involve the combined efforts of up to 40\nanalysts).\n   In the New Mexico scientific laboratory where the blood\nsample was processed, analyses are run in batches involv\ning 40–60 samples. Each sample is identified by a com\nputer-generated number that is not linked back to the file\ncontaining the name of the person from whom the sample\ncame until after all testing is completed. See New Mexico\nScientific Laboratory Brief 26. The analysis is mechani\ncally performed by the gas chromatograph, which may\noperate—as in this case—after all the laboratory employ\nees leave for the day. See id., at 17. And whatever the\nresult, it is reported to both law enforcement and the\ndefense. See id., at 36.\n   The representative of the testing laboratory whom the\nprosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr.\n4              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nRazatos. He testified that he “help[ed] in overseeing the\nadministration of these programs throughout the State,”\nand he was qualified to answer questions concerning each\nof these steps. App. 49. The Court has held that the\ngovernment need not produce at trial “everyone who laid\nhands on the evidence,” Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, n. 1\n(slip op., at 5, n. 1). Here, the defense used the opportu\nnity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial\nof certain laboratory employees. Under questioning by\nBullcoming’s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his\nname did not appear on the report; that he did not receive\nthe sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review;\nand that he did not know the reason for some personnel\ndecisions. App. 58. After weighing arguments from de\nfense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con\nsidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the\nlaboratory’s protocols and processes, the jury found no\nreasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.\n   In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the\ntechnician who filled out a form and recorded the results\nof a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to\nchallenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and\nexamine the technician who performed a test. And it may\ncall other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not\nalways reliable or that the technician might have made a\nmistake. The jury can then decide whether to credit the\ntest, as it did here. The States, furthermore, can assess\nthe progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt stat\nutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is\nadmitted. Rejecting these commonsense arguments and\nthe concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the\nCourt today takes a different course. It once more as\nsumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evi\ndentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming\nMelendez-Diaz’s “vast potential to disrupt criminal proce\ndures.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (KENNEDY, J.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

But the Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated\nthe reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at\n61–62. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a\nlab report because it “is formalized in a signed document.”\nAnte, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt’s unconventional and unstated premise is that\nthe State—by acting to ensure a statement’s reliability—\nmakes the statement more formal and therefore less likely\nto be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?\n19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the\nCourt insists, because reliability does not animate the\nConfrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11–12); Crawford, supra, at 61–62. Yet\njust this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta\ntion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti\ntutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,\n___–___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12, 14–15).\n   Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out\nof the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes\nbeen dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur\nring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834–837,\n841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction\nbetween utterances aimed at proving past events, and\nthose calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare\nDavis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,\nthis rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too\nstrict to be followed. A report is admissible, today’s opin\nion states, if a “live witness competent to testify to the\ntruth of the statements made in the report” appears. Ante,\nat 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana\nlyst, but also any “scientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob\nserve[d] the test reported in the certification.” Ante, at 2.\n   Today’s majority is not committed in equal shares to a\ncommon set of principles in applying the holding of Craw\nford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,\nsupra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,\nat ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the\nCourt), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has\nhad such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case’s\nmeaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in\nevery criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court\nin the Nation. This Court’s prior decisions leave trial\njudges to “guess what future rules this Court will distill\nfrom the sparse constitutional text,” Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug\ngle to apply an “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,”\n“highly context-dependent inquiry” involving “open-ended\nbalancing.” Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority’s approach).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   The persistent ambiguities in the Court’s approach are\nsymptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica\ntions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus\ntrate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted\nthat its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of\ncustody to testify but then qualified that “what testimony\nis introduced must . . . be introduced live.” 557 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This\ncould mean that a statement that evidence remained in\nlaw-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement’s\nmaker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head\nquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain\nof custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also\nbe that that the intern’s statement—which draws on\nstatements in the evidence log—is inadmissible unless\nevery officer who signed the log appears at trial. That\nrule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis\nsibility of the report on the testimony of three or more\nidentified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or\neven 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt has thus—in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz—boxed\nitself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation\nClause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are\nunworkable.\n                            III\n  Crawford itself does not compel today’s conclusion. It\nis true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation\nClause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat\ning trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,\nat 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12). Crawford\nexplained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to\naddress the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious\ntreason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On\nthis view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of\ncourt statements obtained through formal interrogation in\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npreparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defen\ndants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, un\ntested statements by those who observed—or claimed to\nhave observed—preparation for or commission of the\ncrime. And, of course, those statements might not have\nbeen uttered at all or—even if spoken—might not have\nbeen true.\n   A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, pro\nvides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitu\ntional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like\nthe instant one, reports prepared by experienced techni\ncians in laboratories that follow professional norms and\nscientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right\nto call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this\ncase was already protected by checks on potential prosecu\ntorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result\nblind issuance of reports; testing by an independent\nagency; routine processes performed en masse, which\nreduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating\npursuant to scientific and professional norms and over\nsight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14–15, 41, 54; New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.\n   In addition to preventing the State from conducting ex\nparte trials, Crawford’s rejection of the regime of Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), seemed to have two under\nlying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the\nintricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate;\nand the other was to allow the States, in their own courts\nand legislatures and without this Court’s supervision, to\nexplore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules\npertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.\nThese results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks\nthe experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial\nprocess to suit it well to assume the role of national tribu\nnal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these\nobjectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their oppo\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsites.\n   Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay\ndoctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear\nsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined\nformulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta\ntion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge\nof Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.\n691, 739–740, 742, 744–746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern\nEvidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502–503, 514–515,\n533–537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,\nthe Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen\ntury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to\nmake those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay’s Last\nHurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5–6, 36. As a result, the Court\nhas taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap\nplication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court\nstatements by unconfronted and available witnesses who\nobserved the crime and do not appear at trial.\n   Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of\ntheir hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are\nforeclosed now from contributing to the formulation and\nenactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli\nable. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission\nof well-documented and supported reports of abuse by\nwomen whose abusers later murdered them must give\nway, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur\npose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554\nU. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14–15. Whether\nthose statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability\nand other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation\nClause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open\nquestion. The point is that the States cannot now partici\npate in the development of this difficult part of the law.\n   In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic\ndisplacement of the States and dislocation of the federal\nstructure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nop., at 2–3, 22–23). If this Court persists in applying\nwooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony of\nfered by the prosecution—testimony thought proper for\nmany decades in state and federal courts committed to\ndevising fair trial processes—then the States might find it\nnecessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommo\ndate this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those\nrules could remain on State statute books for decades,\neven if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better\nimplement the objectives of Crawford. This underscores\nthe disruptive, long-term structural consequences of deci\nsions like the one the Court announces today.\n   States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to\nenact statutes that require defense counsel to give ad\nvance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a\nreport without the presence in court of the technician who\nprepared it. Indeed, today’s opinion relies upon laws of\nthat sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.\nAnte, at 17 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic,\nhowever, to think that this will take away from the de\nfense the incentives to insist on having the certifying\nanalyst present. There is in the ordinary case that pro\nceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive\nthe right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.\n   Today’s opinion repeats an assertion from Melendez-\nDiaz that its decision will not “impose an undue burden on\nthe prosecution.” Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion). But\nevidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See,\ne.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 7\n(explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles\nPolice Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appear\nances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District\nAttorneys Assocation et al. as Amici Curiae 23 (observing\nthat each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes\n3,220 cases per year on average).

From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re\nquiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving\ncases rose 71%, to 1,600—or 8 or 9 every workday. New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the\nNation’s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10\ntotal analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases\nrecently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The\nanalysts now must travel great distances on most working\ndays. The result has been, in the laboratory’s words,\n“chaotic.” Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection\nand the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or\non leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer\nemployed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a\nwindfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in\never-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability\nto produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant\nincreases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo\nratory’s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce\nstate resources could be committed to other urgent needs\nin the criminal justice system.\n                       *     *     *\n   Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering\nthat the Crawford approach was not preordained. This\nCourt’s missteps have produced an interpretation of the\nword “witness” at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the\nConstitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amend\nment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84\nGeo. L. J. 641, 647, 691–696 (1996), and at odds with\nthe sound administration of justice. It is time to return\nto solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to\ndecline to extend Melendez-Diaz to bar the reliable, com\nmonsense evidentiary framework the State sought to\nfollow in this case.\n</pre>", "id": 219509, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/06/23/Bullcoming_v._New_Mexico.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

NEW MEXICO\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW MEXICO\n\n     No. 09–10876.       Argued March 2, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011\nThe Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause gives the accused “[i]n\n  all criminal prosecutions, . . . the right . . . to be confronted with the\n  witnesses against him.” In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59,\n  this Court held that the Clause permits admission of “[t]estimonial\n  statements of witnesses absent from trial . . . only where the decla\n  rant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior\n  opportunity to cross-examine.” Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\n  setts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a “forensic evidence”\n  exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, cre\n  ated specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked\n  as “testimonial” for Confrontation Clause purposes. Absent stipula\n  tion, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a re\n  port without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth\n  of the report’s statements. 557 U. S., at ___.\n     Petitioner Bullcoming’s jury trial on charges of driving while in\n  toxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.\n  Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certi\n  fying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the thresh\n  old for aggravated DWI. Bullcoming’s blood sample had been tested\n  at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Divi\n  sion (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed,\n  signed, and certified the report. However, the prosecution neither\n  called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record\n  showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undis\n  closed reason. In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst,\n  Razatos, to validate the report. Razatos was familiar with the testing\n  device used to analyze Bullcoming’s blood and with the laboratory’s\n  testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the\n  test on Bullcoming’s blood sample. Bullcoming’s counsel objected, as\n2                   BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    serting that introduction of Caylor’s report without his testimony\n    would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled\n    the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and\n    permitted Razatos to testify. Bullcoming was convicted, and, while\n    his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this\n    Court decided Melendez-Diaz. The state high court acknowledged\n    that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under\n    Melendez-Diaz, but held that the report’s admission did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a\n    mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test re\n    sults, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in\n    testing Bullcoming’s blood, qualified as an expert witness with re\n    spect to the testing machine and SLD procedures. The court affirmed\n    Bullcoming’s conviction.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n147 N. M. 487, 226 P. 3d 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to all but Part IV and footnote 6. The Confrontation Clause, the opin\n  ion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic\n  laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in or\n  der to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony\n  of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform\n  or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.\n  The accused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the\n  certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the ac\n  cused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular\n  scientist. Pp. 8–16.\n     (a) If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be intro\n  duced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the\n  statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity\n  to confront that witness. Pp. 8–14.\n       (i) Caylor’s certification reported more than a machine-generated\n  number: It represented that he received Bullcoming’s blood sample\n  intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the\n  forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he\n  performed a particular test on Bullcoming’s sample, adhering to a\n  precise protocol; and that he left the report’s remarks section blank,\n  indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample’s in\n  tegrity or the analysis’ validity. These representations, relating to\n  past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine\n  produced data, are meet for cross-examination. The potential ramifi\n  cations of the state court’s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags. Most\n  witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.\n  Where, for example, a police officer’s report recorded an objective fact\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsuch as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court’s reasoning would\npermit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or\nshe was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer\ndeployed and the police department’s standard operating procedures.\nAs, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, how\never, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause. The\ncomparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report does not\ndispense with the Clause. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62. The analysts\nwho write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for\nconfrontation even if they have “the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie\nand the veracity of Mother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___,\nn. 6. Pp. 10–11.\n     (ii) Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply be\ncause he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine\nand the SLD’s laboratory procedures. Surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor\nknew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses\nor lies on Caylor’s part. Significantly, Razatos did not know why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand,\nBullcoming’s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to\nreveal whether Caylor’s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty ac\ncounted for his removal from work. And the State did not assert that\nRazatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming’s blood\nalcohol content. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does\nnot tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court\nbelieves that questioning one witness about another’s testimonial\nstatements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\nAlthough the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair\ntrial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because,\non the whole, the trial is fair. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 145. If a “particular guarantee” is violated, no substitute\nprocedure can cure the violation. Id., at 146. Pp. 11–14.\n   (b) Melendez-Diaz precluded the State’s argument that introduc\ntion of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause be\ncause the report is nontestimonial. Like the certificates in Melendez-\nDiaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an “affirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact” in a criminal proceed\ning. 557 U. S., at ___. Created solely for an “evidentiary purpose,”\nid., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial. In all material respects,\nthe SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as\nthere, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory re\nquired by law to assist in police investigations. Like the Melendez-\nDiaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate\nconcerning the result of his analysis. And like the Melendez-Diaz\n4                    BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    certificates, Caylor’s report here is “formalized” in a signed document,\n    Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form\n    contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts’ rules\n    that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n    Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at\n    tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor’s as\n    sertions as testimonial.

The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,\nalthough the blood-alcohol analysis was “testimonial,” the\nConfrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana­\nlyst’s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico’s high\ncourt held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the\nconstitutional requirements.\n  The question presented is whether the Confrontation\nClause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic\nlaboratory report containing a testimonial certification—\nmade for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through\nthe in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the\ncertification or perform or observe the test reported in the\ncertification. We hold that surrogate testimony of that\norder does not meet the constitutional requirement. The\naccused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who\nmade the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable\nat trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to\ncross-examine that particular scientist.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald\nBullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection\nin Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited\nhis vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur­\nance information, he noticed that Bullcoming’s eyes were\nbloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming’s breath, the\ntruckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left\nthe scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre­\nhended by an officer who observed his performance of field\nsobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was\narrested for driving a vehicle while “under the influence of\nintoxicating liquor” (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat.

S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the\npolice obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy­\nsis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming’s\nblood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull­\ncoming’s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police\nsent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD\nform titled “Report of Blood Alcohol Analysis,” partici­\npants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana­\nlyst certified his finding. App. 62.\n   SLD’s report contained in the top block “information . . .\nfilled in by [the] arresting officer.” Ibid. (capitalization\nomitted). This information included the “reason [the]\nsuspect [was] stopped” (the officer checked “Accident”),\nand the date (“8.14.05”) and time (“18:25 PM”) the blood\nsample was drawn. Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The\narresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull­\ncoming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two\nblocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew\nBullcoming’s blood and the SLD intake employee who\nreceived the blood sample sent to the laboratory. Ibid.\n   Following these segments, the report presented the\n“certificate of analyst,” ibid. (capitalization omitted), com­\npleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic\nanalyst assigned to test Bullcoming’s blood sample. Id., at\n62, 64–65. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming’s\nsample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordi­\nnately high level. Id., at 62. Caylor also affirmed that\n“[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken\nin the laboratory,” that “the statements in [the analyst’s\nblock of the report] are correct,” and that he had “followed\nthe procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.” Ibid.\nThose “procedures” instructed analysts, inter alia, to “re­\ntai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the\nanalysis,” and to “not[e] any circumstance or condition\nwhich might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise\n4                 BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\naffect the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 65. Finally, in a\nblock headed “certificate of reviewer,” the SLD examiner\nwho reviewed Caylor’s analysis certified that Caylor was\nqualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the “estab­\nlished procedure” for handling and analyzing Bullcoming’s\nsample “ha[d] been followed.” Id., at 62 (capitalization\nomitted).\n   SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to de­\ntermine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires\nspecialized knowledge and training. Several steps are\ninvolved in the gas chromatograph process, and human\nerror can occur at each step.1\n——————\n    1 Gaschromatography is a widely used scientific method of quan­\ntitatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H.\nMcNair & J. Miller, Basic Gas Chromatography (2d ed. 2009) (hereinaf­\nter McNair). Under SLD’s standard testing protocol, the analyst ex­\ntracts two blood samples and inserts them into vials containing an\n“internal standard”—a chemical additive. App. 53. See McNair 141–\n142. The analyst then “cap[s] the [two] sample[s],” “crimp[s] them with\nan aluminum top,” and places the vials into the gas chromatograph\nmachine. App. 53–54. Within a few hours, this device produces a\nprinted graph—a chromatogram—along with calculations representing\na software-generated interpretation of the data. See Brief for State of\nNew Mexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 16–17.\n   Although the State presented testimony that obtaining an accurate\nBAC measurement merely entails “look[ing] at the [gas chromatograph]\nmachine and record[ing] the results,” App. 54, authoritative sources re­\nveal that the matter is not so simple or certain. “In order to perform\nquantitative analyses satisfactorily and . . . support the results under\nrigorous examination in court, the analyst must be aware of, and\nadhere to, good analytical practices and understand what is being done\nand why.” Stafford, Chromatography, in Principles of Forensic Toxicol­\nogy 92, 114 (B. Levine 2d ed. 2006). See also McNair 137 (“Errors that\noccur in any step can invalidate the best chromatographic analysis, so\nattention must be paid to all steps.”); D. Bartell, M. McMurray, &\nA.

The State accordingly charged Bullcoming\nwith this more serious crime.\n                             B\n  The case was tried to a jury in November 2005, after our\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004),\nbut before Melendez-Diaz. On the day of trial, the State\nannounced that it would not be calling SLD analyst Curtis\nCaylor as a witness because he had “very recently [been]\nput on unpaid leave” for a reason not revealed. 2010–\nNMSC–007, ¶8, 226 P. 3d 1, 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); App. 58. A startled defense counsel objected.\nThe prosecution, she complained, had never disclosed,\nuntil trial commenced, that the witness “out there . . .\n[was] not the analyst [of Bullcoming’s sample].” Id., at 46.\nCounsel stated that, “had [she] known that the analyst\n[who tested Bullcoming’s blood] was not available,” her\nopening, indeed, her entire defense “may very well have\nbeen dramatically different.” Id., at 47. The State, how­\never, proposed to introduce Caylor’s finding as a “business\n——————\nvalid. See McNair 207–214.\n   Nor is the risk of human error so remote as to be negligible. Amici\ninform us, for example, that in neighboring Colorado, a single forensic\nlaboratory produced at least 206 flawed blood-alcohol readings over a\nthree-year span, prompting the dismissal of several criminal prosecu­\ntions. See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net al. as Amici Curiae 32–33. An analyst had used improper amounts\nof the internal standard, causing the chromatograph machine system­\natically to inflate BAC measurements.

Id., at 44.\n  Bullcoming’s counsel opposed the State’s proposal. Id.,\nat 44–45. Without Caylor’s testimony, defense counsel\nmaintained, introduction of the analyst’s finding would\nviolate Bullcoming’s Sixth Amendment right “to be con­\nfronted with the witnesses against him.” Ibid.2 The trial\ncourt overruled the objection, id., at 46–47, and admitted\nthe SLD report as a business record, id., at 44–46, 57.3\nThe jury convicted Bullcoming of aggravated DWI, and the\nNew Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, con­\ncluding that “the blood alcohol report in the present case\nwas non-testimonial and prepared routinely with guaran­\ntees of trustworthiness.” 2008–NMCA–097, §17, 189 P. 3d\n679, 685.\n                              C\n    While Bullcoming’s appeal was pending before the New\nMexico Supreme Court, this Court decided Melendez-Diaz.\nIn that case, “[t]he Massachusetts courts [had] admitted\ninto evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic\nanalysis which showed that material seized by the police\nand connected to the defendant was cocaine.” 557 U.

Bullcoming did not object to the State’s\nfailure to call the SLD intake employee or the reviewing analyst. “It\nis up to the prosecution,” the Court observed in Melendez-Diaz v. Massa\nchusetts, 557 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2009) (slip op., at 5, n. 1), “to decide\nwhat steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence;\nbut what testimony is introduced must (if the defendant objects) be\nintroduced live.”\n   3 The trial judge noted that, when he started out in law practice,\n\n“there were no breath tests or blood tests. They just brought in the cop,\nand the cop said, ‘Yeah, he was drunk.’ ” App. 47.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court\nobserved, the report was “functionally identical to live, in­\ncourt testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on\ndirect examination.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for\ntwo reasons, the court held that admission of the report\ndid not violate the Confrontation Clause.\n  First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor “was a\nmere scrivener,” who “simply transcribed the results gen­\nerated by the gas chromatograph machine.” 226 P. 3d,\nat 8–9. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not\nparticipate in testing Bullcoming’s blood, “qualified as\nan expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph\nmachine.” Id., at 9. “Razatos provided live, in-court tes­\ntimony,” the court stated, “and, thus, was available for\ncross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma­\nchine, the results of [Bullcoming’s] BAC test, and the\nSLD’s established laboratory procedures.” Ibid. Razatos’\ntestimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull­\ncoming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ­\nten report. Id., at 10. But “[Bullcoming’s] right of con­\nfrontation was preserved,” the court concluded, because\nRazatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro­\ngate for Caylor. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to address this question: Does the\nConfrontation Clause permit the prosecution to introduce\n\n——————\n  4 In so ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court explicitly overruled\nState v. Dedman, 2004–NMSC–037, 102 P. 3d 628 (2004), which had\nclassified blood-alcohol reports as public records neither “investigative\nnor prosecutorial” in nature. 226 P. 3d, at 7–8.\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certi­\nfication, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial,\nthrough the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not\nsign the certification or personally perform or observe the\nperformance of the test reported in the certification. 561\nU. S. ___ (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling\nprecedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testi­\nmonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the\naccused at trial unless the witness who made the state­\nment is unavailable and the accused has had a prior op­\nportunity to confront that witness. Because the New\nMexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial state­\nment of one witness, i.e., Caylor, to enter into evidence\nthrough the in-court testimony of a second person, i.e.,\nRazatos, we reverse that court’s judgment.\n                               II\n   The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause confers\nupon the accused “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, . . . the\nright . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”\nIn a pathmarking 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington,\nwe overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which\nhad interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admis­\nsion of absent witnesses’ testimonial statements based on\na judicial determination of reliability. See Roberts, 448\nU. S., at 66. Rejecting Roberts’ “amorphous notions of ‘re­\nliability,’ ” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 61, Crawford held\nthat fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admis­\nsion of “[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from\ntrial . . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\nwhere the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross­\nexamine,” id., at 59. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (“[F]or testimonial evidence\nto be admissible, the Sixth Amendment ‘demands what\nthe common law required: unavailability [of the witness]\nand a prior opportunity for cross-examination.’ ” (quoting\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Melendez-Diaz, relying on\nCrawford’s rationale, refused to create a “forensic evi­\ndence” exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 11–15).5 An analyst’s certification prepared in\nconnection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,\nthe Court held, is “testimonial,” and therefore within the\ncompass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 15–18).6\n  The State in the instant case never asserted that the\nanalyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was\nunavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was\nplaced on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See\nsupra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity\nto cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,\ntherefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming’s favor. The New\nMexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing\nthat the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an\nadequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why\nRazatos’ appearance did not meet the Confrontation\nClause requirement. We next address the State’s argu­\nment that the SLD report ranks as “nontestimonial,” and\n——————\n  5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application\n\nof the Court’s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case\nthan to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti­\ncizing the “Crawford line of cases” for rejecting “reliable evidence”);\npost, at 8–9, 11 (deploring “Crawford’s rejection of the [reliability­\ncentered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts”).\n  6 To rank as “testimonial,” a statement must have a “primary pur­\n\npose” of “establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to\nlater criminal prosecution.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822\n(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating\non the purpose for which a “testimonial report” is created, we observed\nin Melendez-Diaz that business and public records “are generally\nadmissible absent confrontation . . . because—having been created for\nthe administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”\n557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore “[was] not subject to the Confrontation Clause”\nin the first place. Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization\nomitted).\n                               A\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi­\nmony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in\nthis case because analyst Caylor “simply transcribed the\nresul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,”\npresenting no interpretation and exercising no independ­\nent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming’s “true ‘ac­\ncuser,’ ” the court said, was the machine, while testing\nanalyst Caylor’s role was that of “mere scrivener.” Id., at\n9. Caylor’s certification, however, reported more than a\nmachine-generated number. See supra, at 3–4.\n   Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming’s blood\nsample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to\nmake sure that the forensic report number and the sample\nnumber “correspond[ed],” and that he performed on Bull­\ncoming’s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise\nprotocol. App. 62–65. He further represented, by leaving\nthe “[r]emarks” section of the report blank, that no “cir­\ncumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the\nsample or . . . the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 62, 65.\nThese representations, relating to past events and human\nactions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are\nmeet for cross-examination.\n   The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit­\nnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual\nconditions or events, e.g., “the light was green,” “the hour\nwas noon.” Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what\nthey observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec­\ntive fact—Bullcoming’s counsel posited the address above\nthe front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 35.

As our precedent makes plain, the answer is\nemphatically “No.” See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be “evaded\nby having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes­\ntimony of the declarant” (emphasis deleted)); Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis­\nsenting) (“The Court made clear in Davis that it will not\npermit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter\ninto evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.”).\n   The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number\nregistered by the gas chromatograph machine called for\nno interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on\nCaylor’s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8–9. We have already ex­\nplained that Caylor certified to more than a machine­\ngenerated number. See supra, at 3–4. In any event, the\ncomparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report\ndrawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the\nSixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford\nthat the “obviou[s] reliab[ility]” of a testimonial statement\ndoes not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541\nU. S., at 62; see id., at 61 (Clause “commands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing [the evidence] in the cruci­\nble of cross-examination”). Accordingly, the analysts who\nwrite reports that the prosecution introduces must be\nmade available for confrontation even if they possess “the\nscientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of\nMother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 6\n(slip op., at 14, n. 6).\n                           B\n  Recognizing that admission of the blood-alcohol analysis\n12                BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndepended on “live, in-court testimony [by] a qualified ana­\nlyst,” 226 P. 3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nbelieved that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because\nRazatos “qualified as an expert witness with respect to the\ngas chromatograph machine and the SLD’s labora­\ntory procedures,” id., at 9. But surrogate testimony of the\nkind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what\nCaylor knew or observed about the events his certification\nconcerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he\nemployed.7 Nor could such surrogate testimony expose\nany lapses or lies on the certifying analyst’s part.8 Signifi­\ncant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why\nCaylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on\nthe stand, Bullcoming’s counsel could have asked ques­\ntions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasive­\nness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor’s removal from\nhis work station. Notable in this regard, the State never\nasserted that Caylor was “unavailable”; the prosecution\nconveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.\nNor did the State assert that Razatos had any “independ­\nent opinion” concerning Bullcoming’s BAC. See Brief for\nRespondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor’s live testimony\ncould hardly be typed “a hollow formality,” post, at 4.\n   More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in Craw\nford, “[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not sug­\n——————\n   7 We do not question that analyst Caylor, in common with other ana­\n\nlysts employed by SLD, likely would not recall a particular test, given\nthe number of tests each analyst conducts and the standard procedure\nfollowed in testing. Even so, Caylor’s testimony under oath would have\nenabled Bullcoming’s counsel to raise before a jury questions concern­\ning Caylor’s proficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and\nhis veracity. In particular, Bullcoming’s counsel likely would have\ninquired on cross-examination why Caylor had been placed on unpaid\nleave.\n   8 At Bullcoming’s trial, Razatos acknowledged that “you don’t know\n\nunless you actually observe the analysis that someone else conducts,\nwhether they followed th[e] protocol in every instance.” App. 59.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation re­\nquirement to be developed by the courts.” 541 U. S., at 54.\nNor is it “the role of courts to extrapolate from the words\nof the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and\nthen to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve\n(in the courts’ views) those underlying values.” Giles v.\nCalifornia, 554 U. S. 353, 375 (2008). Accordingly, the\nClause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation\nsimply because the court believes that questioning one\nwitness about another’s testimonial statements provides a\nfair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\n     A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment\nright—the right to counsel—is instructive. In United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), the Gov­\nernment argued that illegitimately denying a defendant\nhis counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amend-\nment where “substitute counsel’s performance” did not\ndemonstrably prejudice the defendant. Id., at 144–145.\nThis Court rejected the Government’s argument. “[T]rue\nenough,” the Court explained, “the purpose of the rights\nset forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair\ntrial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disre­\ngarded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.” Id., at\n145. If a “particular guarantee” of the Sixth Amendment\nis violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation,\nand “[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to\nmake the violation ‘complete.’ ” Id., at 146. If repre­\nsentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth\nAmendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a\nsubstitute witness.\n   In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor’s\ncertification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the\nright to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read\nany other way. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Court’s holding means\n“the . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed\n14               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe certificate”).\n                              III\n   We turn, finally, to the State’s contention that the SLD’s\nblood-alcohol analysis reports are nontestimonial in char­\nacter, therefore no Confrontation Clause question even\narises in this case. Melendez-Diaz left no room for that\nargument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,\nsee 226 P. 3d, at 7–8; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find\ninescapable.\n   In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police\nrequest, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re­\nported the laboratory’s analysis to the police (the sub­\nstance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 2). The “certificates of analysis” prepared\nby the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,\nthis Court held, were “incontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact”\nin a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter­\nnal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was\nserved by the certificate in question here.\n   The State maintains that the affirmations made by\nanalyst Caylor were not “adversarial” or “inquisitorial,”\nBrief for Respondent 27–33; instead, they were simply\nobservations of an “independent scientis[t]” made “accord­\ning to a non-adversarial public duty,” id., at 32–33. That\nargument fares no better here than it did in Melendez-\nDiaz. A document created solely for an “evidentiary pur­\npose,” Melendez-Diaz clarified, made in aid of a police\ninvestigation, ranks as testimonial. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 5) (forensic reports available for use at trial are\n“testimonial statements” and certifying analyst is a\n“ ‘witness’ for purposes of the Sixth Amendment”).\n   Distinguishing Bullcoming’s case from Melendez-Diaz,\nwhere the analysts’ findings were contained in certificates\n“sworn to before a notary public,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 2),\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe State emphasizes that the SLD report of Bullcoming’s\nBAC was “unsworn.” Brief for Respondent 13; post, at 2\n(“only sworn statement” here was that of Razatos, “who\nwas present and [did] testif[y]”). As the New Mexico\nSupreme Court recognized, “ ‘the absence of [an] oath [i]s\nnot dispositive’ in determining if a statement is testimo­\nnial.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52).\nIndeed, in Crawford, this Court rejected as untenable any\nconstruction of the Confrontation Clause that would ren­\nder inadmissible only sworn ex parte affidavits, while\nleaving admission of formal, but unsworn statements\n“perfectly OK.” Id., at 52–53, n. 3. Reading the Clause in\nthis “implausible” manner, ibid., the Court noted, would\nmake the right to confrontation easily erasable. See\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 830–831, n. 5; id., at 838 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n   In all material respects, the laboratory report in this\ncase resembles those in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as in\nMelendez-Diaz, a law-enforcement officer provided seized\nevidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in\npolice investigations, N. M. Stat. Ann. §29–3–4 (2004).\nLike the analysts in Melendez-Diaz, analyst Caylor tested\nthe evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the\nresult of his analysis. App. 62. Like the Melendez-Diaz\ncertificates, Caylor’s certificate is “formalized” in a signed\ndocument, Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.), headed a “report,” App. 62. Noteworthy as\nwell, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to\nmunicipal and magistrate courts’ rules that provide for the\nadmission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.\n   In sum, the formalities attending the “report of blood\nalcohol analysis” are more than adequate to qualify Cay­\nlor’s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notariza­\ntion does not remove his certification from Confrontation\nClause governance. The New Mexico Supreme Court,\nguided by Melendez-Diaz, correctly recognized that Cay­\n16              BULLCOMING v.

S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4); Davis, 547 U. S., at 830; Crawford,\n541 U. S., at 51–52.\n                              IV\n   The State and its amici urge that unbending applica­\ntion of the Confrontation Clause to forensic evidence would\nimpose an undue burden on the prosecution. This argu­\nment, also advanced in the dissent, post, at 10–11, largely\nrepeats a refrain rehearsed and rejected in Melendez-Diaz.\nSee 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–23). The con­\nstitutional requirement, we reiterate, “may not [be] disre­\ngard[ed] . . . at our convenience,” id., at ___ (slip op., at\n19), and the predictions of dire consequences, we again\nobserve, are dubious, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).\n   New Mexico law, it bears emphasis, requires the lab­\noratory to preserve samples, which can be retested by\nother analysts, see N. M. Admin. Code §7.33.2.15(A)(4)–(6)\n(2010), available at http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/\n_title07/T07C033.htm, and neither party questions SLD’s\ncompliance with that requirement. Retesting “is almost\nalways an option . . . in [DWI] cases,” Brief for Public\nDefender Service for District of Columbia et al. as Amici\nCuriae 25 (hereinafter PDS Brief), and the State had that\noption here: New Mexico could have avoided any Confron­\ntation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the\nsample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather\nthan to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.\n   Notably, New Mexico advocates retesting as an effective\nmeans to preserve a defendant’s confrontation right “when\nthe [out-of-court] statement is raw data or a mere tran­\nscription of raw data onto a public record.” Brief for Re­\nspondent 53–54. But the State would require the defen­\ndant to initiate retesting. Id., at 55; post, at 4 (defense\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The prosecution, however, bears the bur­\nden of proof. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19) (“[T]he Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the\nprosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant\nto bring those adverse witnesses into court.”). Hence the\nobligation to propel retesting when the original analyst is\nunavailable is the State’s, not the defendant’s. See Taylor\nv. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 410, n. 14 (1988) (Confrontation\nClause’s requirements apply “in every case, whether or not\nthe defendant seeks to rebut the case against him or to\npresent a case of his own”).\n   Furthermore, notice-and-demand procedures, long in ef­\nfect in many jurisdictions, can reduce burdens on foren-\nsic laboratories. Statutes governing these procedures\ntypically “render . . . otherwise hearsay forensic reports\nadmissible[,] while specifically preserving a defendant’s\nright to demand that the prosecution call the author/\nanalyst of [the] report.” PDS Brief 9; see Melendez-\nDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (observing that\nnotice-and-demand statutes “permit the defendant to\nassert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right\nafter receiving notice of the prosecution’s intent to use a\nforensic analyst’s report”).\n   Even before this Court’s decision in Crawford, moreover,\nit was common prosecutorial practice to call the forensic\nanalyst to testify. Prosecutors did so “to bolster the per­\nsuasive power of [the State’s] case[,] . . . [even] when the\ndefense would have preferred that the analyst did not\ntestify.” PDS Brief 8.\n   We note also the “small fraction of . . . cases” that “actu­\nally proceed to trial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 20) (citing estimate that “nearly 95% of convic­\ntions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty\nplea”). And, “when cases in which forensic analysis has\n18                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                         Opinion ofof the CourtJ.\n                          Opinion GINSBURG,\n\nbeen conducted [do] go to trial,” defendants “regularly . . .\n[stipulate] to the admission of [the] analysis.” PDS Brief\n20. “[A]s a result, analysts testify in only a very small\npercentage of cases,” id., at 21, for “[i]t is unlikely that\ndefense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect\nwill be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon\nthe forensic analysis.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 22).9\n   Tellingly, in jurisdictions in which “it is the [acknowl­\nedged] job of . . . analysts to testify in court . . . about their\ntest results,” the sky has not fallen. PDS Brief 23. State\nand municipal laboratories “make operational and staffing\ndecisions” to facilitate analysts’ appearance at trial. Ibid.\nProsecutors schedule trial dates to accommodate analysts’\navailability, and trial courts liberally grant continuances\nwhen unexpected conflicts arise. Id., at 24–25. In rare\ncases in which the analyst is no longer employed by the\nlaboratory at the time of trial, “the prosecution makes the\neffort to bring that analyst . . . to court.” Id., at 25. And,\nas is the practice in New Mexico, see supra, at 16, labora­\ntories ordinarily retain additional samples, enabling them\nto run tests again when necessary.10\n——————\n   9 The dissent argues otherwise, reporting a 71% increase, from 2008\n\nto 2010, in the number of subpoenas for New Mexico analysts’ testi­\nmony in impaired-driving cases. Post, at 11. The dissent is silent,\nhowever, on the number of instances in which subpoenaed analysts in\nfact testify, i.e., the figure that would reveal the actual burden of\ncourtroom testimony. Moreover, New Mexico’s Department of Health,\nScientific Laboratory Division, has attributed the “chaotic” conditions\nnoted by the dissent, ibid., to several favors, among them, staff attri­\ntion, a state hiring freeze, a 15% increase in the number of blood\nsamples received for testing, and “wildly” divergent responses by New\nMexico District Attorneys to Melendez-Diaz. Brief for State of New\nMexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 2–5. Some New Mexico\nDistrict Attorneys’ offices, we are informed, “subpoen[a] every analyst\nwith any connection to a blood sample,” id., at 5, an exorbitant practice\nthat undoubtedly inflates the number of subpoenas issued.\n   10 The dissent refers, selectively, to experience in Los Angeles, post, at\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

In that State,\npost-Melendez-Diaz, the increase in in-court analyst testimony has been\nslight.

I\nwrite separately first to highlight why I view the report at\nissue to be testimonial—specifically because its “primary\npurpose” is evidentiary—and second to emphasize the\nlimited reach of the Court’s opinion.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n   Under our precedents, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nwas correct to hold that the certified BAC report in this\ncase is testimonial. 2010–NMSC–007, ¶18, 226 P. 3d 1, 8.\n   To determine if a statement is testimonial, we must\ndecide whether it has “a primary purpose of creating an\nout-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” Michigan v.\nBryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11). When\nthe “primary purpose” of a statement is “not to create a\nrecord for trial,” ibid., “the admissibility of [the] statement\nis the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not\nthe Confrontation Clause,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   This is not the first time the Court has faced the ques­\ntion of whether a scientific report is testimonial. As the\nCourt explains, ante, at 14–15, in Melendez-Diaz v. Mas\nsachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), we held that “certificates\n2                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nof analysis,” completed by employees of the State Labora­\ntory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public\nHealth, id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), were testimonial because\nthey were “incontrovertibly . . . ‘ “solemn declaration[s] or\naffirmation[s] made for the purpose of establishing or\nproving some fact,” ’ ” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 51 (2004), in turn\nquoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language (1828)).\n   As we explained earlier this Term in Michigan v. Bry\nant, 562 U. S. ___ (2010), “[i]n making the primary pur­\npose determination, standard rules of hearsay . . . will be\nrelevant.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).1 As applied to a\nscientific report, Melendez-Diaz explained that pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Evidence 803, “[d]ocuments kept in the\nregular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at\ntrial despite their hearsay status,” except “if the regularly\nconducted business activity is the production of evidence\nfor use at trial.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)\n(citing Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6)). In that circumstance, the\nhearsay rules bar admission of even business records. Re­\nlatedly, in the Confrontation Clause context, business\nand public records “are generally admissible absent con­\nfrontation . . . because—having been created for the ad­\nministration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose\nof establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not\ntestimonial.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n18). We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of\nthe certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not\n——————\n   1 Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, Bryant deemed reliabil­\n\nity, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be “relevant,” 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12), not “essential,” post, at 5 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\nThe rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause, are designed\nprimarily to police reliability; the purpose of the Confrontation Clause\nis to determine whether statements are testimonial and therefore re­\nquire confrontation.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       3\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nproperly admissible as business or public records under\nthe hearsay rules, id., at ___ (slip op., at 15–16), nor were\nthey admissible under the Confrontation Clause, id., at\n___ (slip op., at 18). The hearsay rule’s recognition of the\ncertificates’ evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci­\nsion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri­\nmary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation\nClause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that\nunder Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the\n“sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide” evidence).\n   Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets\nforth the BAC report and Caylor’s certification on it\nclearly have a “primary purpose of creating an out-of-court\nsubstitute for trial testimony.” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC\nreport is not materially distinguishable from the certifi­\ncates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2, 4–5). 2\n   The formality inherent in the certification further sug­\ngests its evidentiary purpose. Although “[f]ormality is not\nthe sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,” a\nstatement’s formality or informality can shed light on\nwhether a particular statement has a primary purpose\nof use at trial. Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). 3\n——————\n   2 This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC\n\nreport must testify. As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the\ncase “that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the\nchain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing\ndevice, must appear in person as part of the prosecution’s case . . . . It\nis up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are\nso crucial as to require evidence . . . .” 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op.,\nat 5, n. 1).\n   3 By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not “trea[t] the\n\nreliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.” Post, at 5 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil­\nity, the dissent’s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron­\ntation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi­\n4                  BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nI agree with the Court’s assessment that the certificate at\nissue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of\nnotarization. Ante, at 14–15; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\n(“[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive”). The\nformality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to\nsign his name and “certify” to both the result and the\nstatements on the form. A “certification” requires one\n“[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of\n“certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear\nwitness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to\nauthenticate by signing as a witness”).\n   In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a\n“primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for\ntrial testimony,” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nwhich renders it testimonial.\n                            B\n  After holding that the report was testimonial, the New\nMexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis­\nsion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for\ntwo reasons: because Caylor was a “mere scrivener,” and\nbecause Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings\nof the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226\nP. 3d, at 8–10. The Court convincingly explains why those\n——————\nmonial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial\nnature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has\nlong been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality\nsuggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex­\nplained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, “does not necessarily\nindicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the\ntestimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic\nunconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. Post, at 7–8\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\nrationales are incorrect. Ante, at 9–13. Therefore, the\nNew Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding\nthat the report was admissible via Razatos’ testimony.\n                                 II\n   Although this case is materially indistinguishable from\nthe facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight\nsome of the factual circumstances that this case does not\npresent.\n   First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an\nalternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur­\npose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not\nclaimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom­\ning with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing “Statements for Purposes\nof Medical Diagnosis or Treatment” under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are\n“by their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a\nprosecution”); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip\nop., at 6, n. 2) (“[M]edical reports created for treatment\npurposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision\ntoday”); Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 376 (2008)\n(“[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving\ntreatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay\nrules”).\n   Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying\nis a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,\nalbeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\nRazatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no\nrole in producing the BAC report and did not observe any\nportion of Curtis Caylor’s conduct of the testing. App. 58.\nThe court below also recognized Razatos’ total lack of\nconnection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would\nbe a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob­\nserved an analyst conducting a test testified about the\nresults or a report about such results. We need not ad­\n6               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part\n\ndress what degree of involvement is sufficient because\nhere Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the rele­\nvant test and report.\n    Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was\nasked for his independent opinion about underlying testi­\nmonial reports that were not themselves admitted into\nevidence. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or\ndata of a type upon which experts in the field would rea­\nsonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible\nin order for the expert’s opinion based on the facts and\ndata to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the\nState does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,\nexpert opinion about Bullcoming’s blood alcohol concentra­\ntion. Rather, the State explains, “[a]side from reading a\nreport that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos\noffered no opinion about Petitioner’s blood alcohol content\n. . . .” Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).\nHere the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor’s\ntestimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a\ndifferent question if asked to determine the constitutional­\nity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others’ testi­\nmonial statements if the testimonial statements were not\nthemselves admitted as evidence.\n    Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced\nonly machine-generated results, such as a printout from a\ngas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor’s\nstatements, which included his transcription of a blood\nalcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro­\nmatograph printout, along with other statements about\nthe procedures used in handling the blood sample. See\nante, at 10; App. 62 (“I certify that I followed the proce­\ndures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state­\nments in this block are correct”). Thus, we do not decide\nwhether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 226\nP. 3d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an ade­\nquate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Pointer v. Texas,\n380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965). Two Terms ago, in a case aris\ning from a state criminal prosecution, the Court inter\npreted the Clause to mandate exclusion of a laboratory\nreport sought to be introduced based on the authority of\nthat report’s own sworn statement that a test had been\nperformed yielding the results as shown. Melendez-Diaz v.\nMassachusetts, 557 U. S. ___ (2009). The Court’s opinion\nin that case held the report inadmissible because no one\nwas present at trial to testify to its contents.\n   Whether or not one agrees with the reasoning and the\nresult in Melendez-Diaz, the Court today takes the new\nand serious misstep of extending that holding to instances\nlike this one. Here a knowledgeable representative of the\nlaboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab’s\nprocesses and the details of the report; but because he was\nnot the analyst who filled out part of the form and tran\nscribed onto it the test result from a machine printout, the\nCourt finds a confrontation violation. Some of the princi\npal objections to the Court’s underlying theory have been\nset out earlier and need not be repeated here. See id., at\n___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Additional reasons, appli\n2               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncable to the extension of that doctrine and to the new\nruling in this case, are now explained in support of this\nrespectful dissent.\n                              I\n   Before today, the Court had not held that the Confron\ntation Clause bars admission of scientific findings when\nan employee of the testing laboratory authenticates the\nfindings, testifies to the laboratory’s methods and prac\ntices, and is cross-examined at trial. Far from replacing\nlive testimony with “systematic” and “extrajudicial” ex\naminations, Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 835, 836\n(2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (emphasis deleted and internal quota\ntion marks omitted), these procedures are fully consistent\nwith the Confrontation Clause and with well-established\nprinciples for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted\nin full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability\nand with the confrontation guarantee. They do not “re\nsemble Marian proceedings.” Id., at 837.\n   The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by\nthe Court, make live testimony rather than the “solem\nnity” of a document the primary reason to credit the labo\nratory’s scientific results. Id., at 838. Unlike Melendez-\nDiaz, where the jury was asked to credit a labora-\ntory’s findings based solely on documents that were\n“quite plainly affidavits,” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), here the signature, heading, or legend on the docu\nment were routine authentication elements for a report\nthat would be assessed and explained by in-court testi\nmony subject to full cross-examination. The only sworn\nstatement at issue was that of the witness who was pre\nsent and who testified.\n   The record reveals that the certifying analyst’s role here\nwas no greater than that of anyone else in the chain of\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncustody. App. 56 (laboratory employee’s testimony agree\ning that “once the material is prepared and placed in the\nmachine, you don’t need any particular expertise to record\nthe results”). The information contained in the report was\nthe result of a scientific process comprising multiple par\nticipants’ acts, each with its own evidentiary significance.\nThese acts included receipt of the sample at the labora\ntory; recording its receipt; storing it; placing the sample\ninto the testing device; transposing the printout of the\nresults of the test onto the report; and review of the re\nsults. See Id., at 48–56; see also Brief for State of New\nMexico Dept. of Health Scientific Laboratory Division as\nAmicus Curiae 4 (hereinafter New Mexico Scientific Labo\nratory Brief) (“Each blood sample has original testing\nwork by . . . as many as seve[n] analysts . . . .”); App. 62\n(indicating that this case involved three laboratory ana\nlysts who, respectively, received, analyzed, and reviewed\nanalysis of the sample); cf. Brief for State of Indiana et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Briscoe v. Virginia, O. T. 2009, No. 07–\n11191, p. 10 (hereinafter Indiana Brief) (explaining that\nDNA analysis can involve the combined efforts of up to 40\nanalysts).\n   In the New Mexico scientific laboratory where the blood\nsample was processed, analyses are run in batches involv\ning 40–60 samples. Each sample is identified by a com\nputer-generated number that is not linked back to the file\ncontaining the name of the person from whom the sample\ncame until after all testing is completed. See New Mexico\nScientific Laboratory Brief 26. The analysis is mechani\ncally performed by the gas chromatograph, which may\noperate—as in this case—after all the laboratory employ\nees leave for the day. See id., at 17. And whatever the\nresult, it is reported to both law enforcement and the\ndefense. See id., at 36.\n   The representative of the testing laboratory whom the\nprosecution called was a scientific analyst named Mr.\n4              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nRazatos. He testified that he “help[ed] in overseeing the\nadministration of these programs throughout the State,”\nand he was qualified to answer questions concerning each\nof these steps. App. 49. The Court has held that the\ngovernment need not produce at trial “everyone who laid\nhands on the evidence,” Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, n. 1\n(slip op., at 5, n. 1). Here, the defense used the opportu\nnity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial\nof certain laboratory employees. Under questioning by\nBullcoming’s attorney, Razatos acknowledged that his\nname did not appear on the report; that he did not receive\nthe sample, perform the analysis, or complete the review;\nand that he did not know the reason for some personnel\ndecisions. App. 58. After weighing arguments from de\nfense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con\nsidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the\nlaboratory’s protocols and processes, the jury found no\nreasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.\n   In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the\ntechnician who filled out a form and recorded the results\nof a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to\nchallenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and\nexamine the technician who performed a test. And it may\ncall other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not\nalways reliable or that the technician might have made a\nmistake. The jury can then decide whether to credit the\ntest, as it did here. The States, furthermore, can assess\nthe progress of scientific testing and enact or adopt stat\nutes and rules to ensure that only reliable evidence is\nadmitted. Rejecting these commonsense arguments and\nthe concept that reliability is a legitimate concern, the\nCourt today takes a different course. It once more as\nsumes for itself a central role in mandating detailed evi\ndentiary rules, thereby extending and confirming\nMelendez-Diaz’s “vast potential to disrupt criminal proce\ndures.” 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (KENNEDY, J.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ndissenting).\n                               II\n   The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed\nthe Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure\na fair trial with reliable evidence. But the Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated\nthe reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at\n61–62. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a\nlab report because it “is formalized in a signed document.”\nAnte, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt’s unconventional and unstated premise is that\nthe State—by acting to ensure a statement’s reliability—\nmakes the statement more formal and therefore less likely\nto be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?\n19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the\nCourt insists, because reliability does not animate the\nConfrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11–12); Crawford, supra, at 61–62. Yet\njust this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta\ntion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti\ntutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,\n___–___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12, 14–15).\n   Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out\nof the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes\nbeen dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur\nring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834–837,\n841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction\nbetween utterances aimed at proving past events, and\nthose calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare\nDavis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at\n24–30), with id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–9) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting).\n   It is not even clear which witnesses’ testimony could\n6               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrender a scientific report admissible under the Court’s\napproach. Melendez-Diaz stated an inflexible rule: Where\n“analysts’ affidavits” included “testimonial statements,”\ndefendants were “entitled to be confronted with the ana\nlysts” themselves. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,\nthis rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too\nstrict to be followed. A report is admissible, today’s opin\nion states, if a “live witness competent to testify to the\ntruth of the statements made in the report” appears. Ante,\nat 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana\nlyst, but also any “scientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob\nserve[d] the test reported in the certification.” Ante, at 2.\n   Today’s majority is not committed in equal shares to a\ncommon set of principles in applying the holding of Craw\nford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,\nsupra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,\nat ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the\nCourt), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has\nhad such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case’s\nmeaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in\nevery criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court\nin the Nation. This Court’s prior decisions leave trial\njudges to “guess what future rules this Court will distill\nfrom the sparse constitutional text,” Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug\ngle to apply an “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,”\n“highly context-dependent inquiry” involving “open-ended\nbalancing.” Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority’s approach).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   The persistent ambiguities in the Court’s approach are\nsymptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica\ntions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus\ntrate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted\nthat its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of\ncustody to testify but then qualified that “what testimony\nis introduced must . . . be introduced live.” 557 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This\ncould mean that a statement that evidence remained in\nlaw-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement’s\nmaker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head\nquarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain\nof custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also\nbe that that the intern’s statement—which draws on\nstatements in the evidence log—is inadmissible unless\nevery officer who signed the log appears at trial. That\nrule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis\nsibility of the report on the testimony of three or more\nidentified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or\neven 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The\ncourt has thus—in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz—boxed\nitself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation\nClause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are\nunworkable.\n                            III\n  Crawford itself does not compel today’s conclusion. It\nis true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation\nClause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat\ning trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,\nat 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12). Crawford\nexplained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to\naddress the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious\ntreason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On\nthis view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of\ncourt statements obtained through formal interrogation in\n8               BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npreparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defen\ndants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, un\ntested statements by those who observed—or claimed to\nhave observed—preparation for or commission of the\ncrime. And, of course, those statements might not have\nbeen uttered at all or—even if spoken—might not have\nbeen true.\n   A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, pro\nvides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitu\ntional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like\nthe instant one, reports prepared by experienced techni\ncians in laboratories that follow professional norms and\nscientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right\nto call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this\ncase was already protected by checks on potential prosecu\ntorial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result\nblind issuance of reports; testing by an independent\nagency; routine processes performed en masse, which\nreduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating\npursuant to scientific and professional norms and over\nsight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14–15, 41, 54; New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.\n   In addition to preventing the State from conducting ex\nparte trials, Crawford’s rejection of the regime of Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), seemed to have two under\nlying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the\nintricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate;\nand the other was to allow the States, in their own courts\nand legislatures and without this Court’s supervision, to\nexplore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules\npertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.\nThese results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks\nthe experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial\nprocess to suit it well to assume the role of national tribu\nnal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these\nobjectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their oppo\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsites.\n   Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay\ndoctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear\nsay rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined\nformulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta\ntion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge\nof Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.\n691, 739–740, 742, 744–746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern\nEvidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502–503, 514–515,\n533–537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,\nthe Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen\ntury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to\nmake those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay’s Last\nHurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5–6, 36. As a result, the Court\nhas taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap\nplication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court\nstatements by unconfronted and available witnesses who\nobserved the crime and do not appear at trial.\n   Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of\ntheir hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are\nforeclosed now from contributing to the formulation and\nenactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli\nable. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission\nof well-documented and supported reports of abuse by\nwomen whose abusers later murdered them must give\nway, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur\npose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554\nU. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14–15. Whether\nthose statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability\nand other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation\nClause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open\nquestion. The point is that the States cannot now partici\npate in the development of this difficult part of the law.\n   In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic\ndisplacement of the States and dislocation of the federal\nstructure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip\n10              BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nop., at 2–3, 22–23). If this Court persists in applying\nwooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony of\nfered by the prosecution—testimony thought proper for\nmany decades in state and federal courts committed to\ndevising fair trial processes—then the States might find it\nnecessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommo\ndate this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those\nrules could remain on State statute books for decades,\neven if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better\nimplement the objectives of Crawford. This underscores\nthe disruptive, long-term structural consequences of deci\nsions like the one the Court announces today.\n   States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to\nenact statutes that require defense counsel to give ad\nvance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a\nreport without the presence in court of the technician who\nprepared it. Indeed, today’s opinion relies upon laws of\nthat sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.\nAnte, at 17 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic,\nhowever, to think that this will take away from the de\nfense the incentives to insist on having the certifying\nanalyst present. There is in the ordinary case that pro\nceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive\nthe right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.\n   Today’s opinion repeats an assertion from Melendez-\nDiaz that its decision will not “impose an undue burden on\nthe prosecution.” Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion). But\nevidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See,\ne.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 7\n(explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles\nPolice Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appear\nances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District\nAttorneys Assocation et al. as Amici Curiae 23 (observing\nthat each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes\n3,220 cases per year on average).

S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nof Melendez-Diaz are sure to be forthcoming.\n   In the meantime, New Mexico’s experience exemplifies\nthe problems ahead. From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re\nquiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving\ncases rose 71%, to 1,600—or 8 or 9 every workday. New\nMexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the\nNation’s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10\ntotal analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases\nrecently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The\nanalysts now must travel great distances on most working\ndays. The result has been, in the laboratory’s words,\n“chaotic.” Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection\nand the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or\non leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer\nemployed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a\nwindfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in\never-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability\nto produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant\nincreases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo\nratory’s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce\nstate resources could be committed to other urgent needs\nin the criminal justice system.\n                       *     *     *\n   Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering\nthat the Crawford approach was not preordained. This\nCourt’s missteps have produced an interpretation of the\nword “witness” at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the\nConstitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amend\nment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84\nGeo. L. J. 641, 647, 691–696 (1996), and at odds with\nthe sound administration of justice. It is time to return\nto solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to\ndecline to extend Melendez-Diaz to bar the reliable, com\nmonsense evidentiary framework the State sought to\nfollow in this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/219509/", "sha1": "765d499b8eba2767fa779652cb998d1871eb10fc", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-23T07:25:10"}
