Argued March 30, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011*\nFive years after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first ap\n  proved metoclopramide, a drug commonly used to treat digestive\n  tract problems, under the brand name Reglan, generic manufacturers\n  such as petitioners also began producing the drug. Because of accu\n  mulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause\n  tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for\n  the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most re\n  cently in 2009.\n    Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both\n  received the generic drug from their pharmacists. After taking the\n  drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskine\n  sia. In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the\n  generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they\n  took (Manufacturers). Each respondent alleged, inter alia, that long\n  term metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufac\n  turers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate\n  warning labels. In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal\n  statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by re\n  quiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopra\n  mide as was mandated at the time for Reglan. The Fifth and Eighth\n  Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents’ claims\n  were not pre-empted.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.\n——————\n  * Together with No. 09–1039, Actavis Elizabeth, LLC v.

MENSING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n588 F. 3d 603 and 593 F. 3d 428, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  all but Part III–B–2, concluding that federal drug regulations appli\n  cable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus\n  pre-empt, these state claims. Pp. 4–14, 17–20.\n     (a) Because pre-emption analysis requires a comparison between\n  federal and state law, the Court begins by identifying the state tort\n  duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufac\n  turers. Pp. 4–10.\n       (1) State tort law requires a manufacturer that is, or should be,\n  aware of its drug’s danger to label it in a way that renders it rea\n  sonably safe. Respondents pleaded that the Manufacturers knew, or\n  should have known, both that the long-term use of their products car\n  ried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not\n  adequately warn of that risk. Taking these allegations as true, the\n  state-law duty required the Manufacturers to use a different,\n  stronger label than the one they actually used. Pp. 4–5.\n       (2) On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by\n  the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing\n  their generic drugs’ safety labels. A manufacturer seeking federal\n  approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effec\n  tive and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate. Although\n  the same rules originally applied to all drugs, the 1984 law commonly\n  called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allows a generic drug manu\n  facturer to gain FDA approval simply by showing that its drug is\n  equivalent to an already-approved brand-name drug, and that the\n  safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that\n  approved for the brand-name drug. Respondents contend that fed\n  eral law nevertheless provides avenues through which the Manufac\n  turers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to pre\n  vent the injuries here. These include: (1) the FDA’s “changes-being\n  effected” (CBE) process, which permits drug manufacturers, without\n  preapproval, to add or strengthen a warning label; and (2) sending\n  “Dear Doctor” letters providing additional warnings to prescribing\n  physicians and other healthcare professionals. However, the FDA\n  denies that the Manufacturers could have used either of these proc\n  esses to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels. The Court de\n  fers to the FDA’s views because they are not plainly erroneous or in\n  consistent with the regulations, and there is no other reason to doubt\n  that they reflect the FDA’s fair and considered judgment. Auer v.\n  Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462. Assuming, without deciding, that\n  the FDA is correct that federal law nevertheless required the Manu\n  facturers to ask for the agency’s assistance in convincing the brand\n  name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, the Court turns to the\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npre-emption question. Pp. 5–10.\n   (b) Where state and federal law directly conflict, state law must\ngive way. See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583. Such a con\nflict exists where it is “impossible for a private party to comply with\nboth state and federal requirements.” Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,\n514 U. S. 280, 287. Pp. 11–14, 17–20.\n      (1) The Court finds impossibility here. If the Manufacturers had\nindependently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty to\nattach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide, they would have\nviolated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same\nas the corresponding brand-name drug labels. Thus, it was impossi\nble for them to comply with both state and federal law. And even if\nthey had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA help in strength\nening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty ex\nists, they would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty. State\nlaw demanded a safer label; it did not require communication with\nthe FDA about the possibility of a safer label. Pp. 11–12.\n      (2) The Court rejects the argument that the Manufacturers’ pre\nemption defense fails because they failed to ask the FDA for help in\nchanging the corresponding brand-name label. The proper question\nfor “impossibility” analysis is whether the private party could inde\npendently do under federal law what state law requires of it. See\nWyeth, supra, at 573. Accepting respondents’ argument would render\nconflict pre-emption largely meaningless by making most conflicts be\ntween state and federal law illusory. In these cases, it is possible\nthat, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might\nhave eventually been able to strengthen their warning label. But it\nis also possible that they could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret\nits regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process\nto them, persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations\nentirely, or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments. If these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and\nstate law from conflicting, it is unclear when, outside of express pre\nemption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force. That Clause—\nwhich makes federal law “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any\nThing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not\nwithstanding,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2—cannot be read to permit\nan approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but\nmeaningless. Here, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot\nsatisfy its state duties without the Federal Government’s special\npermission and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of\njudgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently sat\nisfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes. Pp. 12–14, 17.\n      (3) Wyeth is not to the contrary. The Court there held that a\n4                       PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure\n    to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it\n    was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and fed\n    eral law under the FDA’s CBE regulation. 555 U. S., at 572–573.\n    The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug\n    manufacturers differ, by Congress’ design, from those applicable to\n    generic drug manufacturers. And different federal statutes and regu\n    lations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results. This\n    Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create simi\n    lar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme. Congress and\n    the FDA retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so\n    desire. Pp. 17–20.\n\n   THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III–\nB–2.

MENSING \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the move­\nment of food through the digestive system. The Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopra­\nmide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980. Five\nyears later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto­\nclopramide. The drug is commonly used to treat diges-\ntive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and\ngastroesophageal reflux disorder.\n   Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopra­\nmide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurologi­\ncal disorder. Studies have shown that up to 29% of pa­\ntients who take metoclopramide for several years develop\nthis condition. McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F. 3d 364, 370,\nn. 5 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &\nMackey, Tardive Dyskinesia Risks and Metoclopramide\nUse Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cis­\napride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (not­\ning 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia\nreported to the FDA’s adverse event reporting system by\nmid-2003).\n   Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been\nstrengthened and clarified several times. In 1985, the\nlabel was modified to warn that “tardive dyskinesia . . .\nmay develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,”\nand the drug’s package insert added that “[t]herapy longer\nthan 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be\nrecommended.” Physician’s Desk Reference 1635–1636\n(41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al.\n21–22 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief). In 2004, the brand­\nname Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA ap­\nproved, a label change to add that “[t]herapy should not\nexceed 12 weeks in duration.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter U. S. Brief). And in 2009,\nthe FDA ordered a black box warning—its strongest—\nwhich states: “Treatment with metoclopramide can cause\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is\noften irreversible. . . . Treatment with metoclopramide\nfor longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare\ncases.” See Physician’s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed.\n2011).\n  Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in\nthese consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001\nand 2002, respectively. Both received generic metoclo­\npramide from their pharmacists. After taking the drug\nas prescribed for several years, both women developed\ntardive dyskinesia.\n  In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the ge­\nneric drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopra­\nmide they took (Manufacturers). Each alleged, as relevant\nhere, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tar­\ndive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable\nunder state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and\nLouisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels.\nThey claimed that “despite mounting evidence that long\nterm metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskine­\nsia far greater than that indicated on the label,” none of\nthe Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately\nwarn of that danger. Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d\n603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also Demahy v. Actavis, Inc., 593\nF. 3d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).\n  In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law\npre-empted the state tort claims. According to the Manu­\nfacturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required\nthem to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their\nbrand-name counterparts. This means, they argued, that\nit was impossible to simultaneously comply with both\nfederal law and any state tort-law duty that required them\nto use a different label.\n  The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits\nrejected the Manufacturers’ arguments and held that Men­\nsing and Demahy’s claims were not pre-empted. See\n4                 PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n588 F. 3d, at 614; 593 F. 3d, at 449. We granted certiorari,\n562 U. S. ___ (2010), consolidated the cases, and now\nreverse each.\n                             II\n  Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and\nstate law. We therefore begin by identifying the state tort\nduties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the\nManufacturers.\n                             A\n   It is undisputed that Minnesota and Louisiana tort law\nrequire a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of\nits product’s danger to label that product in a way that\nrenders it reasonably safe. Under Minnesota law, which\napplies to Mensing’s lawsuit, “where the manufacturer . . .\nof a product has actual or constructive knowledge of\ndanger to users, the . . . manufacturer has a duty to give\nwarning of such dangers.” Frey v. Montgomery Ward &\nCo., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). Similarly, under\nLouisiana law applicable to Demahy’s lawsuit, “a manu­\nfacturer’s duty to warn includes a duty to provide ade­\nquate instructions for safe use of a product.” Stahl v.\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 283 F. 3d 254, 269–270\n(CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:2800.57 (West\n2009). In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on\nthe manufacturer. See Marks v. OHMEDA, Inc., 2003–\n1446, pp. 8–9 (La.

Badger Min. Corp., 676 N. W. 2d 268, 274 (Minn.\n2004).\n   Mensing and Demahy have pleaded that the Manufac­\nturers knew or should have known of the high risk of\ntardive dyskinesia inherent in the long-term use of their\nproduct. They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers\nknew or should have known that their labels did not ade­\nquately warn of that risk. App. 437–438, 67–69, 94–96.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe parties do not dispute that, if these allegations are\ntrue, state law required the Manufacturers to use a differ­\nent, safer label.\n                              B\n  Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling\nrequirements. We begin with what is not in dispute.\nUnder the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. §301 et\nseq., a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a\nnew drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that\nthe proposed label is accurate and adequate.1 See, e.g.,\n21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n567 (2009). Meeting those requirements involves costly\nand lengthy clinical testing. §§355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D.\nBeers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA\nApproval Requirements §2.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).\n  Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs. In 1984,\nhowever, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and\nPatent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly\ncalled the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Under this law,\n“generic drugs” can gain FDA approval simply by showing\nequivalence to a reference listed drug that has already\nbeen approved by the FDA.2 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A).\nThis allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs in­\nexpensively, without duplicating the clinical trials already\nperformed on the equivalent brand-name drug. A generic\ndrug application must also “show that the [safety and\n——————\n  1 All relevant events in these cases predate the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration Amendments Act of 2007, 121 Stat. 823. We therefore\nrefer exclusively to the pre-2007 statutes and regulations and express\nno view on the impact of the 2007 Act.\n  2 As we use it here, “generic drug” refers to a drug designed to be a\n\ncopy of a reference listed drug (typically a brand-name drug), and thus\nidentical in active ingredients, safety, and efficacy. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U. S. 453, 454–455 (1983); 21 CFR\n§314.3(b) (2006) (defining “reference listed drug”).\n6                      PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nefficacy] labeling proposed . . . is the same as the labeling\napproved for the [brand-name] drug.” §355(j)(2)(A)(v); see\nalso §355(j)(4)(G); Beers §§3.01, 3.03[A].\n  As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufactur­\ners have different federal drug labeling duties. A brand­\nname manufacturer seeking new drug approval is respon­\nsible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label. See, e.g.,\n21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth, supra, at 570–571. A\nmanufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other\nhand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is\nthe same as the brand name’s. See, e.g., §355(j)(2)(A)(v);\n§355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).\n  The parties do not disagree. What is in dispute is\nwhether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may\nchange their labels after initial FDA approval. Mensing\nand Demahy contend that federal law provided several\navenues through which the Manufacturers could have\naltered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the\ninjuries here. The FDA, however, tells us that it inter­\nprets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a\nbrand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the\nsame—thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing\nfederal duty of “sameness.” U. S. Brief 16; see also 57 Fed.\nReg. 17961 (1992) (“[T]he [generic drug’s] labeling must\nbe the same as the listed drug product’s labeling because\nthe listed drug product is the basis for [generic drug] ap­\nproval”). The FDA’s views are “controlling unless plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]” or there\nis any other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA’s\nfair and considered judgment.

The CBE process permits\ndrug manufacturers to “add or strengthen a contraindica­\ntion, warning, [or] precaution,” 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A)\n(2006), or to “add or strengthen an instruction about dos­\nage and administration that is intended to increase the\nsafe use of the drug product,” §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). When\nmaking labeling changes using the CBE process, drug man­\nufacturers need not wait for preapproval by the FDA,\nwhich ordinarily is necessary to change a label. Wyeth,\nsupra, at 568. They need only simultaneously file a sup­\nplemental application with the FDA. 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6).\n   The FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have\nused the CBE process to unilaterally strengthen their\nwarning labels. The agency interprets the CBE regulation\nto allow changes to generic drug labels only when a ge­\nneric drug manufacturer changes its label to match an\nupdated brand-name label or to follow the FDA’s instruc­\ntions. U. S. Brief 15, 16, n. 7 (interpreting 21 CFR\n§314.94(a)(8)(iv)); U. S. Brief 16, n. 8. The FDA argues\nthat CBE changes unilaterally made to strengthen a\ngeneric drug’s warning label would violate the statutes\nand regulations requiring a generic drug’s label to match\nits brand-name counterpart’s.

Although Mensing and\nDemahy offer other ways to interpret the regulations, see\nBrief for Respondents 33–35, we do not find the agency’s\ninterpretation “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulation.” Auer, supra, at 461 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Nor do Mensing and Demahy suggest there is\nany other reason to doubt the agency’s reading. We there­\nfore conclude that the CBE process was not open to the\nManufacturers for the sort of change required by state\nlaw.\n                              2\n   Next, Mensing and Demahy contend that the Manufac­\nturers could have used “Dear Doctor” letters to send ad­\nditional warnings to prescribing physicians and other\nhealthcare professionals. See Brief for Respondents 36; 21\nCFR §200.5. Again, the FDA disagrees, and we defer to\nthe agency’s views.\n   The FDA argues that Dear Doctor letters qualify as\n“labeling.” U. S. Brief 18; see also 21 U. S. C. §321(m); 21\nCFR §202.1(l)(2). Thus, any such letters must be “consis­\ntent with and not contrary to [the drug’s] approved . . .\nlabeling.” 21 CFR §201.100(d)(1). A Dear Doctor letter\nthat contained substantial new warning information\nwould not be consistent with the drug’s approved labeling.\nMoreover, if generic drug manufacturers, but not the\nbrand-name manufacturer, sent such letters, that would\ninaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the\nbrand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly\n“misleading.” U. S. Brief 19; see 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3)\n(FDA may withdraw approval of a generic drug if “the\nlabeling of the drug . . . is false or misleading in any\nparticular”).\n   As with the CBE regulation, we defer to the FDA.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMensing and Demahy offer no argument that the FDA’s\ninterpretation is plainly erroneous. See Auer, 519 U. S., at\n461. Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not\npermit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings\nthrough Dear Doctor letters.\n                              3\n   Though the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could\nhave used the CBE process or Dear Doctor letters to\nstrengthen their warning labels, the agency asserts that\na different avenue existed for changing generic drug la­\nbels. According to the FDA, the Manufacturers could have\nproposed—indeed, were required to propose—stronger\nwarning labels to the agency if they believed such warn­\nings were needed. U. S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961. If\nthe FDA had agreed that a label change was necessary,\nit would have worked with the brand-name manufacturer\nto create a new label for both the brand-name and generic\ndrug. Ibid.\n   The agency traces this duty to 21 U. S. C. §352(f)(2),\nwhich provides that a drug is “misbranded . . . [u]nless its\nlabeling bears . . . adequate warnings against . . . unsafe\ndosage or methods or duration of administration or appli­\ncation, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the\nprotection of users.” See U. S. Brief 12. By regulation, the\nFDA has interpreted that statute to require that “labeling\nshall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is\nreasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard\nwith a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).\n   According to the FDA, these requirements apply to ge­\nneric drugs. As it explains, a “ ‘central premise of fed-\neral drug regulation is that the manufacturer bears re­\nsponsibility for the content of its label at all times.’ ” U. S.\nBrief 12–13 (quoting Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 570–571). The\nFDA reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate\nlabeling with the duty of sameness in the following way:\n10                PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGeneric drug manufacturers that become aware of safety\nproblems must ask the agency to work toward strengthen­\ning the label that applies to both the generic and brand­\nname equivalent drug. U. S. Brief 20.\n  The Manufacturers and the FDA disagree over whether\nthis alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually\nexisted. The FDA argues that it explained this duty in the\npreamble to its 1992 regulations implementing the Hatch-\nWaxman Amendments. Ibid.; see 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (“If\na [generic drug manufacturer] believes new safety infor­\nmation should be added to a product’s labeling, it should\ncontact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the label­\ning for the generic and listed drugs should be revised”).\nThe Manufacturers claim that the FDA’s 19-year-old\nstatement did not create a duty, and that there is no evi­\ndence of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pur­\nsuant to any such duty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–24;\nReply Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 18–22. Because we\nultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty\nexisted, we do not resolve the matter.\n                             C\n  To summarize, the relevant state and federal require­\nments are these: State tort law places a duty directly on\nall drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label\ntheir products. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s allegations\nas true, this duty required the Manufacturers to use a\ndifferent, stronger label than the label they actually used.\nFederal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA,\nprevented the Manufacturers from independently chang­\ning their generic drugs’ safety labels. But, we assume,\nfederal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for\nFDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufac­\nturer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding\ngeneric drug manufacturers could do so as well. We turn\nnow to the question of pre-emption.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

It was not lawful under\nfederal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law\nrequired of them.

See post, at 9, 19 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\ndissenting). Nor do they contain any saving clause to expressly pre­\nserve state tort claims. Cf. Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America,\nInc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(discussing the saving clause in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle\nSafety Act of 1966, 49 U. S. C. §30103(e)). Although an express state­\nment on pre-emption is always preferable, the lack of such a statement\ndoes not end our inquiry. Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, the\nabsence of express pre-emption is not a reason to find no conflict pre­\nemption. See post, at 19.\n12                PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlabels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have\nviolated federal law. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s\nallegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufac­\nturers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic meto­\nclopramide. Federal law, however, demanded that ge­\nneric drug labels be the same at all times as the corres­\nponding brand-name drug labels. See, e.g., 21 CFR\n§314.150(b)(10). Thus, it was impossible for the Manufac­\nturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change\nthe label and their federal law duty to keep the label the\nsame.\n  The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthen­\ning the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such\na duty exists, does not change this analysis. Although\nrequesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Man­\nufacturers’ federal duty, it would not have satisfied\ntheir state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling.\nState law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the\nManufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the\npossibility of a safer label. Indeed, Mensing and Demahy\ndeny that their state tort claims are based on the Manu­\nfacturers’ alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in\nchanging the labels. Brief for Respondents 53–54; cf.\nBuckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341\n(2001) (holding that federal drug and medical device laws\npre-empted a state tort-law claim based on failure to\nproperly communicate with the FDA).\n                            B\n                            1\n  Mensing and Demahy contend that, while their state­\nlaw claims do not turn on whether the Manufacturers\nasked the FDA for assistance in changing their labels, the\nManufacturers’ federal affirmative defense of pre-emption\ndoes. Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufactur­\ners had asked the FDA for help in changing the corre­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsponding brand-name label, they might eventually have\nbeen able to accomplish under federal law what state law\nrequires. That is true enough. The Manufacturers “freely\nconcede” that they could have asked the FDA for help.\nPLIVA Brief 48. If they had done so, and if the FDA\ndecided there was sufficient supporting information, and\nif the FDA undertook negotiations with the brand-name\nmanufacturer, and if adequate label changes were decided\non and implemented, then the Manufacturers would have\nstarted a Mouse Trap game that eventually led to a better\nlabel on generic metoclopramide.\n   This raises the novel question whether conflict pre­\nemption should take into account these possible actions by\nthe FDA and the brand-name manufacturer. Here, what\nfederal law permitted the Manufacturers to do could have\nchanged, even absent a change in the law itself, depending\non the actions of the FDA and the brand-name manufac­\nturer. Federal law does not dictate the text of each ge­\nneric drug’s label, but rather ties those labels to their\nbrand-name counterparts. Thus, federal law would permit\nthe Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling re­\nquirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name\nmanufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so.\n   Mensing and Demahy assert that when a private party’s\nability to comply with state law depends on approval and\nassistance from the FDA, proving pre-emption requires\nthat party to demonstrate that the FDA would not have\nallowed compliance with state law. Here, they argue, the\nManufacturers cannot bear their burden of proving impos­\nsibility because they did not even try to start the process\nthat might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer\nlabel. Brief for Respondents 47. This is a fair argument,\nbut we reject it.\n   The question for “impossibility” is whether the private\nparty could independently do under federal law what state\nlaw requires of it. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573 (finding\n14                    PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nno pre-emption where the defendant could “unilaterally”\ndo what state law required). Accepting Mensing and\nDemahy’s argument would render conflict pre-emption\nlargely meaningless because it would make most conflicts\nbetween state and federal law illusory. We can often\nimagine that a third party or the Federal Government\nmight do something that makes it lawful for a private\nparty to accomplish under federal law what state law\nrequires of it. In these cases, it is certainly possible that,\nhad the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they\nmight have eventually been able to strengthen their warn­\ning label. Of course, it is also possible that the Manufac­\nturers could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its\nregulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE\nprocess to them. Following Mensing and Demahy’s argu­\nment to its logical conclusion, it is also possible that,\nby asking, the Manufacturers could have persuaded the\nFDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or\ntalked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments.\n  If these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state\nlaw from conflicting for Supremacy Clause purposes, it\nis unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Su­\npremacy Clause would have any force.6 We do not read\nthe Supremacy Clause to permit an approach to pre­\nemption that renders conflict pre-emption all but mean­\ningless. The Supremacy Clause, on its face, makes federal\nlaw “the supreme Law of the Land” even absent an ex­\npress statement by Congress. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.\n——————\n  6 The dissent asserts that we are forgetting “purposes-and-objectives”\n\npre-emption. Post, at 15–16. But as the dissent acknowledges, pur­\nposes-and-objectives pre-emption is a form of conflict pre-emption.\nPost, at 9, 16. If conflict pre-emption analysis must take into account\nhypothetical federal action, including possible changes in Acts of\nCongress, then there is little reason to think that pre-emption based on\nthe purposes and objectives of Congress would survive either.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Ibid.; see Nelson,\nPreemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 234 (2000); id., at 252–253\n(describing discussion of the Supremacy Clause in state\nratification debates as concerning whether federal law\ncould repeal state law, or vice versa). The phrase “any\n[state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding” is a non ob\nstante provision. Id., at 238–240, nn. 43–45. Eighteenth­\ncentury legislatures used non obstante provisions to\nspecify the degree to which a new statute was meant to\nrepeal older, potentially conflicting statutes in the same\nfield. Id., at 238–240 (citing dozens of statutes from the\n1770’s and 1780’s with similar provisions). A non obstante\nprovision “in a new statute acknowledged that the statute\nmight contradict prior law and instructed courts not to\napply the general presumption against implied repeals.”\nId., at 241–242; 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the\nLaw 639 (4th ed. 1778) (“Although two Acts of Parliament\nare seemingly repugnant, yet if there be no Clause of non\nObstante in the latter, they shall if possible have such\nConstruction, that the latter may not be a Repeal of the\nformer by Implication”). The non obstante provision in the\nSupremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law\nshould be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state\nlaw.\n   Further, the provision suggests that courts should not\nstrain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly\nconflicting state law. Traditionally, courts went to great\nlengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes, in\norder to avoid implied repeals. Warder v.

A\nnon obstante provision thus was a useful way for legisla­\ntures to specify that they did not want courts distorting\nthe new law to accommodate the old. Nelson, supra, at\n240–242; see also J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory\nConstruction §147, p. 199 (1891) (“[W]hen there is inserted\nin a statute a provision [of non obstante] . . . . It is to be\nsupposed that courts will be less inclined against recogniz­\ning repugnancy in applying such statutes”); Weston’s Case,\n73 Eng. Rep. 780, 781 (K.

Morgan ed.,\n10th ed. 1782) (definition of “statute,” ¶6: “[W]hen there is\na seeming variance between two statutes, and no clause of\nnon obstante in the latter, such construction shall be made\nthat both may stand”). The non obstante provision of\nhe Supremacy Clause indicates that a court need look no\nfurther than “the ordinary meanin[g]” of federal law, and\nshould not distort federal law to accommodate conflicting\nstate law. Wyeth, 555 U.

The Manufacturers would be required continually\nto prove the counterfactual conduct of the FDA and brand­\nname manufacturer in order to establish the supremacy of\nfederal law. We do not think the Supremacy Clause con­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntemplates that sort of contingent supremacy. The non\nobstante provision suggests that pre-emption analysis\nshould not involve speculation about ways in which fed­\neral agency and third-party actions could potentially\nreconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.\nWhen the “ordinary meaning” of federal law blocks a\nprivate party from independently accomplishing what\nstate law requires, that party has established pre-emption.\n                              3\n   To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently\nindependently under federal law to do what state law\nrequires may sometimes be difficult to determine. But this\nis not such a case. Before the Manufacturers could satisfy\nstate law, the FDA—a federal agency—had to undertake\nspecial effort permitting them to do so. To decide these\ncases, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy\nits state duties without the Federal Government’s special\npermission and assistance, which is dependent on the\nexercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party can­\nnot independently satisfy those state duties for pre­\nemption purposes.\n   Here, state law imposed a duty on the Manufacturers to\ntake a certain action, and federal law barred them from\ntaking that action. The only action the Manufacturers\ncould independently take—asking for the FDA’s help—is\nnot a matter of state-law concern. Mensing and Demahy’s\ntort claims are pre-empted.\n                             C\n  Wyeth is not to the contrary. In that case, as here,\nthe plaintiff contended that a drug manufacturer had\nbreached a state tort-law duty to provide an adequate\nwarning label. 555 U. S., at 559–560. The Court held that\nthe lawsuit was not pre-empted because it was possible for\nWyeth, a brand-name drug manufacturer, to comply with\n18                     PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nboth state and federal law. Id., at 572–573.7 Specifically,\nthe CBE regulation, 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii), permitted a\nbrand-name drug manufacturer like Wyeth “to unilater­\nally strengthen its warning” without prior FDA approval.\n555 U. S., at 573; cf. supra, at 7–8. Thus, the federal\nregulations applicable to Wyeth allowed the company, of\nits own volition, to strengthen its label in compliance with\nits state tort duty.8\n   We recognize that from the perspective of Mensing and\nDemahy, finding pre-emption here but not in Wyeth makes\nlittle sense. Had Mensing and Demahy taken Reglan, the\nbrand-name drug prescribed by their doctors, Wyeth would\ncontrol and their lawsuits would not be pre-empted. But\n\n——————\n   7 Wyeth also urged that state tort law “creat[ed] an unacceptable\n\n‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\nand objectives of Congress.’ ” 555 U. S., at 563–564 (quoting Hines v.\nDavidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)). The Court rejected that argu­\nment, and that type of pre-emption is not argued here. Cf. post, at 16,\nn. 13 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n   8 The FDA, however, retained the authority to eventually rescind\n\nWyeth’s unilateral CBE changes. Accordingly, the Court noted that\nWyeth could have attempted to show, by “clear evidence,” that the FDA\nwould have rescinded any change in the label and thereby demonstrate\nthat it would in fact have been impossible to do under federal law\nwhat state law required. Wyeth, supra, at 571. Wyeth offered no such\nevidence.\n   That analysis is consistent with our holding today. The Court in\nWyeth asked what the drug manufacturer could independently do under\nfederal law, and in the absence of clear evidence that Wyeth could not\nhave accomplished what state law required of it, found no pre-emption.\nThe Wyeth Court held that, because federal law accommodated state\nlaw duties, “the possibility of impossibility” was “not enough.” Post, at\n10; see also Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982)\n(rejecting “hypothetical” impossibility). But here, “existing” federal law\ndirectly conflicts with state law. Post, at 15 (“Conflict analysis neces­\nsarily turns on existing law”). The question in these cases is not\nwhether the possibility of impossibility establishes pre-emption, but\nrather whether the possibility of possibility defeats pre-emption.

I cannot agree. We have traditionally held defen\ndants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard:\nUntil today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not\nbeen enough to establish pre-emption.\n  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits—\nand, the Court assumes, requires—generic-drug manufac\nturers to propose a label change to the FDA when they\nbelieve that their labels are inadequate. If it agrees that\nthe labels are inadequate, the FDA can initiate a change\n2                 PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto the brand-name label, triggering a corresponding\nchange to the generic labels. Once that occurs, a generic\nmanufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law\nand a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufac\nturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases,\npetitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide\n(Manufacturers), have shown only that they might have\nbeen unable to comply with both federal law and their\nstate-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and\nJulie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sus\ntain their burden.\n   The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion. It\ninvents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to\njustify its dilution of the impossibility standard. It effec\ntively rewrites our decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555 (2009), which holds that federal law does not pre-empt\nfailure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug manufac\nturers. And a plurality of the Court tosses aside our re\npeated admonition that courts should hesitate to conclude\nthat Congress intended to pre-empt state laws governing\nhealth and safety. As a result of today’s decision, whether\na consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain\nrelief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her\npharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or\ngeneric drug. The Court gets one thing right: This out\ncome “makes little sense.” Ante, at 18.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    Today’s decision affects 75 percent of all prescription\ndrugs dispensed in this country. The dominant position of\ngeneric drugs in the prescription drug market is the result\nof a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.\n   In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competi-\ntion and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585—\ncommonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)—to\n“make available more low cost generic drugs by establish\ning a generic drug approval procedure,” H. R. Rep. No. 98–\n857, pt. 1, p. 14 (1984). As the majority explains, to ac\ncomplish this goal the amendments establish an abbrevi\nated application process for generic drugs. Ante, at 5–6;\nsee also 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A). The abbreviated ap\nproval process implements the amendments’ core principle\nthat generic and brand-name drugs must be the “same” in\nnearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic\nmanufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things,\nthat its product has the same active ingredients as an\napproved brand-name drug; that “the route of adminis\ntration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new\ndrug are the same” as the brand-name drug; and that its\nproduct is “bioequivalent” to the brand-name drug.\n§§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv). By eliminating the need for\ngeneric manufacturers to prove their drugs’ safety and\nefficacy independently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\nallow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market\nmuch less expensively.\n  The States have also acted to expand consumption of\nlow-cost generic drugs. In the years leading up to passage\nof the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, States enacted legis\nlation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs\nwhen filling prescriptions for brand-name drugs. Chris\ntensen, Kirking, Ascione, Welage, & Gaither, Drug Prod\nuct Selection: Legal Issues, 41 J. Am. Pharmaceutical\nAssn. 868, 869 (2001). Currently, all States have some\nform of generic substitution law. See ibid. Some States\nrequire generic substitution in certain circumstances.\nDept. of Health and Human Servs., ASPE Issue Brief:\nExpanding the Use of Generic Drugs 7 (2010) (hereinafter\nExpanding the Use of Generic Drugs);1 see, e.g., N.

Ninety percent of drugs for which a\ngeneric version is available are now filled with generics.\nId., at 3–4. In many cases, once generic versions of a\ndrug enter the market, the brand-name manufacturer stops\nselling the brand-name drug altogether. See Brief for\nMarc T.

Reflecting the success of their products,\nmany generic manufacturers, including the Manufacturers\nand their amici, are huge, multinational companies. In\ntotal, generic drug manufacturers sold an estimated $66\nbillion of drugs in this country in 2009. See id., at 15.\n                             B\n   As noted, to obtain FDA approval a generic manufac\nturer must generally show that its drug is the same as an\napproved brand-name drug. It need not conduct clinical\ntrials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug. This\ndoes not mean, however, that a generic manufacturer has\nno duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its prod\nucts. The FDA has limited resources to conduct postap\nproval monitoring of drug safety. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at\n578. Manufacturers, we have recognized, “have superior\naccess to information about their drugs, especially in the\npostmarketing phase as new risks emerge.” Id., at 578–\n579. Federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers—both\nbrand-name and generic—to monitor the safety of their\nproducts.\n   Under federal law, generic manufacturers must “develop\nwritten procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evalua\ntion, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experi\nences” to the FDA.4 21 CFR §314.80(b);5 see also §314.98\n(making §314.80 applicable to generic manufacturers);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6, and n. 2\n(hereinafter U.

Most other adverse drug experiences must\nbe reported on a quarterly or yearly basis.6 §314.80(c)(2).\nGeneric manufacturers must also submit to the FDA an\nannual report summarizing “significant new information\nfrom the previous year that might affect the safety, ef\nfectiveness, or labeling of the drug product,” including a\n“description of actions the [manufacturer] has taken or\nintends to take as a result of this new information.”\n§314.81(b)(2)(i); see also §314.98(c).\n   Generic manufacturers, the majority assumes, also bear\nresponsibility under federal law for monitoring the ade\nquacy of their warnings.

The FDA\nconstrues this regulation to oblige generic manufacturers\n“to seek to revise their labeling and provide FDA with\nsupporting information about risks” when they believe that\nadditional warnings are necessary.7 U. S. Brief 20.\n   The Manufacturers disagree. They read the FDA regu\nlation to require them only to ensure that their labels\nmatch the brand-name labels. See Brief for Petitioner\nPLIVA et al. 38–41. I need not decide whether the regula\ntion in fact obliges generic manufacturers to approach the\nFDA to propose a label change. The majority assumes\nthat it does. And even if generic manufacturers do not\nhave a duty to propose label changes, two points remain\nundisputed. First, they do have a duty under federal law\n——————\n   7 The FDA’s construction of this regulation mirrors the guidance it\n\nprovided to generic manufacturers nearly 20 years ago in announcing\nthe final rule implementing the abbreviated application process for\ngeneric drugs:\n“If an ANDA [i.e., application for approval of a generic drug] applicant\nbelieves new safety information should be added to a product’s labeling,\nit should contact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling\nfor the generic and listed drugs should be revised. After approval of an\nANDA, if an ANDA holder believes that new safety information should\nbe added, it should provide adequate supporting information to FDA,\nand FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed\ndrugs should be revised.” 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (1992).\nFDA’s internal procedures recognize that the Office of Generic Drugs\nwill have to consult with other FDA components on “some labeling\nreviews.” Manual of Policies and Procedures 5200.6, p. 1 (May 9, 2001).\nConsultations involving “possible serious safety concerns” receive the\nhighest priority.

And, second, they\nmay approach the FDA to propose a label change when\nthey believe a change is required.\n                             II\n  This brings me to the Manufacturers’ pre-emption de\nfense. State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of\ndangers to users. See Hines v. Remington Arms Co., 94–\n0455, p. 10 (La. 12/8/94), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337; Frey v.\nMontgomery Ward & Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn.\n1977). The Manufacturers contend, and the majority\nagrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents’ failure-to\nwarn claims because, under federal law, the Manufac\nturers could not have provided additional warnings to\nrespondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.\nI cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility\npre-emption.\n                               A\n    Two principles guide all pre-emption analysis. First,\n“ ‘the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in\nevery pre-emption case.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996)). Sec\nond, “ ‘[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those\nin which Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the\nStates have traditionally occupied, . . . we start with the\nassumption that the historic police powers of the States\nwere not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’ ” Wyeth,\n555 U. S., at 565 (quoting Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485; some\ninternal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).\n    These principles find particular resonance in these\ncases. The States have traditionally regulated health and\nsafety matters. See id., at 485. Notwithstanding Con\ngress’ “certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort\nlitigation” against drug manufacturers, Wyeth, 555 U. S.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nat 575, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law\ntort actions against prescription drug manufacturers,\nwhether brand-name or generic. To the contrary, when\nCongress amended the FDCA in 1962 to “enlarg[e] the\nFDA’s powers to ‘protect the public health’ and ‘assure the\nsafety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,’ [it] took care\nto preserve state law.” Id., at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780);\nsee Pub. L. 87–781, §202, 76 Stat. 793 (“Nothing in the\namendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be\nconstrued as invalidating any provision of State law which\nwould be valid in the absence of such amendments un-\nless there is a direct and positive conflict between such\namendments and such provision of State law”). Notably,\nalthough Congress enacted an express pre-emption provi\nsion for medical devices in 1976, see Pub. L. 94–295, §521,\n90 Stat. 574, 21 U. S. C. §360k(a), it included no such\nprovision in the Hatch-Waxman Amendments eight years\nlater. Cf. Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 567, 574–575. Congress’\n“silence on the issue . . . is powerful evidence that [it] did\nnot intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of\nensuring drug safety and effectiveness.” Id., at 575.\n                              B\n   Federal law impliedly pre-empts state law when state\nand federal law “conflict”—i.e., when “it is impossible for a\nprivate party to comply with both state and federal law” or\nwhen state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\nCongress.” Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530\nU. S. 363, 372–373 (2000) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). The Manufacturers rely solely on the former ground\nof pre-emption.\n   Impossibility pre-emption, we have emphasized, “is a de\nmanding defense.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573.

To prevail on this defense, a defendant\nmust demonstrate that “compliance with both federal and\nstate [law] is a physical impossibility.” Florida Lime &\nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143\n(1963); see also Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. In other words,\nthere must be an “inevitable collision” between federal and\nstate law. Florida Lime, 373 U. S., at 143. “The existence\nof a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to\nwarrant” pre-emption of state law. Rice v. Norman Wil\nliams Co., 458 U.

In other words, the mere possibility of\nimpossibility is not enough.\n   The Manufacturers contend that it was impossible for\nthem to provide additional warnings to respondents Men\nsing and Demahy because federal law prohibited them\nfrom changing their labels unilaterally.8 They concede,\nhowever, that they could have asked the FDA to initiate a\nlabel change. If the FDA agreed that a label change was\nrequired, it could have asked, and indeed pressured, the\nbrand-name manufacturer to change its label, triggering\na corresponding change to the Manufacturers’ generic la\n\n——————\n  8 In its decision below, the Eighth Circuit suggested that the Manu\n\nfacturers could not show impossibility because federal law merely\npermitted them to sell generic drugs; it did not require them to do so.\nSee Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (2009) (“The generic\ndefendants were not compelled to market metoclopramide. If they\nrealized their label was insufficient but did not believe they could even\npropose a label change, they could have simply stopped selling the\nproduct”); see also Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,\n873 (2000) (describing “a case of impossibility” as one “in which state\nlaw penalizes what federal law requires” (emphasis added)).

Having failed to do so, the Manufac\nturers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without\nfurther factual development) to demonstrate that it was\nimpossible for them to comply with both federal and state\nlaw. At most, they have demonstrated only “a hypotheti\ncal or potential conflict.” Rice, 458 U. S., at 659.\n  Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact\nthat they cannot change their labels unilaterally—which\ndistinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer\ndefendant in Wyeth. They correctly point out that in\nWyeth we concluded that the FDA’s CBE regulation au\nthorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before\nreceiving agency approval of its supplemental application\ndescribing the label change. 555 U. S., at 568–571; see\nalso 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6). But the defendant’s label\nchange was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA\nretained “authority to reject labeling changes made pur\nsuant to the CBE regulation.” Wyeth, 555 U.

See Pub. L. 110–85, §901, 121\nStat. 924–926, 21 U. S. C. §355(o)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III). It did, how\never, have the equally significant authority to withdraw the brand-name\nmanufacturer’s permission to market its drug if the manufacturer\nrefused to make a requested labeling change. See 21 U. S. C. §355(e)\n(2006 ed.); 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3).\n   10 A brand-name manufacturer’s ability to comply with a state-law\n\nduty to warn would depend on its own unilateral actions only during\nthe period after it should have changed its label but before the FDA\n12                    PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nFDA approval of the label change did not make compliance\nwith federal and state law impossible in every case. In\nstead, because the defendant bore the burden to show\nimpossibility, we required it to produce “clear evidence\nthat the FDA would not have approved a change to [the]\nlabel.” Ibid.\n   I would apply the same approach in these cases. State\nlaw, respondents allege, required the Manufacturers to\nprovide a strengthened warning about the dangers of\nlong-term metoclopramide use.11 Just like the brand-name\nmanufacturer in Wyeth, the Manufacturers had available\nto them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their\nstate-law duty to warn. Federal law thus “accommodated”\nthe Manufacturers’ state-law duties. See ante, at 18, n. 8.\nIt was not necessarily impossible for the Manufacturers to\ncomply with both federal and state law because, had they\napproached the FDA, the FDA may well have agreed that\na label change was necessary. Accordingly, as in Wyeth, I\nwould require the Manufacturers to show that the FDA\nwould not have approved a proposed label change. They\nhave not made such a showing: They do “not argue that\n[they] attempted to give the kind of warning required by\n[state law] but [were] prohibited from doing so by the\nFDA.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 572.\n   This is not to say that generic manufacturers could\nnever show impossibility. If a generic-manufacturer de\nfendant proposed a label change to the FDA but the FDA\nrejected the proposal, it would be impossible for that\ndefendant to comply with a state-law duty to warn. Like\nwise, impossibility would be established if the FDA had\n——————\nwould have approved or disapproved the label change. The claim in\nWyeth does not appear to have arisen during that period.\n  11 Respondents’ state-law claim is not that the Manufacturers were\n\nrequired to ask the FDA for assistance in changing the labels; the role\nof the FDA arises only as a result of the Manufacturers’ pre-emption\ndefense.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot yet responded to a generic manufacturer’s request for\na label change at the time a plaintiff’s injuries arose. A\ngeneric manufacturer might also show that the FDA had\nitself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in\nlight of the evidence on which a plaintiff’s claim rests but\nhad decided to leave the warnings as is. (The Manufac\nturers make just such an argument in these cases. See,\ne.g., Brief for Petitioner Actavis et al. 11.) But these are\nquestions of fact to be established through discovery.\nBecause the burden of proving impossibility falls on the\ndefendant, I would hold that federal law does not render\nit impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with\na state-law duty to warn as a categorical matter.\n   This conclusion flows naturally from the overarching prin\nciples governing our pre-emption doctrine. See supra,\nat 8. Our “respect for the States as ‘independent sover\neigns in our federal system’ leads us to assume that ‘Con\ngress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of\naction.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr,\n518 U. S., at 485). It is for this reason that we hold defen\ndants asserting impossibility to a “demanding” standard.\nWyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. This presumption against pre\nemption has particular force when the Federal Govern\nment has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying\nwith state law, even when that mechanism requires fed\neral agency action. (The presumption has even greater\nforce when federal law requires defendants to invoke that\nmechanism, as the majority assumes in these cases.) In\nsuch circumstances, I would hold, defendants will usually\nbe unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility\nif they have not even attempted to employ that mecha\nnism. Any other approach threatens to infringe the\nStates’ authority over traditional matters of state inter\nest—such as the failure-to-warn claims here—when Con\ngress expressed no intent to pre-empt state law.\n14                  PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n  The majority concedes that the Manufacturers might\nhave been able to accomplish under federal law what state\nlaw requires. Ante, at 12–13. To reach the conclusion that\nthe Manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their bur\nden to show impossibility, the majority invents a new pre\nemption rule: “The question for ‘impossibility’ is whether\nthe private party could independently do under federal\nlaw what state law requires of it.” Ante, at 13 (empha-\nsis added). Because the Manufacturers could not have\nchanged their labels without the exercise of judgment by\nthe FDA, the majority holds, compliance with both state\nand federal law was impossible in these cases.12\n  The majority’s new test has no basis in our precedents.\nThe majority cites only Wyeth in support of its test. As\ndiscussed above, however, Wyeth does not stand for the\nproposition that it is impossible to comply with both fed\neral and state law whenever federal agency approval is\nrequired. To the contrary, label changes by brand-name\nmanufacturers such as Wyeth are subject to FDA review\nand acceptance. See supra, at 11–12. And, even if Wyeth\ncould be characterized as turning on the fact that the\nbrand-name manufacturer could change its label unilater\nally, the possibility of unilateral action was, at most, a\nsufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense\nin that case. Wyeth did not hold that unilateral action is a\nnecessary condition in every case.\n——————\n  12 These cases do not involve a situation where a brand-name\n\nmanufacturer itself produces generic drugs. See Okie, Multinational\nMedicines—Ensuring Drug Quality in an Era of Global Manufactur\ning, 361 N. Eng. J. Med. 737, 738 (2009); see also GPhA, Frequently\nAsked Questions About Generics, http://www.gphaonline.org/about\ngpha/about-generics/faq (“Brand-name companies make about half of\ngeneric drugs”). In that case, the manufacturer could independently\nchange the brand-name label under the CBE regulation, triggering a\ncorresponding change to its own generic label.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            15\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   With so little support in our case law, the majority un\nderstandably turns to other rationales. None of the\nrationales that it offers, however, makes any sense. First,\nit offers a reductio ad absurdum: If the possibility of FDA\napproval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in\nthese cases, it warns, as a “logical conclusion” so too would\nbe the possibility that the FDA might rewrite its regula\ntions or that Congress might amend the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments. Ante, at 14. The logic of this conclusion\nescapes me. Conflict analysis necessarily turns on exist\ning law. It thus would be ridiculous to conclude that\nfederal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the\ndefendant could have asked a federal agency or Congress\nto change the law. Here, by contrast, the Manufacturers’\ncompliance with their state-law duty to warn did not re\nquire them to ask for a change in federal law, as the\nmajority itself recognizes. See ante, at 13 (“[F]ederal law\nwould permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state\nlabeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the\nbrand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label\nto do so”). The FDA already afforded them a mechanism\nfor attempting to comply with their state-law duties.\nIndeed, the majority assumes that FDA regulations re\nquired the Manufacturers to request a label change when\nthey had “reasonable evidence of an association of a seri\nous hazard with a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).\n   Second, the majority suggests that any other approach\nwould render conflict pre-emption “illusory” and “meaning\nless.” Ante, at 14. It expresses concern that, without a\nrobust view of what constitutes conflict, the Supremacy\nClause would not have “any force” except in cases of ex\npress pre-emption. Ibid. To the extent the majority’s\npurported concern is driven by its reductio ad absurdum,\nsee ante, at 14, n. 6, that concern is itself illusory, for the\nreasons just stated. To the extent the majority is con\ncerned that our traditionally narrow view of what consti\n16                     PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption\nas a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no\nsense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict pre\nemption may be found, even absent impossibility, where\nstate law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of\nCongress.” Crosby, 530 U. S., at 373 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor\nCo., 529 U. S. 861, 886 (2000); Barnett Bank of Marion\nCty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 31 (1996); Hines v.\nDavidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). The majority’s ex\npansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to pre\nvent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.13\n    Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory\nthat the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to\noperate as a so-called non obstante provision. See ante, at\n15–17 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225\n(2000)). According to the plurality, non obstante provi\nsions in statutes “instruc[t] courts not to apply the general\npresumption against implied repeals.” Ante, at 15 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 16 (stating\nthat when a statute contains a non obstante provision,\n“ ‘courts will be less inclined against recognizing repug\nnancy in applying such statutes’ ” (quoting J. Sutherland,\nStatutes and Statutory Construction §147, p. 199 (1891)).\nFrom this understanding of the Supremacy Clause, the\nplurality extrapolates the principle that “courts should not\nstrain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly\n——————\n  13 JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s opinion, has previously ex\npressed the view that obstacle pre-emption is inconsistent with the\nConstitution.

S. 555, 604 (2009) (opinion concurring in\njudgment). That position, however, has not been accepted by this\nCourt, and it thus should not justify the majority’s novel expansion of\nimpossibility pre-emption.\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconflicting state law.” Ante, at 15.\n   This principle would have been news to the Congress\nthat enacted the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984:\nOur precedents hold just the opposite. For more than half\na century, we have directed courts to presume that con\ngressional action does not supersede “the historic police\npowers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and\nmanifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator\nCorp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see also Gade, 505 U. S.,\nat 111–112 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). We apply this presumption against\npre-emption both where Congress has spoken to the pre\nemption question and where it has not. See Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at 566, n. 3. In the context of express pre-emption,\nwe read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre\nempt state law. See Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S.\n70, 77 (2008) (“[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause\nis susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts\nordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ”\n(quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431,\n449 (2005))); see also Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\nU. S. 504, 518 (1992). And, when the claim is that federal\nlaw impliedly pre-empts state law, we require a “strong”\nshowing of a conflict “to overcome the presumption that\nstate and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist\nwith federal regulation.” Hillsborough County v. Auto\nmated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 716\n(1985).\n   The plurality’s new theory of the Supremacy Clause is a\ndirect assault on these precedents.14 Whereas we have\n——————\n  14 The author of the law review article proposing this theory of the\n\nSupremacy Clause acknowledges as much. See Nelson, Preemption, 86\nVa. L. Rev. 225, 304 (2000) (“The non obstante provision rejects an\nartificial presumption that Congress did not intend to contradict any\nstate laws and that federal statutes must therefore be harmonized with\nstate law”). The plurality, on the other hand, carefully avoids discuss\n18                   PLIVA, INC. v.

And whereas we have long required evidence of a\n“clear and manifest” purpose to pre-empt, Rice, 331 U. S.,\nat 230, the plurality now instructs courts to “look no fur\nther than the ordinary meaning of federal law” before\nconcluding that Congress must have intended to cast aside\nstate law, ante, at 16 (internal quotation marks and al\nteration omitted).\n   That the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this\nnovel theory of the Supremacy Clause—a theory advo\ncated by no party or amici in these cases—is telling.\nProper application of the longstanding presumption\nagainst pre-emption compels the conclusion that federal\nlaw does not render compliance with state law impossible\nmerely because it requires an actor to seek federal agency\napproval. When federal law provides actors with a mech\nanism for attempting to comply with their state-law\nduties, “respect for the States as ‘independent sovereigns\nin our federal system’ ” should require those actors to\nattempt to comply with state law before being heard to\ncomplain that compliance with both laws was impossible.\nWyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr, 518\nU. S., at 485).\n                             III\n  Today’s decision leads to so many absurd consequences\nthat I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended\nto pre-empt state law in these cases.\n  First, the majority’s pre-emption analysis strips generic\n\n—————— \n\ning the ramifications of its new theory for the longstanding presump\n\ntion against pre-emption. \n\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 449. Given the longstanding\nexistence of product liability actions, including for failure\nto warn, “[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would,\nwithout comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\nfor those injured by illegal conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S.,\nat 251; see also Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (noting our previously expressed\n“doubt that Congress would quietly preempt product\nliability claims without providing a federal substitute”).\nIn concluding that Congress silently immunized generic\nmanufacturers from all failure-to-warn claims, the major\nity disregards our previous hesitance to infer congres\nsional intent to effect such a sweeping change in tradi\ntional state-law remedies.\n   As the majority itself admits, a drug consumer’s right\nto compensation for inadequate warnings now turns on\nthe happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her pre\nscription with a brand-name drug or a generic. If a con\nsumer takes a brand-name drug, she can sue the manufac\nturer for inadequate warnings under our opinion in Wyeth.\nIf, however, she takes a generic drug, as occurs 75 percent\nof the time, she now has no right to sue. The majority\noffers no reason to think—apart from its new articulation\nof the impossibility standard—that Congress would have\nintended such an arbitrary distinction. In some States,\npharmacists must dispense generic drugs absent instruc\ntion to the contrary from a consumer’s physician. Even\nwhen consumers can request brand-name drugs, the price\nof the brand-name drug or the consumers’ insurance plans\nmay make it impossible to do so. As a result, in many\ncases, consumers will have no ability to preserve their\nstate-law right to recover for injuries caused by inade\n20                    PLIVA, INC. v.

As we\nexplained in Wyeth, “[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown\ndrug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufactur\ners to disclose safety risks promptly.” 555 U. S., at 579.\nThus, we recognized, “state law offers an additional, and\nimportant, layer of consumer protection that complements\nFDA regulation.” Ibid. Today’s decision eliminates the\ntraditional state-law incentives for generic manufacturers\nto monitor and disclose safety risks. When a generic drug\nhas a brand-name equivalent on the market, the brand\nname manufacturer will remain incentivized to uncover\nsafety risks. But brand-name manufacturers often leave\nthe market once generic versions are available, see supra,\nat 4–5, meaning that there will be no manufacturer sub\nject to failure-to-warn liability. As to those generic drugs,\nthere will be no “additional . . . layer of consumer protec\ntion.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 579.\n   Finally, today’s decision undoes the core principle of\nthe Hatch-Waxman Amendments that generic and brand\nname drugs are the “same” in nearly all respects.15 See\nBrief for Rep. Henry A. Waxman as Amicus Curiae 9.\nThe majority pins the expansion of the generic drug market\non “the special, and different, regulation of generic drugs,”\nwhich allows generic manufacturers to produce their\ndrugs more cheaply. Ante, at 19. This tells only half the\nstory. The expansion of the market for generic drugs has\nalso flowed from the increased acceptance of, and trust in,\n——————\n  15 According to the GPhA, both the FDA and the generic drug indus\n\ntry “spend millions of dollars each year . . . seeking to reassure consum\ners that affordable generic drugs really are—as federal law compels\nthem to be—the same as their pricier brand-name counterparts.” Brief\nfor GPhA as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. in Nos. 09–993, 09–1039,\npp. 2–3.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Consumers of\nbrand-name drugs can sue manufacturers for inadequate\nwarnings; consumers of generic drugs cannot. These\ndivergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer\ndemand for generics, at least among consumers who can\nafford brand-name drugs. They may pose “an ethical\ndilemma” for prescribing physicians. Brief for American\nMedical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29. And they\nmay well cause the States to rethink their longstanding\nefforts to promote generic use through generic substitution\nlaws. See Brief for National Conference of State Legisla\ntors as Amicus Curiae 15 (state generic substitution laws\n“have proceeded on the premise that . . . generic drugs are\nnot, from citizens’ perspective, materially different from\nbrand ones, except for the lower price”). These conse\nquences are directly at odds with the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments’ goal of increasing consumption of generic\ndrugs.\n  Nothing in the Court’s opinion convinces me that, in\nenacting the requirement that generic labels match their\ncorresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended\nthese absurd results. The Court certainly has not shown\nthat such was the “clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added). To the contrary, because fed\neral law affords generic manufacturers a mechanism for\nattempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn,\nI would hold that federal law does not categorically\npre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic\nmanufacturers. Especially in light of the presumption\nagainst pre-emption, the burden should fall on generic\nmanufacturers to show that compliance was impossible on\nthe particular facts of their case.

Argued March 30, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011*\nFive years after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first ap\n  proved metoclopramide, a drug commonly used to treat digestive\n  tract problems, under the brand name Reglan, generic manufacturers\n  such as petitioners also began producing the drug. Because of accu\n  mulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause\n  tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for\n  the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most re\n  cently in 2009.\n    Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both\n  received the generic drug from their pharmacists. After taking the\n  drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskine\n  sia. In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the\n  generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they\n  took (Manufacturers). Each respondent alleged, inter alia, that long\n  term metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufac\n  turers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate\n  warning labels. In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal\n  statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by re\n  quiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopra\n  mide as was mandated at the time for Reglan. The Fifth and Eighth\n  Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents’ claims\n  were not pre-empted.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.\n——————\n  * Together with No. 09–1039, Actavis Elizabeth, LLC v.

Pp. 4–14, 17–20.\n     (a) Because pre-emption analysis requires a comparison between\n  federal and state law, the Court begins by identifying the state tort\n  duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufac\n  turers. Pp. 4–10.\n       (1) State tort law requires a manufacturer that is, or should be,\n  aware of its drug’s danger to label it in a way that renders it rea\n  sonably safe. Respondents pleaded that the Manufacturers knew, or\n  should have known, both that the long-term use of their products car\n  ried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not\n  adequately warn of that risk. Taking these allegations as true, the\n  state-law duty required the Manufacturers to use a different,\n  stronger label than the one they actually used. Pp. 4–5.\n       (2) On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by\n  the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing\n  their generic drugs’ safety labels. A manufacturer seeking federal\n  approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effec\n  tive and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate. Although\n  the same rules originally applied to all drugs, the 1984 law commonly\n  called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allows a generic drug manu\n  facturer to gain FDA approval simply by showing that its drug is\n  equivalent to an already-approved brand-name drug, and that the\n  safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that\n  approved for the brand-name drug. Respondents contend that fed\n  eral law nevertheless provides avenues through which the Manufac\n  turers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to pre\n  vent the injuries here. These include: (1) the FDA’s “changes-being\n  effected” (CBE) process, which permits drug manufacturers, without\n  preapproval, to add or strengthen a warning label; and (2) sending\n  “Dear Doctor” letters providing additional warnings to prescribing\n  physicians and other healthcare professionals. However, the FDA\n  denies that the Manufacturers could have used either of these proc\n  esses to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels. The Court de\n  fers to the FDA’s views because they are not plainly erroneous or in\n  consistent with the regulations, and there is no other reason to doubt\n  that they reflect the FDA’s fair and considered judgment. Auer v.\n  Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462. Assuming, without deciding, that\n  the FDA is correct that federal law nevertheless required the Manu\n  facturers to ask for the agency’s assistance in convincing the brand\n  name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, the Court turns to the\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npre-emption question. Pp. 5–10.\n   (b) Where state and federal law directly conflict, state law must\ngive way. See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583. Such a con\nflict exists where it is “impossible for a private party to comply with\nboth state and federal requirements.” Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,\n514 U. S. 280, 287. Pp. 11–14, 17–20.\n      (1) The Court finds impossibility here. If the Manufacturers had\nindependently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty to\nattach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide, they would have\nviolated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same\nas the corresponding brand-name drug labels. Thus, it was impossi\nble for them to comply with both state and federal law. And even if\nthey had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA help in strength\nening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty ex\nists, they would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty. State\nlaw demanded a safer label; it did not require communication with\nthe FDA about the possibility of a safer label. Pp. 11–12.\n      (2) The Court rejects the argument that the Manufacturers’ pre\nemption defense fails because they failed to ask the FDA for help in\nchanging the corresponding brand-name label. The proper question\nfor “impossibility” analysis is whether the private party could inde\npendently do under federal law what state law requires of it. See\nWyeth, supra, at 573. Accepting respondents’ argument would render\nconflict pre-emption largely meaningless by making most conflicts be\ntween state and federal law illusory. In these cases, it is possible\nthat, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might\nhave eventually been able to strengthen their warning label. But it\nis also possible that they could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret\nits regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process\nto them, persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations\nentirely, or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments. If these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and\nstate law from conflicting, it is unclear when, outside of express pre\nemption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force. That Clause—\nwhich makes federal law “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any\nThing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not\nwithstanding,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2—cannot be read to permit\nan approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but\nmeaningless. Here, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot\nsatisfy its state duties without the Federal Government’s special\npermission and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of\njudgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently sat\nisfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes. Pp. 12–14, 17.\n      (3) Wyeth is not to the contrary. The Court there held that a\n4                       PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure\n    to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it\n    was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and fed\n    eral law under the FDA’s CBE regulation. 555 U. S., at 572–573.\n    The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug\n    manufacturers differ, by Congress’ design, from those applicable to\n    generic drug manufacturers. And different federal statutes and regu\n    lations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results. This\n    Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create simi\n    lar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme.

MENSING \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the move­\nment of food through the digestive system. The Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopra­\nmide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980. Five\nyears later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto­\nclopramide. The drug is commonly used to treat diges-\ntive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and\ngastroesophageal reflux disorder.\n   Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopra­\nmide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurologi­\ncal disorder. Studies have shown that up to 29% of pa­\ntients who take metoclopramide for several years develop\nthis condition. McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F. 3d 364, 370,\nn. 5 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &\nMackey, Tardive Dyskinesia Risks and Metoclopramide\nUse Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cis­\napride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (not­\ning 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia\nreported to the FDA’s adverse event reporting system by\nmid-2003).\n   Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been\nstrengthened and clarified several times. In 1985, the\nlabel was modified to warn that “tardive dyskinesia . . .\nmay develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,”\nand the drug’s package insert added that “[t]herapy longer\nthan 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be\nrecommended.” Physician’s Desk Reference 1635–1636\n(41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al.\n21–22 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief). In 2004, the brand­\nname Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA ap­\nproved, a label change to add that “[t]herapy should not\nexceed 12 weeks in duration.” Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter U. S. Brief). And in 2009,\nthe FDA ordered a black box warning—its strongest—\nwhich states: “Treatment with metoclopramide can cause\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is\noften irreversible. . . . Treatment with metoclopramide\nfor longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare\ncases.” See Physician’s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed.\n2011).\n  Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in\nthese consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001\nand 2002, respectively. Both received generic metoclo­\npramide from their pharmacists. After taking the drug\nas prescribed for several years, both women developed\ntardive dyskinesia.\n  In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the ge­\nneric drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopra­\nmide they took (Manufacturers). Each alleged, as relevant\nhere, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tar­\ndive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable\nunder state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and\nLouisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels.\nThey claimed that “despite mounting evidence that long\nterm metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskine­\nsia far greater than that indicated on the label,” none of\nthe Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately\nwarn of that danger. Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d\n603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also Demahy v. Actavis, Inc., 593\nF. 3d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).\n  In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law\npre-empted the state tort claims. According to the Manu­\nfacturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required\nthem to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their\nbrand-name counterparts. This means, they argued, that\nit was impossible to simultaneously comply with both\nfederal law and any state tort-law duty that required them\nto use a different label.\n  The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits\nrejected the Manufacturers’ arguments and held that Men­\nsing and Demahy’s claims were not pre-empted. See\n4                 PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n588 F. 3d, at 614; 593 F. 3d, at 449. We granted certiorari,\n562 U. S. ___ (2010), consolidated the cases, and now\nreverse each.\n                             II\n  Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and\nstate law. We therefore begin by identifying the state tort\nduties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the\nManufacturers.\n                             A\n   It is undisputed that Minnesota and Louisiana tort law\nrequire a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of\nits product’s danger to label that product in a way that\nrenders it reasonably safe. Under Minnesota law, which\napplies to Mensing’s lawsuit, “where the manufacturer . . .\nof a product has actual or constructive knowledge of\ndanger to users, the . . . manufacturer has a duty to give\nwarning of such dangers.” Frey v. Montgomery Ward &\nCo., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). Similarly, under\nLouisiana law applicable to Demahy’s lawsuit, “a manu­\nfacturer’s duty to warn includes a duty to provide ade­\nquate instructions for safe use of a product.” Stahl v.\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 283 F. 3d 254, 269–270\n(CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:2800.57 (West\n2009). In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on\nthe manufacturer. See Marks v. OHMEDA, Inc., 2003–\n1446, pp. 8–9 (La. App. 3/31/04), 871 So. 2d 1148, 1155;\nGray v. Badger Min. Corp., 676 N. W. 2d 268, 274 (Minn.\n2004).\n   Mensing and Demahy have pleaded that the Manufac­\nturers knew or should have known of the high risk of\ntardive dyskinesia inherent in the long-term use of their\nproduct. They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers\nknew or should have known that their labels did not ade­\nquately warn of that risk. App. 437–438, 67–69, 94–96.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThe parties do not dispute that, if these allegations are\ntrue, state law required the Manufacturers to use a differ­\nent, safer label.\n                              B\n  Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling\nrequirements. We begin with what is not in dispute.\nUnder the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. §301 et\nseq., a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a\nnew drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that\nthe proposed label is accurate and adequate.1 See, e.g.,\n21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n567 (2009). Meeting those requirements involves costly\nand lengthy clinical testing. §§355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D.\nBeers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA\nApproval Requirements §2.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).\n  Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs. In 1984,\nhowever, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and\nPatent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly\ncalled the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Under this law,\n“generic drugs” can gain FDA approval simply by showing\nequivalence to a reference listed drug that has already\nbeen approved by the FDA.2 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A).\nThis allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs in­\nexpensively, without duplicating the clinical trials already\nperformed on the equivalent brand-name drug. A generic\ndrug application must also “show that the [safety and\n——————\n  1 All relevant events in these cases predate the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration Amendments Act of 2007, 121 Stat. 823. We therefore\nrefer exclusively to the pre-2007 statutes and regulations and express\nno view on the impact of the 2007 Act.\n  2 As we use it here, “generic drug” refers to a drug designed to be a\n\ncopy of a reference listed drug (typically a brand-name drug), and thus\nidentical in active ingredients, safety, and efficacy. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U. S. 453, 454–455 (1983); 21 CFR\n§314.3(b) (2006) (defining “reference listed drug”).\n6                      PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nefficacy] labeling proposed . . . is the same as the labeling\napproved for the [brand-name] drug.” §355(j)(2)(A)(v); see\nalso §355(j)(4)(G); Beers §§3.01, 3.03[A].\n  As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufactur­\ners have different federal drug labeling duties. A brand­\nname manufacturer seeking new drug approval is respon­\nsible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label. See, e.g.,\n21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth, supra, at 570–571. A\nmanufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other\nhand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is\nthe same as the brand name’s. See, e.g., §355(j)(2)(A)(v);\n§355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).\n  The parties do not disagree. What is in dispute is\nwhether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may\nchange their labels after initial FDA approval. Mensing\nand Demahy contend that federal law provided several\navenues through which the Manufacturers could have\naltered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the\ninjuries here. The FDA, however, tells us that it inter­\nprets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a\nbrand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the\nsame—thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing\nfederal duty of “sameness.” U. S. Brief 16; see also 57 Fed.\nReg. 17961 (1992) (“[T]he [generic drug’s] labeling must\nbe the same as the listed drug product’s labeling because\nthe listed drug product is the basis for [generic drug] ap­\nproval”). The FDA’s views are “controlling unless plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]” or there\nis any other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA’s\nfair and considered judgment.

S. ____ (2011)               7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                              1\n   First, Mensing and Demahy urge that the FDA’s\n“changes-being-effected” (CBE) process allowed the Manu­\nfacturers to change their labels when necessary. See Brief\nfor Respondents 33–35; see also 593 F. 3d, at 439–444;\nGaeta v. Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Co., 630 F. 3d 1225,\n1231 (CA9 2011); Foster v. American Home Prods. Corp.,\n29 F. 3d 165, 170 (CA4 1994). The CBE process permits\ndrug manufacturers to “add or strengthen a contraindica­\ntion, warning, [or] precaution,” 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A)\n(2006), or to “add or strengthen an instruction about dos­\nage and administration that is intended to increase the\nsafe use of the drug product,” §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). When\nmaking labeling changes using the CBE process, drug man­\nufacturers need not wait for preapproval by the FDA,\nwhich ordinarily is necessary to change a label. Wyeth,\nsupra, at 568. They need only simultaneously file a sup­\nplemental application with the FDA. 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6).\n   The FDA denies that the Manufacturers could have\nused the CBE process to unilaterally strengthen their\nwarning labels. The agency interprets the CBE regulation\nto allow changes to generic drug labels only when a ge­\nneric drug manufacturer changes its label to match an\nupdated brand-name label or to follow the FDA’s instruc­\ntions. U. S. Brief 15, 16, n. 7 (interpreting 21 CFR\n§314.94(a)(8)(iv)); U. S. Brief 16, n. 8. The FDA argues\nthat CBE changes unilaterally made to strengthen a\ngeneric drug’s warning label would violate the statutes\nand regulations requiring a generic drug’s label to match\nits brand-name counterpart’s. Id., at 15–16; see also\n21 U. S. C. §355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8)(iii),\n314.150(b)(10) (approval may be withdrawn if the generic\ndrug’s label “is no longer consistent with that for [the\n—————— \n\nultimate conclusion about whether state law should be pre-empted.\n\nWyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 576 (2009).\n\n8                 PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrand-name]”).\n  We defer to the FDA’s interpretation of its CBE and\ngeneric labeling regulations.     Although Mensing and\nDemahy offer other ways to interpret the regulations, see\nBrief for Respondents 33–35, we do not find the agency’s\ninterpretation “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulation.” Auer, supra, at 461 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Nor do Mensing and Demahy suggest there is\nany other reason to doubt the agency’s reading. We there­\nfore conclude that the CBE process was not open to the\nManufacturers for the sort of change required by state\nlaw.\n                              2\n   Next, Mensing and Demahy contend that the Manufac­\nturers could have used “Dear Doctor” letters to send ad­\nditional warnings to prescribing physicians and other\nhealthcare professionals. See Brief for Respondents 36; 21\nCFR §200.5. Again, the FDA disagrees, and we defer to\nthe agency’s views.\n   The FDA argues that Dear Doctor letters qualify as\n“labeling.” U. S. Brief 18; see also 21 U. S. C. §321(m); 21\nCFR §202.1(l)(2). Thus, any such letters must be “consis­\ntent with and not contrary to [the drug’s] approved . . .\nlabeling.” 21 CFR §201.100(d)(1). A Dear Doctor letter\nthat contained substantial new warning information\nwould not be consistent with the drug’s approved labeling.\nMoreover, if generic drug manufacturers, but not the\nbrand-name manufacturer, sent such letters, that would\ninaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the\nbrand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly\n“misleading.” U. S. Brief 19; see 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3)\n(FDA may withdraw approval of a generic drug if “the\nlabeling of the drug . . . is false or misleading in any\nparticular”).\n   As with the CBE regulation, we defer to the FDA.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMensing and Demahy offer no argument that the FDA’s\ninterpretation is plainly erroneous. See Auer, 519 U. S., at\n461. Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not\npermit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings\nthrough Dear Doctor letters.\n                              3\n   Though the FDA denies that the Manufacturers could\nhave used the CBE process or Dear Doctor letters to\nstrengthen their warning labels, the agency asserts that\na different avenue existed for changing generic drug la­\nbels. According to the FDA, the Manufacturers could have\nproposed—indeed, were required to propose—stronger\nwarning labels to the agency if they believed such warn­\nings were needed. U. S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961. If\nthe FDA had agreed that a label change was necessary,\nit would have worked with the brand-name manufacturer\nto create a new label for both the brand-name and generic\ndrug. Ibid.\n   The agency traces this duty to 21 U. S. C. §352(f)(2),\nwhich provides that a drug is “misbranded . . . [u]nless its\nlabeling bears . . . adequate warnings against . . . unsafe\ndosage or methods or duration of administration or appli­\ncation, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the\nprotection of users.” See U. S. Brief 12. By regulation, the\nFDA has interpreted that statute to require that “labeling\nshall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is\nreasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard\nwith a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).\n   According to the FDA, these requirements apply to ge­\nneric drugs. As it explains, a “ ‘central premise of fed-\neral drug regulation is that the manufacturer bears re­\nsponsibility for the content of its label at all times.’ ” U. S.\nBrief 12–13 (quoting Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 570–571). The\nFDA reconciles this duty to have adequate and accurate\nlabeling with the duty of sameness in the following way:\n10                PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGeneric drug manufacturers that become aware of safety\nproblems must ask the agency to work toward strengthen­\ning the label that applies to both the generic and brand­\nname equivalent drug. U. S. Brief 20.\n  The Manufacturers and the FDA disagree over whether\nthis alleged duty to request a strengthened label actually\nexisted. The FDA argues that it explained this duty in the\npreamble to its 1992 regulations implementing the Hatch-\nWaxman Amendments. Ibid.; see 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (“If\na [generic drug manufacturer] believes new safety infor­\nmation should be added to a product’s labeling, it should\ncontact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the label­\ning for the generic and listed drugs should be revised”).\nThe Manufacturers claim that the FDA’s 19-year-old\nstatement did not create a duty, and that there is no evi­\ndence of any generic drug manufacturer ever acting pur­\nsuant to any such duty. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–24;\nReply Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al. 18–22. Because we\nultimately find pre-emption even assuming such a duty\nexisted, we do not resolve the matter.\n                             C\n  To summarize, the relevant state and federal require­\nments are these: State tort law places a duty directly on\nall drug manufacturers to adequately and safely label\ntheir products. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s allegations\nas true, this duty required the Manufacturers to use a\ndifferent, stronger label than the label they actually used.\nFederal drug regulations, as interpreted by the FDA,\nprevented the Manufacturers from independently chang­\ning their generic drugs’ safety labels. But, we assume,\nfederal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for\nFDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufac­\nturer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding\ngeneric drug manufacturers could do so as well. We turn\nnow to the question of pre-emption.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

See post, at 9, 19 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\ndissenting). Nor do they contain any saving clause to expressly pre­\nserve state tort claims. Cf. Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America,\nInc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(discussing the saving clause in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle\nSafety Act of 1966, 49 U. S. C. §30103(e)). Although an express state­\nment on pre-emption is always preferable, the lack of such a statement\ndoes not end our inquiry. Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, the\nabsence of express pre-emption is not a reason to find no conflict pre­\nemption. See post, at 19.\n12                PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlabels to satisfy their state-law duty, they would have\nviolated federal law. Taking Mensing and Demahy’s\nallegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufac­\nturers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic meto­\nclopramide. Federal law, however, demanded that ge­\nneric drug labels be the same at all times as the corres­\nponding brand-name drug labels. See, e.g., 21 CFR\n§314.150(b)(10). Thus, it was impossible for the Manufac­\nturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change\nthe label and their federal law duty to keep the label the\nsame.\n  The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthen­\ning the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such\na duty exists, does not change this analysis. Although\nrequesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Man­\nufacturers’ federal duty, it would not have satisfied\ntheir state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling.\nState law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the\nManufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the\npossibility of a safer label. Indeed, Mensing and Demahy\ndeny that their state tort claims are based on the Manu­\nfacturers’ alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in\nchanging the labels. Brief for Respondents 53–54; cf.\nBuckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341\n(2001) (holding that federal drug and medical device laws\npre-empted a state tort-law claim based on failure to\nproperly communicate with the FDA).\n                            B\n                            1\n  Mensing and Demahy contend that, while their state­\nlaw claims do not turn on whether the Manufacturers\nasked the FDA for assistance in changing their labels, the\nManufacturers’ federal affirmative defense of pre-emption\ndoes. Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufactur­\ners had asked the FDA for help in changing the corre­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsponding brand-name label, they might eventually have\nbeen able to accomplish under federal law what state law\nrequires. That is true enough. The Manufacturers “freely\nconcede” that they could have asked the FDA for help.\nPLIVA Brief 48. If they had done so, and if the FDA\ndecided there was sufficient supporting information, and\nif the FDA undertook negotiations with the brand-name\nmanufacturer, and if adequate label changes were decided\non and implemented, then the Manufacturers would have\nstarted a Mouse Trap game that eventually led to a better\nlabel on generic metoclopramide.\n   This raises the novel question whether conflict pre­\nemption should take into account these possible actions by\nthe FDA and the brand-name manufacturer. Here, what\nfederal law permitted the Manufacturers to do could have\nchanged, even absent a change in the law itself, depending\non the actions of the FDA and the brand-name manufac­\nturer. Federal law does not dictate the text of each ge­\nneric drug’s label, but rather ties those labels to their\nbrand-name counterparts. Thus, federal law would permit\nthe Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling re­\nquirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name\nmanufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so.\n   Mensing and Demahy assert that when a private party’s\nability to comply with state law depends on approval and\nassistance from the FDA, proving pre-emption requires\nthat party to demonstrate that the FDA would not have\nallowed compliance with state law. Here, they argue, the\nManufacturers cannot bear their burden of proving impos­\nsibility because they did not even try to start the process\nthat might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer\nlabel. Brief for Respondents 47. This is a fair argument,\nbut we reject it.\n   The question for “impossibility” is whether the private\nparty could independently do under federal law what state\nlaw requires of it. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573 (finding\n14                    PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nno pre-emption where the defendant could “unilaterally”\ndo what state law required). Accepting Mensing and\nDemahy’s argument would render conflict pre-emption\nlargely meaningless because it would make most conflicts\nbetween state and federal law illusory. We can often\nimagine that a third party or the Federal Government\nmight do something that makes it lawful for a private\nparty to accomplish under federal law what state law\nrequires of it. In these cases, it is certainly possible that,\nhad the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they\nmight have eventually been able to strengthen their warn­\ning label. Of course, it is also possible that the Manufac­\nturers could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its\nregulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE\nprocess to them. Following Mensing and Demahy’s argu­\nment to its logical conclusion, it is also possible that,\nby asking, the Manufacturers could have persuaded the\nFDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or\ntalked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments.\n  If these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state\nlaw from conflicting for Supremacy Clause purposes, it\nis unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Su­\npremacy Clause would have any force.6 We do not read\nthe Supremacy Clause to permit an approach to pre­\nemption that renders conflict pre-emption all but mean­\ningless. The Supremacy Clause, on its face, makes federal\nlaw “the supreme Law of the Land” even absent an ex­\npress statement by Congress. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.\n——————\n  6 The dissent asserts that we are forgetting “purposes-and-objectives”\n\npre-emption. Post, at 15–16. But as the dissent acknowledges, pur­\nposes-and-objectives pre-emption is a form of conflict pre-emption.\nPost, at 9, 16. If conflict pre-emption analysis must take into account\nhypothetical federal action, including possible changes in Acts of\nCongress, then there is little reason to think that pre-emption based on\nthe purposes and objectives of Congress would survive either.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Ibid.; see Nelson,\nPreemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 234 (2000); id., at 252–253\n(describing discussion of the Supremacy Clause in state\nratification debates as concerning whether federal law\ncould repeal state law, or vice versa). The phrase “any\n[state law] to the Contrary notwithstanding” is a non ob\nstante provision. Id., at 238–240, nn. 43–45. Eighteenth­\ncentury legislatures used non obstante provisions to\nspecify the degree to which a new statute was meant to\nrepeal older, potentially conflicting statutes in the same\nfield. Id., at 238–240 (citing dozens of statutes from the\n1770’s and 1780’s with similar provisions). A non obstante\nprovision “in a new statute acknowledged that the statute\nmight contradict prior law and instructed courts not to\napply the general presumption against implied repeals.”\nId., at 241–242; 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the\nLaw 639 (4th ed. 1778) (“Although two Acts of Parliament\nare seemingly repugnant, yet if there be no Clause of non\nObstante in the latter, they shall if possible have such\nConstruction, that the latter may not be a Repeal of the\nformer by Implication”). The non obstante provision in the\nSupremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law\nshould be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state\nlaw.\n   Further, the provision suggests that courts should not\nstrain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly\nconflicting state law. Traditionally, courts went to great\nlengths attempting to harmonize conflicting statutes, in\norder to avoid implied repeals. Warder v. Arell, 2 Va. 282,\n296 (1796) (opinion of Roane, J.)

A\nnon obstante provision thus was a useful way for legisla­\ntures to specify that they did not want courts distorting\nthe new law to accommodate the old. Nelson, supra, at\n240–242; see also J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory\nConstruction §147, p. 199 (1891) (“[W]hen there is inserted\nin a statute a provision [of non obstante] . . . . It is to be\nsupposed that courts will be less inclined against recogniz­\ning repugnancy in applying such statutes”); Weston’s Case,\n73 Eng. Rep. 780, 781 (K. B. 1576) (“[W]hen there are two\nstatutes, one in appearance crossing the other, and no\nclause of non obstante is contained in the second statute\n. . . the exposition ought to be that both should stand in\nforce”); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (J. Morgan ed.,\n10th ed. 1782) (definition of “statute,” ¶6: “[W]hen there is\na seeming variance between two statutes, and no clause of\nnon obstante in the latter, such construction shall be made\nthat both may stand”). The non obstante provision of\nhe Supremacy Clause indicates that a court need look no\nfurther than “the ordinary meanin[g]” of federal law, and\nshould not distort federal law to accommodate conflicting\nstate law. Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 588 (THOMAS, J., concur­\nring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    To consider in our pre-emption analysis the contingen­\ncies inherent in these cases—in which the Manufacturers’\nability to comply with state law depended on uncertain\nfederal agency and third-party decisions—would be incon­\nsistent with the non obstante provision of the Supremacy\nClause. The Manufacturers would be required continually\nto prove the counterfactual conduct of the FDA and brand­\nname manufacturer in order to establish the supremacy of\nfederal law. We do not think the Supremacy Clause con­\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntemplates that sort of contingent supremacy. The non\nobstante provision suggests that pre-emption analysis\nshould not involve speculation about ways in which fed­\neral agency and third-party actions could potentially\nreconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.\nWhen the “ordinary meaning” of federal law blocks a\nprivate party from independently accomplishing what\nstate law requires, that party has established pre-emption.\n                              3\n   To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently\nindependently under federal law to do what state law\nrequires may sometimes be difficult to determine. But this\nis not such a case. Before the Manufacturers could satisfy\nstate law, the FDA—a federal agency—had to undertake\nspecial effort permitting them to do so. To decide these\ncases, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy\nits state duties without the Federal Government’s special\npermission and assistance, which is dependent on the\nexercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party can­\nnot independently satisfy those state duties for pre­\nemption purposes.\n   Here, state law imposed a duty on the Manufacturers to\ntake a certain action, and federal law barred them from\ntaking that action. The only action the Manufacturers\ncould independently take—asking for the FDA’s help—is\nnot a matter of state-law concern. Mensing and Demahy’s\ntort claims are pre-empted.\n                             C\n  Wyeth is not to the contrary. In that case, as here,\nthe plaintiff contended that a drug manufacturer had\nbreached a state tort-law duty to provide an adequate\nwarning label. 555 U. S., at 559–560. The Court held that\nthe lawsuit was not pre-empted because it was possible for\nWyeth, a brand-name drug manufacturer, to comply with\n18                     PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nboth state and federal law. Id., at 572–573.7 Specifically,\nthe CBE regulation, 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii), permitted a\nbrand-name drug manufacturer like Wyeth “to unilater­\nally strengthen its warning” without prior FDA approval.\n555 U. S., at 573; cf. supra, at 7–8. Thus, the federal\nregulations applicable to Wyeth allowed the company, of\nits own volition, to strengthen its label in compliance with\nits state tort duty.8\n   We recognize that from the perspective of Mensing and\nDemahy, finding pre-emption here but not in Wyeth makes\nlittle sense. Had Mensing and Demahy taken Reglan, the\nbrand-name drug prescribed by their doctors, Wyeth would\ncontrol and their lawsuits would not be pre-empted. But\n\n——————\n   7 Wyeth also urged that state tort law “creat[ed] an unacceptable\n\n‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\nand objectives of Congress.’ ” 555 U. S., at 563–564 (quoting Hines v.\nDavidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)). The Court rejected that argu­\nment, and that type of pre-emption is not argued here. Cf. post, at 16,\nn. 13 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\n   8 The FDA, however, retained the authority to eventually rescind\n\nWyeth’s unilateral CBE changes. Accordingly, the Court noted that\nWyeth could have attempted to show, by “clear evidence,” that the FDA\nwould have rescinded any change in the label and thereby demonstrate\nthat it would in fact have been impossible to do under federal law\nwhat state law required. Wyeth, supra, at 571. Wyeth offered no such\nevidence.\n   That analysis is consistent with our holding today. The Court in\nWyeth asked what the drug manufacturer could independently do under\nfederal law, and in the absence of clear evidence that Wyeth could not\nhave accomplished what state law required of it, found no pre-emption.\nThe Wyeth Court held that, because federal law accommodated state\nlaw duties, “the possibility of impossibility” was “not enough.” Post, at\n10; see also Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982)\n(rejecting “hypothetical” impossibility). But here, “existing” federal law\ndirectly conflicts with state law. Post, at 15 (“Conflict analysis neces­\nsarily turns on existing law”). The question in these cases is not\nwhether the possibility of impossibility establishes pre-emption, but\nrather whether the possibility of possibility defeats pre-emption.

I cannot agree. We have traditionally held defen\ndants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard:\nUntil today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not\nbeen enough to establish pre-emption.\n  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits—\nand, the Court assumes, requires—generic-drug manufac\nturers to propose a label change to the FDA when they\nbelieve that their labels are inadequate. If it agrees that\nthe labels are inadequate, the FDA can initiate a change\n2                 PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto the brand-name label, triggering a corresponding\nchange to the generic labels. Once that occurs, a generic\nmanufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law\nand a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufac\nturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases,\npetitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide\n(Manufacturers), have shown only that they might have\nbeen unable to comply with both federal law and their\nstate-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and\nJulie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sus\ntain their burden.\n   The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion. It\ninvents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to\njustify its dilution of the impossibility standard. It effec\ntively rewrites our decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S.\n555 (2009), which holds that federal law does not pre-empt\nfailure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug manufac\nturers. And a plurality of the Court tosses aside our re\npeated admonition that courts should hesitate to conclude\nthat Congress intended to pre-empt state laws governing\nhealth and safety. As a result of today’s decision, whether\na consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain\nrelief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her\npharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or\ngeneric drug.

The dominant position of\ngeneric drugs in the prescription drug market is the result\nof a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.\n   In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competi-\ntion and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585—\ncommonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

R. Rep. No. 98–\n857, pt. 1, p. 14 (1984). As the majority explains, to ac\ncomplish this goal the amendments establish an abbrevi\nated application process for generic drugs. Ante, at 5–6;\nsee also 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A). The abbreviated ap\nproval process implements the amendments’ core principle\nthat generic and brand-name drugs must be the “same” in\nnearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic\nmanufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things,\nthat its product has the same active ingredients as an\napproved brand-name drug; that “the route of adminis\ntration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new\ndrug are the same” as the brand-name drug; and that its\nproduct is “bioequivalent” to the brand-name drug.\n§§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv). By eliminating the need for\ngeneric manufacturers to prove their drugs’ safety and\nefficacy independently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\nallow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market\nmuch less expensively.\n  The States have also acted to expand consumption of\nlow-cost generic drugs. In the years leading up to passage\nof the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, States enacted legis\nlation authorizing pharmacists to substitute generic drugs\nwhen filling prescriptions for brand-name drugs. Chris\ntensen, Kirking, Ascione, Welage, & Gaither, Drug Prod\nuct Selection: Legal Issues, 41 J. Am. Pharmaceutical\nAssn. 868, 869 (2001). Currently, all States have some\nform of generic substitution law. See ibid.

Some States require patient consent to\nsubstitution, and all States “allow the physician to specify\nthat the brand name must be prescribed, although with\ndifferent levels of effort from the physician.” Expanding\nthe Use of Generic Drugs 7.2\n   These legislative efforts to expand production and con\nsumption of generic drugs have proved wildly successful.\nIt is estimated that in 1984, when the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments were enacted, generic drugs constituted 19\npercent of drugs sold in this country.

Ninety percent of drugs for which a\ngeneric version is available are now filled with generics.\nId., at 3–4. In many cases, once generic versions of a\ndrug enter the market, the brand-name manufacturer stops\nselling the brand-name drug altogether. See Brief for\nMarc T.

Reflecting the success of their products,\nmany generic manufacturers, including the Manufacturers\nand their amici, are huge, multinational companies. In\ntotal, generic drug manufacturers sold an estimated $66\nbillion of drugs in this country in 2009. See id., at 15.\n                             B\n   As noted, to obtain FDA approval a generic manufac\nturer must generally show that its drug is the same as an\napproved brand-name drug. It need not conduct clinical\ntrials to prove the safety and efficacy of the drug. This\ndoes not mean, however, that a generic manufacturer has\nno duty under federal law to ensure the safety of its prod\nucts. The FDA has limited resources to conduct postap\nproval monitoring of drug safety. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at\n578. Manufacturers, we have recognized, “have superior\naccess to information about their drugs, especially in the\npostmarketing phase as new risks emerge.” Id., at 578–\n579. Federal law thus obliges drug manufacturers—both\nbrand-name and generic—to monitor the safety of their\nproducts.\n   Under federal law, generic manufacturers must “develop\nwritten procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evalua\ntion, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experi\nences” to the FDA.4 21 CFR §314.80(b);5 see also §314.98\n(making §314.80 applicable to generic manufacturers);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 6, and n. 2\n(hereinafter U.

If a manufacturer receives a report of a seri\nous and unexpected adverse drug experience, it must re\nport the event to the FDA within 15 days and must\n“promptly investigate.” §§314.80(c)(1)(i)–(ii); see also Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 8. Most other adverse drug experiences must\nbe reported on a quarterly or yearly basis.6 §314.80(c)(2).\nGeneric manufacturers must also submit to the FDA an\nannual report summarizing “significant new information\nfrom the previous year that might affect the safety, ef\nfectiveness, or labeling of the drug product,” including a\n“description of actions the [manufacturer] has taken or\nintends to take as a result of this new information.”\n§314.81(b)(2)(i); see also §314.98(c).\n   Generic manufacturers, the majority assumes, also bear\nresponsibility under federal law for monitoring the ade\nquacy of their warnings. I agree with the majority’s con\nclusion that generic manufacturers are not permitted\nunilaterally to change their labels through the “changes\nbeing-effected” (CBE) process or to issue additional warn\nings through “Dear Doctor” letters.

S., at 570–571. The FDA\nconstrues this regulation to oblige generic manufacturers\n“to seek to revise their labeling and provide FDA with\nsupporting information about risks” when they believe that\nadditional warnings are necessary.7 U. S. Brief 20.\n   The Manufacturers disagree. They read the FDA regu\nlation to require them only to ensure that their labels\nmatch the brand-name labels. See Brief for Petitioner\nPLIVA et al. 38–41. I need not decide whether the regula\ntion in fact obliges generic manufacturers to approach the\nFDA to propose a label change. The majority assumes\nthat it does. And even if generic manufacturers do not\nhave a duty to propose label changes, two points remain\nundisputed. First, they do have a duty under federal law\n——————\n   7 The FDA’s construction of this regulation mirrors the guidance it\n\nprovided to generic manufacturers nearly 20 years ago in announcing\nthe final rule implementing the abbreviated application process for\ngeneric drugs:\n“If an ANDA [i.e., application for approval of a generic drug] applicant\nbelieves new safety information should be added to a product’s labeling,\nit should contact FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling\nfor the generic and listed drugs should be revised. After approval of an\nANDA, if an ANDA holder believes that new safety information should\nbe added, it should provide adequate supporting information to FDA,\nand FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed\ndrugs should be revised.” 57 Fed. Reg. 17961 (1992).\nFDA’s internal procedures recognize that the Office of Generic Drugs\nwill have to consult with other FDA components on “some labeling\nreviews.” Manual of Policies and Procedures 5200.6, p. 1 (May 9, 2001).\nConsultations involving “possible serious safety concerns” receive the\nhighest priority. Id., at 3.\n8                  PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto monitor the safety of their products. And, second, they\nmay approach the FDA to propose a label change when\nthey believe a change is required.\n                             II\n  This brings me to the Manufacturers’ pre-emption de\nfense. State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of\ndangers to users. See Hines v. Remington Arms Co., 94–\n0455, p. 10 (La. 12/8/94), 648 So. 2d 331, 337; Frey v.\nMontgomery Ward & Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn.\n1977). The Manufacturers contend, and the majority\nagrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents’ failure-to\nwarn claims because, under federal law, the Manufac\nturers could not have provided additional warnings to\nrespondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.\nI cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility\npre-emption.\n                               A\n    Two principles guide all pre-emption analysis. First,\n“ ‘the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in\nevery pre-emption case.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996)). Sec\nond, “ ‘[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those\nin which Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the\nStates have traditionally occupied, . . . we start with the\nassumption that the historic police powers of the States\nwere not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’ ” Wyeth,\n555 U. S., at 565 (quoting Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485; some\ninternal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).\n    These principles find particular resonance in these\ncases. The States have traditionally regulated health and\nsafety matters. See id., at 485. Notwithstanding Con\ngress’ “certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort\nlitigation” against drug manufacturers, Wyeth, 555 U. S.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)              9\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nat 575, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law\ntort actions against prescription drug manufacturers,\nwhether brand-name or generic. To the contrary, when\nCongress amended the FDCA in 1962 to “enlarg[e] the\nFDA’s powers to ‘protect the public health’ and ‘assure the\nsafety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,’ [it] took care\nto preserve state law.” Id., at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780);\nsee Pub. L. 87–781, §202, 76 Stat. 793 (“Nothing in the\namendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be\nconstrued as invalidating any provision of State law which\nwould be valid in the absence of such amendments un-\nless there is a direct and positive conflict between such\namendments and such provision of State law”). Notably,\nalthough Congress enacted an express pre-emption provi\nsion for medical devices in 1976, see Pub. L. 94–295, §521,\n90 Stat. 574, 21 U. S. C. §360k(a), it included no such\nprovision in the Hatch-Waxman Amendments eight years\nlater. Cf. Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 567, 574–575. Congress’\n“silence on the issue . . . is powerful evidence that [it] did\nnot intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of\nensuring drug safety and effectiveness.” Id., at 575.\n                              B\n   Federal law impliedly pre-empts state law when state\nand federal law “conflict”—i.e., when “it is impossible for a\nprivate party to comply with both state and federal law” or\nwhen state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of\nCongress.” Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530\nU. S. 363, 372–373 (2000) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). The Manufacturers rely solely on the former ground\nof pre-emption.\n   Impossibility pre-emption, we have emphasized, “is a de\nmanding defense.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573.

To prevail on this defense, a defendant\nmust demonstrate that “compliance with both federal and\nstate [law] is a physical impossibility.” Florida Lime &\nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142–143\n(1963); see also Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. In other words,\nthere must be an “inevitable collision” between federal and\nstate law. Florida Lime, 373 U. S., at 143. “The existence\nof a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to\nwarrant” pre-emption of state law. Rice v. Norman Wil\nliams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982); see also Gade v.\nNational Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88,\n110 (1992) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). In other words, the mere possibility of\nimpossibility is not enough.\n   The Manufacturers contend that it was impossible for\nthem to provide additional warnings to respondents Men\nsing and Demahy because federal law prohibited them\nfrom changing their labels unilaterally.8 They concede,\nhowever, that they could have asked the FDA to initiate a\nlabel change. If the FDA agreed that a label change was\nrequired, it could have asked, and indeed pressured, the\nbrand-name manufacturer to change its label, triggering\na corresponding change to the Manufacturers’ generic la\n\n——————\n  8 In its decision below, the Eighth Circuit suggested that the Manu\n\nfacturers could not show impossibility because federal law merely\npermitted them to sell generic drugs; it did not require them to do so.\nSee Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (2009) (“The generic\ndefendants were not compelled to market metoclopramide. If they\nrealized their label was insufficient but did not believe they could even\npropose a label change, they could have simply stopped selling the\nproduct”); see also Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,\n873 (2000) (describing “a case of impossibility” as one “in which state\nlaw penalizes what federal law requires” (emphasis added)). Respon\ndents have not advanced this argument, and I find it unnecessary to\nconsider.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   11\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbels.9 Thus, had the Manufacturers invoked the available\nmechanism for initiating label changes, they may well\nhave been able to change their labels in sufficient time to\nwarn respondents. Having failed to do so, the Manufac\nturers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without\nfurther factual development) to demonstrate that it was\nimpossible for them to comply with both federal and state\nlaw. At most, they have demonstrated only “a hypotheti\ncal or potential conflict.” Rice, 458 U. S., at 659.\n  Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact\nthat they cannot change their labels unilaterally—which\ndistinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer\ndefendant in Wyeth. They correctly point out that in\nWyeth we concluded that the FDA’s CBE regulation au\nthorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before\nreceiving agency approval of its supplemental application\ndescribing the label change. 555 U. S., at 568–571; see\nalso 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6). But the defendant’s label\nchange was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA\nretained “authority to reject labeling changes made pur\nsuant to the CBE regulation.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 571.\nThus, in the long run, a brand-name manufacturer’s com\npliance with a state-law duty to warn required action by\ntwo actors: The brand-name manufacturer had to change\nthe label and the FDA, upon reviewing the supplemental\napplication, had to agree with the change.10 The need for\n——————\n  9 At  the time respondents’ cause of action arose, the FDA did not have\nauthority to require a brand-name manufacturer to change its label.\n(It received that authority in 2007. See Pub. L. 110–85, §901, 121\nStat. 924–926, 21 U. S. C. §355(o)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III). It did, how\never, have the equally significant authority to withdraw the brand-name\nmanufacturer’s permission to market its drug if the manufacturer\nrefused to make a requested labeling change. See 21 U. S. C. §355(e)\n(2006 ed.); 21 CFR §314.150(b)(3).\n   10 A brand-name manufacturer’s ability to comply with a state-law\n\nduty to warn would depend on its own unilateral actions only during\nthe period after it should have changed its label but before the FDA\n12                    PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nFDA approval of the label change did not make compliance\nwith federal and state law impossible in every case. In\nstead, because the defendant bore the burden to show\nimpossibility, we required it to produce “clear evidence\nthat the FDA would not have approved a change to [the]\nlabel.” Ibid.\n   I would apply the same approach in these cases. State\nlaw, respondents allege, required the Manufacturers to\nprovide a strengthened warning about the dangers of\nlong-term metoclopramide use.11 Just like the brand-name\nmanufacturer in Wyeth, the Manufacturers had available\nto them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their\nstate-law duty to warn. Federal law thus “accommodated”\nthe Manufacturers’ state-law duties. See ante, at 18, n. 8.\nIt was not necessarily impossible for the Manufacturers to\ncomply with both federal and state law because, had they\napproached the FDA, the FDA may well have agreed that\na label change was necessary. Accordingly, as in Wyeth, I\nwould require the Manufacturers to show that the FDA\nwould not have approved a proposed label change. They\nhave not made such a showing: They do “not argue that\n[they] attempted to give the kind of warning required by\n[state law] but [were] prohibited from doing so by the\nFDA.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 572.\n   This is not to say that generic manufacturers could\nnever show impossibility. If a generic-manufacturer de\nfendant proposed a label change to the FDA but the FDA\nrejected the proposal, it would be impossible for that\ndefendant to comply with a state-law duty to warn. Like\nwise, impossibility would be established if the FDA had\n——————\nwould have approved or disapproved the label change. The claim in\nWyeth does not appear to have arisen during that period.\n  11 Respondents’ state-law claim is not that the Manufacturers were\n\nrequired to ask the FDA for assistance in changing the labels; the role\nof the FDA arises only as a result of the Manufacturers’ pre-emption\ndefense.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot yet responded to a generic manufacturer’s request for\na label change at the time a plaintiff’s injuries arose. A\ngeneric manufacturer might also show that the FDA had\nitself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in\nlight of the evidence on which a plaintiff’s claim rests but\nhad decided to leave the warnings as is. (The Manufac\nturers make just such an argument in these cases. See,\ne.g., Brief for Petitioner Actavis et al. 11.) But these are\nquestions of fact to be established through discovery.\nBecause the burden of proving impossibility falls on the\ndefendant, I would hold that federal law does not render\nit impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with\na state-law duty to warn as a categorical matter.\n   This conclusion flows naturally from the overarching prin\nciples governing our pre-emption doctrine. See supra,\nat 8. Our “respect for the States as ‘independent sover\neigns in our federal system’ leads us to assume that ‘Con\ngress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of\naction.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr,\n518 U. S., at 485). It is for this reason that we hold defen\ndants asserting impossibility to a “demanding” standard.\nWyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. This presumption against pre\nemption has particular force when the Federal Govern\nment has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying\nwith state law, even when that mechanism requires fed\neral agency action. (The presumption has even greater\nforce when federal law requires defendants to invoke that\nmechanism, as the majority assumes in these cases.) In\nsuch circumstances, I would hold, defendants will usually\nbe unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility\nif they have not even attempted to employ that mecha\nnism. Any other approach threatens to infringe the\nStates’ authority over traditional matters of state inter\nest—such as the failure-to-warn claims here—when Con\ngress expressed no intent to pre-empt state law.\n14                  PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n  The majority concedes that the Manufacturers might\nhave been able to accomplish under federal law what state\nlaw requires. Ante, at 12–13. To reach the conclusion that\nthe Manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their bur\nden to show impossibility, the majority invents a new pre\nemption rule: “The question for ‘impossibility’ is whether\nthe private party could independently do under federal\nlaw what state law requires of it.” Ante, at 13 (empha-\nsis added). Because the Manufacturers could not have\nchanged their labels without the exercise of judgment by\nthe FDA, the majority holds, compliance with both state\nand federal law was impossible in these cases.12\n  The majority’s new test has no basis in our precedents.\nThe majority cites only Wyeth in support of its test. As\ndiscussed above, however, Wyeth does not stand for the\nproposition that it is impossible to comply with both fed\neral and state law whenever federal agency approval is\nrequired. To the contrary, label changes by brand-name\nmanufacturers such as Wyeth are subject to FDA review\nand acceptance. See supra, at 11–12. And, even if Wyeth\ncould be characterized as turning on the fact that the\nbrand-name manufacturer could change its label unilater\nally, the possibility of unilateral action was, at most, a\nsufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense\nin that case. Wyeth did not hold that unilateral action is a\nnecessary condition in every case.\n——————\n  12 These cases do not involve a situation where a brand-name\n\nmanufacturer itself produces generic drugs. See Okie, Multinational\nMedicines—Ensuring Drug Quality in an Era of Global Manufactur\ning, 361 N. Eng. J. Med. 737, 738 (2009); see also GPhA, Frequently\nAsked Questions About Generics, http://www.gphaonline.org/about\ngpha/about-generics/faq (“Brand-name companies make about half of\ngeneric drugs”). In that case, the manufacturer could independently\nchange the brand-name label under the CBE regulation, triggering a\ncorresponding change to its own generic label.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            15\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   With so little support in our case law, the majority un\nderstandably turns to other rationales. None of the\nrationales that it offers, however, makes any sense. First,\nit offers a reductio ad absurdum: If the possibility of FDA\napproval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in\nthese cases, it warns, as a “logical conclusion” so too would\nbe the possibility that the FDA might rewrite its regula\ntions or that Congress might amend the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments. Ante, at 14. The logic of this conclusion\nescapes me. Conflict analysis necessarily turns on exist\ning law. It thus would be ridiculous to conclude that\nfederal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the\ndefendant could have asked a federal agency or Congress\nto change the law. Here, by contrast, the Manufacturers’\ncompliance with their state-law duty to warn did not re\nquire them to ask for a change in federal law, as the\nmajority itself recognizes. See ante, at 13 (“[F]ederal law\nwould permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state\nlabeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the\nbrand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label\nto do so”). The FDA already afforded them a mechanism\nfor attempting to comply with their state-law duties.\nIndeed, the majority assumes that FDA regulations re\nquired the Manufacturers to request a label change when\nthey had “reasonable evidence of an association of a seri\nous hazard with a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).\n   Second, the majority suggests that any other approach\nwould render conflict pre-emption “illusory” and “meaning\nless.” Ante, at 14. It expresses concern that, without a\nrobust view of what constitutes conflict, the Supremacy\nClause would not have “any force” except in cases of ex\npress pre-emption. Ibid. To the extent the majority’s\npurported concern is driven by its reductio ad absurdum,\nsee ante, at 14, n. 6, that concern is itself illusory, for the\nreasons just stated. To the extent the majority is con\ncerned that our traditionally narrow view of what consti\n16                     PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption\nas a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no\nsense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict pre\nemption may be found, even absent impossibility, where\nstate law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\nand execution of the full purposes and objectives of\nCongress.” Crosby, 530 U. S., at 373 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor\nCo., 529 U. S. 861, 886 (2000); Barnett Bank of Marion\nCty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 31 (1996); Hines v.\nDavidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). The majority’s ex\npansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to pre\nvent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.13\n    Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory\nthat the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to\noperate as a so-called non obstante provision. See ante, at\n15–17 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225\n(2000)). According to the plurality, non obstante provi\nsions in statutes “instruc[t] courts not to apply the general\npresumption against implied repeals.” Ante, at 15 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 16 (stating\nthat when a statute contains a non obstante provision,\n“ ‘courts will be less inclined against recognizing repug\nnancy in applying such statutes’ ” (quoting J. Sutherland,\nStatutes and Statutory Construction §147, p. 199 (1891)).\nFrom this understanding of the Supremacy Clause, the\nplurality extrapolates the principle that “courts should not\nstrain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly\n——————\n  13 JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s opinion, has previously ex\npressed the view that obstacle pre-emption is inconsistent with the\nConstitution. See Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2–5);\nWyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 604 (2009) (opinion concurring in\njudgment). That position, however, has not been accepted by this\nCourt, and it thus should not justify the majority’s novel expansion of\nimpossibility pre-emption.\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  17\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconflicting state law.” Ante, at 15.\n   This principle would have been news to the Congress\nthat enacted the Hatch-Waxman Amendments in 1984:\nOur precedents hold just the opposite. For more than half\na century, we have directed courts to presume that con\ngressional action does not supersede “the historic police\npowers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and\nmanifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator\nCorp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see also Gade, 505 U. S.,\nat 111–112 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). We apply this presumption against\npre-emption both where Congress has spoken to the pre\nemption question and where it has not. See Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at 566, n. 3. In the context of express pre-emption,\nwe read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre\nempt state law. See Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S.\n70, 77 (2008) (“[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause\nis susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts\nordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ”\n(quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431,\n449 (2005))); see also Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\nU. S. 504, 518 (1992). And, when the claim is that federal\nlaw impliedly pre-empts state law, we require a “strong”\nshowing of a conflict “to overcome the presumption that\nstate and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist\nwith federal regulation.” Hillsborough County v. Auto\nmated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 716\n(1985).\n   The plurality’s new theory of the Supremacy Clause is a\ndirect assault on these precedents.14 Whereas we have\n——————\n  14 The author of the law review article proposing this theory of the\n\nSupremacy Clause acknowledges as much. See Nelson, Preemption, 86\nVa. L. Rev. 225, 304 (2000) (“The non obstante provision rejects an\nartificial presumption that Congress did not intend to contradict any\nstate laws and that federal statutes must therefore be harmonized with\nstate law”). The plurality, on the other hand, carefully avoids discuss\n18                   PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlong presumed that federal law does not pre-empt, or\nrepeal, state law, the plurality today reads the Supremacy\nClause to operate as a provision instructing courts “not to\napply the general presumption against implied repeals.”\nAnte, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And whereas we have long required evidence of a\n“clear and manifest” purpose to pre-empt, Rice, 331 U. S.,\nat 230, the plurality now instructs courts to “look no fur\nther than the ordinary meaning of federal law” before\nconcluding that Congress must have intended to cast aside\nstate law, ante, at 16 (internal quotation marks and al\nteration omitted).\n   That the plurality finds it necessary to resort to this\nnovel theory of the Supremacy Clause—a theory advo\ncated by no party or amici in these cases—is telling.\nProper application of the longstanding presumption\nagainst pre-emption compels the conclusion that federal\nlaw does not render compliance with state law impossible\nmerely because it requires an actor to seek federal agency\napproval. When federal law provides actors with a mech\nanism for attempting to comply with their state-law\nduties, “respect for the States as ‘independent sovereigns\nin our federal system’ ” should require those actors to\nattempt to comply with state law before being heard to\ncomplain that compliance with both laws was impossible.\nWyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr, 518\nU. S., at 485).\n                             III\n  Today’s decision leads to so many absurd consequences\nthat I cannot fathom that Congress would have intended\nto pre-empt state law in these cases.\n  First, the majority’s pre-emption analysis strips generic\n\n—————— \n\ning the ramifications of its new theory for the longstanding presump\n\ntion against pre-emption. \n\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 449. Given the longstanding\nexistence of product liability actions, including for failure\nto warn, “[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would,\nwithout comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\nfor those injured by illegal conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S.,\nat 251; see also Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) (noting our previously expressed\n“doubt that Congress would quietly preempt product\nliability claims without providing a federal substitute”).\nIn concluding that Congress silently immunized generic\nmanufacturers from all failure-to-warn claims, the major\nity disregards our previous hesitance to infer congres\nsional intent to effect such a sweeping change in tradi\ntional state-law remedies.\n   As the majority itself admits, a drug consumer’s right\nto compensation for inadequate warnings now turns on\nthe happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her pre\nscription with a brand-name drug or a generic. If a con\nsumer takes a brand-name drug, she can sue the manufac\nturer for inadequate warnings under our opinion in Wyeth.\nIf, however, she takes a generic drug, as occurs 75 percent\nof the time, she now has no right to sue. The majority\noffers no reason to think—apart from its new articulation\nof the impossibility standard—that Congress would have\nintended such an arbitrary distinction. In some States,\npharmacists must dispense generic drugs absent instruc\ntion to the contrary from a consumer’s physician. Even\nwhen consumers can request brand-name drugs, the price\nof the brand-name drug or the consumers’ insurance plans\nmay make it impossible to do so. As a result, in many\ncases, consumers will have no ability to preserve their\nstate-law right to recover for injuries caused by inade\n20                    PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nquate warnings.\n   Second, the majority’s decision creates a gap in the\nparallel federal-state regulatory scheme in a way that\ncould have troubling consequences for drug safety. As we\nexplained in Wyeth, “[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown\ndrug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufactur\ners to disclose safety risks promptly.” 555 U. S., at 579.\nThus, we recognized, “state law offers an additional, and\nimportant, layer of consumer protection that complements\nFDA regulation.” Ibid. Today’s decision eliminates the\ntraditional state-law incentives for generic manufacturers\nto monitor and disclose safety risks. When a generic drug\nhas a brand-name equivalent on the market, the brand\nname manufacturer will remain incentivized to uncover\nsafety risks. But brand-name manufacturers often leave\nthe market once generic versions are available, see supra,\nat 4–5, meaning that there will be no manufacturer sub\nject to failure-to-warn liability. As to those generic drugs,\nthere will be no “additional . . . layer of consumer protec\ntion.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 579.\n   Finally, today’s decision undoes the core principle of\nthe Hatch-Waxman Amendments that generic and brand\nname drugs are the “same” in nearly all respects.15 See\nBrief for Rep. Henry A. Waxman as Amicus Curiae 9.\nThe majority pins the expansion of the generic drug market\non “the special, and different, regulation of generic drugs,”\nwhich allows generic manufacturers to produce their\ndrugs more cheaply. Ante, at 19. This tells only half the\nstory. The expansion of the market for generic drugs has\nalso flowed from the increased acceptance of, and trust in,\n——————\n  15 According to the GPhA, both the FDA and the generic drug indus\n\ntry “spend millions of dollars each year . . . seeking to reassure consum\ners that affordable generic drugs really are—as federal law compels\nthem to be—the same as their pricier brand-name counterparts.” Brief\nfor GPhA as Amicus Curiae on Pet. for Cert. in Nos. 09–993, 09–1039,\npp. 2–3.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Consumers of\nbrand-name drugs can sue manufacturers for inadequate\nwarnings; consumers of generic drugs cannot. These\ndivergent liability rules threaten to reduce consumer\ndemand for generics, at least among consumers who can\nafford brand-name drugs. They may pose “an ethical\ndilemma” for prescribing physicians. Brief for American\nMedical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29. And they\nmay well cause the States to rethink their longstanding\nefforts to promote generic use through generic substitution\nlaws. See Brief for National Conference of State Legisla\ntors as Amicus Curiae 15 (state generic substitution laws\n“have proceeded on the premise that . . . generic drugs are\nnot, from citizens’ perspective, materially different from\nbrand ones, except for the lower price”). These conse\nquences are directly at odds with the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments’ goal of increasing consumption of generic\ndrugs.\n  Nothing in the Court’s opinion convinces me that, in\nenacting the requirement that generic labels match their\ncorresponding brand-name labels, Congress intended\nthese absurd results. The Court certainly has not shown\nthat such was the “clear and manifest purpose of Con\ngress.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added). To the contrary, because fed\neral law affords generic manufacturers a mechanism for\nattempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn,\nI would hold that federal law does not categorically\npre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic\nmanufacturers. Especially in light of the presumption\nagainst pre-emption, the burden should fall on generic\nmanufacturers to show that compliance was impossible on\nthe particular facts of their case. By holding that the\n22                 PLIVA, INC. v.
