UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09\u201310245.       Argued February 23, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nIn order to reduce unwarranted federal sentencing disparities, the Sen\n  tencing Reform Act of 1984 authorizes the United States Sentencing\n  Commission to create, and to retroactively amend, Sentencing Guide\n  lines to inform judicial discretion. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) per\n  mits a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n  \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been\n  lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction.\n  This case concerns \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s application to cases in which the de\n  fendant and the Government have entered into a plea agreement un\n  der Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which permits\n  the parties to \u201cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is\n  the appropriate disposition of the case,\u201d and \u201cbinds the court [to the\n  agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.\u201d\n     Petitioner Freeman was indicted for various crimes, including pos\n  sessing with intent to distribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1).\n  He entered into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to plead guilty to all\n  charges; in return the Government agreed to a 106-month sentence.\n  The agreement states that the parties independently reviewed the\n  applicable Guidelines, noted that Freeman agreed to have his sen\n  tence determined under the Guidelines, and reflected the parties\u2019 un\n  derstanding that the agreed-to sentence corresponded with the\n  minimum sentence suggested by the applicable Guidelines range of\n  46 to 57 months, along with a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60\n  months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\n  crime under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Three years after the District\n  Court accepted the plea agreement, the Commission issued a retroac\n  tive Guidelines amendment to remedy the significant disparity be\n  tween the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses.\n2                    FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Because the amendment\u2019s effect was to reduce Freeman\u2019s applicable\n    sentencing range to 37 to 46 months plus the consecutive 60-month\n    mandatory minimum, he moved for a sentence reduction under\n    \u00a73582(c)(2). However, the District Court denied the motion, and the\n    Sixth Circuit affirmed because its precedent rendered defendants\n    sentenced pursuant to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements ineligible for\n    \u00a73582(c)(2) relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n355 Fed. Appx. 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER,\n  and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that defendants who enter into\n  11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence as a condi\n  tion of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp.\n  5\u201310.\n     (a) The text and purpose of the statute, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), and the\n  governing Guidelines policy statements compel the conclusion that\n  the district court has authority to entertain \u00a73582(c)(2) motions when\n  sentences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defen\n  dant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The district judge must,\n  in every case, impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than nec\n  essary, to comply with\u201d the purposes of federal sentencing, in light of\n  the Guidelines and other relevant factors. \u00a73553(a). The Guidelines\n  provide a framework or starting point\u2014a basis, in the term\u2019s com\n  monsense meaning\u2014for the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. Rule\n  11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to agree on a\n  specific sentence, but that agreement does not discharge the district\n  court\u2019s independent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual\n  sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge\u2019s reliance on the\n  Guidelines will be apparent when the judge uses the Guidelines\n  range as the starting point in the analysis and imposes a sentence\n  within the range. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49. Even\n  where the judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the\n  judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the\n  deviation, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sen\n  tence. The parties\u2019 recommended sentence binds the court \u201conce the\n  court accepts the plea agreement,\u201d Rule 11(c)(1)(C), but the relevant\n  policy statement forbids the judge to accept an agreement without\n  first giving due consideration to the applicable Guidelines sentencing\n  range, even if the parties recommend a specific sentence as a condi\n  tion of the guilty plea, see U. S. Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\n  Manual \u00a76B1.2. This approach finds further support in the policy\n  statement applicable to \u00a73582(c)(2) motions, which instructs the dis\n  trict court in modifying a sentence to substitute the retroactive\n  amendment, but to leave all original Guidelines determinations in\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nplace, \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). Pp. 5\u20137.\n   (b) Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the Dis\ntrict Court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence\nwas appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range. Its deci\nsion was therefore \u201cbased on\u201d that range within \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s mean\ning. P. 7.\n   (c) The Government\u2019s argument that sentences that follow an\n11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based only on the agreement itself and not\nthe Guidelines, and are therefore ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2) reduction,\nmust be rejected. Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreement, the judge\u2019s decision to accept the plea and impose the\nrecommended sentence is likely to be based on the Guidelines; and\nwhen it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek \u00a73582(c)(2) relief.\nPp. 7\u201310.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concluded that if an agreement under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) expressly uses\na Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to es\ntablish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission, the prison term is \u201cbased on\u201d\nthe range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduc\ntion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp. 1\u201311.\n   (a) The term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant\nto a (C) agreement is \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself, not on the\njudge\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines sentencing range. To hold oth\nerwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreements\u2014to\nbind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant\nto determine what sentence he will receive. Pp. 1\u20135.\n   (b) This does not mean, however, that a term of imprisonment im\nposed under a (C) agreement can never be reduced under \u00a73582(c)(2).\nBecause the very purpose of a (C) agreement is to allow the parties to\ndetermine the defendant\u2019s sentence, when the agreement itself em\nploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the\ncharged offenses in establishing the term of imprisonment imposed\nby the district court, the defendant is eligible to have his sentence re\nduced under \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp. 5\u20139.\n   (c) Freeman is eligible. The offense level and criminal history cate\ngory set forth in his (C) agreement produce a sentencing range of 46\nto 57 months; it is evident that the parties combined the 46-month\nfigure at the low end of the range with the 60-month mandatory\nminimum sentence under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) to establish the 106-month\nsentence called for in the agreement. Under the amended Guide\nlines, however, the applicable sentencing range is now 37 to 46\nmonths. Therefore, Freeman\u2019s prison term is \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing\nrange that \u201chas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com\n4                    FREEMAN v.

S. C. \u00a73551\net seq., calls for the creation of Sentencing Guidelines to\ninform judicial discretion in order to reduce unwarranted\ndisparities in federal sentencing. The Act allows retro\nactive amendments to the Guidelines for cases where\nthe Guidelines become a cause of inequality, not a bulwark\nagainst it. When a retroactive Guideline amendment is\nadopted, \u00a73582(c)(2) permits defendants sentenced based\non a sentencing range that has been modified to move for\na reduced sentence.\n  The question here is whether defendants who enter into\nplea agreements that recommend a particular sentence\nas a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief\nunder \u00a73582(c)(2). See Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C)\n(authorizing such plea agreements). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit held that, barring a miscarriage of\njustice or mutual mistake, defendants who enter into\n11(c)(1)(C) agreements cannot benefit from retroactive\nGuideline amendments.\n  Five Members of the Court agree that this judgment\nmust be reversed. The Justices who join this plurality\nopinion conclude that the categorical bar enacted by the\n2               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nCourt of Appeals finds no support in \u00a73582(c)(2), Rule\n11(c)(1)(C), or the relevant Guidelines policy statements.\nIn every case the judge must exercise discretion to im\npose an appropriate sentence. This discretion, in turn, is\nframed by the Guidelines. And the Guidelines must be\nconsulted, in the regular course, whether the case is one in\nwhich the conviction was after a trial or after a plea,\nincluding a plea pursuant to an agreement that recom\nmends a particular sentence. The district judge\u2019s decision\nto impose a sentence may therefore be based on the Guide\nlines even if the defendant agrees to plead guilty under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). Where the decision to impose a sentence\nis based on a range later subject to retroactive amend\nment, \u00a73582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.\n   Section 3582(c)(2) empowers district judges to correct sen\ntences that depend on frameworks that later prove un\njustified. There is no reason to deny \u00a73582(c)(2) relief to\ndefendants who linger in prison pursuant to sentences\nthat would not have been imposed but for a since-rejected,\nexcessive range.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reverse the judgment on a\ndifferent ground set out in the opinion concurring in the\njudgment. That opinion, like the dissent, would hold that\nsentences following 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based on the\nagreement rather than the Guidelines, and therefore that\n\u00a73582(c)(2) relief is not available in the typical case. But\nunlike the dissent she would permit the petitioner here to\nseek a sentence reduction because his plea agreement in\nexpress terms ties the recommended sentence to the\nGuidelines sentencing range.\n   The reasons that lead those Members of the Court who\njoin this plurality opinion may be set forth as follows.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Federal courts are forbidden, as a general matter, to\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

C. \u00a73582(c); but the rule of finality is subject to a\nfew narrow exceptions. Here, the exception is contained in\na statutory provision enacted to permit defendants whose\nGuidelines sentencing range has been lowered by retro\nactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction if the\nterms of the statute are met. The statute provides:\n    \u201cIn the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to\n    a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range\n    that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing\n    Commission pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 994(o) . . . the\n    court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after\n    considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to\n    the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction\n    is consistent with applicable policy statements issued\n    by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n  This case concerns the application of the statute to cases\nin which defendants enter into plea agreements under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). That Rule permits the parties to \u201cagree\nthat a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appro\npriate disposition of the case, . . . [a request which] binds\nthe court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u201d The\nquestion is whether defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreements that specify a particular sentence may be said\nto have been sentenced \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing\nrange, making them eligible for relief under \u00a73582(c)(2).\n                            B\n   Petitioner William Freeman was indicted in 2005 for\nvarious crimes, including possessing with intent to dis\ntribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1); (b)(1)(C). He\nentered into an agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in which\nhe agreed to plead guilty to all charges. In return the\nGovernment \u201cagree[d] that a sentence of 106 months\u2019 in\ncarceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.\u201d\n4               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nApp. 26a. The agreement states that \u201c[b]oth parties have\nindependently reviewed the Sentencing Guidelines appli\ncable in this case,\u201d and that \u201c[Freeman] agrees to have his\nsentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide\nlines.\u201d The agreement reflects the parties\u2019 expectation\nthat Freeman would face a Guidelines range of 46 to 57\nmonths, id., at 27a\u201328a (Offense Level 19, Criminal His\ntory Category IV), along with a consecutive mandatory\nminimum of 60 months for possessing a firearm in fur\ntherance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(1)(A). The recommended sentence of 106 months\nthus corresponded with the minimum sentence suggested\nby the Guidelines, in addition to the 60-month \u00a7924(c)\n(1)(A) sentence.\n   The District Court accepted the plea agreement. At the\nsentencing hearing, the court \u201cadopt[ed] the findings of\nthe probation officer disclosed in the probation report and\napplication of the guidelines as set out therein.\u201d App. 47a.\n\u201c[H]aving considered the advisory guidelines and 18 USC\n3553(a),\u201d the court imposed the recommended 106-month\nsentence, which was \u201cwithin the guideline ranges\u201d\u2014the\n46- to 57-month range the parties had anticipated plus the\nmandatory 60 months under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)\u2014and \u201csufficient\nto meet the objectives of the law.\u201d Id. at 48a\u201349a.\n   Three years later, the Commission issued a retroactive\namendment to the Guidelines to remedy the significant\ndisparity between the penalties for cocaine base and pow\nder cocaine offenses. See United States Sentencing Com\nmission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706\n(Nov. 2010) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007) (adjusting\nGuidelines); id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008) (mak\ning Amendment 706 retroactive).

The District Court, however, denied the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\naffirmed. United States v. Goins, 355 Fed. Appx. 1 (2009).\nAdhering to its decision in United States v. Peveler, 359\nF. 3d 369 (2004), the Court of Appeals held that defen\ndants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that\nspecify a particular sentence are ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2)\nrelief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II\n  Federal sentencing law requires the district judge in\nevery case to impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary, to comply with\u201d the purposes of federal\nsentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other \u00a73553(a)\nfactors. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a). The Guidelines provide a\nframework or starting point\u2014a basis, in the commonsense\nmeaning of the term\u2014for the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion.\nE.g., 1 Oxford English Dictionary 977 (2d ed. 1989). Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to\nagree that a specific sentence is appropriate, but that\nagreement does not discharge the district court\u2019s inde\npendent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual\nsentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge\u2019s\nreliance on the Guidelines will be apparent, for the judge\nwill use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the\nanalysis and impose a sentence within the range. Gall v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007). Even where the\njudge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the\njudge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to\nexplain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines\nare in a real sense a basis for the sentence.\n  Rule 11(c)(1)(C) makes the parties\u2019 recommended sen\ntence binding on the court \u201conce the court accepts the plea\nagreement,\u201d but the governing policy statement confirms\nthat the court\u2019s acceptance is itself based on the Guide\n6               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nlines. See USSG \u00a76B1.2. That policy statement forbids\nthe district judge to accept an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement with\nout first evaluating the recommended sentence in light\nof the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range. The com\nmentary to \u00a76B1.2 advises that a court may accept an\n11(c)(1)(C) agreement \u201conly if the court is satisfied either\nthat such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the\napplicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence de\nparts from the applicable guideline range for justifiable\nreasons.\u201d Cf. Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36 (1993)\n(Guidelines commentary is authoritative). Any bargain\nbetween the parties is contingent until the court accepts\nthe agreement. The Guidelines require the district judge\nto give due consideration to the relevant sentencing range,\neven if the defendant and prosecutor recommend a specific\nsentence as a condition of the guilty plea.\n   This approach finds further support in the policy state\nment that applies to \u00a73582(c)(2) motions. See USSG\n\u00a71B1.10. It instructs the district court in modifying a\nsentence to substitute only the retroactive amendment\nand then leave all original Guidelines determinations in\nplace. \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). In other words, the policy statement\nseeks to isolate whatever marginal effect the since\nrejected Guideline had on the defendant\u2019s sentence. Work\ning backwards from this purpose, \u00a73582(c)(2) modification\nproceedings should be available to permit the district\ncourt to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the\nsentencing range in question was a relevant part of the\nanalytic framework the judge used to determine the sen\ntence or to approve the agreement. This is the only rule\nconsistent with the governing policy statement, a state\nment that rests on the premise that a Guideline range\nmay be one of many factors that determine the sentence\nimposed.\n   Thus, the text and purpose of the three relevant\nsources\u2014the statute, the Rule, and the governing policy\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Apart\nfrom the defense attorney\u2019s initial statement that the case\ninvolved a \u201c(C) plea,\u201d id., at 47a, the hearing proceeded as\nif the agreement did not exist. The court expressed its\nindependent judgment that the sentence was appropriate\nin light of the applicable Guidelines range, and its decision\nwas therefore \u201cbased on\u201d that range.\n                             IV\n   The Government asks this Court to hold that sentences\nlike petitioner\u2019s, which follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement,\nare based only on the agreement and not the Guidelines,\nand therefore that defendants so sentenced are ineligible\nfor \u00a73582(c)(2) relief. The Government\u2019s position rests in\npart on the concern that the conclusion reached here will\nupset the bargain struck between prosecutor and defen\ndant. See Brief for United States 42\u201343. That, however,\nhas nothing to do with whether a sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d\nthe Guidelines under \u00a73582(c)(2). And in any event, the\nconcern is overstated. Retroactive reductions to sentenc\ning ranges are infrequent, so the problem will not arise\noften.

Rev. 519, 535 (2009).\nMore important, the district court\u2019s authority under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) is subject to significant constraints, constraints\nthat can be enforced by appellate review.\n   The binding policy statement governing \u00a73582(c)(2)\nmotions places considerable limits on district court discre\ntion. All Guidelines decisions from the original sentencing\nremain in place, save the sentencing range that was al\ntered by retroactive amendment. USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). In\nan initial sentencing hearing, a district court can vary\nbelow the Guidelines; but, by contrast, below-Guidelines\nmodifications in \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings are forbidden,\nUSSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A), except where the original sen\ntence was itself a downward departure. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(B).\nAnd the court must always \u201cconsider the nature and seri\nousness of the danger to any person or the community that\nmay be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of\nimprisonment.\u201d \u00a71B1.10, comment., n. 1(B)(ii). The dis\ntrict court\u2019s authority is limited; and the Courts of Ap\npeals, and ultimately this Court, can ensure that district\ncourts do not overhaul plea agreements, thereby abusing\ntheir authority under \u00a73582(c)(2). See Dillon v. United\nStates, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (reviewing and affirming a\n\u00a73582(c)(2) sentence reduction); Gall, 552 U. S., at 49 (all\nsentences are reviewable for abuse of discretion).\n   The Government would enact a categorical bar on\n\u00a73582(c)(2) relief. But such a bar would prevent district\ncourts from making an inquiry that is within their own\nspecial knowledge and expertise. What is at stake in this\ncase is a defendant\u2019s eligibility for relief, not the extent of\nthat relief. Indeed, even where a defendant is permitted\nto seek a reduction, the district judge may conclude that a\nreduction would be inappropriate. District judges have a\ncontinuing professional commitment, based on scholarship\nand accumulated experience, to a consistent sentencing\npolicy. They can rely on the frameworks they have de\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

They may,\nwhen considering a \u00a73582(c)(2) motion, take into account\na defendant\u2019s decision to enter into an 11(c)(1)(C) agree\nment. If the district court, based on its experience and\ninformed judgment, concludes the agreement led to a more\nlenient sentence than would otherwise have been imposed,\nit can deny the motion, for the statute permits but does\nnot require the court to reduce a sentence. This discretion\nensures that \u00a73582(c)(2) does not produce a windfall.\n   As noted, the opinion concurring in the judgment sug\ngests an intermediate position. That opinion argues that\nin general defendants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreements are ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2) relief, but relief\nmay be sought where the plea agreement itself contem\nplates sentence reduction. The statute, however, calls for\nan inquiry into the reasons for a judge\u2019s sentence, not the\nreasons that motivated or informed the parties. If, as the\nGovernment suggests, the judge\u2019s decision to impose a\nsentence is based on the agreement, then \u00a73582(c)(2)\ndoes not apply. The parties cannot by contract upset an\notherwise-final sentence. And the consequences of this\nerroneous rule would be significant. By allowing modifica\ntion only when the terms of the agreement contemplate it,\nthe proposed rule would permit the very disparities the\nSentencing Reform Act seeks to eliminate.\n   The Act aims to create a comprehensive sentencing\nscheme in which those who commit crimes of similar\nseverity under similar conditions receive similar sen\ntences.    See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(6); K. Stith & J.\nCabranes, Fear of Judging 104\u2013105 (1998).            Section\n3582(c)(2) contributes to that goal by ensuring that district\ncourts may adjust sentences imposed pursuant to a range\nthat the Commission concludes are too severe, out of step\nwith the seriousness of the crime and the sentencing\nranges of analogous offenses, and inconsistent with the\n10               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nAct\u2019s purposes.\n   The crack-cocaine range here is a prime example of an\nunwarranted disparity that \u00a73582(c)(2) is designed to cure.\nThe Commission amended the crack-cocaine Guidelines\nto effect a \u201cpartial remedy\u201d for the \u201curgent and compel\nling\u201d problem of crack-cocaine sentences, which, the Com\nmission concluded, \u201csignificantly undermines the various\ncongressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Re\nform Act.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Report\nto Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy,\npp. 8\u201310 (May 2007); see also USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.\n706; Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 99\u2013100\n(2007). The Commission determined that those Guide\nlines were flawed, and therefore that sentences that relied\non them ought to be reexamined. There is no good reason\nto extend the benefit of the Commission\u2019s judgment only to\nan arbitrary subset of defendants whose agreed sentences\nwere accepted in light of a since-rejected Guidelines range\nbased on whether their plea agreements refer to the\nGuidelines. Congress enacted \u00a73582(c)(2) to remedy sys\ntemic injustice, and the approach outlined in the opinion\nconcurring in the judgment would undercut a systemic\nsolution.\n   Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agree\nment, the judge\u2019s decision to accept the plea and impose\nthe recommended sentence is likely to be based on the\nGuidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligi\nble to seek \u00a73582(c)(2) relief. This straightforward analy\nsis would avoid making arbitrary distinctions between\nsimilar defendants based on the terms of their plea\nagreements. And it would also reduce unwarranted dis\nparities in federal sentencing, consistent with the pur\nposes of the Sentencing Reform Act.\n                        *    *    *\n     The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. C.\n\u00a73582(c)(2), but I differ as to the reason why. In my view,\nthe term of imprisonment imposed by a district court\npursuant to an agreement authorized by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) is \u201cbased\non\u201d the agreement itself, not on the judge\u2019s calculation of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines. However, I believe that if a (C)\nagreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range\napplicable to the charged offense to establish the term of\nimprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, the term of\nimprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d the range employed and\nthe defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under\n\u00a73582(c)(2).\n                                I\n  To ask whether a particular term of imprisonment is\n\u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range is to ask\nwhether that range serves as the basis or foundation for\nthe term of imprisonment. No term of imprisonment\u2014\n2                FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhether derived from a (C) agreement or otherwise\u2014has\nlegal effect until the court enters judgment imposing it.\nAs a result, in applying \u00a73582(c)(2) a court must discern\nthe foundation for the term of imprisonment imposed by\nthe sentencing judge. As the plurality explains, in the\nnormal course the district judge\u2019s calculation of the Guide\nlines range applicable to the charged offenses will serve as\nthe basis for the term of imprisonment imposed. See ante,\nat 5; see also Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007).\n   Sentencing under (C) agreements, however, is different.\nAt the time of sentencing, the term of imprisonment im\nposed pursuant to a (C) agreement does not involve the\ncourt\u2019s independent calculation of the Guidelines or con\nsideration of the other 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) factors. The\ncourt may only accept or reject the agreement, and if\nit chooses to accept it, at sentencing the court may only\nimpose the term of imprisonment the agreement calls for;\nthe court may not change its terms. See Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 11(c)(3)(A) (\u201cTo the extent the plea agreement is of\nthe type specified in [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)], the court may\naccept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until\nthe court has reviewed the presentence report\u201d); Advisory\nCommittee\u2019s Notes on 1979 Amendments to Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 583\u2013584 (1982 ed.)\n(\u201c[C]ritical to a . . .

Green, 595 F. 3d 432, 438 (CA2 2010).\n   In the (C) agreement context, therefore, it is the binding\nplea agreement that is the foundation for the term of im\nprisonment to which the defendant is sentenced. At the\nmoment of sentencing, the court simply implements the\nterms of the agreement it has already accepted. Contrary\nto the plurality\u2019s view, see ante, at 5\u20136, the fact that USSG\n\u00a76B1.2(c) (Nov. 2010) instructs a district court to use the\nGuidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to accept a\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(C) agreement does not mean that the term of imprison\nment imposed by the court is \u201cbased on\u201d a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range. The term of imprisonment\nimposed by the sentencing judge is dictated by the terms\nof the agreement entered into by the parties, not the\njudge\u2019s Guidelines calculation. In short, the term of im\nprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement is, for\npurposes of \u00a73582(c)(2), \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself.\n   To hold otherwise would be to contravene the very pur\npose of (C) agreements\u2014to bind the district court and\nallow the Government and the defendant to determine\nwhat sentence he will receive. Although district courts\nordinarily have significant discretion in determining the\nappropriate sentence to be imposed on a particular defen\ndant, see Gall, 552 U. S., at 46, under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) it\nis the parties\u2019 agreement that determines the sentence to\nbe imposed, see Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on 1999\nAmendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App.,\np. 1570 (2000 ed.) (noting that, under a (C) agreement,\n\u201cthe government and defense have actually agreed on\nwhat amounts to an appropriate sentence . . . . [T]his\nagreement is binding on the court once the court accepts\nit\u201d). To be sure, the court \u201cretains absolute discretion\nwhether to accept a plea agreement,\u201d ibid., but once it\ndoes it is bound at sentencing to give effect to the parties\u2019\nagreement as to the appropriate term of imprisonment.\n   Allowing district courts later to reduce a term of im\nprisonment simply because the court itself considered\nthe Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the agree\nment would transform \u00a73582(c)(2) into a mechanism by\nwhich courts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in\nways not contemplated by the parties. At the time that\n\u00a73582(c)(2) was enacted in 1984, it was already well un\nderstood that, under Rule 11, the term of imprisonment\nstipulated in a (C) agreement bound the district court once\nit accepted the agreement. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n4                  FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n11(e)(1) (1982) (specifying that the parties to a (C) agree\nment may \u201cagree that a specific sentence is the appropri\nate disposition of the case\u201d); United States v.

Dillon\nv. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)\n(\u201cCongress intended [\u00a73582(c)(2)] to authorize only a\nlimited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence\u201d).\n   By the same token, the mere fact that the parties to a\n(C) agreement may have considered the Guidelines in the\ncourse of their negotiations does not empower the court\nunder \u00a73582(c)(2) to reduce the term of imprisonment they\nultimately agreed upon, as Freeman argues. Undoubt\nedly, he is correct that in most cases the Government and\nthe defendant will negotiate the term of imprisonment in a\n(C) agreement by reference to the applicable Guidelines\nprovisions. See Brief for Petitioner 30\u201331 (\u201c[T]he Guide\nlines are . . . the starting point and initial benchmark for\nplea negotiations\u201d); Brief for United States 33 (noting the\n\u201cconcededly strong likelihood that the parties will . . .\ncalculat[e] and conside[r] potential Guidelines ranges in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Prior\n          to 2002, Rule 11\u2019s provisions governing binding plea agree\nments were located in Rule 11(e)(1)(C). In substance they were largely\nidentical to the current rules in 11(c)(1)(C). See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n11(e)(1)(C) (2000).\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

This only makes sense; plea bargain\ning necessarily occurs in the shadow of the sentencing\nscheme to which the defendant would otherwise be sub\nject. See United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 255\n(2005) (\u201c[P]lea bargaining takes place in the shadow of . . .\na potential trial\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   The term of imprisonment imposed by the district court,\nhowever, is not \u201cbased on\u201d those background negotia-\ntions; instead, as explained above, it is based on the binding\nagreement produced by those negotiations. I therefore\ncannot agree with Freeman that \u00a73582(c)(2) calls upon\ndistrict courts to engage in a free-ranging search through\nthe parties\u2019 negotiating history in search of a Guidelines\nsentencing range that might have been relevant to the\nagreement or the court\u2019s acceptance of it. Nor can I agree\nwith the plurality that the district judge\u2019s calculation of\nthe Guidelines provides the basis for the term of impris\nonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement.\n                                II\n  These conclusions, however, do not mean that a term of\nimprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement can\nnever be reduced under \u00a73582(c)(2), as the Government\ncontends. For example, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties\nto \u201cagree that a specific . . . sentencing range is the appro\npriate disposition of the case.\u201d In delineating the agreed\nupon term of imprisonment, some (C) agreements may\ncall for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range. In such cases, the district\ncourt\u2019s acceptance of the agreement obligates the court to\nsentence the defendant accordingly, and there can be no\ndoubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is\n\u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range within the\nmeaning of \u00a73582(c)(2). If that Guidelines range is sub\nsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the de\n6                   FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfendant is eligible for sentence reduction.\n  Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific\nterm of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but\nalso make clear that the basis for the specified term is\na Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense\nto which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that\nsentencing range is evident from the agreement itself, for\npurposes of \u00a73582(c)(2) the term of imprisonment imposed\nby the court in accordance with that agreement is \u201cbased\non\u201d that range. Therefore, when a (C) agreement ex\npressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently\nlowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for\nsentence reduction under \u00a73582(c)(2).2\n  In so holding, I necessarily reject the categorical rule\nadvanced by the Government and endorsed by the dissent,\nwhich artificially divorces a (C) agreement from its ex\npress terms.3 Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thedissent suggests that this rule results from a \u201cmistaken shift in\nanalysis\u201d in this opinion from the actions of the judge to the intent of\nthe parties. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The purpose of a\n(C) agreement, however, is to bind the sentencing court to the terms\nagreed upon by the parties. See supra, at 3\u20134. Therefore, to determine\nwhether a sentence imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement was \u201cbased\non\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range, the reviewing court must necessar\nily look to the agreement itself.\n   3 The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this ques\n\ntion have taken approaches consistent with the one I take today. See\nUnited States v. Rivera-Mart\u00ednez, 607 F. 3d 283, 286\u2013287 (CA1 2010);\nUnited States v. Ray, 598 F. 3d 407, 409\u2013410 (CA7 2010); United States\nv.

It appears that only the Third Circuit\nhas applied the absolute rule advanced by the Government. See United\nStates v. Sanchez, 562 F. 3d 275, 282, and n. 8 (2009). As noted by the\nplurality, see ante, at 1, even the Sixth Circuit allows for sentence\nreduction \u201cto avoid a miscarriage of justice or to correct a mutual\nmistake,\u201d United States v. Peveler, 359 F. 3d 369, 378, n. 4 (2004) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).

When a (C) agree\nment explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentenc\ning range to establish the term of imprisonment, the\nagreement itself demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent that\nthe imposed term of imprisonment will be based on that\nrange, as required for sentence reduction under the stat\nute.5    The Government\u2019s concern that application of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFreeman. See United States v. Garcia, 606 F. 3d 209, 214 (CA5 2010)\n(per curiam); United States v. Cobb, 584 F. 3d 979, 985 (CA10 2009).\n    4 The dissent contends that, even when a (C) agreement expressly\n\nuses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprison\nment, the district court imposing a sentence pursuant to that agree\nment does not \u201cappl[y]\u201d that range within the meaning of the appli\ncable Guidelines policy statement. See post, at 4\u20135 (citing USSG\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(1) (Nov. 2010)). But in so arguing, the dissent\u2014like the\nGovernment\u2014would have courts ignore the agreement\u2019s express terms,\nwhich the court \u201capplie[s]\u201d when imposing the term of imprisonment.\n    5 The plurality asserts that \u201c[t]here is no good reason to extend the\n\nbenefit [of sentence reduction] only to an arbitrary subset of defendants\n. . . based on whether their plea agreements refer to the Guidelines.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But the \u201cgood reason\u201d is evident: Rule 11(c)(1)(C)\u2019s entire\npurpose is to allow the parties\u2019 intent to determine sentencing out\ncomes. See supra, at 3\u20134. If a (C) agreement does not indicate the\nparties\u2019 intent to base the term of imprisonment on a particular Guide\nlines range subsequently lowered by the Commission, then \u00a73582(c)(2)\nsimply does not apply.\n8                  FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a73582(c)(2) to (C) agreements will result in certain defen\ndants receiving an \u201cunjustified windfall\u201d is therefore mis\nplaced. See Brief for United States 40, 43.\n  Furthermore, in cases where the Government believes\nthat even the limited sentence reduction authorized by\n\u00a73582(c)(2) and USSG \u00a71B1.10 improperly benefits the\ndefendant, it can argue to the district court that the court\nshould not exercise its discretion under the statute to\nreduce the sentence.6 See Dillon, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (noting that, in applying \u00a73582(c)(2), the court\nmust \u201cconsider whether the authorized reduction is war\nranted, either in whole or in part, according to the factors\nset forth in [18 U. S. C.] \u00a73553(a)\u201d).\n  Finally, if the Government wants to ensure ex ante that\na particular defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment will not be\nreduced later, the solution is simple enough: Nothing\nprevents the Government from negotiating with a defen\ndant to secure a waiver of his statutory right to seek sen\ntence reduction under \u00a73582(c)(2), just as it often does\nwith respect to a defendant\u2019s rights to appeal and collater\nally attack the conviction and sentence.7 See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73742; 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III); see also\nApp. 28a\u201329a (provision in Freeman\u2019s agreement ex\npressly waiving both rights). In short, application of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, the district court might decline to reduce the term of\n\nimprisonment of an eligible defendant in light of the Government\u2019s\nargument that it made significant concessions in the agreement\u2014such\nas dropping a charge or forgoing a future charge\u2014and therefore it\nwould not have agreed to a lower sentence at the time the agreement\nwas made.\n  7 The opposite would not necessarily be true, however, under the\n\nreading of \u00a73582(c)(2) proposed by the Government and the dissent. If\na district court has no statutory authority to reduce a term of impris\nonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement\u2014because such a term is\nnever \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range within the meaning of\n\u00a73582(c)(2)\u2014it is not clear how the parties could effectively confer that\nauthority upon the court by the terms of their agreement.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Free\nman\u2019s agreement does.\n   The agreement states that Freeman \u201cagrees to have his\nsentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide\nlines,\u201d App. 28a, and that 106 months is the total term of\nimprisonment to be imposed, id., at 26a. The agreement\nalso makes clear that the \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) count to which\nFreeman agrees to plead guilty carries a minimum sen\ntence of 60 months, \u201cwhich must be served consecutively\nto\u201d any other sentence imposed. Id., at 27a. This leaves\n46 months unaccounted for. The agreement sets Free\nman\u2019s offense level at 19, as determined by the quantity of\ndrugs and his acceptance of responsibility, and states that\nthe parties anticipate a criminal history category of IV.\nId., at 27a\u201328a. Looking to the Sentencing Guidelines,\nan offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of\nIV produce a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months.8 See\nUSSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Therefore, contrary\nto the dissent\u2019s curious suggestion that \u201cthere is no way\nof knowing what th[e] sentence was \u2018based on,\u2019 \u201d post, at 6,\nit is evident that Freeman\u2019s agreement employed the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Because it is the parties\u2019 agreement that controls in the (C) agree\n\nment context, see supra, at 3\u20134, even if the District Court had calcu\nlated the range differently than the parties, see post, at 8 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting), Freeman would still be eligible for resentencing, as\nlong as the parties\u2019 chosen range was one that was \u201csubsequently . . .\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n10                  FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n46-month figure at the bottom end of this sentencing range,\nin combination with the 60-month mandatory minimum\nsentence under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A), to establish his 106-month\nsentence.9 Thus the first of \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s conditions is\nsatisfied\u2014Freeman\u2019s term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d a\nGuidelines sentencing range.\n   In 2007 the Commission amended the Guidelines provi\nsions applicable to cocaine base offenses, such that the\noffense level applicable to the quantity of drugs for which\nFreeman was charged was lowered from 22 to 20. See\nApp. 142a\u2013143a (Sealed); USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706.\nTaking into account the three-level reduction for accep\ntance of responsibility, Freeman\u2019s recalculated offense\nlevel is 17, resulting in an amended sentencing range of 37\nto 46 months. Thus there can be no doubt that the Guide\nlines sentencing range originally used to establish Free\nman\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201chas subsequently been\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The dissent asks whether Freeman would be eligible for sentence\n\nreduction if the agreement had called for a 53-month term of impris\nonment. See post, at 7. Though that question is not presented by the\nfacts of this case, the answer is evident from the foregoing discussion: If\nthe agreement itself made clear that the parties arrived at the 53\nmonth term of imprisonment by determining the sentencing range ap\nplicable to Freeman\u2019s offenses and then halving the 106-month figure\nat its low end, he would have been eligible under \u00a73582(c)(2). See\nUnited States v. Franklin, 600 F. 3d 893, 897 (CA7 2010) (noting that a\n(C) agreement would not foreclose relief under \u00a73582(c)(2) if it provided\nthat the term of imprisonment was to be 40 percent below the low end\nof the applicable sentencing range).\n   Of course, if a (C) agreement \u201cdoes not contain any references to the\nGuidelines,\u201d post, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), there is no way of\nknowing whether the agreement \u201cuse[d] a Guidelines sentencing range\nto establish the term of imprisonment,\u201d supra, at 6, and a prisoner\nsentenced under such an agreement would not be eligible. It is there\nfore unclear why the dissent believes that the straightforward inquiry\ncalled for by the rule I apply today will \u201cfoster confusion\u201d among the\nlower courts. Post, at 7. This approach is consistent with the one\nalready taken by most Courts of Appeals, see n. 3, supra, and there\nis no indication that they have found it unpalatable, cf. post, at 9.\n                Cite as: 564 U.

In this case, Freeman executed a written plea\nagreement in which the parties \u201cagree[d] that a sentence\nof 106 months\u2019 incarceration [was] the appropriate disposi\u00ad\ntion.\u201d App. 26a. Because the plea agreement was entered\npursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), that proposed sentence be\u00ad\ncame binding on the District Court once it accepted the\nagreement. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C) (the\nparties\u2019 \u201crequest\u201d for \u201ca specific sentence\u201d \u201cbinds the court\nonce the court accepts the plea agreement\u201d). As a result,\nwhen determining the sentence to impose on Freeman, the\nDistrict Court needed to consult one thing and one thing\nonly\u2014the plea agreement. See ante, at 2 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (\u201cAt the moment of sentencing, the court\nsimply implements the terms of the agreement it has al\u00ad\nready accepted\u201d).\n   I also agree with JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR that the \u201cterm of\nimprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge is dictated\nby the terms of the agreement entered into by the par\u00ad\nties, not the judge\u2019s Guidelines calculation,\u201d and that\n\u201c[a]l-lowing district courts later to reduce a term of impris\u00ad\nonment simply because the court itself considered the\nGuidelines in deciding whether to accept the agreement\nwould transform \u00a73582(c)(2) into a mechanism by which\ncourts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in ways\nnot contemplated by the parties.\u201d Ante, at 3.\n   But then comes the O.

This\nexception is in my view as mistaken as the position of the\nplurality\u2014and basically for the same reasons.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR begins the departure from her\nown rule innocently enough. As she explains, \u201csome (C)\nagreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced\nwithin a particular Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d Ante, at\n5. In such a case, according to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, there\ncan be \u201cno doubt\u201d that the prison term the court imposes is\n\u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range, and there\u00ad\nfore the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction. Ibid.\n  Whether or not that is true, it provides no support for\nthe next step:\n      \u201cSimilarly, a plea agreement might provide for a\n    specific term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of\n    months\u2014but also make clear that the basis for the\n    specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range appli\u00ad\n    cable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded\n    guilty. As long as that sentencing range is evident\n    from the agreement itself . . . the term of imprison\u00ad\n    ment imposed by the court in accordance with that\n    agreement is \u2018based on\u2019 that range.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n   This category of cases is not \u201csimilar\u201d to the first at all.\nIt is one thing to say that a sentence imposed pursuant to\nan agreement expressly providing that the court will\nsentence the defendant within an applicable Guidelines\nrange is \u201cbased on\u201d that range. It is quite another to\nconclude that an agreement providing for a specific term is\n\u201csimilarly\u201d based on a Guidelines range, simply because\nthe specified term can be said to reflect that range.\n4               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   According to the concurrence, if the parties simply \u201ccon\u00ad\nsider[ ] the Guidelines\u201d or \u201cnegotiate . . . by reference\u201d\nto them, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduc\u00ad\ntion. Ante, at 4. If, however, the agreement sets forth a\nspecific term but it is somehow \u201cclear that the basis for the\nspecified term is a Guidelines sentencing range,\u201d then the\ndefendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. Ante, at 6.\nThis head-scratching distinction between negotiating by\nreference to the Guidelines and using them as a basis for\nthe specified term makes for an unworkable test that can\nyield only arbitrary results.\n   The confusion is compounded by the varying standards\nin the concurrence. Sometimes the test is whether an\nagreement \u201cexpressly uses\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range,\nante, at 1, 6; see ante, at 7 (\u201cexplicitly employs\u201d). Other\ntimes the test is whether such use is \u201cevident,\u201d ante, at 6,\n9; see ante, at 10, n. 9 (\u201cclear\u201d). A third option is whether\nthe agreement \u201cindicate[s] the parties\u2019 intent to base the\nterm of imprisonment on a particular Guideline range.\u201d\nAnte, at 7, n. 5 (emphasis added).\n   The error in the concurring opinion is largely attribut\u00ad\nable to a mistaken shift in analysis. In the first half of the\nopinion, the inquiry properly looks to what the judge does:\nHe is, after all, the one who imposes the sentence. After\napproving the agreement, the judge considers only the\nfixed term in the agreement, so the sentence he actually\nimposes is not \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines.\n   In the second half of the opinion, however, the analysis\nsuddenly shifts, and focuses on the parties: Did they \u201cuse\u201d\nor \u201cemploy\u201d the Guidelines in arriving at the term in their\nagreement?       But \u00a73582(c)(2) is concerned only with\nwhether a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment based on a sentencing range.\u201d Only a court\ncan sentence a defendant, so there is no basis for examin\u00ad\ning why the parties settled on a particular prison term.\n   This conclusion dovetails with USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(1)\u2014\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

(emphasis added).\n   As noted, the District Court sentenced Freeman pursu\u00ad\nant to the term specified by his plea agreement; it never\n\u201capplied\u201d a Guidelines provision in imposing his term of\nimprisonment. The fact that the court may have \u201cuse[d]\nthe Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to ac\u00ad\ncept a (C) agreement does not mean that the term of im\u00ad\nprisonment imposed by the court is \u2018based on\u2019 a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range.\u201d Ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). Even if the Guidelines were \u201cused\u201d or\n\u201cemployed\u201d by the parties in arriving at the Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) sentencing term, they were not \u201capplied when\nthe defendant was sentenced.\u201d Once the District Court\naccepted the agreement, all that was later \u201capplied\u201d was\nthe sentence set forth in that agreement.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR is wrong to assert that her stan\u00ad\ndard \u201cdoes not rewrite the plea agreement\u201d but rather\n\u201cenforces the agreement\u2019s terms.\u201d Ante, at 7. According to\nthe concurrence, \u201c[w]hen a (C) agreement explicitly em\u00ad\nploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, the agreement itself demon\u00ad\nstrates the parties\u2019 intent that the imposed term of im\u00ad\n6               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nprisonment will be based on that range,\u201d and therefore\nsubject to reduction if the Commission subsequently low\u00ad\ners that range. Ibid. In this case, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\nconcludes that Freeman\u2019s agreement contemplated such a\nreduction, even though the parties had \u201cagree[d] that a\nsentence of 106 months\u2019 incarceration is the appropriate\ndisposition of this case.\u201d App. 26a.\n   There is, however, no indication whatever that the par\u00ad\nties to the agreement contemplated the prospect of low\u00ad\nered sentencing ranges. And it is fanciful to suppose that\nthe parties would have said \u201c106 months\u201d if what they\nreally meant was \u201ca sentence at the lowest end of the\napplicable Guidelines range.\u201d Cf. App. 25a (parties in this\ncase recommending \u201ca fine at the lowest end of the appli\u00ad\ncable Guideline Range\u201d). In concluding otherwise, the\nconcurrence \u201cignore[s] the agreement\u2019s express terms.\u201d\nAnte, at 7, n. 4.\n   The reality is that whenever the parties choose a fixed\nterm, there is no way of knowing what that sentence was\n\u201cbased on.\u201d The prosecutor and the defendant could well\nhave had quite different reasons for concluding that 106\nmonths was a good deal. Perhaps the prosecutor wanted\nto devote the limited resources of his office to a different\narea of criminal activity, rather than try this case. Per\u00ad\nhaps the defendant had reason to question the credibility\nof one of his key witnesses, and feared a longer sentence if\nthe case went to trial.\n   Indeed, the fact that there may be uncertainty about\nhow to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range could be\nthe basis for agreement on a fixed term in a plea under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). Here the agreement made clear that\nthere was some doubt about the Guidelines calculations.\nSee App. 28a (\u201cBoth parties reserve the right to object to\nthe USSG \u00a74A1.1 calculation of defendant\u2019s criminal\nhistory\u201d); ibid. (the parties acknowledge that their Guide\u00ad\nlines calculations \u201care not binding upon the Court\u201d and\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

[the] Sentencing Guideline\napplication\u201d).\n   In addition, parties frequently enter plea agreements\nthat reflect prosecutorial decisions not to pursue particu\u00ad\nlar counts. If a defendant faces three counts, and agrees\nto plead to one if the prosecutor does not pursue the other\ntwo, is the sentence reflected in the Rule 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreement in any sense \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines sentenc\u00ad\ning range for the one count to which the defendant\npleaded? Surely not. The concurrence tacitly concedes as\nmuch when it suggests that an agreement to \u201cdrop[ ] a\ncharge or forgo[ ] a future charge\u201d could ultimately be\ngrounds for not reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence. Ante,\nat 8, n. 6. But what this really shows is a basic flaw in the\n\u201cbased on\u201d test adopted by that opinion.\n   Finally, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s approach will foster con\u00ad\nfusion in an area in need of clarity. As noted, courts\nwill be hard pressed to apply the distinction between\nreferring to and relying on a Guidelines range. Other\nquestions abound:\n   What if the agreement contains a particular Guidelines\ncalculation but the agreement\u2019s stipulated sentence is out\u00ad\nside the parties\u2019 predicted Guidelines range? The test\nin the concurring opinion is whether the agreement \u201cuses\u201d\nor \u201cemploys\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, ante, at 1, not whether that\nterm falls within the range. In this case, what if the term\nwas 53 months\u2014exactly half the low end of the sentencing\nrange anticipated by the parties? Is it \u201cevident\u201d in that\ncase that the Guidelines were used or employed to estab\u00ad\nlish the agreed-upon sentence?*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR responds that \u201c[i]f the agreement itself made\n8                 FREEMAN v.

This is no\nacademic hypothetical. See, e.g., United States v. Frank\nlin, 600 F. 3d 893, 896\u2013897 (CA7 2010) (noting that \u201cthe\ndistrict court settled on a higher guidelines range than\nthat contemplated in the [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)] plea agree\u00ad\nment\u201d). Is a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentence still subject to\nreduction if the parties relied on the wrong sentencing\nrange? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s surprising answer is \u201cyes,\u201d\nsee ante, at 9, n. 8, even though the governing Guide\u00ad\nlines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible\nfor sentence reduction if the amended Guideline has \u201cthe\neffect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline\nrange\u201d\u2014presumably the correct applicable guideline\nrange. See USSG \u00a71B1.10(a)(2), p. s. Relying on error is\njust one unforeseen consequence of looking not to the\nspecified term in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, but instead\ntrying to reconstruct what led the parties to agree to that\nterm in the first place.\n   This confusion will invite the very thing JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR claims to disavow: a \u201cfree-ranging search\u201d by\ndistrict courts \u201cthrough the parties\u2019 negotiating history in\nsearch of a Guidelines sentencing range that might have\nbeen relevant to the agreement.\u201d Ante, at 5.

Argued February 23, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nIn order to reduce unwarranted federal sentencing disparities, the Sen\n  tencing Reform Act of 1984 authorizes the United States Sentencing\n  Commission to create, and to retroactively amend, Sentencing Guide\n  lines to inform judicial discretion. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) per\n  mits a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n  \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been\n  lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction.\n  This case concerns \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s application to cases in which the de\n  fendant and the Government have entered into a plea agreement un\n  der Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which permits\n  the parties to \u201cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is\n  the appropriate disposition of the case,\u201d and \u201cbinds the court [to the\n  agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.\u201d\n     Petitioner Freeman was indicted for various crimes, including pos\n  sessing with intent to distribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1).\n  He entered into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to plead guilty to all\n  charges; in return the Government agreed to a 106-month sentence.\n  The agreement states that the parties independently reviewed the\n  applicable Guidelines, noted that Freeman agreed to have his sen\n  tence determined under the Guidelines, and reflected the parties\u2019 un\n  derstanding that the agreed-to sentence corresponded with the\n  minimum sentence suggested by the applicable Guidelines range of\n  46 to 57 months, along with a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60\n  months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\n  crime under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1)(A). Three years after the District\n  Court accepted the plea agreement, the Commission issued a retroac\n  tive Guidelines amendment to remedy the significant disparity be\n  tween the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses.\n2                    FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Because the amendment\u2019s effect was to reduce Freeman\u2019s applicable\n    sentencing range to 37 to 46 months plus the consecutive 60-month\n    mandatory minimum, he moved for a sentence reduction under\n    \u00a73582(c)(2). However, the District Court denied the motion, and the\n    Sixth Circuit affirmed because its precedent rendered defendants\n    sentenced pursuant to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements ineligible for\n    \u00a73582(c)(2) relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n355 Fed. Appx. 1, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER,\n  and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that defendants who enter into\n  11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence as a condi\n  tion of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp.\n  5\u201310.\n     (a) The text and purpose of the statute, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), and the\n  governing Guidelines policy statements compel the conclusion that\n  the district court has authority to entertain \u00a73582(c)(2) motions when\n  sentences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defen\n  dant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The district judge must,\n  in every case, impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than nec\n  essary, to comply with\u201d the purposes of federal sentencing, in light of\n  the Guidelines and other relevant factors. \u00a73553(a). The Guidelines\n  provide a framework or starting point\u2014a basis, in the term\u2019s com\n  monsense meaning\u2014for the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion. Rule\n  11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to agree on a\n  specific sentence, but that agreement does not discharge the district\n  court\u2019s independent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual\n  sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge\u2019s reliance on the\n  Guidelines will be apparent when the judge uses the Guidelines\n  range as the starting point in the analysis and imposes a sentence\n  within the range. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49. Even\n  where the judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the\n  judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the\n  deviation, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sen\n  tence. The parties\u2019 recommended sentence binds the court \u201conce the\n  court accepts the plea agreement,\u201d Rule 11(c)(1)(C), but the relevant\n  policy statement forbids the judge to accept an agreement without\n  first giving due consideration to the applicable Guidelines sentencing\n  range, even if the parties recommend a specific sentence as a condi\n  tion of the guilty plea, see U. S. Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\n  Manual \u00a76B1.2. This approach finds further support in the policy\n  statement applicable to \u00a73582(c)(2) motions, which instructs the dis\n  trict court in modifying a sentence to substitute the retroactive\n  amendment, but to leave all original Guidelines determinations in\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nplace, \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). Pp. 5\u20137.\n   (b) Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the Dis\ntrict Court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence\nwas appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range. Its deci\nsion was therefore \u201cbased on\u201d that range within \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s mean\ning. P. 7.\n   (c) The Government\u2019s argument that sentences that follow an\n11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based only on the agreement itself and not\nthe Guidelines, and are therefore ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2) reduction,\nmust be rejected. Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreement, the judge\u2019s decision to accept the plea and impose the\nrecommended sentence is likely to be based on the Guidelines; and\nwhen it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek \u00a73582(c)(2) relief.\nPp. 7\u201310.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concluded that if an agreement under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) expressly uses\na Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to es\ntablish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission, the prison term is \u201cbased on\u201d\nthe range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduc\ntion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp. 1\u201311.\n   (a) The term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant\nto a (C) agreement is \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself, not on the\njudge\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines sentencing range. To hold oth\nerwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreements\u2014to\nbind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant\nto determine what sentence he will receive. Pp. 1\u20135.\n   (b) This does not mean, however, that a term of imprisonment im\nposed under a (C) agreement can never be reduced under \u00a73582(c)(2).\nBecause the very purpose of a (C) agreement is to allow the parties to\ndetermine the defendant\u2019s sentence, when the agreement itself em\nploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the\ncharged offenses in establishing the term of imprisonment imposed\nby the district court, the defendant is eligible to have his sentence re\nduced under \u00a73582(c)(2). Pp. 5\u20139.\n   (c) Freeman is eligible. The offense level and criminal history cate\ngory set forth in his (C) agreement produce a sentencing range of 46\nto 57 months; it is evident that the parties combined the 46-month\nfigure at the low end of the range with the 60-month mandatory\nminimum sentence under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) to establish the 106-month\nsentence called for in the agreement. Under the amended Guide\nlines, however, the applicable sentencing range is now 37 to 46\nmonths. Therefore, Freeman\u2019s prison term is \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing\nrange that \u201chas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com\n4                    FREEMAN v.

S. C. \u00a73551\net seq., calls for the creation of Sentencing Guidelines to\ninform judicial discretion in order to reduce unwarranted\ndisparities in federal sentencing. The Act allows retro\nactive amendments to the Guidelines for cases where\nthe Guidelines become a cause of inequality, not a bulwark\nagainst it. When a retroactive Guideline amendment is\nadopted, \u00a73582(c)(2) permits defendants sentenced based\non a sentencing range that has been modified to move for\na reduced sentence.\n  The question here is whether defendants who enter into\nplea agreements that recommend a particular sentence\nas a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief\nunder \u00a73582(c)(2). See Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C)\n(authorizing such plea agreements). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit held that, barring a miscarriage of\njustice or mutual mistake, defendants who enter into\n11(c)(1)(C) agreements cannot benefit from retroactive\nGuideline amendments.\n  Five Members of the Court agree that this judgment\nmust be reversed. The Justices who join this plurality\nopinion conclude that the categorical bar enacted by the\n2               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nCourt of Appeals finds no support in \u00a73582(c)(2), Rule\n11(c)(1)(C), or the relevant Guidelines policy statements.\nIn every case the judge must exercise discretion to im\npose an appropriate sentence. This discretion, in turn, is\nframed by the Guidelines. And the Guidelines must be\nconsulted, in the regular course, whether the case is one in\nwhich the conviction was after a trial or after a plea,\nincluding a plea pursuant to an agreement that recom\nmends a particular sentence. The district judge\u2019s decision\nto impose a sentence may therefore be based on the Guide\nlines even if the defendant agrees to plead guilty under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). Where the decision to impose a sentence\nis based on a range later subject to retroactive amend\nment, \u00a73582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.\n   Section 3582(c)(2) empowers district judges to correct sen\ntences that depend on frameworks that later prove un\njustified. There is no reason to deny \u00a73582(c)(2) relief to\ndefendants who linger in prison pursuant to sentences\nthat would not have been imposed but for a since-rejected,\nexcessive range.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reverse the judgment on a\ndifferent ground set out in the opinion concurring in the\njudgment. That opinion, like the dissent, would hold that\nsentences following 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based on the\nagreement rather than the Guidelines, and therefore that\n\u00a73582(c)(2) relief is not available in the typical case. But\nunlike the dissent she would permit the petitioner here to\nseek a sentence reduction because his plea agreement in\nexpress terms ties the recommended sentence to the\nGuidelines sentencing range.\n   The reasons that lead those Members of the Court who\njoin this plurality opinion may be set forth as follows.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Federal courts are forbidden, as a general matter, to\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

C. \u00a73582(c); but the rule of finality is subject to a\nfew narrow exceptions. Here, the exception is contained in\na statutory provision enacted to permit defendants whose\nGuidelines sentencing range has been lowered by retro\nactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction if the\nterms of the statute are met. The statute provides:\n    \u201cIn the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to\n    a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range\n    that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing\n    Commission pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 994(o) . . . the\n    court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after\n    considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to\n    the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction\n    is consistent with applicable policy statements issued\n    by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n  This case concerns the application of the statute to cases\nin which defendants enter into plea agreements under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). That Rule permits the parties to \u201cagree\nthat a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appro\npriate disposition of the case, . . . [a request which] binds\nthe court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u201d The\nquestion is whether defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreements that specify a particular sentence may be said\nto have been sentenced \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing\nrange, making them eligible for relief under \u00a73582(c)(2).\n                            B\n   Petitioner William Freeman was indicted in 2005 for\nvarious crimes, including possessing with intent to dis\ntribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1); (b)(1)(C). He\nentered into an agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in which\nhe agreed to plead guilty to all charges. In return the\nGovernment \u201cagree[d] that a sentence of 106 months\u2019 in\ncarceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.\u201d\n4               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nApp. 26a. The agreement states that \u201c[b]oth parties have\nindependently reviewed the Sentencing Guidelines appli\ncable in this case,\u201d and that \u201c[Freeman] agrees to have his\nsentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide\nlines.\u201d The agreement reflects the parties\u2019 expectation\nthat Freeman would face a Guidelines range of 46 to 57\nmonths, id., at 27a\u201328a (Offense Level 19, Criminal His\ntory Category IV), along with a consecutive mandatory\nminimum of 60 months for possessing a firearm in fur\ntherance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U.

The District Court, however, denied the\nmotion, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\naffirmed. United States v. Goins, 355 Fed. Appx. 1 (2009).\nAdhering to its decision in United States v. Peveler, 359\nF. 3d 369 (2004), the Court of Appeals held that defen\ndants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that\nspecify a particular sentence are ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2)\nrelief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II\n  Federal sentencing law requires the district judge in\nevery case to impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary, to comply with\u201d the purposes of federal\nsentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other \u00a73553(a)\nfactors. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a). The Guidelines provide a\nframework or starting point\u2014a basis, in the commonsense\nmeaning of the term\u2014for the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion.\nE.g., 1 Oxford English Dictionary 977 (2d ed. 1989). Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to\nagree that a specific sentence is appropriate, but that\nagreement does not discharge the district court\u2019s inde\npendent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual\nsentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge\u2019s\nreliance on the Guidelines will be apparent, for the judge\nwill use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the\nanalysis and impose a sentence within the range. Gall v.\nUnited States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007). Even where the\njudge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the\njudge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to\nexplain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines\nare in a real sense a basis for the sentence.\n  Rule 11(c)(1)(C) makes the parties\u2019 recommended sen\ntence binding on the court \u201conce the court accepts the plea\nagreement,\u201d but the governing policy statement confirms\nthat the court\u2019s acceptance is itself based on the Guide\n6               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nlines. See USSG \u00a76B1.2. That policy statement forbids\nthe district judge to accept an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement with\nout first evaluating the recommended sentence in light\nof the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range. The com\nmentary to \u00a76B1.2 advises that a court may accept an\n11(c)(1)(C) agreement \u201conly if the court is satisfied either\nthat such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the\napplicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence de\nparts from the applicable guideline range for justifiable\nreasons.\u201d Cf. Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36 (1993)\n(Guidelines commentary is authoritative). Any bargain\nbetween the parties is contingent until the court accepts\nthe agreement. The Guidelines require the district judge\nto give due consideration to the relevant sentencing range,\neven if the defendant and prosecutor recommend a specific\nsentence as a condition of the guilty plea.\n   This approach finds further support in the policy state\nment that applies to \u00a73582(c)(2) motions. See USSG\n\u00a71B1.10. It instructs the district court in modifying a\nsentence to substitute only the retroactive amendment\nand then leave all original Guidelines determinations in\nplace. \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). In other words, the policy statement\nseeks to isolate whatever marginal effect the since\nrejected Guideline had on the defendant\u2019s sentence. Work\ning backwards from this purpose, \u00a73582(c)(2) modification\nproceedings should be available to permit the district\ncourt to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the\nsentencing range in question was a relevant part of the\nanalytic framework the judge used to determine the sen\ntence or to approve the agreement. This is the only rule\nconsistent with the governing policy statement, a state\nment that rests on the premise that a Guideline range\nmay be one of many factors that determine the sentence\nimposed.\n   Thus, the text and purpose of the three relevant\nsources\u2014the statute, the Rule, and the governing policy\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

App. 47a, 49a.\nIt explained that it \u201cconsidered the advisory guidelines\nand 18 USC 3553(a),\u201d and that \u201cthe sentence imposed . . .\nfall[s] within the guideline rang[e] and [is] sufficient to\nmeet the objectives of the law.\u201d Id., at 48a\u201349a. Apart\nfrom the defense attorney\u2019s initial statement that the case\ninvolved a \u201c(C) plea,\u201d id., at 47a, the hearing proceeded as\nif the agreement did not exist. The court expressed its\nindependent judgment that the sentence was appropriate\nin light of the applicable Guidelines range, and its decision\nwas therefore \u201cbased on\u201d that range.\n                             IV\n   The Government asks this Court to hold that sentences\nlike petitioner\u2019s, which follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement,\nare based only on the agreement and not the Guidelines,\nand therefore that defendants so sentenced are ineligible\nfor \u00a73582(c)(2) relief. The Government\u2019s position rests in\npart on the concern that the conclusion reached here will\nupset the bargain struck between prosecutor and defen\ndant. See Brief for United States 42\u201343. That, however,\nhas nothing to do with whether a sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d\nthe Guidelines under \u00a73582(c)(2). And in any event, the\nconcern is overstated. Retroactive reductions to sentenc\ning ranges are infrequent, so the problem will not arise\noften. Thompson, DOJ\u2019s Attack on Federal Judicial \u201cLeni\nency,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s Response, and the Future of\n8                FREEMAN v.

Rev. 519, 535 (2009).\nMore important, the district court\u2019s authority under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) is subject to significant constraints, constraints\nthat can be enforced by appellate review.\n   The binding policy statement governing \u00a73582(c)(2)\nmotions places considerable limits on district court discre\ntion. All Guidelines decisions from the original sentencing\nremain in place, save the sentencing range that was al\ntered by retroactive amendment. USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(1). In\nan initial sentencing hearing, a district court can vary\nbelow the Guidelines; but, by contrast, below-Guidelines\nmodifications in \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings are forbidden,\nUSSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A), except where the original sen\ntence was itself a downward departure. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(B).\nAnd the court must always \u201cconsider the nature and seri\nousness of the danger to any person or the community that\nmay be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of\nimprisonment.\u201d \u00a71B1.10, comment., n. 1(B)(ii). The dis\ntrict court\u2019s authority is limited; and the Courts of Ap\npeals, and ultimately this Court, can ensure that district\ncourts do not overhaul plea agreements, thereby abusing\ntheir authority under \u00a73582(c)(2). See Dillon v. United\nStates, 560 U. S. ___ (2010) (reviewing and affirming a\n\u00a73582(c)(2) sentence reduction); Gall, 552 U. S., at 49 (all\nsentences are reviewable for abuse of discretion).\n   The Government would enact a categorical bar on\n\u00a73582(c)(2) relief. But such a bar would prevent district\ncourts from making an inquiry that is within their own\nspecial knowledge and expertise. What is at stake in this\ncase is a defendant\u2019s eligibility for relief, not the extent of\nthat relief. Indeed, even where a defendant is permitted\nto seek a reduction, the district judge may conclude that a\nreduction would be inappropriate. District judges have a\ncontinuing professional commitment, based on scholarship\nand accumulated experience, to a consistent sentencing\npolicy. They can rely on the frameworks they have de\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

They may,\nwhen considering a \u00a73582(c)(2) motion, take into account\na defendant\u2019s decision to enter into an 11(c)(1)(C) agree\nment. If the district court, based on its experience and\ninformed judgment, concludes the agreement led to a more\nlenient sentence than would otherwise have been imposed,\nit can deny the motion, for the statute permits but does\nnot require the court to reduce a sentence. This discretion\nensures that \u00a73582(c)(2) does not produce a windfall.\n   As noted, the opinion concurring in the judgment sug\ngests an intermediate position. That opinion argues that\nin general defendants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreements are ineligible for \u00a73582(c)(2) relief, but relief\nmay be sought where the plea agreement itself contem\nplates sentence reduction. The statute, however, calls for\nan inquiry into the reasons for a judge\u2019s sentence, not the\nreasons that motivated or informed the parties. If, as the\nGovernment suggests, the judge\u2019s decision to impose a\nsentence is based on the agreement, then \u00a73582(c)(2)\ndoes not apply. The parties cannot by contract upset an\notherwise-final sentence. And the consequences of this\nerroneous rule would be significant. By allowing modifica\ntion only when the terms of the agreement contemplate it,\nthe proposed rule would permit the very disparities the\nSentencing Reform Act seeks to eliminate.\n   The Act aims to create a comprehensive sentencing\nscheme in which those who commit crimes of similar\nseverity under similar conditions receive similar sen\ntences.    See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(6); K. Stith & J.\nCabranes, Fear of Judging 104\u2013105 (1998).            Section\n3582(c)(2) contributes to that goal by ensuring that district\ncourts may adjust sentences imposed pursuant to a range\nthat the Commission concludes are too severe, out of step\nwith the seriousness of the crime and the sentencing\nranges of analogous offenses, and inconsistent with the\n10               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nAct\u2019s purposes.\n   The crack-cocaine range here is a prime example of an\nunwarranted disparity that \u00a73582(c)(2) is designed to cure.\nThe Commission amended the crack-cocaine Guidelines\nto effect a \u201cpartial remedy\u201d for the \u201curgent and compel\nling\u201d problem of crack-cocaine sentences, which, the Com\nmission concluded, \u201csignificantly undermines the various\ncongressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Re\nform Act.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Report\nto Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy,\npp. 8\u201310 (May 2007); see also USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.\n706; Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 99\u2013100\n(2007). The Commission determined that those Guide\nlines were flawed, and therefore that sentences that relied\non them ought to be reexamined. There is no good reason\nto extend the benefit of the Commission\u2019s judgment only to\nan arbitrary subset of defendants whose agreed sentences\nwere accepted in light of a since-rejected Guidelines range\nbased on whether their plea agreements refer to the\nGuidelines. Congress enacted \u00a73582(c)(2) to remedy sys\ntemic injustice, and the approach outlined in the opinion\nconcurring in the judgment would undercut a systemic\nsolution.\n   Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agree\nment, the judge\u2019s decision to accept the plea and impose\nthe recommended sentence is likely to be based on the\nGuidelines; and when it is, the defendant should be eligi\nble to seek \u00a73582(c)(2) relief. This straightforward analy\nsis would avoid making arbitrary distinctions between\nsimilar defendants based on the terms of their plea\nagreements. And it would also reduce unwarranted dis\nparities in federal sentencing, consistent with the pur\nposes of the Sentencing Reform Act.\n                        *    *    *\n     The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. C.\n\u00a73582(c)(2), but I differ as to the reason why. In my view,\nthe term of imprisonment imposed by a district court\npursuant to an agreement authorized by Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) is \u201cbased\non\u201d the agreement itself, not on the judge\u2019s calculation of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines. However, I believe that if a (C)\nagreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range\napplicable to the charged offense to establish the term of\nimprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, the term of\nimprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d the range employed and\nthe defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under\n\u00a73582(c)(2).\n                                I\n  To ask whether a particular term of imprisonment is\n\u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range is to ask\nwhether that range serves as the basis or foundation for\nthe term of imprisonment. No term of imprisonment\u2014\n2                FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhether derived from a (C) agreement or otherwise\u2014has\nlegal effect until the court enters judgment imposing it.\nAs a result, in applying \u00a73582(c)(2) a court must discern\nthe foundation for the term of imprisonment imposed by\nthe sentencing judge. As the plurality explains, in the\nnormal course the district judge\u2019s calculation of the Guide\nlines range applicable to the charged offenses will serve as\nthe basis for the term of imprisonment imposed. See ante,\nat 5; see also Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007).\n   Sentencing under (C) agreements, however, is different.\nAt the time of sentencing, the term of imprisonment im\nposed pursuant to a (C) agreement does not involve the\ncourt\u2019s independent calculation of the Guidelines or con\nsideration of the other 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a) factors. The\ncourt may only accept or reject the agreement, and if\nit chooses to accept it, at sentencing the court may only\nimpose the term of imprisonment the agreement calls for;\nthe court may not change its terms. See Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 11(c)(3)(A) (\u201cTo the extent the plea agreement is of\nthe type specified in [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)], the court may\naccept the agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until\nthe court has reviewed the presentence report\u201d); Advisory\nCommittee\u2019s Notes on 1979 Amendments to Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., pp. 583\u2013584 (1982 ed.)\n(\u201c[C]ritical to a . . .

Green, 595 F. 3d 432, 438 (CA2 2010).\n   In the (C) agreement context, therefore, it is the binding\nplea agreement that is the foundation for the term of im\nprisonment to which the defendant is sentenced. At the\nmoment of sentencing, the court simply implements the\nterms of the agreement it has already accepted. Contrary\nto the plurality\u2019s view, see ante, at 5\u20136, the fact that USSG\n\u00a76B1.2(c) (Nov. 2010) instructs a district court to use the\nGuidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to accept a\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(C) agreement does not mean that the term of imprison\nment imposed by the court is \u201cbased on\u201d a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range. The term of imprisonment\nimposed by the sentencing judge is dictated by the terms\nof the agreement entered into by the parties, not the\njudge\u2019s Guidelines calculation. In short, the term of im\nprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement is, for\npurposes of \u00a73582(c)(2), \u201cbased on\u201d the agreement itself.\n   To hold otherwise would be to contravene the very pur\npose of (C) agreements\u2014to bind the district court and\nallow the Government and the defendant to determine\nwhat sentence he will receive. Although district courts\nordinarily have significant discretion in determining the\nappropriate sentence to be imposed on a particular defen\ndant, see Gall, 552 U. S., at 46, under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) it\nis the parties\u2019 agreement that determines the sentence to\nbe imposed, see Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on 1999\nAmendments to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App.,\np. 1570 (2000 ed.) (noting that, under a (C) agreement,\n\u201cthe government and defense have actually agreed on\nwhat amounts to an appropriate sentence . . . . [T]his\nagreement is binding on the court once the court accepts\nit\u201d). To be sure, the court \u201cretains absolute discretion\nwhether to accept a plea agreement,\u201d ibid., but once it\ndoes it is bound at sentencing to give effect to the parties\u2019\nagreement as to the appropriate term of imprisonment.\n   Allowing district courts later to reduce a term of im\nprisonment simply because the court itself considered\nthe Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the agree\nment would transform \u00a73582(c)(2) into a mechanism by\nwhich courts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in\nways not contemplated by the parties. At the time that\n\u00a73582(c)(2) was enacted in 1984, it was already well un\nderstood that, under Rule 11, the term of imprisonment\nstipulated in a (C) agreement bound the district court once\nit accepted the agreement.

Undoubt\nedly, he is correct that in most cases the Government and\nthe defendant will negotiate the term of imprisonment in a\n(C) agreement by reference to the applicable Guidelines\nprovisions.

This only makes sense; plea bargain\ning necessarily occurs in the shadow of the sentencing\nscheme to which the defendant would otherwise be sub\nject. See United States v. Booker, 543 U.

I therefore\ncannot agree with Freeman that \u00a73582(c)(2) calls upon\ndistrict courts to engage in a free-ranging search through\nthe parties\u2019 negotiating history in search of a Guidelines\nsentencing range that might have been relevant to the\nagreement or the court\u2019s acceptance of it. Nor can I agree\nwith the plurality that the district judge\u2019s calculation of\nthe Guidelines provides the basis for the term of impris\nonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement.\n                                II\n  These conclusions, however, do not mean that a term of\nimprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement can\nnever be reduced under \u00a73582(c)(2), as the Government\ncontends. For example, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties\nto \u201cagree that a specific . . . sentencing range is the appro\npriate disposition of the case.\u201d In delineating the agreed\nupon term of imprisonment, some (C) agreements may\ncall for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range. In such cases, the district\ncourt\u2019s acceptance of the agreement obligates the court to\nsentence the defendant accordingly, and there can be no\ndoubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is\n\u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range within the\nmeaning of \u00a73582(c)(2). If that Guidelines range is sub\nsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the de\n6                   FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfendant is eligible for sentence reduction.\n  Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific\nterm of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of months\u2014but\nalso make clear that the basis for the specified term is\na Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense\nto which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that\nsentencing range is evident from the agreement itself, for\npurposes of \u00a73582(c)(2) the term of imprisonment imposed\nby the court in accordance with that agreement is \u201cbased\non\u201d that range. Therefore, when a (C) agreement ex\npressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently\nlowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for\nsentence reduction under \u00a73582(c)(2).2\n  In so holding, I necessarily reject the categorical rule\nadvanced by the Government and endorsed by the dissent,\nwhich artificially divorces a (C) agreement from its ex\npress terms.3 Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thedissent suggests that this rule results from a \u201cmistaken shift in\nanalysis\u201d in this opinion from the actions of the judge to the intent of\nthe parties. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The purpose of a\n(C) agreement, however, is to bind the sentencing court to the terms\nagreed upon by the parties. See supra, at 3\u20134. Therefore, to determine\nwhether a sentence imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement was \u201cbased\non\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range, the reviewing court must necessar\nily look to the agreement itself.\n   3 The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this ques\n\ntion have taken approaches consistent with the one I take today. See\nUnited States v. Rivera-Mart\u00ednez, 607 F. 3d 283, 286\u2013287 (CA1 2010);\nUnited States v. Ray, 598 F. 3d 407, 409\u2013410 (CA7 2010); United States\nv. Main, 579 F. 3d 200, 203 (CA2 2009); United States v. Scurlark, 560\nF. 3d 839, 842\u2013843 (CA8 2009). It appears that only the Third Circuit\nhas applied the absolute rule advanced by the Government. See United\nStates v. Sanchez, 562 F. 3d 275, 282, and n. 8 (2009). As noted by the\nplurality, see ante, at 1, even the Sixth Circuit allows for sentence\nreduction \u201cto avoid a miscarriage of justice or to correct a mutual\nmistake,\u201d United States v. Peveler, 359 F. 3d 369, 378, n. 4 (2004) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted). And only two Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted a wide-ranging approach similar to the one suggested by\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    7\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nis to allow the parties to determine the defendant\u2019s sen\ntence, when the agreement itself employs the particular\nGuidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged\noffenses in establishing the term of imprisonment, the\ndefendant is eligible to have his sentence reduced under\n\u00a73582(c)(2).4 In such cases, the district court\u2019s reduction of\nthe sentence does not rewrite the plea agreement; instead,\nit enforces the agreement\u2019s terms.\n   Like the plurality, I am not persuaded by the Govern\nment\u2019s argument that allowing a term of imprisonment\nimposed pursuant to a (C) agreement to be reduced under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) deprives the Government of the benefit of the\nbargain it struck with the defendant. When a (C) agree\nment explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentenc\ning range to establish the term of imprisonment, the\nagreement itself demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent that\nthe imposed term of imprisonment will be based on that\nrange, as required for sentence reduction under the stat\nute.5    The Government\u2019s concern that application of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFreeman. See United States v. Garcia, 606 F. 3d 209, 214 (CA5 2010)\n(per curiam); United States v. Cobb, 584 F. 3d 979, 985 (CA10 2009).\n    4 The dissent contends that, even when a (C) agreement expressly\n\nuses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish the term of imprison\nment, the district court imposing a sentence pursuant to that agree\nment does not \u201cappl[y]\u201d that range within the meaning of the appli\ncable Guidelines policy statement. See post, at 4\u20135 (citing USSG\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(1) (Nov. 2010)). But in so arguing, the dissent\u2014like the\nGovernment\u2014would have courts ignore the agreement\u2019s express terms,\nwhich the court \u201capplie[s]\u201d when imposing the term of imprisonment.\n    5 The plurality asserts that \u201c[t]here is no good reason to extend the\n\nbenefit [of sentence reduction] only to an arbitrary subset of defendants\n. . . based on whether their plea agreements refer to the Guidelines.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. But the \u201cgood reason\u201d is evident: Rule 11(c)(1)(C)\u2019s entire\npurpose is to allow the parties\u2019 intent to determine sentencing out\ncomes. See supra, at 3\u20134. If a (C) agreement does not indicate the\nparties\u2019 intent to base the term of imprisonment on a particular Guide\nlines range subsequently lowered by the Commission, then \u00a73582(c)(2)\nsimply does not apply.\n8                  FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a73582(c)(2) to (C) agreements will result in certain defen\ndants receiving an \u201cunjustified windfall\u201d is therefore mis\nplaced. See Brief for United States 40, 43.\n  Furthermore, in cases where the Government believes\nthat even the limited sentence reduction authorized by\n\u00a73582(c)(2) and USSG \u00a71B1.10 improperly benefits the\ndefendant, it can argue to the district court that the court\nshould not exercise its discretion under the statute to\nreduce the sentence.6 See Dillon, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (noting that, in applying \u00a73582(c)(2), the court\nmust \u201cconsider whether the authorized reduction is war\nranted, either in whole or in part, according to the factors\nset forth in [18 U. S. C.] \u00a73553(a)\u201d).\n  Finally, if the Government wants to ensure ex ante that\na particular defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment will not be\nreduced later, the solution is simple enough: Nothing\nprevents the Government from negotiating with a defen\ndant to secure a waiver of his statutory right to seek sen\ntence reduction under \u00a73582(c)(2), just as it often does\nwith respect to a defendant\u2019s rights to appeal and collater\nally attack the conviction and sentence.7 See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73742; 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III); see also\nApp. 28a\u201329a (provision in Freeman\u2019s agreement ex\npressly waiving both rights). In short, application of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, the district court might decline to reduce the term of\n\nimprisonment of an eligible defendant in light of the Government\u2019s\nargument that it made significant concessions in the agreement\u2014such\nas dropping a charge or forgoing a future charge\u2014and therefore it\nwould not have agreed to a lower sentence at the time the agreement\nwas made.\n  7 The opposite would not necessarily be true, however, under the\n\nreading of \u00a73582(c)(2) proposed by the Government and the dissent. If\na district court has no statutory authority to reduce a term of impris\nonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement\u2014because such a term is\nnever \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range within the meaning of\n\u00a73582(c)(2)\u2014it is not clear how the parties could effectively confer that\nauthority upon the court by the terms of their agreement.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a73582(c)(2) to an eligible defendant does not\u2014and will\nnot\u2014deprive the Government of the benefit of its bargain.\n                             III\n   In order to conclude that Freeman is eligible for sen\ntence reduction under \u00a73582(c)(2), the plea agreement\nbetween Freeman and the Government must use a Guide\nlines sentencing range that has subsequently been low\nered by the Sentencing Commission to establish the term\nof imprisonment imposed by the District Court. Free\nman\u2019s agreement does.\n   The agreement states that Freeman \u201cagrees to have his\nsentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide\nlines,\u201d App. 28a, and that 106 months is the total term of\nimprisonment to be imposed, id., at 26a. The agreement\nalso makes clear that the \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) count to which\nFreeman agrees to plead guilty carries a minimum sen\ntence of 60 months, \u201cwhich must be served consecutively\nto\u201d any other sentence imposed. Id., at 27a. This leaves\n46 months unaccounted for. The agreement sets Free\nman\u2019s offense level at 19, as determined by the quantity of\ndrugs and his acceptance of responsibility, and states that\nthe parties anticipate a criminal history category of IV.\nId., at 27a\u201328a. Looking to the Sentencing Guidelines,\nan offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of\nIV produce a sentencing range of 46 to 57 months.8 See\nUSSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Therefore, contrary\nto the dissent\u2019s curious suggestion that \u201cthere is no way\nof knowing what th[e] sentence was \u2018based on,\u2019 \u201d post, at 6,\nit is evident that Freeman\u2019s agreement employed the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Because it is the parties\u2019 agreement that controls in the (C) agree\n\nment context, see supra, at 3\u20134, even if the District Court had calcu\nlated the range differently than the parties, see post, at 8 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting), Freeman would still be eligible for resentencing, as\nlong as the parties\u2019 chosen range was one that was \u201csubsequently . . .\nlowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n10                  FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n46-month figure at the bottom end of this sentencing range,\nin combination with the 60-month mandatory minimum\nsentence under \u00a7924(c)(1)(A), to establish his 106-month\nsentence.9 Thus the first of \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s conditions is\nsatisfied\u2014Freeman\u2019s term of imprisonment is \u201cbased on\u201d a\nGuidelines sentencing range.\n   In 2007 the Commission amended the Guidelines provi\nsions applicable to cocaine base offenses, such that the\noffense level applicable to the quantity of drugs for which\nFreeman was charged was lowered from 22 to 20. See\nApp. 142a\u2013143a (Sealed); USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706.\nTaking into account the three-level reduction for accep\ntance of responsibility, Freeman\u2019s recalculated offense\nlevel is 17, resulting in an amended sentencing range of 37\nto 46 months. Thus there can be no doubt that the Guide\nlines sentencing range originally used to establish Free\nman\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201chas subsequently been\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The dissent asks whether Freeman would be eligible for sentence\n\nreduction if the agreement had called for a 53-month term of impris\nonment. See post, at 7. Though that question is not presented by the\nfacts of this case, the answer is evident from the foregoing discussion: If\nthe agreement itself made clear that the parties arrived at the 53\nmonth term of imprisonment by determining the sentencing range ap\nplicable to Freeman\u2019s offenses and then halving the 106-month figure\nat its low end, he would have been eligible under \u00a73582(c)(2). See\nUnited States v. Franklin, 600 F. 3d 893, 897 (CA7 2010) (noting that a\n(C) agreement would not foreclose relief under \u00a73582(c)(2) if it provided\nthat the term of imprisonment was to be 40 percent below the low end\nof the applicable sentencing range).\n   Of course, if a (C) agreement \u201cdoes not contain any references to the\nGuidelines,\u201d post, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), there is no way of\nknowing whether the agreement \u201cuse[d] a Guidelines sentencing range\nto establish the term of imprisonment,\u201d supra, at 6, and a prisoner\nsentenced under such an agreement would not be eligible. It is there\nfore unclear why the dissent believes that the straightforward inquiry\ncalled for by the rule I apply today will \u201cfoster confusion\u201d among the\nlower courts. Post, at 7. This approach is consistent with the one\nalready taken by most Courts of Appeals, see n. 3, supra, and there\nis no indication that they have found it unpalatable, cf. post, at 9.\n                Cite as: 564 U.

I agree with the concurrence that the\nsentence imposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement\nis based on the agreement, not the Sentencing Guidelines.\nI would, however, adhere to that logic regardless whether\nthe agreement could be said to \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cemploy\u201d a Guide\u00ad\nlines range in arriving at the particular sentence specified\nin the agreement. Ante, at 1 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).\nIn that respect I agree with the plurality that the ap\u00ad\nproach of the concurrence to determining when a Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) sentence may be reduced is arbitrary and\nunworkable.

In this case, Freeman executed a written plea\nagreement in which the parties \u201cagree[d] that a sentence\nof 106 months\u2019 incarceration [was] the appropriate disposi\u00ad\ntion.\u201d App. 26a. Because the plea agreement was entered\npursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), that proposed sentence be\u00ad\ncame binding on the District Court once it accepted the\nagreement. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C) (the\nparties\u2019 \u201crequest\u201d for \u201ca specific sentence\u201d \u201cbinds the court\nonce the court accepts the plea agreement\u201d). As a result,\nwhen determining the sentence to impose on Freeman, the\nDistrict Court needed to consult one thing and one thing\nonly\u2014the plea agreement. See ante, at 2 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (\u201cAt the moment of sentencing, the court\nsimply implements the terms of the agreement it has al\u00ad\nready accepted\u201d).\n   I also agree with JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR that the \u201cterm of\nimprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge is dictated\nby the terms of the agreement entered into by the par\u00ad\nties, not the judge\u2019s Guidelines calculation,\u201d and that\n\u201c[a]l-lowing district courts later to reduce a term of impris\u00ad\nonment simply because the court itself considered the\nGuidelines in deciding whether to accept the agreement\nwould transform \u00a73582(c)(2) into a mechanism by which\ncourts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in ways\nnot contemplated by the parties.\u201d Ante, at 3.\n   But then comes the O.

This\nexception is in my view as mistaken as the position of the\nplurality\u2014and basically for the same reasons.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR begins the departure from her\nown rule innocently enough. As she explains, \u201csome (C)\nagreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced\nwithin a particular Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d Ante, at\n5. In such a case, according to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, there\ncan be \u201cno doubt\u201d that the prison term the court imposes is\n\u201cbased on\u201d the agreed-upon sentencing range, and there\u00ad\nfore the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction. Ibid.\n  Whether or not that is true, it provides no support for\nthe next step:\n      \u201cSimilarly, a plea agreement might provide for a\n    specific term of imprisonment\u2014such as a number of\n    months\u2014but also make clear that the basis for the\n    specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range appli\u00ad\n    cable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded\n    guilty. As long as that sentencing range is evident\n    from the agreement itself . . . the term of imprison\u00ad\n    ment imposed by the court in accordance with that\n    agreement is \u2018based on\u2019 that range.\u201d Ante, at 6.\n   This category of cases is not \u201csimilar\u201d to the first at all.\nIt is one thing to say that a sentence imposed pursuant to\nan agreement expressly providing that the court will\nsentence the defendant within an applicable Guidelines\nrange is \u201cbased on\u201d that range. It is quite another to\nconclude that an agreement providing for a specific term is\n\u201csimilarly\u201d based on a Guidelines range, simply because\nthe specified term can be said to reflect that range.\n4               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   According to the concurrence, if the parties simply \u201ccon\u00ad\nsider[ ] the Guidelines\u201d or \u201cnegotiate . . . by reference\u201d\nto them, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduc\u00ad\ntion. Ante, at 4. If, however, the agreement sets forth a\nspecific term but it is somehow \u201cclear that the basis for the\nspecified term is a Guidelines sentencing range,\u201d then the\ndefendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. Ante, at 6.\nThis head-scratching distinction between negotiating by\nreference to the Guidelines and using them as a basis for\nthe specified term makes for an unworkable test that can\nyield only arbitrary results.\n   The confusion is compounded by the varying standards\nin the concurrence. Sometimes the test is whether an\nagreement \u201cexpressly uses\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range,\nante, at 1, 6; see ante, at 7 (\u201cexplicitly employs\u201d). Other\ntimes the test is whether such use is \u201cevident,\u201d ante, at 6,\n9; see ante, at 10, n. 9 (\u201cclear\u201d). A third option is whether\nthe agreement \u201cindicate[s] the parties\u2019 intent to base the\nterm of imprisonment on a particular Guideline range.\u201d\nAnte, at 7, n. 5 (emphasis added).\n   The error in the concurring opinion is largely attribut\u00ad\nable to a mistaken shift in analysis. In the first half of the\nopinion, the inquiry properly looks to what the judge does:\nHe is, after all, the one who imposes the sentence. After\napproving the agreement, the judge considers only the\nfixed term in the agreement, so the sentence he actually\nimposes is not \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines.\n   In the second half of the opinion, however, the analysis\nsuddenly shifts, and focuses on the parties: Did they \u201cuse\u201d\nor \u201cemploy\u201d the Guidelines in arriving at the term in their\nagreement?       But \u00a73582(c)(2) is concerned only with\nwhether a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment based on a sentencing range.\u201d Only a court\ncan sentence a defendant, so there is no basis for examin\u00ad\ning why the parties settled on a particular prison term.\n   This conclusion dovetails with USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(1)\u2014\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement governing\nwhether a defendant is eligible for a reduction under\n\u00a73582(c)(2). As we explained last Term, \u00a73582(c)(2) re\u00ad\nquires a district court \u201cto follow the Commission\u2019s instruc\u00ad\ntions in \u00a71B1.10 to determine the prisoner\u2019s eligibility\nfor a sentence modification.\u201d Dillon v. United States,\n560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9). According to\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(1), the court must first determine \u201cthe\namended guideline range that would have been applicable\nto the defendant\u201d if the retroactively amended provision\nhad been in effect at the time of his sentencing. \u201cIn mak\u00ad\ning such determination, the court shall substitute only\nthe amendments . . . for the corresponding guideline pro\u00ad\nvisions that were applied when the defendant was sen\ntenced.\u201d USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(1), p. s. (emphasis added).\n   As noted, the District Court sentenced Freeman pursu\u00ad\nant to the term specified by his plea agreement; it never\n\u201capplied\u201d a Guidelines provision in imposing his term of\nimprisonment. The fact that the court may have \u201cuse[d]\nthe Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to ac\u00ad\ncept a (C) agreement does not mean that the term of im\u00ad\nprisonment imposed by the court is \u2018based on\u2019 a particular\nGuidelines sentencing range.\u201d Ante, at 2\u20133 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). Even if the Guidelines were \u201cused\u201d or\n\u201cemployed\u201d by the parties in arriving at the Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) sentencing term, they were not \u201capplied when\nthe defendant was sentenced.\u201d Once the District Court\naccepted the agreement, all that was later \u201capplied\u201d was\nthe sentence set forth in that agreement.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR is wrong to assert that her stan\u00ad\ndard \u201cdoes not rewrite the plea agreement\u201d but rather\n\u201cenforces the agreement\u2019s terms.\u201d Ante, at 7. According to\nthe concurrence, \u201c[w]hen a (C) agreement explicitly em\u00ad\nploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, the agreement itself demon\u00ad\nstrates the parties\u2019 intent that the imposed term of im\u00ad\n6               FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nprisonment will be based on that range,\u201d and therefore\nsubject to reduction if the Commission subsequently low\u00ad\ners that range. Ibid. In this case, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\nconcludes that Freeman\u2019s agreement contemplated such a\nreduction, even though the parties had \u201cagree[d] that a\nsentence of 106 months\u2019 incarceration is the appropriate\ndisposition of this case.\u201d App. 26a.\n   There is, however, no indication whatever that the par\u00ad\nties to the agreement contemplated the prospect of low\u00ad\nered sentencing ranges. And it is fanciful to suppose that\nthe parties would have said \u201c106 months\u201d if what they\nreally meant was \u201ca sentence at the lowest end of the\napplicable Guidelines range.\u201d Cf. App. 25a (parties in this\ncase recommending \u201ca fine at the lowest end of the appli\u00ad\ncable Guideline Range\u201d). In concluding otherwise, the\nconcurrence \u201cignore[s] the agreement\u2019s express terms.\u201d\nAnte, at 7, n. 4.\n   The reality is that whenever the parties choose a fixed\nterm, there is no way of knowing what that sentence was\n\u201cbased on.\u201d The prosecutor and the defendant could well\nhave had quite different reasons for concluding that 106\nmonths was a good deal. Perhaps the prosecutor wanted\nto devote the limited resources of his office to a different\narea of criminal activity, rather than try this case. Per\u00ad\nhaps the defendant had reason to question the credibility\nof one of his key witnesses, and feared a longer sentence if\nthe case went to trial.\n   Indeed, the fact that there may be uncertainty about\nhow to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range could be\nthe basis for agreement on a fixed term in a plea under\nRule 11(c)(1)(C). Here the agreement made clear that\nthere was some doubt about the Guidelines calculations.\nSee App. 28a (\u201cBoth parties reserve the right to object to\nthe USSG \u00a74A1.1 calculation of defendant\u2019s criminal\nhistory\u201d); ibid. (the parties acknowledge that their Guide\u00ad\nlines calculations \u201care not binding upon the Court\u201d and\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                7\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat the \u201cdefendant understands the Court will independ\u00ad\nently calculate the Guidelines at sentencing and defendant\nmay not withdraw the plea of guilty solely because the\nCourt does not agree with . . . [the] Sentencing Guideline\napplication\u201d).\n   In addition, parties frequently enter plea agreements\nthat reflect prosecutorial decisions not to pursue particu\u00ad\nlar counts. If a defendant faces three counts, and agrees\nto plead to one if the prosecutor does not pursue the other\ntwo, is the sentence reflected in the Rule 11(c)(1)(C)\nagreement in any sense \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines sentenc\u00ad\ning range for the one count to which the defendant\npleaded? Surely not. The concurrence tacitly concedes as\nmuch when it suggests that an agreement to \u201cdrop[ ] a\ncharge or forgo[ ] a future charge\u201d could ultimately be\ngrounds for not reducing the defendant\u2019s sentence. Ante,\nat 8, n. 6. But what this really shows is a basic flaw in the\n\u201cbased on\u201d test adopted by that opinion.\n   Finally, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s approach will foster con\u00ad\nfusion in an area in need of clarity. As noted, courts\nwill be hard pressed to apply the distinction between\nreferring to and relying on a Guidelines range. Other\nquestions abound:\n   What if the agreement contains a particular Guidelines\ncalculation but the agreement\u2019s stipulated sentence is out\u00ad\nside the parties\u2019 predicted Guidelines range? The test\nin the concurring opinion is whether the agreement \u201cuses\u201d\nor \u201cemploys\u201d a Guidelines sentencing range to establish\nthe term of imprisonment, ante, at 1, not whether that\nterm falls within the range. In this case, what if the term\nwas 53 months\u2014exactly half the low end of the sentencing\nrange anticipated by the parties? Is it \u201cevident\u201d in that\ncase that the Guidelines were used or employed to estab\u00ad\nlish the agreed-upon sentence?*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR responds that \u201c[i]f the agreement itself made\n8                 FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   What if the plea agreement does not contain any refer\u00ad\nences to the Guidelines\u2014not even the partial and tenta\u00ad\ntive Guidelines calculations in Freeman\u2019s agreement\u2014but\nthe binding sentence selected by the parties corresponds\nexactly to the low end of the applicable Guidelines range?\nIs it \u201cevident\u201d in that case that the agreement is based on\na sentencing range?\n   What if the District Court calculates the applicable\nGuidelines range differently than the parties? This is no\nacademic hypothetical. See, e.g., United States v. Frank\nlin, 600 F. 3d 893, 896\u2013897 (CA7 2010) (noting that \u201cthe\ndistrict court settled on a higher guidelines range than\nthat contemplated in the [Rule 11(c)(1)(C)] plea agree\u00ad\nment\u201d). Is a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentence still subject to\nreduction if the parties relied on the wrong sentencing\nrange? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s surprising answer is \u201cyes,\u201d\nsee ante, at 9, n. 8, even though the governing Guide\u00ad\nlines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible\nfor sentence reduction if the amended Guideline has \u201cthe\neffect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline\nrange\u201d\u2014presumably the correct applicable guideline\nrange. See USSG \u00a71B1.10(a)(2), p. s. Relying on error is\njust one unforeseen consequence of looking not to the\nspecified term in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, but instead\ntrying to reconstruct what led the parties to agree to that\nterm in the first place.\n   This confusion will invite the very thing JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR claims to disavow: a \u201cfree-ranging search\u201d by\ndistrict courts \u201cthrough the parties\u2019 negotiating history in\nsearch of a Guidelines sentencing range that might have\nbeen relevant to the agreement.\u201d Ante, at 5. This is par\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nclear\u201d that the parties arrived at the 53-month figure by determining\nthe sentencing range and then halving the range\u2019s low end\u2014106\nmonths\u2014then the sentence could be reduced. Ante, at 10, n. 9. Does\nthe 53-month figure itself make that clear? What if the figure is 26\u00bd\nmonths?\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nticularly unfortunate given that the whole point of Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) agreements is to provide the parties with cer\u00ad\ntainty about sentencing.\n                         *  *     *\n  As with any negotiation, parties entering a Rule 11(c)\n(1)(C) plea agreement must take the bitter with the\nsweet. Because of today\u2019s decision, however, Freeman gets\nmore sweet and the Government more bitter than either\nside bargained for. But those who will really be left with a\nsour taste after today\u2019s decision are the lower courts\ncharged with making sense of it going forward.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
