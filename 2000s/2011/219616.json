ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 10\u2013779.      Argued April 26, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nPharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to doctors through\n  a process called \u201cdetailing.\u201d       Pharmacies receive \u201cprescriber\n  identifying information\u201d when processing prescriptions and sell the\n  information to \u201cdata miners,\u201d who produce reports on prescriber be\n  havior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n  \u201cDetailers\u201d employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers then use the\n  reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase sales to doctors.\n  Vermont\u2019s Prescription Confidentiality Law provides that, absent the\n  prescriber\u2019s consent, prescriber-identifying information may not be\n  sold by pharmacies and similar entities, disclosed by those entities\n  for marketing purposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical\n  manufacturers. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631(d). The prohibitions\n  are subject to exceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying in\n  formation to be disseminated and used for a number of purposes, e.g.,\n  \u201chealth care research.\u201d \u00a74631(e).\n    Respondents, Vermont data miners and an association of brand\n  name drug manufacturers, sought declaratory and injunctive relief\n  against state officials (hereinafter Vermont), contending that\n  \u00a74631(d) violates their rights under the Free Speech Clause of the\n  First Amendment. The District Court denied relief, but the Second\n  Circuit reversed, holding that \u00a74631(d) unconstitutionally burdens\n  the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data miners without\n  adequate justification.\nHeld:\n    1. Vermont\u2019s statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based\n burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial\n scrutiny. Pp. 6\u201315.\n2                    SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (a) On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based re\n    striction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying in\n    formation. The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in\n    large part on the content of a purchaser\u2019s speech. It then bars phar\n    macies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will\n    use that information for marketing. Finally, it prohibits pharmaceu\n    tical manufacturers from using the information for marketing. The\n    statute thus disfavors marketing, i.e., speech with a particular con\n    tent, as well as particular speakers, i.e., detailers engaged in market\n    ing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cincinnati v. Dis\n    covery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426; Turner Broadcasting\n    System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658. Yet the law allows pre\n    scriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used\n    for other types of speech and by other speakers. The record and for\n    mal legislative findings of purpose confirm that \u00a74631(d) imposes an\n    aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who\n    promote brand-name drugs. In practical operation, Vermont\u2019s law\n    \u201cgoes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint\n    discrimination.\u201d R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391. Heightened\n    judicial scrutiny is warranted. Pp. 8\u201311.\n         (b) Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwar\n    ranted. The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regula\n    tion. Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however,\n    \u00a74631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the\n    identity of the speaker. The State next argues that, because pre\n    scriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a\n    legal mandate, \u00a74631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to govern\n    ment-held information. That argument finds some support in Los\n    Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S.\n    32, but that case is distinguishable. Vermont has imposed a restric\n    tion on access to information in private hands. United Reporting re\n    served that situation\u2014i.e., \u201ca case in which the government is prohib\n    iting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already\n    possesses.\u201d Id., at 40. In addition, the United Reporting plaintiff was\n    presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury,\n    while respondents claim that \u00a74631(d) burdens their own speech.\n    That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny. Vermont also ar\n    gues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales,\n    transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,\n    not speech. However, the creation and dissemination of information\n    are speech for First Amendment purposes. See, e.g., Bartnicki v.\n    Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 527. There is no need to consider Vermont\u2019s\n    request for an exception to that rule. Section 4631(d) imposes a\n    speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncircumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny,\neven assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere\ncommodity. Pp. 11\u201315.\n   2. Vermont\u2019s justifications for \u00a74631(d) do not withstand height\nened scrutiny. Pp. 15\u201324.\n      (a) The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial\nspeech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see,\ne.g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States,\n527 U. S. 173, 184. To sustain \u00a74631(d)\u2019s targeted, content-based\nburden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and\nthat the measure is drawn to achieve that interest. See Board of\nTrustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480\u2013481. Ver\nmont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy,\nincluding physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the\nintegrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the\nachievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and\nreducing healthcare costs. Pp. 15\u201317.\n      (b) Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their\nprescription decisions confidential, \u00a74631(d) is not drawn to serve\nthat interest. Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying informa\ntion with anyone for any reason except for marketing. Vermont\nmight have addressed physician confidentiality through \u201ca more co\nherent policy,\u201d Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195,\nsuch as allowing the information\u2019s sale or disclosure in only a few\nnarrow and well-justified circumstances. But it did not. Given the in\nformation\u2019s widespread availability and many permissible uses, Ver\nmont\u2019s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify\nthe burdens that \u00a74631(d) imposes on protected expression. It is true\nthat doctors can forgo the law\u2019s advantages by consenting to the sale,\ndisclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information. But\nthe State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which\nwill allow the doctor\u2019s prescriber-identifying information to be dis\nseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which\nwill allow the information to be used by those speakers whose mes\nsage the State supports. Cf. Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S.\n728. Respondents suggest a further defect lies in \u00a74631(d)\u2019s pre\nsumption of applicability absent an individual election to the con\ntrary. Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy\nmeasure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.\nVermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to\navoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detail\ners. Cf. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of\nStratton, 536 U. S. 150, 168. Vermont further argues that detailers\u2019\n4                    SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor\n    patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment de\n    cisions. But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions,\n    it can do so only because it is persuasive. Fear that speech might\n    persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it. Pp. 17\u201321.\n         (c) While Vermont\u2019s goals of lowering the costs of medical ser\n    vices and promoting public health may be proper, \u00a74631(d) does not\n    advance them in a permissible way. Vermont seeks to achieve those\n    objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by\n    certain speakers\u2014i.e., by diminishing detailers\u2019 ability to influence\n    prescription decisions. But \u201cthe fear that people would make bad de\n    cisions if given truthful information\u201d cannot justify content-based\n    burdens on speech. Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535\n    U. S. 357, 374. That precept applies with full force when the audi\n    ence\u2014here, prescribing physicians\u2014consists of \u201csophisticated and\n    experienced\u201d consumers. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 775. The\n    instant law\u2019s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find\n    detailing instructive. Vermont may be displeased that detailers with\n    prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand\n    name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in\n    order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction. Vermont nowhere\n    contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within\n    the meaning of this Court\u2019s First Amendment precedents. The\n    State\u2019s interest in burdening detailers\u2019 speech thus turns on nothing\n    more than a difference of opinion.

SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF \n\n        VERMONT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.\n\n            IMS HEALTH INC. ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 23, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Vermont law restricts the sale, disclosure, and use of\npharmacy records that reveal the prescribing practices of\nindividual doctors. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631 (Supp.\n2010). Subject to certain exceptions, the information may\nnot be sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing pur\nposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufac\nturers. Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard\nmedical privacy and diminish the likelihood that market\ning will lead to prescription decisions not in the best inter\nests of patients or the State. It can be assumed that these\ninterests are significant. Speech in aid of pharmaceutical\nmarketing, however, is a form of expression protected by\nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As a\nconsequence, Vermont\u2019s statute must be subjected to\nheightened judicial scrutiny. The law cannot satisfy that\nstandard.\n                         I\n                         A\n  Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to\n2               SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoctors through a process called \u201cdetailing.\u201d This often in-\nvolves a scheduled visit to a doctor\u2019s office to persuade\nthe doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical. De\ntailers bring drug samples as well as medical studies\nthat explain the \u201cdetails\u201d and potential advantages of var\nious prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen, ask\nquestions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be\nmore effective when they know the background and pur\nchasing preferences of their clientele, and pharmaceutical\nsalespersons are no exception. Knowledge of a physi-\ncian\u2019s prescription practices\u2014called \u201cprescriber-identifying\n information\u201d\u2014enables a detailer better to ascertain which\ndoctors are likely to be interested in a particular drug and\nhow best to present a particular sales message. Detailing\nis an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies\nmost often use it to promote high-profit brand-name drugs\nprotected by patent. Once a brand-name drug\u2019s patent\nexpires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives\nare manufactured and sold.\n   Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal\nlaw, receive prescriber-identifying information when proc\nessing prescriptions. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b); see also\nVt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule 9.2.\nMany pharmacies sell this information to \u201cdata miners,\u201d\nfirms that analyze prescriber-identifying information and\nproduce reports on prescriber behavior. Data miners lease\nthese reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to\nnondisclosure agreements. Detailers, who represent the\nmanufacturers, then use the reports to refine their mar\nketing tactics and increase sales.\n   In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidential\nity Law. The measure is also referred to as Act 80. It has\nseveral components. The central provision of the present\ncase is \u00a74631(d).\n    \u201cA health insurer, a self-insured employer, an elec\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    tronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other\n    similar entity shall not sell, license, or exchange\n    for value regulated records containing prescriber\n    identifiable information, nor permit the use of\n    regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable\n    information for marketing or promoting a prescription\n    drug, unless the prescriber consents . . . . Pharmaceu\n    tical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers\n    shall not use prescriber-identifiable information for\n    marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless\n    the prescriber consents . . . .\u201d\nThe quoted provision has three component parts. The\nprovision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insur\ners, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying\ninformation, absent the prescriber\u2019s consent. The parties\nhere dispute whether this clause applies to all sales or\nonly to sales for marketing. The provision then goes on to\nprohibit pharmacies, health insurers, and similar enti-\nties from allowing prescriber-identifying information to be\nused for marketing, unless the prescriber consents. This\nprohibition in effect bars pharmacies from disclosing the\ninformation for marketing purposes. Finally, the provi\nsion\u2019s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers\nand pharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber\nidentifying information for marketing, again absent the\nprescriber\u2019s consent. The Vermont attorney general may\npursue civil remedies against violators. \u00a74631(f).\n   Separate statutory provisions elaborate the scope of the\nprohibitions set out in \u00a74631(d). \u201cMarketing\u201d is defined to\ninclude \u201cadvertising, promotion, or any activity\u201d that is\n\u201cused to influence sales or the market share of a prescrip\ntion drug.\u201d \u00a74631(b)(5). Section 4631(c)(1) further pro\nvides that Vermont\u2019s Department of Health must allow \u201ca\nprescriber to give consent for his or her identifying infor\nmation to be used for the purposes\u201d identified in \u00a74631(d).\n4               SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFinally, the Act\u2019s prohibitions on sale, disclosure, and use\nare subject to a list of exceptions. For example, prescriber\nidentifying information may be disseminated or used for\n\u201chealth care research\u201d; to enforce \u201ccompliance\u201d with health\ninsurance formularies, or preferred drug lists; for \u201ccare\nmanagement educational communications provided to\u201d pa\ntients on such matters as \u201ctreatment options\u201d; for law\nenforcement operations; and for purposes \u201cotherwise pro\nvided by law.\u201d \u00a74631(e).\n   Act 80 also authorized funds for an \u201cevidence-based pre\nscription drug education program\u201d designed to provide\ndoctors and others with \u201cinformation and education on\nthe therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription\ndrugs.\u201d \u00a74622(a)(1). An express aim of the program is\nto advise prescribers \u201cabout commonly used brand-name\ndrugs for which the patent has expired\u201d or will soon ex\npire. \u00a74622(a)(2). Similar efforts to promote the use of\ngeneric pharmaceuticals are sometimes referred to as\n\u201ccounter-detailing.\u201d App. 211; see also IMS Health Inc. v.\nAyotte, 550 F. 3d 42, 91 (CA1 2008) (Lipez, J., concurring\nand dissenting).       The counterdetailer\u2019s recommended\nsubstitute may be an older, less expensive drug and not a\nbioequivalent of the brand-name drug the physician might\notherwise prescribe. Like the pharmaceutical manufac\nturers whose efforts they hope to resist, counterdetailers\nin some States use prescriber-identifying information to\nincrease their effectiveness. States themselves may sup\nply the prescriber-identifying information used in these\nprograms. See App. 313; id., at 375 (\u201c[W]e use the data\ngiven to us by the State of Pennsylvania . . . to figure out\nwhich physicians to talk to\u201d); see also id., at 427\u2013429\n(Director of the Office of Vermont Health Access explain\ning that the office collects prescriber-identifying informa\ntion but \u201cdoes not at this point in time have a counter\ndetailing or detailing effort\u201d). As first enacted, Act 80 also\nrequired detailers to provide information about alternative\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment options. The Vermont Legislature, however,\nlater repealed that provision. 2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, \u00a73.\n  Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings. Vt. Acts\nNo. 80, \u00a71. Vermont found, for example, that the \u201cgoals of\nmarketing programs are often in conflict with the goals\nof the state\u201d and that the \u201cmarketplace for ideas on medi\ncine safety and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that\n brand-name companies invest in expensive pharmaceuti\ncal marketing campaigns to doctors.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71(3), (4). Detail\ning, in the legislature\u2019s view, caused doctors to make\ndecisions based on \u201cincomplete and biased information.\u201d\n\u00a71(4). Because they \u201care unable to take the time to re\nsearch the quickly changing pharmaceutical market,\u201d\nVermont doctors \u201crely on information provided by phar\nmaceutical representatives.\u201d       \u00a71(13).   The legislature\nfurther found that detailing increases the cost of health\ncare and health insurance, \u00a71(15); encourages hasty and\nexcessive reliance on brand-name drugs, before the profes\nsion has observed their effectiveness as compared with\nolder and less expensive generic alternatives, \u00a71(7); and\nfosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tanta\nmount to harassment, \u00a7\u00a71(27)\u2013(28). The legislative find\nings further noted that use of prescriber-identifying in\nformation \u201cincrease[s] the effect of detailing programs\u201d\nby allowing detailers to target their visits to particular\ndoctors. \u00a7\u00a71(23)\u2013(26). Use of prescriber-identifying data\nalso helps detailers shape their messages by \u201ctailoring\u201d their\n\u201cpresentations to individual prescriber styles, preferences,\nand attitudes.\u201d \u00a71(25).\n                           B\n  The present case involves two consolidated suits. One\nwas brought by three Vermont data miners, the other\nby an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that\nproduce brand-name drugs. These entities are the re\nspondents here.

The District Court found that \u201c[p]harmaceutical\nmanufacturers are essentially the only paying customers\nof the data vendor industry\u201d and that, because detailing\nunpatented generic drugs is not \u201ccost-effective,\u201d pharma\nceutical sales representatives \u201cdetail only branded drugs.\u201d\nId., at 451, 442. As the District Court further con-\ncluded, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s determination that [prescriber\nidentifying] data is an effective marketing tool that en\nables detailers to increase sales of new drugs is supported\nin the record.\u201d Id., at 451. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It\nheld that \u00a74631(d) violates the First Amendment by bur\ndening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data\nminers without an adequate justification. 630 F. 3d 263.\nJudge Livingston dissented.\n   The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with de\ncisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by\nMaine and New Hampshire. See IMS Health Inc. v. Mills,\n616 F. 3d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); Ayotte, supra (New Hamp-\nshire). Recognizing a division of authority regarding the\nconstitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted\ncertiorari. 562 U. S. __ (2011).\n                            II\n  The beginning point is the text of \u00a74631(d). In the pro-\nceedings below, Vermont stated that the first sentence\nof \u00a74631(d) prohibits pharmacies and other regulated\nentities from selling or disseminating prescriber\nidentifying information for marketing. The information,\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin other words, could be sold or given away for purposes\nother than marketing. The District Court and the Court of\nAppeals accepted the State\u2019s reading. See 630 F. 3d,\nat 276. At oral argument in this Court, however, the\nState for the first time advanced an alternative reading of\n\u00a74631(d)\u2014namely, that pharmacies, health insurers, and\nsimilar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying infor\nmation for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions\nset out at \u00a74631(e). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\u201320. It might\nbe argued that the State\u2019s newfound interpretation comes\ntoo late in the day. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002) (waiver); New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel). The\nrespondents, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals\nwere entitled to rely on the State\u2019s plausible interpretation\nof the law it is charged with enforcing. For the State to\nchange its position is particularly troubling in a First\nAmendment case, where plaintiffs have a special interest\nin obtaining a prompt adjudication of their rights, despite\npotential ambiguities of state law. See Houston v. Hill,\n482 U. S. 451, 467\u2013468, and n. 17 (1987); Zwickler v.\nKoota, 389 U. S. 241, 252 (1967).\n  In any event, \u00a74631(d) cannot be sustained even under\nthe interpretation the State now adopts. As a consequence\nthis Court can assume that the opening clause of \u00a74631(d)\nprohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities\nfrom selling prescriber-identifying information, subject to\nthe statutory exceptions set out at \u00a74631(e). Under that\nreading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or\nacademic researchers, see \u00a74631(e)(1), but not, for exam\nple, to pharmaceutical marketers. There is no dispute as\nto the remainder of \u00a74631(d). It prohibits pharmacies,\nhealth insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or\notherwise allowing prescriber-identifying information to\nbe used for marketing. And it bars pharmaceutical manu\nfacturers and detailers from using the information for\n8              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmarketing. The questions now are whether \u00a74631(d) must\nbe tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so,\nwhether the State can justify the law.\n                             A\n                             1\n  On its face, Vermont\u2019s law enacts content- and speaker\nbased restrictions on the sale, disclosure, and use of\nprescriber-identifying information. The provision first for\nbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the\ncontent of a purchaser\u2019s speech. For example, those who\nwish to engage in certain \u201ceducational communications,\u201d\n\u00a74631(e)(4), may purchase the information. The measure\nthen bars any disclosure when recipient speakers will use\nthe information for marketing. Finally, the provision\u2019s\nsecond sentence prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers\nfrom using the information for marketing. The statute\nthus disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular\ncontent. More than that, the statute disfavors specific\nspeakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a\nresult of these content- and speaker-based rules, detailers\ncannot obtain prescriber-identifying information, even\nthough the information may be purchased or acquired by\nother speakers with diverse purposes and viewpoints.\nDetailers are likewise barred from using the information\nfor marketing, even though the information may be used\nby a wide range of other speakers. For example, it ap\npears that Vermont could supply academic organizations\nwith prescriber-identifying information to use in counter\ning the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufac\nturers and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs.\nBut \u00a74631(d) leaves detailers no means of purchasing,\nacquiring, or using prescriber-identifying information.\nThe law on its face burdens disfavored speech by disfa\nvored speakers.\n  Any doubt that \u00a74631(d) imposes an aimed, content\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbased burden on detailers is dispelled by the record and by\nformal legislative findings. As the District Court noted,\n\u201c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only\npaying customers of the data vendor industry\u201d; and the\nalmost invariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs. 631\nF. Supp. 2d, at 451. Vermont\u2019s law thus has the effect of\npreventing detailers\u2014and only detailers\u2014from communi\ncating with physicians in an effective and informative\nmanner. Cf. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766 (1993)\n(explaining the \u201cconsiderable value\u201d of in-person solicita\ntion). Formal legislative findings accompanying \u00a74631(d)\nconfirm that the law\u2019s express purpose and practical effect\nare to diminish the effectiveness of marketing by manu\nfacturers of brand-name drugs. Just as the \u201cinevitable\neffect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitu\ntional,\u201d a statute\u2019s stated purposes may also be considered.\nUnited States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968). Here,\nthe Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in\nparticular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey\nmessages that \u201care often in conflict with the goals of the\nstate.\u201d 2007 Vt. No. 80, \u00a71(3). The legislature designed\n\u00a74631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for\ndisfavored treatment. \u201cIn its practical operation,\u201d Ver\nmont\u2019s law \u201cgoes even beyond mere content discrimina\ntion, to actual viewpoint discrimination.\u201d R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992). Given the legislature\u2019s\nexpressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that\n\u00a74631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the content\nof speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint.\n   Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based\nburden on protected expression. It follows that heightened\njudicial scrutiny is warranted. See Cincinnati v. Discovery\nNetwork, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418 (1993) (applying height\nened scrutiny to \u201ca categorical prohibition on the use of\nnewsracks to disseminate commercial messages\u201d); id., at\n10              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n429 (\u201c[T]he very basis for the regulation is the difference\nin content between ordinary newspapers and commercial\nspeech\u201d in the form of \u201ccommercial handbills . . . . Thus,\nby any commonsense understanding of the term, the ban\nin this case is \u2018content based\u2019 \u201d (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658 (1994) (explaining that\nstrict scrutiny applies to regulations reflecting \u201caversion\u201d\nto what \u201cdisfavored speakers\u201d have to say). The Court has\nrecognized that the \u201cdistinction between laws burdening\nand laws banning speech is but a matter of degree\u201d and\nthat the \u201cGovernment\u2019s content-based burdens must sat\nisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.\u201d\nUnited States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529\nU. S. 803, 812 (2000). Lawmakers may no more silence\nunwanted speech by burdening its utterance than by cen\nsoring its content. See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Mem-\nbers of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,\n115 (1991) (content-based financial burden); Minneapolis\nStar & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm\u2019r of Revenue, 460\nU. S. 575 (1983) (speaker-based financial burden).\n   The First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny\nwhenever the government creates \u201ca regulation of speech\nbecause of disagreement with the message it conveys.\u201d\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989);\nsee also Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48\n(1986) (explaining that \u201c \u2018content-neutral\u2019 speech regula\ntions\u201d are \u201cthose that are justified without reference to the\ncontent of the regulated speech\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). A government bent on frustrating an impend\ning demonstration might pass a law demanding two years\u2019\nnotice before the issuance of parade permits. Even if the\nhypothetical measure on its face appeared neutral as to\ncontent and speaker, its purpose to suppress speech and\nits unjustified burdens on expression would render it\nunconstitutional.

See Discovery Network, supra, at 429\u2013430 (commer\ncial speech restriction lacking a \u201cneutral justification\u201d was\nnot content neutral). A \u201cconsumer\u2019s concern for the free\nflow of commercial speech often may be far keener than\nhis concern for urgent political dialogue.\u201d Bates v. State\nBar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977). That reality has\ngreat relevance in the fields of medicine and public health,\nwhere information can save lives.\n                              2\n   The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is\nunwarranted because its law is a mere commercial regula\ntion. It is true that restrictions on protected expression\nare distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more\ngenerally, on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that\nthe First Amendment does not prevent restrictions di\nrected at commerce or conduct from imposing inciden\ntal burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based\nhiring may require employers to remove \u201c \u2018White Appli\ncants Only\u2019 \u201d signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and\nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 62 (2006); why \u201can\nordinance against outdoor fires\u201d might forbid \u201cburning a\nflag,\u201d R. A. V., supra, at 385; and why antitrust laws can\nprohibit \u201cagreements in restraint of trade,\u201d Giboney v.\nEmpire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490, 502 (1949).\n   But \u00a74631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden\non protected expression. Both on its face and in its practi\ncal operation, Vermont\u2019s law imposes a burden based on\nthe content of speech and the identity of the speaker. See\nsupra, at 8\u201311. While the burdened speech results from\nan economic motive, so too does a great deal of vital ex\npression. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 818\n(1975); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266\n(1964); see also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533\nU. S. 405, 410\u2013411 (2001) (applying \u201cFirst Amendment\nscrutiny\u201d where speech effects were not incidental and\n12              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoting that \u201cthose whose business and livelihood depend\nin some way upon the product involved no doubt deem\nFirst Amendment protection to be just as important for\nthem as it is for other discrete, little noticed groups\u201d).\nVermont\u2019s law does not simply have an effect on speech,\nbut is directed at certain content and is aimed at particu\nlar speakers. The Constitution \u201cdoes not enact Mr. Her\nbert Spencer\u2019s Social Statics.\u201d Lochner v. New York, 198\nU. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). It does enact\nthe First Amendment.\n   Vermont further argues that \u00a74631(d) regulates not\nspeech but simply access to information. Prescriber\nidentifying information was generated in compliance with\na legal mandate, the State argues, and so could be consid\nered a kind of governmental information. This argument\nfinds some support in Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United\nReporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32 (1999), where the\nCourt held that a plaintiff could not raise a facial chal\nlenge to a content-based restriction on access to government-\nheld information. Because no private party faced a\nthreat of legal punishment, the Court characterized the\nlaw at issue as \u201cnothing more than a governmental denial\nof access to information in its possession.\u201d Id., at 40.\nUnder those circumstances the special reasons for permit\nting First Amendment plaintiffs to invoke the rights of\nothers did not apply. Id., at 38\u201339. Having found that the\nplaintiff could not raise a facial challenge, the Court re\nmanded for consideration of an as-applied challenge. Id.,\nat 41. United Reporting is thus a case about the availabil\nity of facial challenges. The Court did not rule on the\nmerits of any First Amendment claim.\n   United Reporting is distinguishable in at least two\nrespects. First, Vermont has imposed a restriction on\naccess to information in private hands. This confronts the\nCourt with a point reserved, and a situation not ad\ndressed, in United Reporting. Here, unlike in United\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReporting, we do have \u201ca case in which the government is\nprohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the\nspeaker already possesses.\u201d Id., at 40. The difference is\nsignificant. An individual\u2019s right to speak is implicated\nwhen information he or she possesses is subjected to \u201cre\nstraints on the way in which the information might be\nused\u201d or disseminated. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,\n467 U. S. 20, 32 (1984); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532\nU. S. 514, 527 (2001); Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S.\n524 (1989); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S.\n713 (1971) (per curiam). In Seattle Times, this Court\napplied heightened judicial scrutiny before sustaining a\ntrial court order prohibiting a newspaper\u2019s disclosure of\ninformation it learned through coercive discovery. It is\ntrue that the respondents here, unlike the newspaper in\nSeattle Times, do not themselves possess information\nwhose disclosure has been curtailed. That information,\nhowever, is in the hands of pharmacies and other private\nentities. There is no question that the \u201cthreat of prosecu\ntion . . . hangs over their heads.\u201d United Reporting, 528\nU. S., at 41. For that reason United Reporting does not\nbar respondents\u2019 facial challenge.\n   United Reporting is distinguishable for a second and\neven more important reason. The plaintiff in United\nReporting had neither \u201cattempt[ed] to qualify\u201d for access to\nthe government\u2019s information nor presented an as-applied\nclaim in this Court. Id., at 40. As a result, the Court\nassumed that the plaintiff had not suffered a personal\nFirst Amendment injury and could prevail only by invok\ning the rights of others through a facial challenge. Here,\nby contrast, the respondents claim\u2014with good reason\u2014\nthat \u00a74631(d) burdens their own speech. That argument\nfinds support in the separate writings in United Report\ning, which were joined by eight Justices. All of those\nwritings recognized that restrictions on the disclosure of\ngovernment-held information can facilitate or burden the\n14              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexpression of potential recipients and so transgress the\nFirst Amendment. See id., at 42 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(suggesting that \u201ca restriction upon access that allows\naccess to the press . . . but at the same time denies access\nto persons who wish to use the information for certain\nspeech purposes, is in reality a restriction upon speech\u201d);\nid., at 43 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (noting that \u201cthe\nprovision of [government] information is a kind of subsidy\nto people who wish to speak\u201d about certain subjects, \u201cand\nonce a State decides to make such a benefit available to\nthe public, there are no doubt limits to its freedom to\ndecide how that benefit will be distributed\u201d); id., at 46\n(Stevens, J., dissenting) (concluding that, \u201cbecause the\nState\u2019s discrimination is based on its desire to prevent the\ninformation from being used for constitutionally protected\npurposes, [i]t must assume the burden of justifying its\nconduct\u201d). Vermont\u2019s law imposes a content- and speaker\nbased burden on respondents\u2019 own speech. That consid\neration provides a separate basis for distinguishing United\nReporting and requires heightened judicial scrutiny.\n   The State also contends that heightened judicial scru\ntiny is unwarranted in this case because sales, transfer,\nand use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,\nnot speech. Consistent with that submission, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has charac\nterized prescriber-identifying information as a mere \u201ccom\nmodity\u201d with no greater entitlement to First Amend-\nment protection than \u201cbeef jerky.\u201d Ayotte, 550 F. 3d, at\n52\u201353. In contrast the courts below concluded that a\nprohibition on the sale of prescriber-identifying informa\ntion is a content-based rule akin to a ban on the sale of\ncookbooks, laboratory results, or train schedules. See 630\nF. 3d, at 271\u2013272 (\u201cThe First Amendment protects even\ndry information, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or\nartistic expression\u201d (internal quotation marks and altera\ntion omitted)); 631 F. Supp. 2d, at 445 (\u201cA restriction on\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisclosure is a regulation of speech, and the \u2018sale\u2019 of [in\nformation] is simply disclosure for profit\u201d).\n   This Court has held that the creation and dissemination\nof information are speech within the meaning of the First\nAmendment. See, e.g., Bartnicki, supra, at 527 (\u201c[I]f the\nacts of \u2018disclosing\u2019 and \u2018publishing\u2019 information do not\nconstitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall\nwithin that category, as distinct from the category of\nexpressive conduct\u201d (some internal quotation marks omit\nted)); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 481\n(1995) (\u201cinformation on beer labels\u201d is speech); Dun &\nBradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749,\n759 (1985) (plurality opinion) (credit report is \u201cspeech\u201d).\nFacts, after all, are the beginning point for much of the\nspeech that is most essential to advance human knowl\nedge and to conduct human affairs. There is thus a\nstrong argument that prescriber-identifying information is\nspeech for First Amendment purposes.\n   The State asks for an exception to the rule that informa\ntion is speech, but there is no need to consider that re\nquest in this case. The State has imposed content- and\nspeaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of\nprescriber-identifying information. So long as they do not\nengage in marketing, many speakers can obtain and use\nthe information. But detailers cannot. Vermont\u2019s statute\ncould be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines\nfrom purchasing or using ink. Cf. Minneapolis Star, 460\nU. S. 575. Like that hypothetical law, \u00a74631(d) imposes a\nspeaker- and content-based burden on protected expres\nsion, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applica\ntion of heightened scrutiny. As a consequence, this case\ncan be resolved even assuming, as the State argues, that\nprescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.\n                             B\n  In the ordinary case it is all but dispositive to conclude\n16             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint\ndiscriminatory. See R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382 (\u201cContent\nbased regulations are presumptively invalid\u201d); id., at 391\u2013\n392. The State argues that a different analysis applies\nhere because, assuming \u00a74631(d) burdens speech at all, it\nat most burdens only commercial speech. As in previous\ncases, however, the outcome is the same whether a special\ncommercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial\nscrutiny is applied. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broad\ncasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184\n(1999). For the same reason there is no need to determine\nwhether all speech hampered by \u00a74631(d) is commercial,\nas our cases have used that term. Cf. Board of Trustees\nof State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 474 (1989)\n(discussing whether \u201cpure speech and commercial speech\u201d\nwere inextricably intertwined, so that \u201cthe entirety must\n. . . be classified as noncommercial\u201d).\n    Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State\u2019s\nburden to justify its content-based law as consistent with\nthe First Amendment. Thompson v. Western States Medi\ncal Center, 535 U. S. 357, 373 (2002). To sustain the\ntargeted, content-based burden \u00a74631(d) imposes on pro\ntected expression, the State must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental in\nterest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that\ninterest. See Fox, supra, at 480\u2013481; Central Hudson Gas\n& Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447 U. S.\n557, 566 (1980). There must be a \u201cfit between the legisla\nture\u2019s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those\nends.\u201d Fox, supra, at 480 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only\nthat the State\u2019s interests are proportional to the result-\ning burdens placed on speech but also that the law does\nnot seek to suppress a disfavored message. See Turner\nBroadcasting, 512 U. S., at 662\u2013663.\n    The State\u2019s asserted justifications for \u00a74631(d) come\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder two general headings. First, the State contends\nthat its law is necessary to protect medical privacy, includ\ning physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment,\nand the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Sec\nond, the State argues that \u00a74631(d) is integral to the\nachievement of policy objectives\u2014namely, improved public\nhealth and reduced healthcare costs. Neither justification\nwithstands scrutiny.\n                              1\n  Vermont argues that its physicians have a \u201creasonable\nexpectation\u201d that their prescriber-identifying information\n\u201cwill not be used for purposes other than . . . filling and\nprocessing\u201d prescriptions. See 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(29). It may be assumed that, for many reasons, physi\ncians have an interest in keeping their prescription deci\nsions confidential. But \u00a74631(d) is not drawn to serve that\ninterest. Under Vermont\u2019s law, pharmacies may share\nprescriber-identifying information with anyone for any rea\nson save one: They must not allow the information to\nbe used for marketing. Exceptions further allow pharma\ncies to sell prescriber-identifying information for certain\npurposes, including \u201chealth care research.\u201d \u00a74631(e). And\nthe measure permits insurers, researchers, journalists,\nthe State itself, and others to use the information. See\n\u00a74631(d); cf. App. 370\u2013372; id., at 211. All but conceding\nthat \u00a74631(d) does not in itself advance confidentiality\ninterests, the State suggests that other laws might impose\nseparate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying\ninformation. See Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 20.1.\nBut the potential effectiveness of other measures cannot\njustify the distinctive set of prohibitions and sanctions\nimposed by \u00a74631(d).\n  Perhaps the State could have addressed physician confi\ndentiality through \u201ca more coherent policy.\u201d Greater New\nOrleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195; see also Discovery\n18              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNetwork, 507 U. S., at 428. For instance, the State might\nhave advanced its asserted privacy interest by allowing\nthe information\u2019s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow\nand well-justified circumstances. See, e.g., Health In\nsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71320d\u20132; 45 CFR pts. 160 and 164 (2010). A\nstatute of that type would present quite a different case\nthan the one presented here. But the State did not enact\na statute with that purpose or design. Instead, Vermont\nmade prescriber-identifying information available to an\nalmost limitless audience. The explicit structure of the\nstatute allows the information to be studied and used by\nall but a narrow class of disfavored speakers. Given the\ninformation\u2019s widespread availability and many permissi\nble uses, the State\u2019s asserted interest in physician confi\ndentiality does not justify the burden that \u00a74631(d) places\non protected expression.\n   The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the\nadvantages of \u00a74631(d) by consenting to the sale, disclo\nsure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.\nSee \u00a74631(c)(1). It is true that private decisionmaking can\navoid governmental partiality and thus insulate privacy\nmeasures from First Amendment challenge. See Rowan v.\nPost Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728 (1970); cf. Bolger v. Youngs\nDrug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 72 (1983). But that\nprinciple is inapposite here. Vermont has given its doctors\na contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow your\nprescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and\nused without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will\nallow your information to be used by those speakers whose\nmessage the State supports. Section 4631(d) may offer a\nlimited degree of privacy, but only on terms favorable to\nthe speech the State prefers. Cf. Rowan, supra, at 734,\n737, 739, n. 6 (sustaining a law that allowed private par\nties to make \u201cunfettered,\u201d \u201cunlimited,\u201d and \u201cunreviewable\u201d\nchoices regarding their own privacy). This is not to say\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat all privacy measures must avoid content-based rules.\nHere, however, the State has conditioned privacy on ac\nceptance of a content-based rule that is not drawn to serve\nthe State\u2019s asserted interest. To obtain the limited privacy\nallowed by \u00a74631(d), Vermont physicians are forced to\nacquiesce in the State\u2019s goal of burdening disfavored\nspeech by disfavored speakers.\n   Respondents suggest that a further defect of \u00a74631(d)\nlies in its presumption of applicability absent a physician\u2019s\nelection to the contrary. Vermont\u2019s law might burden less\nspeech if it came into operation only after an individual\nchoice, but a revision to that effect would not necessarily\nsave \u00a74631(d). Even reliance on a prior election would not\nsuffice, for instance, if available categories of coverage by\ndesign favored speakers of one political persuasion over\nanother. Rules that burden protected expression may not\nbe sustained when the options provided by the State are\ntoo narrow to advance legitimate interests or too broad to\nprotect speech. As already explained, \u00a74631(d) permits\nextensive use of prescriber-identifying information and so\ndoes not advance the State\u2019s asserted interest in physician\nconfidentiality. The limited range of available privacy\noptions instead reflects the State\u2019s impermissible purpose\nto burden disfavored speech. Vermont\u2019s argument accord\ningly fails, even if the availability and scope of private\nelection might be relevant in other contexts, as when the\nstatute\u2019s design is unrelated to any purpose to advance a\npreferred message.\n   The State also contends that \u00a74631(d) protects doctors\nfrom \u201charassing sales behaviors.\u201d 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(28). \u201cSome doctors in Vermont are experiencing an\nundesired increase in the aggressiveness of pharmaceuti\ncal sales representatives,\u201d the Vermont Legislature found,\n\u201cand a few have reported that they felt coerced and har\nassed.\u201d \u00a71(20). It is doubtful that concern for \u201ca few\u201d\nphysicians who may have \u201cfelt coerced and harassed\u201d by\n20              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npharmaceutical marketers can sustain a broad content\nbased rule like \u00a74631(d). Many are those who must en\ndure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of\nfreedom. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,\n210\u2013211 (1975); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21\n(1971). In any event the State offers no explanation why\nremedies other than content-based rules would be inade\nquate. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.\n484, 503 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Physicians can,\nand often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, includ\ning detailers who use prescriber-identifying information.\nSee, e.g., App. 180, 333\u2013334. Doctors who wish to forgo\ndetailing altogether are free to give \u201cNo Solicitation\u201d or\n\u201cNo Detailing\u201d instructions to their office managers or to\nreceptionists at their places of work. Personal privacy\neven in one\u2019s own home receives \u201cample protection\u201d from\nthe \u201cresident\u2019s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in\nconversation with unwelcome visitors.\u201d Watchtower Bible\n& Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S.\n150, 168 (2002); see also Bolger, supra, at 72. A physi\ncian\u2019s office is no more private and is entitled to no greater\nprotection.\n  Vermont argues that detailers\u2019 use of prescriber\nidentifying information undermines the doctor-patient\nrelationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment\ndecisions. According to the State, \u201cunwanted pressure\noccurs\u201d when doctors learn that their prescription deci\nsions are being \u201cmonitored\u201d by detailers. 2007 Vt. Laws\nNo. 80, \u00a71(27). Some physicians accuse detailers of \u201cspy\ning\u201d or of engaging in \u201cunderhanded\u201d conduct in order to\n\u201csubvert\u201d prescription decisions. App. 336, 380, 407\u2013408;\nsee also id., at 326\u2013328. And Vermont claims that detail\ning makes people \u201canxious\u201d about whether doctors have\ntheir patients\u2019 best interests at heart. Id., at 327. But the\nState does not explain why detailers\u2019 use of prescriber\nidentifying information is more likely to prompt these\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjections than many other uses permitted by \u00a74631(d).\nIn any event, this asserted interest is contrary to basic\nFirst Amendment principles. Speech remains protected\neven when it may \u201cstir people to action,\u201d \u201cmove them to\ntears,\u201d or \u201cinflict great pain.\u201d Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). The more benign and,\nmany would say, beneficial speech of pharmaceutical\nmarketing is also entitled to the protection of the First\nAmendment. If pharmaceutical marketing affects treat\nment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persua\nsive. Absent circumstances far from those presented here,\nthe fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful\nbasis for quieting it. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,\n447 (1969) (per curiam).\n                               2\n  The State contends that \u00a74631(d) advances impor-\ntant public policy goals by lowering the costs of medical\nservices and promoting public health. If prescriber\nidentifying information were available for use by detailers,\nthe State contends, then detailing would be effective in\npromoting brand-name drugs that are more expensive and\nless safe than generic alternatives. This logic is set out at\nlength in the legislative findings accompanying \u00a74631(d).\nYet at oral argument here, the State declined to acknowl\nedge that \u00a74631(d)\u2019s objective purpose and practical effect\nwere to inhibit detailing and alter doctors\u2019 prescription\ndecisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136. The State\u2019s reluctance\nto embrace its own legislature\u2019s rationale reflects the\nvulnerability of its position.\n  While Vermont\u2019s stated policy goals may be proper,\n\u00a74631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way. As\nthe Court of Appeals noted, the \u201cstate\u2019s own explanation of\nhow\u201d \u00a74631(d) \u201cadvances its interests cannot be said to be\ndirect.\u201d 630 F. 3d, at 277. The State seeks to achieve its\npolicy objectives through the indirect means of restraining\n22             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain speech by certain speakers\u2014that is, by diminish\ning detailers\u2019 ability to influence prescription decisions.\nThose who seek to censor or burden free expression often\nassert that disfavored speech has adverse effects. But the\n\u201cfear that people would make bad decisions if given truth\nful information\u201d cannot justify content-based burdens on\nspeech. Thompson, 535 U. S., at 374; see also Virginia Bd.\nof Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,\n425 U. S. 748, 769\u2013770 (1976). \u201cThe First Amendment\ndirects us to be especially skeptical of regulations that\nseek to keep people in the dark for what the government\nperceives to be their own good.\u201d 44 Liquormart, supra, at\n503 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also Linmark Associates,\nInc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 97 (1977). These pre\ncepts apply with full force when the audience, in this\ncase prescribing physicians, consists of \u201csophisticated and\nexperienced\u201d consumers. Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 775.\n   As Vermont\u2019s legislative findings acknowledge, the prem-\nise of \u00a74631(d) is that the force of speech can justify\nthe government\u2019s attempts to stifle it. Indeed the State\ndefends the law by insisting that \u201cpharmaceutical market\ning has a strong influence on doctors\u2019 prescribing prac\ntices.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 49\u201350. This reasoning is\nincompatible with the First Amendment. In an attempt to\nreverse a disfavored trend in public opinion, a State could\nnot ban campaigning with slogans, picketing with signs, or\nmarching during the daytime. Likewise the State may not\nseek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the\nmarketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading adver\ntisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy\njingles. That the State finds expression too persuasive\ndoes not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its\nmessengers.\n   The defect in Vermont\u2019s law is made clear by the fact\nthat many listeners find detailing instructive. Indeed the\nrecord demonstrates that some Vermont doctors view\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntargeted detailing based on prescriber-identifying infor\nmation as \u201cvery helpful\u201d because it allows detailers to\nshape their messages to each doctor\u2019s practice. App. 274;\nsee also id., at 181, 218, 271\u2013272. Even the United States,\nwhich appeared here in support of Vermont, took care to\ndispute the State\u2019s \u201cunwarranted view that the dangers\nof [n]ew drugs outweigh their benefits to patients.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 24, n. 4. There are di\nvergent views regarding detailing and the prescription\nof brand-name drugs. Under the Constitution, resolution of\n that debate must result from free and uninhibited speech.\nAs one Vermont physician put it: \u201cWe have a saying in\nmedicine, information is power. And the more you know,\nor anyone knows, the better decisions can be made.\u201d App.\n279. There are similar sayings in law, including that\n\u201cinformation is not in itself harmful, that people will\nperceive their own best interests if only they are well\nenough informed, and that the best means to that end is\nto open the channels of communication rather than to\nclose them.\u201d Virginia Bd., 425 U. S., at 770. The choice\n\u201cbetween the dangers of suppressing information, and the\ndangers of its misuse if it is freely available\u201d is one that\n\u201cthe First Amendment makes for us.\u201d Ibid.\n   Vermont may be displeased that detailers who use\nprescriber-identifying information are effective in promot\ning brand-name drugs. The State can express that view\nthrough its own speech. See Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97; cf.\n\u00a74622(a)(1) (establishing a prescription drug educational\nprogram). But a State\u2019s failure to persuade does not allow\nit to hamstring the opposition. The State may not burden\nthe speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a\npreferred direction. \u201cThe commercial marketplace, like\nother spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a\nforum where ideas and information flourish. Some of the\nideas and information are vital, some of slight worth. But\nthe general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not\n24              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe government, assess the value of the information pre\nsented.\u201d Edenfield, supra, at 767.\n  It is true that content-based restrictions on protected\nexpression are sometimes permissible, and that principle\napplies to commercial speech. Indeed the government\u2019s\nlegitimate interest in protecting consumers from \u201ccommer\ncial harms\u201d explains \u201cwhy commercial speech can be sub\nject to greater governmental regulation than noncommer\ncial speech.\u201d Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 426; see also\n44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., 502 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The\nCourt has noted, for example, that \u201ca State may choose to\nregulate price advertising in one industry but not in oth\ners, because the risk of fraud . . . is in its view greater\nthere.\u201d R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 388\u2013389 (citing Virginia Bd.,\nsupra, at 771\u2013772). Here, however, Vermont has not\nshown that its law has a neutral justification.\n  The State nowhere contends that detailing is false or\nmisleading within the meaning of this Court\u2019s First\nAmendment precedents. See Thompson, 535 U. S., at 373.\nNor does the State argue that the provision challenged\nhere will prevent false or misleading speech. Cf. post, at\n10\u201311 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (collecting regulations that\nthe government might defend on this ground). The State\u2019s\ninterest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns\non nothing more than a difference of opinion. See Bolger,\n463 U. S., at 69; Thompson, supra, at 376.\n                        *    *    *\n  The capacity of technology to find and publish personal\ninformation, including records required by the govern\nment, presents serious and unresolved issues with respect\nto personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In\nconsidering how to protect those interests, however, the\nState cannot engage in content-based discrimination to\nadvance its own side of a debate.\n  If Vermont\u2019s statute provided that prescriber-identifying\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Here, however, the State gives possessors of the\ninformation broad discretion and wide latitude in disclos\ning the information, while at the same time restricting\nthe information\u2019s use by some speakers and for some pur\nposes, even while the State itself can use the information\nto counter the speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a\nconcept too integral to the person and a right too essential\nto freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those\nideas the government prefers.\n   When it enacted \u00a74631(d), the Vermont Legislature\nfound that the \u201cmarketplace for ideas on medicine safety\nand effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that brand\nname companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical mar\nketing campaigns to doctors.\u201d 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(4). \u201cThe goals of marketing programs,\u201d the legislature\nsaid, \u201care often in conflict with the goals of the state.\u201d\n\u00a71(3). The text of \u00a74631(d), associated legislative findings,\nand the record developed in the District Court establish\nthat Vermont enacted its law for this end. The State has\nburdened a form of protected expression that it found too\npersuasive. At the same time, the State has left unbur\ndened those speakers whose messages are in accord with\nits own views. This the State cannot do.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

It deprives pharmaceutical\nand data-mining companies of data, collected pursuant to\nthe government\u2019s regulatory mandate, that could help\npharmaceutical companies create better sales messages.\nIn my view, this effect on expression is inextricably related\nto a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial\nenterprise. The First Amendment does not require courts\nto apply a special \u201cheightened\u201d standard of review when\nreviewing such an effort. And, in any event, the statute\nmeets the First Amendment standard this Court has\npreviously applied when the government seeks to regulate\ncommercial speech. For any or all of these reasons, the\nCourt should uphold the statute as constitutional.\n                         I\n  The Vermont statute before us says pharmacies and\ncertain other entities\n    \u201cshall not [1] sell . . . regulated records containing\n    prescriber-identifiable information, nor [2] permit the\n    use of [such] records . . . for marketing or promoting a\n    prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.\u201d Vt.\n    Stat.

In Part IV, I shall explain why the\nthird prohibition makes no difference to the result.\n                              II\n   In Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521\nU. S. 457 (1997), this Court considered the First Amend\nment\u2019s application to federal agricultural commodity mar\nketing regulations that required growers of fruit to\nmake compulsory contributions to pay for collective adver\ntising. The Court reviewed the lawfulness of the regula\ntion\u2019s negative impact on the growers\u2019 freedom voluntarily\nto choose their own commercial messages \u201cunder the\nstandard appropriate for the review of economic regula\ntion.\u201d Id., at 469.\n   In this case I would ask whether Vermont\u2019s regulatory\nprovisions work harm to First Amendment interests that\nis disproportionate to their furtherance of legitimate regu\nlatory objectives. And in doing so, I would give significant\nweight to legitimate commercial regulatory objectives\u2014as\nthis Court did in Glickman. The far stricter, specially\n\u201cheightened\u201d First Amendment standards that the major\nity would apply to this instance of commercial regulation\nare out of place here.

Without such a marketplace, the\npublic could not freely choose a government pledged to\nimplement policies that reflect the people\u2019s informed will.\n  At the same time, our cases make clear that the First\nAmendment offers considerably less protection to the\nmaintenance of a free marketplace for goods and services.\nSee Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623\n(1995) (\u201cWe have always been careful to distinguish com\nmercial speech from speech at the First Amendment\u2019s\ncore\u201d). And they also reflect the democratic importance of\npermitting an elected government to implement through\neffective programs policy choices for which the people\u2019s\nelected representatives have voted.\n  Thus this Court has recognized that commercial speech\nincluding advertising has an \u201cinformational function\u201d and\n4               SORRELL v.

S. 809,\n826 (1975). But at the same time it has applied a less\nthan strict, \u201cintermediate\u201d First Amendment test when\nthe government directly restricts commercial speech.\nUnder that test, government laws and regulations may\nsignificantly restrict speech, as long as they also \u201cdirectly\nadvance\u201d a \u201csubstantial\u201d government interest that could\nnot \u201cbe served as well by a more limited restriction.\u201d\nCentral Hudson, supra, at 564. Moreover, the Court has\nfound that \u201csales practices\u201d that are \u201cmisleading, decep\ntive, or aggressive\u201d lack the protection of even this \u201cinter\nmediate\u201d standard. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island,\n517 U. S. 484, 501 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also\nCentral Hudson, supra, at 563; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy\nv. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,\n772 (1976). And the Court has emphasized the need, in\napplying an \u201cintermediate\u201d test, to maintain the\n    \u201c \u2018commonsense\u2019 distinction between speech proposing\n    a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area\n    traditionally subject to government regulation, and\n    other varieties of speech.\u201d Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar\n    Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 455\u2013456 (1978) (quoting Virginia\n    Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 771, n. 24; emphasis\n    added).\n  The Court has also normally applied a yet more lenient\napproach to ordinary commercial or regulatory legislation\nthat affects speech in less direct ways. In doing so, the\nCourt has taken account of the need in this area of law to\ndefer significantly to legislative judgment\u2014as the Court\nhas done in cases involving the Commerce Clause or the\nDue Process Clause. See Glickman, supra, at 475\u2013476.\n\u201cOur function\u201d in such cases, Justice Brandeis said, \u201cis\nonly to determine the reasonableness of the legislature\u2019s\nbelief in the existence of evils and in the effectiveness of\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Since ordinary regulatory pro\ngrams can affect speech, particularly commercial speech,\nin myriad ways, to apply a \u201cheightened\u201d First Amendment\nstandard of review whenever such a program burdens\nspeech would transfer from legislatures to judges the\nprimary power to weigh ends and to choose means, threat\nening to distort or undermine legitimate legislative ob\njectives.

Cf.\nJohanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U.

New York,\n    198 U. S. 45 (1905), in which it was common practice\n    for this Court to strike down economic regulations\n    adopted by a State based on the Court\u2019s own notions\n    of the most appropriate means for the State to imple\n    ment its considered policies.\u201d 447 U. S., at 589.\n                             B\n   There are several reasons why the Court should review\nVermont\u2019s law \u201cunder the standard appropriate for the\nreview of economic regulation,\u201d not \u201cunder a heightened\nstandard appropriate for the review of First Amendment\nissues.\u201d Glickman, 521 U. S., at 469. For one thing, Ver\nmont\u2019s statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say\nanything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to\nendorse any particular point of view, whether ideological\nor related to the sale of a product. Cf. id., at 469\u2013470.\n(And I here assume that Central Hudson might otherwise\napply. See Part III, infra.)\n   For another thing, the same First Amendment stan\ndards that apply to Vermont here would apply to similar\nregulatory actions taken by other States or by the Federal\nGovernment acting, for example, through Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) regulation. (And the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s ability to pre-empt state laws that interfere\nwith existing or contemplated federal forms of regulation\nis here irrelevant.)\n   Further, the statute\u2019s requirements form part of a tra\nditional, comprehensive regulatory regime. Cf. United\nFoods, supra, at 411. The pharmaceutical drug industry\nhas been heavily regulated at least since 1906. See Pure\nFood and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768. Longstanding statutes\nand regulations require pharmaceutical companies to\nengage in complex drug testing to ensure that their drugs\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Only then can the drugs be marketed, at which\npoint drug companies are subject to the FDA\u2019s exhaustive\nregulation of the content of drug labels and the manner in\nwhich drugs can be advertised and sold. \u00a7352(f)(2); 21\nCFR pts. 201\u2013203 (2010).\n   Finally, Vermont\u2019s statute is directed toward informa\ntion that exists only by virtue of government regulation.\nUnder federal law, certain drugs can be dispensed only by\na pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical\npractitioner. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b). Vermont regulates the\nqualifications, the fitness, and the practices of pharma\ncists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a\n\u201cpatient record system\u201d that, among other things, tracks\nwho prescribed which drugs. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26,\n\u00a7\u00a72041(a), 2022(14) (Supp. 2010); Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy\nAdmin. Rules (Pharmacy Rules) 9.1, 9.24(e) (2009). But\nfor these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to\nknow who had told customers to buy which drugs (as is\nthe case when a doctor tells a patient to take a daily dose\nof aspirin).\n   Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored\nrestrictions on the use of information subject to their\nregulatory jurisdiction. A car dealership that obtains\ncredit scores for customers who want car loans can be\nprohibited from using credit data to search for new cus\ntomers. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681b (2006 ed. and Supp. III);\ncf. Trans Union Corp. v. FTC, 245 F. 3d 809, reh\u2019g denied,\n267 F. 3d 1138 (CADC 2001). Medical specialists who\nobtain medical records for their existing patients cannot\npurchase those records in order to identify new patients.\nSee 45 CFR \u00a7164.508(a)(3) (2010). Or, speaking hypo\nthetically, a public utilities commission that directs local\ngas distributors to gather usage information for individual\ncustomers might permit the distributors to share the data\nwith researchers (trying to lower energy costs) but forbid\n8              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsales of the data to appliance manufacturers seeking to\nsell gas stoves.\n   Such regulatory actions are subject to judicial review,\ne.g., for compliance with applicable statutes. And they\nwould normally be subject to review under the Adminis\ntrative Procedure Act to make certain they are not \u201carbi\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A) (2006 ed.). In an appropriate case, such review\nmight be informed by First Amendment considerations.\nBut regulatory actions of the kind present here have not\npreviously been thought to raise serious additional consti\ntutional concerns under the First Amendment. But cf.\nTrans Union LLC v. FTC, 536 U. S. 915 (2002) (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (questioning ban\non use of consumer credit reports for target marketing).\nThe ease with which one can point to actual or hypothet\nical examples with potentially adverse speech-related\neffects at least roughly comparable to those at issue here\nindicates the danger of applying a \u201cheightened\u201d or \u201cinter\nmediate\u201d standard of First Amendment review where\ntypical regulatory actions affect commercial speech (say,\nby withholding information that a commercial speaker\nmight use to shape the content of a message).\n   Thus, it is not surprising that, until today, this Court\nhas never found that the First Amendment prohibits the\ngovernment from restricting the use of information gath\nered pursuant to a regulatory mandate\u2014whether the\ninformation rests in government files or has remained in\nthe hands of the private firms that gathered it. But cf.\nante, at 11\u201314. Nor has this Court ever previously applied\nany form of \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny in any even roughly\nsimilar case. See Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Re\nporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32 (1999) (no height\nened scrutiny); compare Cincinnati v. Discovery Network,\nInc., 507 U.

It\nadds that \u201c[c]ommercial speech is no exception.\u201d Ante,\nat 10\u201311. And the Court then emphasizes that this is a\ncase involving both \u201ccontent-based\u201d and \u201cspeaker-based\u201d\nrestrictions. See ante, at 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22,\n24.\n   But neither of these categories\u2014\u201ccontent-based\u201d nor\n\u201cspeaker-based\u201d\u2014has ever before justified greater scrutiny\nwhen regulatory activity affects commercial speech. See,\ne.g., Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F. Supp.\n582 (DC 1971) (three-judge court), summarily aff\u2019d\nsub nom. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Acting Attorney\nGeneral, 405 U. S. 1000 (1972) (upholding ban on radio\nand television marketing of tobacco). And the absence of\nany such precedent is understandable.\n   Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on\nthe basis of content. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S.,\nat 761, 762 (\u201cIf there is a kind of commercial speech that\nlacks all First Amendment protection, . . . it must be dis\ntinguished by its content\u201d). Electricity regulators, for\nexample, oversee company statements, pronouncements,\nand proposals, but only about electricity. See, e.g., Vt.\nPub. Serv. Bd. Rules 3.100 (1983), 4.200 (1986), 5.200\n(2004). The Federal Reserve Board regulates the content\nof statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest\nrate disclosures, but only when made by financial institu\ntions. See 12 CFR pts. 226, 230 (2011). And the FDA\n10              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noversees the form and content of labeling, advertising, and\nsales proposals of drugs, but not of furniture. See 21 CFR\npts. 201\u2013203. Given the ubiquity of content-based regula\ntory categories, why should the \u201ccontent-based\u201d nature of\ntypical regulation require courts (other things being equal)\nto grant legislators and regulators less deference? Cf.\nBoard of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.\n469, 481 (1989) (courts, in First Amendment area, should\n\u201cprovide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed\nleeway\u201d when regulated industries are at issue).\n   Nor, in the context of a regulatory program, is it un\nusual for particular rules to be \u201cspeaker-based,\u201d affecting\nonly a class of entities, namely, the regulated firms. An\nenergy regulator, for example, might require the manu\nfacturers of home appliances to publicize ways to reduce\nenergy consumption, while exempting producers of indus\ntrial equipment. See, e.g., 16 CFR pt. 305 (2011) (prescrib\ning labeling requirements for certain home appliances);\nNev. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7704.804, 704.808 (2010) (requiring\nutilities to provide consumers with information on conser\nvation). Or a trade regulator might forbid a particular\nfirm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product\ncontains \u201ccleansing grains that scrub away dirt and ex\ncess oil\u201d unless it substantiates that claim with detailed\nbackup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics use\nneed not substantiate their claims. Morris, F. T. C. Or\nders Data to Back Ad Claims, N. Y. Times, Nov. 3, 1973,\np. 32; Boys\u2019 Life, Oct. 1973, p. 64; see 36 Fed. Reg. 12058\n(1971). Or the FDA might control in detail just what a\npharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential pur\nchasers about its products. Such a firm, for example,\ncould not suggest to a potential purchaser (say, a doctor)\nthat he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an \u201coff\nlabel\u201d use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and\nwith considerable evidence, believes the drug will help.\nAll the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free to\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose. See 21\nCFR pt. 99; cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm.,\n531 U. S. 341, 350\u2013351 (2001) (discussing effect of similar\nregulations in respect to medical devices); see also Pro\nposed Rule, Revised Effectiveness Determination; Sun\nscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,\n76 Fed. Reg. 35672 (2011) (proposing to prohibit market\ning of sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) of\ngreater than 50 due to insufficient data \u201cto indicate that\nthere is additional clinical benefit\u201d).\n   If the Court means to create constitutional barriers to\nregulatory rules that might affect the content of a com\nmercial message, it has embarked upon an unprecedented\ntask\u2014a task that threatens significant judicial interfer\nence with widely accepted regulatory activity. Cf., e.g., 21\nCFR pts. 201\u2013203. Nor would it ease the task to limit its\n\u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny to regulations that only affect cer\ntain speakers. As the examples that I have set forth\nillustrate, many regulations affect only messages sent by a\nsmall class of regulated speakers, for example, electricity\ngenerators or natural gas pipelines.\n   The Court also uses the words \u201caimed\u201d and \u201ctargeted\u201d\nwhen describing the relation of the statute to drug manu\nfacturers. Ante, at 8, 9, 12, 16. But, for the reasons just\nset forth, to require \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny on this basis is\nto require its application early and often when the State\nseeks to regulate industry. Any statutory initiative stems\nfrom a legislative agenda. See, e.g., Message to Congress,\nMay 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4\n(request from President Franklin Roosevelt for legislation\nto ease the plight of factory workers). Any administrative\ninitiative stems from a regulatory agenda. See, e.g., Exec.\nOrder No. 12866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (1993) (specifying\nhow to identify regulatory priorities and requiring agen\ncies to prepare agendas). The related statutes, regula\ntions, programs, and initiatives almost always reflect a\n12              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npoint of view, for example, of the Congress and the ad\nministration that enacted them and ultimately the voters.\nAnd they often aim at, and target, particular firms that\nengage in practices about the merits of which the Gov\nernment and the firms may disagree. Section 2 of the\nSherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a72, for example, which limits the\ntruthful, nonmisleading speech of firms that, due to their\nmarket power, can affect the competitive landscape, is\ndirectly aimed at, and targeted at, monopolists.\n   In short, the case law in this area reflects the need to\nensure that the First Amendment protects the \u201cmarket\nplace of ideas,\u201d thereby facilitating the democratic creation\nof sound government policies without improperly hamper\ning the ability of government to introduce an agenda, to\nimplement its policies, and to favor them to the exclusion\nof contrary policies. To apply \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny when\nthe regulation of commercial activities (which often in\nvolve speech) is at issue is unnecessarily to undercut the\nlatter constitutional goal. The majority\u2019s view of this case\npresents that risk.\n   Moreover, given the sheer quantity of regulatory initia\ntives that touch upon commercial messages, the Court\u2019s\nvision of its reviewing task threatens to return us to a\nhappily bygone era when judges scrutinized legislation for\nits interference with economic liberty. History shows that\nthe power was much abused and resulted in the constitu\ntionalization of economic theories preferred by individual\njurists. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75\u201376\n(1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). By inviting courts to\nscrutinize whether a State\u2019s legitimate regulatory inter\nests can be achieved in less restrictive ways whenever\nthey touch (even indirectly) upon commercial speech,\ntoday\u2019s majority risks repeating the mistakes of the past\nin a manner not anticipated by our precedents. See Cen\ntral Hudson, 447 U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting);\ncf. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co.,\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Whether Vermont\u2019s regulatory\nstatute \u201ctargets\u201d drug companies (as opposed to affecting\nthem unintentionally) must be beside the First Amendment\npoint.\n  This does not mean that economic regulation having\nsome effect on speech is always lawful. Courts typically\nreview the lawfulness of statutes for rationality and of\nregulations (if federal) to make certain they are not \u201carbi\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A). And our valuable free-speech tradition may\nplay an important role in such review. But courts do not\nnormally view these matters as requiring \u201cheightened\u201d\nFirst Amendment scrutiny\u2014and particularly not the un\nforgiving brand of \u201cintermediate\u201d scrutiny employed by\nthe majority. Because the imposition of \u201cheightened\u201d\nscrutiny in such instances would significantly change the\nlegislative/judicial balance, in a way that would signifi\ncantly weaken the legislature\u2019s authority to regulate\ncommerce and industry, I would not apply a \u201cheightened\u201d\nFirst Amendment standard of review in this case.\n                            III\n  Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont\u2019s\nstatute survives application of Central Hudson\u2019s \u201cinterme\ndiate\u201d commercial speech standard as well as any more\nlimited \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d test.\n14              SORRELL v.

I agree that it withholds from pharmaceutical\ncompanies information that would help those entities\ncreate a more effective selling message. But I cannot\nagree with the majority that the harm also involves unjus\ntified discrimination in that it permits \u201cpharmacies\u201d to\n\u201cshare prescriber-identifying information with anyone for\nany reason\u201d (but marketing). Ante, at 17. Whatever the\nFirst Amendment relevance of such discrimination, there\nis no evidence that it exists in Vermont. The record con\ntains no evidence that prescriber-identifying data is\nwidely disseminated. See App. 248, 255. Cf. Burson v.\nFreeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992) (plurality opinion)\n(\u201cStates adopt laws to address the problems that confront\nthem. The First Amendment does not require States to\nregulate for problems that do not exist\u201d); Bates v. State\nBar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 380 (1977) (\u201c[T]he justification\nfor the application of overbreadth analysis applies weakly,\nif at all, in the ordinary commercial context\u201d).\n   The absence of any such evidence likely reflects the\npresence of other legal rules that forbid widespread\nrelease of prescriber-identifying information. Vermont\u2019s\nPharmacy Rules, for example, define \u201cunprofessional\nconduct\u201d to include \u201c[d]ivulging or revealing to unauthor\nized persons patient or practitioner information or the\nnature of professional pharmacy services rendered.\u201d Rule\n20.1(i) (emphasis added); see also Reply Brief for Petition\ners 21. The statute reinforces this prohibition where\npharmaceutical marketing is at issue. And the exceptions\nthat it creates are narrow and concern common and often\nessential uses of prescription data. See Vt. Stat.

The Court apparently means that the\nstatute (1) prevents pharmaceutical companies from creat\ning individualized messages that would help them sell\ntheir drugs more effectively, but (2) permits \u201ccounterde\ntailing\u201d programs, which often promote generic drugs, to\ncreate such messages using prescriber-identifying data. I\nam willing to assume, for argument\u2019s sake, that this con\nsequence would significantly increase the statute\u2019s nega\ntive impact upon commercial speech. But cf. 21 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii) (FDA\u2019s \u201cfair balance\u201d require\nment); App. 193 (no similar FDA requirement for nondrug\nmanufacturers). The record before us, however, contains\nno evidentiary basis for the conclusion that any such\nindividualized counterdetailing is widespread, or exists at\nall, in Vermont.\n    The majority points out, ante, at 4, that Act 80, of which\n\u00a74631 was a part, also created an \u201cevidence-based pre\nscription drug education program,\u201d in which the Vermont\nDepartment of Health, the Department of Vermont Health\nAccess, and the University of Vermont, among others,\nwork together \u201cto provide information and education on\nthe therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescrip\ntion drugs\u201d to health professionals responsible for pre\nscribing and dispensing prescription drugs, Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 18, \u00a74622(a)(1). See generally \u00a7\u00a74621\u20134622. But that\nprogram does not make use of prescriber-identifying data.\n16             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nReply Brief for Petitioners 11.\n   The majority cites testimony by two witnesses in sup\nport of its statement that \u201cStates themselves may supply\nthe prescriber-identifying information used in [counterde\ntailing] programs.\u201d Ante, at 4. One witness explained that\nacademic detailers in Pennsylvania work with state health\nofficials to identify physicians serving patients whose\nhealth care is likewise state provided. App. 375. The\nother, an IMS Health officer, observed that Vermont has\nits own multipayer database containing prescriber\nidentifying data, which could be used to talk to doctors\nabout their prescription patterns and the lower costs\nassociated with generics. Id., at 313. But nothing in the\nrecord indicates that any \u201ccounterdetailing\u201d of this kind\nhas ever taken place in fact in Vermont. State-sponsored\nhealth care professionals sometimes meet with small\ngroups of doctors to discuss best practices and generic\ndrugs generally. See University of Vermont, College of\nMedicine, Office of Primary Care, Vermont Academic\nDetailing Program (July 2010), http://www.med.uvm.edu/\nahec/downloads/VTAD_overview_2010.07.08.pdf (all Inter\nnet materials as visited June 21, 2011, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). Nothing in Vermont\u2019s statute\nprohibits brand-name manufacturers from undertaking a\nsimilar effort.\n   The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related\nharm that the record shows this statute to have brought\nabout is the one I have previously described: The with\nholding of information collected through a regulatory\nprogram, thereby preventing companies from shaping a\ncommercial message they believe maximally effective. The\nabsence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm\nis serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is\nmodest at most.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 564. Ver\nmont enacted its statute\n    \u201cto advance the state\u2019s interest in protecting the pub\n    lic health of Vermonters, protecting the privacy of\n    prescribers and prescribing information, and to en\n    sure costs are contained in the private health care\n    sector, as well as for state purchasers of prescription\n    drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and\n    ensuring prescribers receive unbiased information.\u201d\n    \u00a74631(a).\nThese objectives are important. And the interests they\nembody all are \u201cneutral\u201d in respect to speech. Cf. ante, at\n24.\n   The protection of public health falls within the tradi\ntional scope of a State\u2019s police powers. Hillsborough\nCounty v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S.\n707, 719 (1985). The fact that the Court normally exempts\nthe regulation of \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d information\neven from the rigors of its \u201cintermediate\u201d commercial\nspeech scrutiny testifies to the importance of securing\n\u201cunbiased information,\u201d see 44 Liquormart, 517 U.

As major payers in the health care system,\nhealth care spending is also of crucial state interest. And\nthis Court has affirmed the importance of maintaining\n\u201cprivacy\u201d as an important public policy goal\u2014even in\nrespect to information already disclosed to the public for\nparticular purposes (but not others).

S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139)\n(discussing privacy interests in nondisclosure).\n    At the same time, the record evidence is sufficient to\npermit a legislature to conclude that the statute \u201cdirectly\nadvances\u201d each of these objectives. The statute helps to\nfocus sales discussions on an individual drug\u2019s safety,\neffectiveness, and cost, perhaps compared to other drugs\n(including generics). These drug-related facts have every\nthing to do with general information that drug manufac\nturers likely possess. They have little, if anything, to do\nwith the name or prior prescription practices of the par\nticular doctor to whom a detailer is speaking. Shaping a\ndetailing message based on an individual doctor\u2019s prior\nprescription habits may help sell more of a particular\nmanufacturer\u2019s particular drugs. But it does so by divert\ning attention from scientific research about a drug\u2019s safety\nand effectiveness, as well as its cost. This diversion comes\nat the expense of public health and the State\u2019s fiscal\ninterests.\n    Vermont compiled a substantial legislative record to\ncorroborate this line of reasoning. See Testimony of Sean\nFlynn (Apr. 11, 2007), App. in No. 09\u20131913\u2013cv(L) etc.\n(CA2), p. A\u20131156 (hereinafter CA2 App.) (use of data\nmining helps drug companies \u201cto cover up information\nthat is not in the best of light of their drug and to high\nlight information that makes them look good\u201d); Volker &\nOutterson, New Legislative Trends Threaten the Way\nHealth Information Companies Operate, Pharmaceutical\nPricing & Reimbursement 2007, id., at A\u20134235 (one for\nmer detailer considered prescriber-identifying data the\n\u201c \u2018greatest tool in planning our approach to manipulating\ndoctors\u2019 \u201d (quoting Whitney, Big (Brother) Pharma: How\nDrug Reps Know Which Doctors to Target, New Republic,\nAug. 29, 2006, http://www.tnr.com/article/84056/health\ncare-eli-lilly-pfizer-ama); Testimony of Paul Harrington\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

And it is the job of regulatory agencies and\nlegislatures to make just these kinds of judgments. Ver\nmont\u2019s attempts to ensure a \u201cfair balance\u201d of information\nis no different from the FDA\u2019s similar requirement, see\n21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii). No one has yet sug\ngested that substantial portions of federal drug regulation\nare unconstitutional. Why then should we treat Vermont\u2019s\nlaw differently?\n  The record also adequately supports the State\u2019s privacy\nobjective. Regulatory rules in Vermont make clear that\nthe confidentiality of an individual doctor\u2019s prescribing\npractices remains the norm. See, e.g., Pharmacy Rule\n8.7(c) (\u201cPrescription and other patient health care infor\nmation shall be secure from access by the public, and the\ninformation shall be kept confidential\u201d); Pharmacy Rule\n20              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n20.1(i) (forbidding disclosure of patient or prescriber in\nformation to \u201cunauthorized persons\u201d without consent).\nExceptions to this norm are comparatively few. See, e.g.,\nibid. (identifying \u201cauthorized persons\u201d); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n18, \u00a74631(e); App. 248, 255 (indicating that prescriber\nidentifying data is not widely disseminated). There is no\nindication that the State of Vermont, or others in the\nState, makes use of this information for counterdetailing\nefforts. See supra, at 15.\n   Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the data miners\nwho sell information to those manufacturers would like to\ncreate (and did create) an additional exception, which\nmeans additional circulation of otherwise largely confi\ndential information. Vermont\u2019s statute closes that door.\nAt the same time, the statute permits doctors who wish\nto permit use of their prescribing practices to do so.\n\u00a7\u00a74631(c)\u2013(d). For purposes of Central Hudson, this would\nseem sufficiently to show that the statute serves a mean\ningful interest in increasing the protection given to pre\nscriber privacy. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (in commercial\nspeech area, First Amendment requires \u201ca fit that is not\nnecessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not\nnecessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope\nis in proportion to the interest served\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also United States v. Edge Broadcast\ning Co., 509 U.

In any event, physi\ncians are unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for\nthose detailers, whether delivering a balanced or imbal\nanced message, are nonetheless providers of much useful\ninformation. See Manchanda & Honka, The Effects and\nRole of Direct-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceuti\ncal Industry: An Integrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol\u2019y\nL. & Ethics 785, 793\u2013797, 815\u2013816 (2005); Ziegler, Lew, &\nSinger, The Accuracy of Drug Information from Pharma\nceutical Sales Representatives, 273 JAMA 1296 (1995).\nForcing doctors to choose between targeted detailing and\nno detailing at all could therefore jeopardize the State\u2019s\ninterest in promoting public health.\n   The majority also suggests that if the \u201cstatute provided\nthat prescriber-identifying information could not be sold or\ndisclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State\nmight have a stronger position.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325; see also\nante, at 17. But the disclosure-permitting exceptions here\nare quite narrow, and they serve useful, indeed essential\npurposes. See supra, at 14. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n18, \u00a74631(e) with note following 42 U. S. C. \u00a71320d\u20132, p.\n1190, and 45 CFR \u00a7164.512 (uses and disclosures not\nrequiring consent under the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996). Regardless, this alterna\ntive is not \u201ca more limited restriction,\u201d Central Hudson,\nsupra, at 564 (emphasis added), for it would impose a\ngreater, not a lesser, burden upon the dissemination of\ninformation.\n   Respondents\u2019 alternatives are no more helpful. Respon\ndents suggest that \u201cVermont can simply inform physicians\nthat pharmaceutical companies . . . use prescription his\ntory information to communicate with doctors.\u201d Brief for\n22             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nRespondent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America 48. But how would that help serve the State\u2019s\nbasic purposes? It would not create the \u201cfair balance\u201d of\ninformation in pharmaceutical marketing that the State,\nlike the FDA, seeks. Cf. Reno v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997) (alternative must be \u201cat\nleast as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that\nthe statute was enacted to serve\u201d). Respondents also\nsuggest policies requiring use of generic drugs or educat\ning doctors about their benefits. Brief for Respondent\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\n54\u201355. Such programs have been in effect for some time\nin Vermont or other States, without indication that they\nhave prevented the imbalanced sales tactics at which\nVermont\u2019s statute takes aim. See, e.g., Written Statement\nof Jerry Avorn & Aaron Kesselheim, CA2 App. 4310; Doc.\n414, at 60\u201361. And in any event, such laws do not help\nprotect prescriber privacy.\n   Vermont has thus developed a record that sufficiently\nshows that its statute meaningfully furthers substantial\nstate interests. Neither the majority nor respondents\nsuggests any equally effective \u201cmore limited\u201d restriction.\nAnd the First Amendment harm that Vermont\u2019s statute\nworks is, at most, modest. I consequently conclude that,\neven if we apply an \u201cintermediate\u201d test such as that in\nCentral Hudson, this statute is constitutional.\n                           IV\n   What about the statute\u2019s third restriction, providing\nthat \u201c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical\nmarketers\u201d may not \u201cuse prescriber-identifiable informa\ntion for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless\nthe prescriber consents\u201d? Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631(d)\n(emphasis added). In principle, I should not reach this\nquestion. That is because respondent pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers, marketers, and data miners seek a de\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

C. \u00a72201; App. 49\u2013\n128. And they have neither shown nor claimed that they\ncould obtain significant amounts of \u201cprescriber-identifiable\ninformation\u201d if the first two prohibitions are valid. If, as\nI believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related to\nselling and disclosing the information) are valid, then\nthe dispute about the validity of the third provision is\nnot \u201c \u2018real and substantial\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018definite and concrete.\u2019 \u201d\nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127\n(2007) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.\n227, 240\u2013241 (1937)) (Article III does not permit courts to\nentertain such disputes).\n  The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions,\nand so I add that I disagree with the majority as to the\nconstitutionality of the third restriction as well\u2014basically\nfor the reasons I have already set out. The prohibition\nagainst pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber\nidentifying information works no more than modest First\nAmendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the need\nto ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unneces\nsarily high drug costs, and protect the privacy of prescrib\ning physicians. There is no obvious equally effective, more\nlimited alternative.\n                              V\n   In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the\n\u201cintermediate\u201d standards this Court has applied to restric\ntions on commercial speech. A fortiori it satisfies less\ndemanding standards that are more appropriately applied\nin this kind of commercial regulatory case\u2014a case where\nthe government seeks typical regulatory ends (lower drug\nprices, more balanced sales messages) through the use of\nordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use\nof data gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate). The\nspeech-related consequences here are indirect, incidental,\n24             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand entirely commercial. See supra, at 6\u20139.\n  The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of\nimportant First Amendment categories\u2014\u201ccontent-based,\u201d\n\u201cspeaker-based,\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d\u2014but without taking full\naccount of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech\neffects, the values these First Amendment categories seek\nto promote, and prior precedent. See supra, at 2\u20136, 9\u201313,\n17. At best the Court opens a Pandora\u2019s Box of First\nAmendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory\npractices that may only incidentally affect a commercial\nmessage. See, e.g., supra, at 7\u20138, 9\u201311. At worst, it re\nawakens Lochner\u2019s pre-New Deal threat of substituting\njudicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary\neconomic regulation is at issue. See Central Hudson, 447\nU. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n  Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial\nspeech standard or a less demanding standard, I believe\nVermont\u2019s law is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd with respect, I dissent.\n",

Vermont\u2019s statute, which imposes content- and speaker-based\n burdens on protected expression, is subject to heightened judicial\n scrutiny. Pp. 6\u201315.\n2                    SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (a) On its face, the law enacts a content- and speaker-based re\n    striction on the sale, disclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying in\n    formation. The law first forbids sale subject to exceptions based in\n    large part on the content of a purchaser\u2019s speech. It then bars phar\n    macies from disclosing the information when recipient speakers will\n    use that information for marketing. Finally, it prohibits pharmaceu\n    tical manufacturers from using the information for marketing. The\n    statute thus disfavors marketing, i.e., speech with a particular con\n    tent, as well as particular speakers, i.e., detailers engaged in market\n    ing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cincinnati v. Dis\n    covery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426; Turner Broadcasting\n    System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 658. Yet the law allows pre\n    scriber-identifying information to be purchased, acquired, and used\n    for other types of speech and by other speakers. The record and for\n    mal legislative findings of purpose confirm that \u00a74631(d) imposes an\n    aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in particular detailers who\n    promote brand-name drugs. In practical operation, Vermont\u2019s law\n    \u201cgoes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint\n    discrimination.\u201d R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 391. Heightened\n    judicial scrutiny is warranted. Pp. 8\u201311.\n         (b) Vermont errs in arguing that heightened scrutiny is unwar\n    ranted. The State contends that its law is a mere commercial regula\n    tion. Far from having only an incidental effect on speech, however,\n    \u00a74631(d) imposes a burden based on the content of speech and the\n    identity of the speaker. The State next argues that, because pre\n    scriber-identifying information was generated in compliance with a\n    legal mandate, \u00a74631(d) is akin to a restriction on access to govern\n    ment-held information. That argument finds some support in Los\n    Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S.\n    32, but that case is distinguishable. Vermont has imposed a restric\n    tion on access to information in private hands. United Reporting re\n    served that situation\u2014i.e., \u201ca case in which the government is prohib\n    iting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already\n    possesses.\u201d Id., at 40. In addition, the United Reporting plaintiff was\n    presumed to have suffered no personal First Amendment injury,\n    while respondents claim that \u00a74631(d) burdens their own speech.\n    That circumstance warrants heightened scrutiny. Vermont also ar\n    gues that heightened judicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales,\n    transfer, and use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,\n    not speech. However, the creation and dissemination of information\n    are speech for First Amendment purposes. See, e.g., Bartnicki v.\n    Vopper, 532 U. S. 514, 527. There is no need to consider Vermont\u2019s\n    request for an exception to that rule. Section 4631(d) imposes a\n    speaker- and content-based burden on protected expression, and that\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncircumstance is sufficient to justify applying heightened scrutiny,\neven assuming that prescriber-identifying information is a mere\ncommodity. Pp. 11\u201315.\n   2. Vermont\u2019s justifications for \u00a74631(d) do not withstand height\nened scrutiny. Pp. 15\u201324.\n      (a) The outcome here is the same whether a special commercial\nspeech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied, see,\ne.g., Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United States,\n527 U. S. 173, 184. To sustain \u00a74631(d)\u2019s targeted, content-based\nburden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and\nthat the measure is drawn to achieve that interest. See Board of\nTrustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480\u2013481. Ver\nmont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical privacy,\nincluding physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment, and the\nintegrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and (2) is integral to the\nachievement of the policy objectives of improving public health and\nreducing healthcare costs. Pp. 15\u201317.\n      (b) Assuming that physicians have an interest in keeping their\nprescription decisions confidential, \u00a74631(d) is not drawn to serve\nthat interest. Pharmacies may share prescriber-identifying informa\ntion with anyone for any reason except for marketing. Vermont\nmight have addressed physician confidentiality through \u201ca more co\nherent policy,\u201d Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195,\nsuch as allowing the information\u2019s sale or disclosure in only a few\nnarrow and well-justified circumstances. But it did not. Given the in\nformation\u2019s widespread availability and many permissible uses, Ver\nmont\u2019s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot justify\nthe burdens that \u00a74631(d) imposes on protected expression. It is true\nthat doctors can forgo the law\u2019s advantages by consenting to the sale,\ndisclosure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information. But\nthe State has offered only a contrived choice: Either consent, which\nwill allow the doctor\u2019s prescriber-identifying information to be dis\nseminated and used without constraint; or, withhold consent, which\nwill allow the information to be used by those speakers whose mes\nsage the State supports. Cf. Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S.\n728. Respondents suggest a further defect lies in \u00a74631(d)\u2019s pre\nsumption of applicability absent an individual election to the con\ntrary. Reliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy\nmeasure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.\nVermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary to\navoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with detail\ners. Cf. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of\nStratton, 536 U. S. 150, 168. Vermont further argues that detailers\u2019\n4                    SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    use of prescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor\n    patient relationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment de\n    cisions. But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment decisions,\n    it can do so only because it is persuasive. Fear that speech might\n    persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it. Pp. 17\u201321.\n         (c) While Vermont\u2019s goals of lowering the costs of medical ser\n    vices and promoting public health may be proper, \u00a74631(d) does not\n    advance them in a permissible way. Vermont seeks to achieve those\n    objectives through the indirect means of restraining certain speech by\n    certain speakers\u2014i.e., by diminishing detailers\u2019 ability to influence\n    prescription decisions. But \u201cthe fear that people would make bad de\n    cisions if given truthful information\u201d cannot justify content-based\n    burdens on speech. Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535\n    U. S. 357, 374. That precept applies with full force when the audi\n    ence\u2014here, prescribing physicians\u2014consists of \u201csophisticated and\n    experienced\u201d consumers. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 775. The\n    instant law\u2019s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners find\n    detailing instructive. Vermont may be displeased that detailers with\n    prescriber-indentifying information are effective in promoting brand\n    name drugs, but the State may not burden protected expression in\n    order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction. Vermont nowhere\n    contends that its law will prevent false or misleading speech within\n    the meaning of this Court\u2019s First Amendment precedents. The\n    State\u2019s interest in burdening detailers\u2019 speech thus turns on nothing\n    more than a difference of opinion.

SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF \n\n        VERMONT, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.\n\n            IMS HEALTH INC. ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 23, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Vermont law restricts the sale, disclosure, and use of\npharmacy records that reveal the prescribing practices of\nindividual doctors. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631 (Supp.\n2010). Subject to certain exceptions, the information may\nnot be sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing pur\nposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufac\nturers. Vermont argues that its prohibitions safeguard\nmedical privacy and diminish the likelihood that market\ning will lead to prescription decisions not in the best inter\nests of patients or the State. It can be assumed that these\ninterests are significant. Speech in aid of pharmaceutical\nmarketing, however, is a form of expression protected by\nthe Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As a\nconsequence, Vermont\u2019s statute must be subjected to\nheightened judicial scrutiny. The law cannot satisfy that\nstandard.\n                         I\n                         A\n  Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to\n2               SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoctors through a process called \u201cdetailing.\u201d This often in-\nvolves a scheduled visit to a doctor\u2019s office to persuade\nthe doctor to prescribe a particular pharmaceutical. De\ntailers bring drug samples as well as medical studies\nthat explain the \u201cdetails\u201d and potential advantages of var\nious prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen, ask\nquestions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be\nmore effective when they know the background and pur\nchasing preferences of their clientele, and pharmaceutical\nsalespersons are no exception. Knowledge of a physi-\ncian\u2019s prescription practices\u2014called \u201cprescriber-identifying\n information\u201d\u2014enables a detailer better to ascertain which\ndoctors are likely to be interested in a particular drug and\nhow best to present a particular sales message. Detailing\nis an expensive undertaking, so pharmaceutical companies\nmost often use it to promote high-profit brand-name drugs\nprotected by patent. Once a brand-name drug\u2019s patent\nexpires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives\nare manufactured and sold.\n   Pharmacies, as a matter of business routine and federal\nlaw, receive prescriber-identifying information when proc\nessing prescriptions. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b); see also\nVt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule 9.2.\nMany pharmacies sell this information to \u201cdata miners,\u201d\nfirms that analyze prescriber-identifying information and\nproduce reports on prescriber behavior. Data miners lease\nthese reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers subject to\nnondisclosure agreements. Detailers, who represent the\nmanufacturers, then use the reports to refine their mar\nketing tactics and increase sales.\n   In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription Confidential\nity Law. The measure is also referred to as Act 80. It has\nseveral components. The central provision of the present\ncase is \u00a74631(d).\n    \u201cA health insurer, a self-insured employer, an elec\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    tronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other\n    similar entity shall not sell, license, or exchange\n    for value regulated records containing prescriber\n    identifiable information, nor permit the use of\n    regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable\n    information for marketing or promoting a prescription\n    drug, unless the prescriber consents . . . . Pharmaceu\n    tical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers\n    shall not use prescriber-identifiable information for\n    marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless\n    the prescriber consents . . . .\u201d\nThe quoted provision has three component parts. The\nprovision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insur\ners, and similar entities from selling prescriber-identifying\ninformation, absent the prescriber\u2019s consent. The parties\nhere dispute whether this clause applies to all sales or\nonly to sales for marketing. The provision then goes on to\nprohibit pharmacies, health insurers, and similar enti-\nties from allowing prescriber-identifying information to be\nused for marketing, unless the prescriber consents. This\nprohibition in effect bars pharmacies from disclosing the\ninformation for marketing purposes. Finally, the provi\nsion\u2019s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers\nand pharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber\nidentifying information for marketing, again absent the\nprescriber\u2019s consent. The Vermont attorney general may\npursue civil remedies against violators. \u00a74631(f).\n   Separate statutory provisions elaborate the scope of the\nprohibitions set out in \u00a74631(d). \u201cMarketing\u201d is defined to\ninclude \u201cadvertising, promotion, or any activity\u201d that is\n\u201cused to influence sales or the market share of a prescrip\ntion drug.\u201d \u00a74631(b)(5). Section 4631(c)(1) further pro\nvides that Vermont\u2019s Department of Health must allow \u201ca\nprescriber to give consent for his or her identifying infor\nmation to be used for the purposes\u201d identified in \u00a74631(d).\n4               SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFinally, the Act\u2019s prohibitions on sale, disclosure, and use\nare subject to a list of exceptions. For example, prescriber\nidentifying information may be disseminated or used for\n\u201chealth care research\u201d; to enforce \u201ccompliance\u201d with health\ninsurance formularies, or preferred drug lists; for \u201ccare\nmanagement educational communications provided to\u201d pa\ntients on such matters as \u201ctreatment options\u201d; for law\nenforcement operations; and for purposes \u201cotherwise pro\nvided by law.\u201d \u00a74631(e).\n   Act 80 also authorized funds for an \u201cevidence-based pre\nscription drug education program\u201d designed to provide\ndoctors and others with \u201cinformation and education on\nthe therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription\ndrugs.\u201d \u00a74622(a)(1). An express aim of the program is\nto advise prescribers \u201cabout commonly used brand-name\ndrugs for which the patent has expired\u201d or will soon ex\npire. \u00a74622(a)(2). Similar efforts to promote the use of\ngeneric pharmaceuticals are sometimes referred to as\n\u201ccounter-detailing.\u201d App. 211; see also IMS Health Inc. v.\nAyotte, 550 F. 3d 42, 91 (CA1 2008) (Lipez, J., concurring\nand dissenting).       The counterdetailer\u2019s recommended\nsubstitute may be an older, less expensive drug and not a\nbioequivalent of the brand-name drug the physician might\notherwise prescribe. Like the pharmaceutical manufac\nturers whose efforts they hope to resist, counterdetailers\nin some States use prescriber-identifying information to\nincrease their effectiveness. States themselves may sup\nply the prescriber-identifying information used in these\nprograms. See App. 313; id., at 375 (\u201c[W]e use the data\ngiven to us by the State of Pennsylvania . . . to figure out\nwhich physicians to talk to\u201d); see also id., at 427\u2013429\n(Director of the Office of Vermont Health Access explain\ning that the office collects prescriber-identifying informa\ntion but \u201cdoes not at this point in time have a counter\ndetailing or detailing effort\u201d). As first enacted, Act 80 also\nrequired detailers to provide information about alternative\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment options. The Vermont Legislature, however,\nlater repealed that provision. 2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, \u00a73.\n  Act 80 was accompanied by legislative findings. Vt. Acts\nNo. 80, \u00a71. Vermont found, for example, that the \u201cgoals of\nmarketing programs are often in conflict with the goals\nof the state\u201d and that the \u201cmarketplace for ideas on medi\ncine safety and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that\n brand-name companies invest in expensive pharmaceuti\ncal marketing campaigns to doctors.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71(3), (4). Detail\ning, in the legislature\u2019s view, caused doctors to make\ndecisions based on \u201cincomplete and biased information.\u201d\n\u00a71(4). Because they \u201care unable to take the time to re\nsearch the quickly changing pharmaceutical market,\u201d\nVermont doctors \u201crely on information provided by phar\nmaceutical representatives.\u201d       \u00a71(13).   The legislature\nfurther found that detailing increases the cost of health\ncare and health insurance, \u00a71(15); encourages hasty and\nexcessive reliance on brand-name drugs, before the profes\nsion has observed their effectiveness as compared with\nolder and less expensive generic alternatives, \u00a71(7); and\nfosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tanta\nmount to harassment, \u00a7\u00a71(27)\u2013(28). The legislative find\nings further noted that use of prescriber-identifying in\nformation \u201cincrease[s] the effect of detailing programs\u201d\nby allowing detailers to target their visits to particular\ndoctors. \u00a7\u00a71(23)\u2013(26). Use of prescriber-identifying data\nalso helps detailers shape their messages by \u201ctailoring\u201d their\n\u201cpresentations to individual prescriber styles, preferences,\nand attitudes.\u201d \u00a71(25).\n                           B\n  The present case involves two consolidated suits. One\nwas brought by three Vermont data miners, the other\nby an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that\nproduce brand-name drugs. These entities are the re\nspondents here.

The District Court found that \u201c[p]harmaceutical\nmanufacturers are essentially the only paying customers\nof the data vendor industry\u201d and that, because detailing\nunpatented generic drugs is not \u201ccost-effective,\u201d pharma\nceutical sales representatives \u201cdetail only branded drugs.\u201d\nId., at 451, 442.

The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded. It\nheld that \u00a74631(d) violates the First Amendment by bur\ndening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and data\nminers without an adequate justification. 630 F. 3d 263.\nJudge Livingston dissented.\n   The decision of the Second Circuit is in conflict with de\ncisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by\nMaine and New Hampshire. See IMS Health Inc. v. Mills,\n616 F. 3d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); Ayotte, supra (New Hamp-\nshire). Recognizing a division of authority regarding the\nconstitutionality of state statutes, this Court granted\ncertiorari. 562 U. S. __ (2011).\n                            II\n  The beginning point is the text of \u00a74631(d). In the pro-\nceedings below, Vermont stated that the first sentence\nof \u00a74631(d) prohibits pharmacies and other regulated\nentities from selling or disseminating prescriber\nidentifying information for marketing. The information,\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin other words, could be sold or given away for purposes\nother than marketing. The District Court and the Court of\nAppeals accepted the State\u2019s reading. See 630 F. 3d,\nat 276. At oral argument in this Court, however, the\nState for the first time advanced an alternative reading of\n\u00a74631(d)\u2014namely, that pharmacies, health insurers, and\nsimilar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying infor\nmation for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions\nset out at \u00a74631(e). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\u201320. It might\nbe argued that the State\u2019s newfound interpretation comes\ntoo late in the day. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU. S. 51, 56, n. 4 (2002) (waiver); New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel). The\nrespondents, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals\nwere entitled to rely on the State\u2019s plausible interpretation\nof the law it is charged with enforcing. For the State to\nchange its position is particularly troubling in a First\nAmendment case, where plaintiffs have a special interest\nin obtaining a prompt adjudication of their rights, despite\npotential ambiguities of state law. See Houston v. Hill,\n482 U. S. 451, 467\u2013468, and n. 17 (1987); Zwickler v.\nKoota, 389 U. S. 241, 252 (1967).\n  In any event, \u00a74631(d) cannot be sustained even under\nthe interpretation the State now adopts. As a consequence\nthis Court can assume that the opening clause of \u00a74631(d)\nprohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar entities\nfrom selling prescriber-identifying information, subject to\nthe statutory exceptions set out at \u00a74631(e). Under that\nreading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or\nacademic researchers, see \u00a74631(e)(1), but not, for exam\nple, to pharmaceutical marketers. There is no dispute as\nto the remainder of \u00a74631(d). It prohibits pharmacies,\nhealth insurers, and similar entities from disclosing or\notherwise allowing prescriber-identifying information to\nbe used for marketing. And it bars pharmaceutical manu\nfacturers and detailers from using the information for\n8              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmarketing. The questions now are whether \u00a74631(d) must\nbe tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so,\nwhether the State can justify the law.\n                             A\n                             1\n  On its face, Vermont\u2019s law enacts content- and speaker\nbased restrictions on the sale, disclosure, and use of\nprescriber-identifying information. The provision first for\nbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the\ncontent of a purchaser\u2019s speech. For example, those who\nwish to engage in certain \u201ceducational communications,\u201d\n\u00a74631(e)(4), may purchase the information. The measure\nthen bars any disclosure when recipient speakers will use\nthe information for marketing. Finally, the provision\u2019s\nsecond sentence prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers\nfrom using the information for marketing. The statute\nthus disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular\ncontent. More than that, the statute disfavors specific\nspeakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a\nresult of these content- and speaker-based rules, detailers\ncannot obtain prescriber-identifying information, even\nthough the information may be purchased or acquired by\nother speakers with diverse purposes and viewpoints.\nDetailers are likewise barred from using the information\nfor marketing, even though the information may be used\nby a wide range of other speakers. For example, it ap\npears that Vermont could supply academic organizations\nwith prescriber-identifying information to use in counter\ning the messages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufac\nturers and in promoting the prescription of generic drugs.\nBut \u00a74631(d) leaves detailers no means of purchasing,\nacquiring, or using prescriber-identifying information.\nThe law on its face burdens disfavored speech by disfa\nvored speakers.\n  Any doubt that \u00a74631(d) imposes an aimed, content\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbased burden on detailers is dispelled by the record and by\nformal legislative findings. As the District Court noted,\n\u201c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only\npaying customers of the data vendor industry\u201d; and the\nalmost invariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers is in support of brand-name drugs. 631\nF. Supp. 2d, at 451. Vermont\u2019s law thus has the effect of\npreventing detailers\u2014and only detailers\u2014from communi\ncating with physicians in an effective and informative\nmanner. Cf. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 766 (1993)\n(explaining the \u201cconsiderable value\u201d of in-person solicita\ntion). Formal legislative findings accompanying \u00a74631(d)\nconfirm that the law\u2019s express purpose and practical effect\nare to diminish the effectiveness of marketing by manu\nfacturers of brand-name drugs. Just as the \u201cinevitable\neffect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitu\ntional,\u201d a statute\u2019s stated purposes may also be considered.\nUnited States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968). Here,\nthe Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in\nparticular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey\nmessages that \u201care often in conflict with the goals of the\nstate.\u201d 2007 Vt. No. 80, \u00a71(3). The legislature designed\n\u00a74631(d) to target those speakers and their messages for\ndisfavored treatment. \u201cIn its practical operation,\u201d Ver\nmont\u2019s law \u201cgoes even beyond mere content discrimina\ntion, to actual viewpoint discrimination.\u201d R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 391 (1992). Given the legislature\u2019s\nexpressed statement of purpose, it is apparent that\n\u00a74631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the content\nof speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint.\n   Act 80 is designed to impose a specific, content-based\nburden on protected expression. It follows that heightened\njudicial scrutiny is warranted. See Cincinnati v. Discovery\nNetwork, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418 (1993) (applying height\nened scrutiny to \u201ca categorical prohibition on the use of\nnewsracks to disseminate commercial messages\u201d); id., at\n10              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n429 (\u201c[T]he very basis for the regulation is the difference\nin content between ordinary newspapers and commercial\nspeech\u201d in the form of \u201ccommercial handbills . . . . Thus,\nby any commonsense understanding of the term, the ban\nin this case is \u2018content based\u2019 \u201d (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v.

The Court has\nrecognized that the \u201cdistinction between laws burdening\nand laws banning speech is but a matter of degree\u201d and\nthat the \u201cGovernment\u2019s content-based burdens must sat\nisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.\u201d\nUnited States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529\nU. S. 803, 812 (2000). Lawmakers may no more silence\nunwanted speech by burdening its utterance than by cen\nsoring its content. See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Mem-\nbers of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,\n115 (1991) (content-based financial burden); Minneapolis\nStar & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm\u2019r of Revenue, 460\nU. S. 575 (1983) (speaker-based financial burden).\n   The First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny\nwhenever the government creates \u201ca regulation of speech\nbecause of disagreement with the message it conveys.\u201d\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989);\nsee also Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.

A government bent on frustrating an impend\ning demonstration might pass a law demanding two years\u2019\nnotice before the issuance of parade permits.

S. 350, 364 (1977). That reality has\ngreat relevance in the fields of medicine and public health,\nwhere information can save lives.\n                              2\n   The State argues that heightened judicial scrutiny is\nunwarranted because its law is a mere commercial regula\ntion. It is true that restrictions on protected expression\nare distinct from restrictions on economic activity or, more\ngenerally, on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that\nthe First Amendment does not prevent restrictions di\nrected at commerce or conduct from imposing inciden\ntal burdens on speech. That is why a ban on race-based\nhiring may require employers to remove \u201c \u2018White Appli\ncants Only\u2019 \u201d signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and\nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 62 (2006); why \u201can\nordinance against outdoor fires\u201d might forbid \u201cburning a\nflag,\u201d R. A.

S. 490, 502 (1949).\n   But \u00a74631(d) imposes more than an incidental burden\non protected expression. Both on its face and in its practi\ncal operation, Vermont\u2019s law imposes a burden based on\nthe content of speech and the identity of the speaker. See\nsupra, at 8\u201311. While the burdened speech results from\nan economic motive, so too does a great deal of vital ex\npression. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 818\n(1975); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266\n(1964); see also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533\nU. S. 405, 410\u2013411 (2001) (applying \u201cFirst Amendment\nscrutiny\u201d where speech effects were not incidental and\n12              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoting that \u201cthose whose business and livelihood depend\nin some way upon the product involved no doubt deem\nFirst Amendment protection to be just as important for\nthem as it is for other discrete, little noticed groups\u201d).\nVermont\u2019s law does not simply have an effect on speech,\nbut is directed at certain content and is aimed at particu\nlar speakers. The Constitution \u201cdoes not enact Mr. Her\nbert Spencer\u2019s Social Statics.\u201d Lochner v. New York, 198\nU. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). It does enact\nthe First Amendment.\n   Vermont further argues that \u00a74631(d) regulates not\nspeech but simply access to information. Prescriber\nidentifying information was generated in compliance with\na legal mandate, the State argues, and so could be consid\nered a kind of governmental information. This argument\nfinds some support in Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United\nReporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32 (1999), where the\nCourt held that a plaintiff could not raise a facial chal\nlenge to a content-based restriction on access to government-\nheld information. Because no private party faced a\nthreat of legal punishment, the Court characterized the\nlaw at issue as \u201cnothing more than a governmental denial\nof access to information in its possession.\u201d Id., at 40.\nUnder those circumstances the special reasons for permit\nting First Amendment plaintiffs to invoke the rights of\nothers did not apply. Id., at 38\u201339. Having found that the\nplaintiff could not raise a facial challenge, the Court re\nmanded for consideration of an as-applied challenge. Id.,\nat 41. United Reporting is thus a case about the availabil\nity of facial challenges. The Court did not rule on the\nmerits of any First Amendment claim.\n   United Reporting is distinguishable in at least two\nrespects. First, Vermont has imposed a restriction on\naccess to information in private hands. This confronts the\nCourt with a point reserved, and a situation not ad\ndressed, in United Reporting. Here, unlike in United\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReporting, we do have \u201ca case in which the government is\nprohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the\nspeaker already possesses.\u201d Id., at 40. The difference is\nsignificant. An individual\u2019s right to speak is implicated\nwhen information he or she possesses is subjected to \u201cre\nstraints on the way in which the information might be\nused\u201d or disseminated. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart,\n467 U. S. 20, 32 (1984); see also Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532\nU. S. 514, 527 (2001); Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S.\n524 (1989); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S.\n713 (1971) (per curiam). In Seattle Times, this Court\napplied heightened judicial scrutiny before sustaining a\ntrial court order prohibiting a newspaper\u2019s disclosure of\ninformation it learned through coercive discovery. It is\ntrue that the respondents here, unlike the newspaper in\nSeattle Times, do not themselves possess information\nwhose disclosure has been curtailed. That information,\nhowever, is in the hands of pharmacies and other private\nentities. There is no question that the \u201cthreat of prosecu\ntion . . . hangs over their heads.\u201d United Reporting, 528\nU. S., at 41. For that reason United Reporting does not\nbar respondents\u2019 facial challenge.\n   United Reporting is distinguishable for a second and\neven more important reason. The plaintiff in United\nReporting had neither \u201cattempt[ed] to qualify\u201d for access to\nthe government\u2019s information nor presented an as-applied\nclaim in this Court. Id., at 40. As a result, the Court\nassumed that the plaintiff had not suffered a personal\nFirst Amendment injury and could prevail only by invok\ning the rights of others through a facial challenge. Here,\nby contrast, the respondents claim\u2014with good reason\u2014\nthat \u00a74631(d) burdens their own speech. That argument\nfinds support in the separate writings in United Report\ning, which were joined by eight Justices. All of those\nwritings recognized that restrictions on the disclosure of\ngovernment-held information can facilitate or burden the\n14              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexpression of potential recipients and so transgress the\nFirst Amendment. See id., at 42 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(suggesting that \u201ca restriction upon access that allows\naccess to the press . . . but at the same time denies access\nto persons who wish to use the information for certain\nspeech purposes, is in reality a restriction upon speech\u201d);\nid., at 43 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (noting that \u201cthe\nprovision of [government] information is a kind of subsidy\nto people who wish to speak\u201d about certain subjects, \u201cand\nonce a State decides to make such a benefit available to\nthe public, there are no doubt limits to its freedom to\ndecide how that benefit will be distributed\u201d); id., at 46\n(Stevens, J., dissenting) (concluding that, \u201cbecause the\nState\u2019s discrimination is based on its desire to prevent the\ninformation from being used for constitutionally protected\npurposes, [i]t must assume the burden of justifying its\nconduct\u201d). Vermont\u2019s law imposes a content- and speaker\nbased burden on respondents\u2019 own speech. That consid\neration provides a separate basis for distinguishing United\nReporting and requires heightened judicial scrutiny.\n   The State also contends that heightened judicial scru\ntiny is unwarranted in this case because sales, transfer,\nand use of prescriber-identifying information are conduct,\nnot speech. Consistent with that submission, the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has charac\nterized prescriber-identifying information as a mere \u201ccom\nmodity\u201d with no greater entitlement to First Amend-\nment protection than \u201cbeef jerky.\u201d Ayotte, 550 F. 3d, at\n52\u201353. In contrast the courts below concluded that a\nprohibition on the sale of prescriber-identifying informa\ntion is a content-based rule akin to a ban on the sale of\ncookbooks, laboratory results, or train schedules. See 630\nF. 3d, at 271\u2013272 (\u201cThe First Amendment protects even\ndry information, devoid of advocacy, political relevance, or\nartistic expression\u201d (internal quotation marks and altera\ntion omitted)); 631 F. Supp. 2d, at 445 (\u201cA restriction on\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisclosure is a regulation of speech, and the \u2018sale\u2019 of [in\nformation] is simply disclosure for profit\u201d).\n   This Court has held that the creation and dissemination\nof information are speech within the meaning of the First\nAmendment. See, e.g., Bartnicki, supra, at 527 (\u201c[I]f the\nacts of \u2018disclosing\u2019 and \u2018publishing\u2019 information do not\nconstitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall\nwithin that category, as distinct from the category of\nexpressive conduct\u201d (some internal quotation marks omit\nted)); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 481\n(1995) (\u201cinformation on beer labels\u201d is speech); Dun &\nBradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749,\n759 (1985) (plurality opinion) (credit report is \u201cspeech\u201d).\nFacts, after all, are the beginning point for much of the\nspeech that is most essential to advance human knowl\nedge and to conduct human affairs. There is thus a\nstrong argument that prescriber-identifying information is\nspeech for First Amendment purposes.\n   The State asks for an exception to the rule that informa\ntion is speech, but there is no need to consider that re\nquest in this case. The State has imposed content- and\nspeaker-based restrictions on the availability and use of\nprescriber-identifying information. So long as they do not\nengage in marketing, many speakers can obtain and use\nthe information. But detailers cannot. Vermont\u2019s statute\ncould be compared with a law prohibiting trade magazines\nfrom purchasing or using ink. Cf. Minneapolis Star, 460\nU. S. 575. Like that hypothetical law, \u00a74631(d) imposes a\nspeaker- and content-based burden on protected expres\nsion, and that circumstance is sufficient to justify applica\ntion of heightened scrutiny. As a consequence, this case\ncan be resolved even assuming, as the State argues, that\nprescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.\n                             B\n  In the ordinary case it is all but dispositive to conclude\n16             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a law is content-based and, in practice, viewpoint\ndiscriminatory. See R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382 (\u201cContent\nbased regulations are presumptively invalid\u201d); id., at 391\u2013\n392. The State argues that a different analysis applies\nhere because, assuming \u00a74631(d) burdens speech at all, it\nat most burdens only commercial speech. As in previous\ncases, however, the outcome is the same whether a special\ncommercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial\nscrutiny is applied. See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Broad\ncasting Assn., Inc. v. United States, 527 U. S. 173, 184\n(1999). For the same reason there is no need to determine\nwhether all speech hampered by \u00a74631(d) is commercial,\nas our cases have used that term. Cf. Board of Trustees\nof State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 474 (1989)\n(discussing whether \u201cpure speech and commercial speech\u201d\nwere inextricably intertwined, so that \u201cthe entirety must\n. . . be classified as noncommercial\u201d).\n    Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the State\u2019s\nburden to justify its content-based law as consistent with\nthe First Amendment. Thompson v. Western States Medi\ncal Center, 535 U. S. 357, 373 (2002). To sustain the\ntargeted, content-based burden \u00a74631(d) imposes on pro\ntected expression, the State must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental in\nterest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that\ninterest. See Fox, supra, at 480\u2013481; Central Hudson Gas\n& Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447 U. S.\n557, 566 (1980). There must be a \u201cfit between the legisla\nture\u2019s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those\nends.\u201d Fox, supra, at 480 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). As in other contexts, these standards ensure not only\nthat the State\u2019s interests are proportional to the result-\ning burdens placed on speech but also that the law does\nnot seek to suppress a disfavored message. See Turner\nBroadcasting, 512 U. S., at 662\u2013663.\n    The State\u2019s asserted justifications for \u00a74631(d) come\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder two general headings. First, the State contends\nthat its law is necessary to protect medical privacy, includ\ning physician confidentiality, avoidance of harassment,\nand the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Sec\nond, the State argues that \u00a74631(d) is integral to the\nachievement of policy objectives\u2014namely, improved public\nhealth and reduced healthcare costs. Neither justification\nwithstands scrutiny.\n                              1\n  Vermont argues that its physicians have a \u201creasonable\nexpectation\u201d that their prescriber-identifying information\n\u201cwill not be used for purposes other than . . . filling and\nprocessing\u201d prescriptions. See 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(29). It may be assumed that, for many reasons, physi\ncians have an interest in keeping their prescription deci\nsions confidential. But \u00a74631(d) is not drawn to serve that\ninterest. Under Vermont\u2019s law, pharmacies may share\nprescriber-identifying information with anyone for any rea\nson save one: They must not allow the information to\nbe used for marketing. Exceptions further allow pharma\ncies to sell prescriber-identifying information for certain\npurposes, including \u201chealth care research.\u201d \u00a74631(e). And\nthe measure permits insurers, researchers, journalists,\nthe State itself, and others to use the information. See\n\u00a74631(d); cf. App. 370\u2013372; id., at 211. All but conceding\nthat \u00a74631(d) does not in itself advance confidentiality\ninterests, the State suggests that other laws might impose\nseparate bars on the disclosure of prescriber-identifying\ninformation. See Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 20.1.\nBut the potential effectiveness of other measures cannot\njustify the distinctive set of prohibitions and sanctions\nimposed by \u00a74631(d).\n  Perhaps the State could have addressed physician confi\ndentiality through \u201ca more coherent policy.\u201d Greater New\nOrleans Broadcasting, supra, at 195; see also Discovery\n18              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNetwork, 507 U. S., at 428. For instance, the State might\nhave advanced its asserted privacy interest by allowing\nthe information\u2019s sale or disclosure in only a few narrow\nand well-justified circumstances. See, e.g., Health In\nsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71320d\u20132; 45 CFR pts. 160 and 164 (2010). A\nstatute of that type would present quite a different case\nthan the one presented here. But the State did not enact\na statute with that purpose or design. Instead, Vermont\nmade prescriber-identifying information available to an\nalmost limitless audience. The explicit structure of the\nstatute allows the information to be studied and used by\nall but a narrow class of disfavored speakers. Given the\ninformation\u2019s widespread availability and many permissi\nble uses, the State\u2019s asserted interest in physician confi\ndentiality does not justify the burden that \u00a74631(d) places\non protected expression.\n   The State points out that it allows doctors to forgo the\nadvantages of \u00a74631(d) by consenting to the sale, disclo\nsure, and use of their prescriber-identifying information.\nSee \u00a74631(c)(1). It is true that private decisionmaking can\navoid governmental partiality and thus insulate privacy\nmeasures from First Amendment challenge. See Rowan v.\nPost Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728 (1970); cf. Bolger v. Youngs\nDrug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 72 (1983). But that\nprinciple is inapposite here. Vermont has given its doctors\na contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow your\nprescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and\nused without constraint; or, withhold consent, which will\nallow your information to be used by those speakers whose\nmessage the State supports. Section 4631(d) may offer a\nlimited degree of privacy, but only on terms favorable to\nthe speech the State prefers. Cf. Rowan, supra, at 734,\n737, 739, n. 6 (sustaining a law that allowed private par\nties to make \u201cunfettered,\u201d \u201cunlimited,\u201d and \u201cunreviewable\u201d\nchoices regarding their own privacy).

S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat all privacy measures must avoid content-based rules.\nHere, however, the State has conditioned privacy on ac\nceptance of a content-based rule that is not drawn to serve\nthe State\u2019s asserted interest. To obtain the limited privacy\nallowed by \u00a74631(d), Vermont physicians are forced to\nacquiesce in the State\u2019s goal of burdening disfavored\nspeech by disfavored speakers.\n   Respondents suggest that a further defect of \u00a74631(d)\nlies in its presumption of applicability absent a physician\u2019s\nelection to the contrary. Vermont\u2019s law might burden less\nspeech if it came into operation only after an individual\nchoice, but a revision to that effect would not necessarily\nsave \u00a74631(d). Even reliance on a prior election would not\nsuffice, for instance, if available categories of coverage by\ndesign favored speakers of one political persuasion over\nanother. Rules that burden protected expression may not\nbe sustained when the options provided by the State are\ntoo narrow to advance legitimate interests or too broad to\nprotect speech. As already explained, \u00a74631(d) permits\nextensive use of prescriber-identifying information and so\ndoes not advance the State\u2019s asserted interest in physician\nconfidentiality. The limited range of available privacy\noptions instead reflects the State\u2019s impermissible purpose\nto burden disfavored speech. Vermont\u2019s argument accord\ningly fails, even if the availability and scope of private\nelection might be relevant in other contexts, as when the\nstatute\u2019s design is unrelated to any purpose to advance a\npreferred message.\n   The State also contends that \u00a74631(d) protects doctors\nfrom \u201charassing sales behaviors.\u201d 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(28). \u201cSome doctors in Vermont are experiencing an\nundesired increase in the aggressiveness of pharmaceuti\ncal sales representatives,\u201d the Vermont Legislature found,\n\u201cand a few have reported that they felt coerced and har\nassed.\u201d \u00a71(20). It is doubtful that concern for \u201ca few\u201d\nphysicians who may have \u201cfelt coerced and harassed\u201d by\n20              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npharmaceutical marketers can sustain a broad content\nbased rule like \u00a74631(d). Many are those who must en\ndure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of\nfreedom. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,\n210\u2013211 (1975); Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21\n(1971). In any event the State offers no explanation why\nremedies other than content-based rules would be inade\nquate. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S.\n484, 503 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.). Physicians can,\nand often do, simply decline to meet with detailers, includ\ning detailers who use prescriber-identifying information.\nSee, e.g., App. 180, 333\u2013334. Doctors who wish to forgo\ndetailing altogether are free to give \u201cNo Solicitation\u201d or\n\u201cNo Detailing\u201d instructions to their office managers or to\nreceptionists at their places of work. Personal privacy\neven in one\u2019s own home receives \u201cample protection\u201d from\nthe \u201cresident\u2019s unquestioned right to refuse to engage in\nconversation with unwelcome visitors.\u201d Watchtower Bible\n& Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S.\n150, 168 (2002); see also Bolger, supra, at 72. A physi\ncian\u2019s office is no more private and is entitled to no greater\nprotection.\n  Vermont argues that detailers\u2019 use of prescriber\nidentifying information undermines the doctor-patient\nrelationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment\ndecisions. According to the State, \u201cunwanted pressure\noccurs\u201d when doctors learn that their prescription deci\nsions are being \u201cmonitored\u201d by detailers. 2007 Vt. Laws\nNo. 80, \u00a71(27). Some physicians accuse detailers of \u201cspy\ning\u201d or of engaging in \u201cunderhanded\u201d conduct in order to\n\u201csubvert\u201d prescription decisions. App. 336, 380, 407\u2013408;\nsee also id., at 326\u2013328. And Vermont claims that detail\ning makes people \u201canxious\u201d about whether doctors have\ntheir patients\u2019 best interests at heart. Id., at 327. But the\nState does not explain why detailers\u2019 use of prescriber\nidentifying information is more likely to prompt these\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobjections than many other uses permitted by \u00a74631(d).\nIn any event, this asserted interest is contrary to basic\nFirst Amendment principles. Speech remains protected\neven when it may \u201cstir people to action,\u201d \u201cmove them to\ntears,\u201d or \u201cinflict great pain.\u201d Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). The more benign and,\nmany would say, beneficial speech of pharmaceutical\nmarketing is also entitled to the protection of the First\nAmendment. If pharmaceutical marketing affects treat\nment decisions, it does so because doctors find it persua\nsive. Absent circumstances far from those presented here,\nthe fear that speech might persuade provides no lawful\nbasis for quieting it. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,\n447 (1969) (per curiam).\n                               2\n  The State contends that \u00a74631(d) advances impor-\ntant public policy goals by lowering the costs of medical\nservices and promoting public health. If prescriber\nidentifying information were available for use by detailers,\nthe State contends, then detailing would be effective in\npromoting brand-name drugs that are more expensive and\nless safe than generic alternatives. This logic is set out at\nlength in the legislative findings accompanying \u00a74631(d).\nYet at oral argument here, the State declined to acknowl\nedge that \u00a74631(d)\u2019s objective purpose and practical effect\nwere to inhibit detailing and alter doctors\u2019 prescription\ndecisions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u20136. The State\u2019s reluctance\nto embrace its own legislature\u2019s rationale reflects the\nvulnerability of its position.\n  While Vermont\u2019s stated policy goals may be proper,\n\u00a74631(d) does not advance them in a permissible way. As\nthe Court of Appeals noted, the \u201cstate\u2019s own explanation of\nhow\u201d \u00a74631(d) \u201cadvances its interests cannot be said to be\ndirect.\u201d 630 F. 3d, at 277. The State seeks to achieve its\npolicy objectives through the indirect means of restraining\n22             SORRELL v.

But the\n\u201cfear that people would make bad decisions if given truth\nful information\u201d cannot justify content-based burdens on\nspeech. Thompson, 535 U. S., at 374; see also Virginia Bd.\nof Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,\n425 U. S. 748, 769\u2013770 (1976). \u201cThe First Amendment\ndirects us to be especially skeptical of regulations that\nseek to keep people in the dark for what the government\nperceives to be their own good.\u201d 44 Liquormart, supra, at\n503 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also Linmark Associates,\nInc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 97 (1977). These pre\ncepts apply with full force when the audience, in this\ncase prescribing physicians, consists of \u201csophisticated and\nexperienced\u201d consumers. Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 775.\n   As Vermont\u2019s legislative findings acknowledge, the prem-\nise of \u00a74631(d) is that the force of speech can justify\nthe government\u2019s attempts to stifle it. Indeed the State\ndefends the law by insisting that \u201cpharmaceutical market\ning has a strong influence on doctors\u2019 prescribing prac\ntices.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 49\u201350. This reasoning is\nincompatible with the First Amendment. In an attempt to\nreverse a disfavored trend in public opinion, a State could\nnot ban campaigning with slogans, picketing with signs, or\nmarching during the daytime. Likewise the State may not\nseek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the\nmarketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading adver\ntisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy\njingles. That the State finds expression too persuasive\ndoes not permit it to quiet the speech or to burden its\nmessengers.\n   The defect in Vermont\u2019s law is made clear by the fact\nthat many listeners find detailing instructive. Indeed the\nrecord demonstrates that some Vermont doctors view\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntargeted detailing based on prescriber-identifying infor\nmation as \u201cvery helpful\u201d because it allows detailers to\nshape their messages to each doctor\u2019s practice. App. 274;\nsee also id., at 181, 218, 271\u2013272. Even the United States,\nwhich appeared here in support of Vermont, took care to\ndispute the State\u2019s \u201cunwarranted view that the dangers\nof [n]ew drugs outweigh their benefits to patients.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 24, n. 4. There are di\nvergent views regarding detailing and the prescription\nof brand-name drugs. Under the Constitution, resolution of\n that debate must result from free and uninhibited speech.\nAs one Vermont physician put it: \u201cWe have a saying in\nmedicine, information is power. And the more you know,\nor anyone knows, the better decisions can be made.\u201d App.\n279. There are similar sayings in law, including that\n\u201cinformation is not in itself harmful, that people will\nperceive their own best interests if only they are well\nenough informed, and that the best means to that end is\nto open the channels of communication rather than to\nclose them.\u201d Virginia Bd., 425 U. S., at 770. The choice\n\u201cbetween the dangers of suppressing information, and the\ndangers of its misuse if it is freely available\u201d is one that\n\u201cthe First Amendment makes for us.\u201d Ibid.\n   Vermont may be displeased that detailers who use\nprescriber-identifying information are effective in promot\ning brand-name drugs. The State can express that view\nthrough its own speech. See Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97; cf.\n\u00a74622(a)(1) (establishing a prescription drug educational\nprogram). But a State\u2019s failure to persuade does not allow\nit to hamstring the opposition. The State may not burden\nthe speech of others in order to tilt public debate in a\npreferred direction. \u201cThe commercial marketplace, like\nother spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a\nforum where ideas and information flourish. Some of the\nideas and information are vital, some of slight worth. But\nthe general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not\n24              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe government, assess the value of the information pre\nsented.\u201d Edenfield, supra, at 767.\n  It is true that content-based restrictions on protected\nexpression are sometimes permissible, and that principle\napplies to commercial speech. Indeed the government\u2019s\nlegitimate interest in protecting consumers from \u201ccommer\ncial harms\u201d explains \u201cwhy commercial speech can be sub\nject to greater governmental regulation than noncommer\ncial speech.\u201d Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 426; see also\n44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., 502 (opinion of Stevens, J.). The\nCourt has noted, for example, that \u201ca State may choose to\nregulate price advertising in one industry but not in oth\ners, because the risk of fraud . . . is in its view greater\nthere.\u201d R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 388\u2013389 (citing Virginia Bd.,\nsupra, at 771\u2013772). Here, however, Vermont has not\nshown that its law has a neutral justification.\n  The State nowhere contends that detailing is false or\nmisleading within the meaning of this Court\u2019s First\nAmendment precedents. See Thompson, 535 U. S., at 373.\nNor does the State argue that the provision challenged\nhere will prevent false or misleading speech. Cf. post, at\n10\u201311 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (collecting regulations that\nthe government might defend on this ground). The State\u2019s\ninterest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turns\non nothing more than a difference of opinion. See Bolger,\n463 U. S., at 69; Thompson, supra, at 376.\n                        *    *    *\n  The capacity of technology to find and publish personal\ninformation, including records required by the govern\nment, presents serious and unresolved issues with respect\nto personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In\nconsidering how to protect those interests, however, the\nState cannot engage in content-based discrimination to\nadvance its own side of a debate.\n  If Vermont\u2019s statute provided that prescriber-identifying\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Here, however, the State gives possessors of the\ninformation broad discretion and wide latitude in disclos\ning the information, while at the same time restricting\nthe information\u2019s use by some speakers and for some pur\nposes, even while the State itself can use the information\nto counter the speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a\nconcept too integral to the person and a right too essential\nto freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those\nideas the government prefers.\n   When it enacted \u00a74631(d), the Vermont Legislature\nfound that the \u201cmarketplace for ideas on medicine safety\nand effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that brand\nname companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical mar\nketing campaigns to doctors.\u201d 2007 Vt. Laws No. 80,\n\u00a71(4). \u201cThe goals of marketing programs,\u201d the legislature\nsaid, \u201care often in conflict with the goals of the state.\u201d\n\u00a71(3). The text of \u00a74631(d), associated legislative findings,\nand the record developed in the District Court establish\nthat Vermont enacted its law for this end. The State has\nburdened a form of protected expression that it found too\npersuasive. At the same time, the State has left unbur\ndened those speakers whose messages are in accord with\nits own views. This the State cannot do.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

It deprives pharmaceutical\nand data-mining companies of data, collected pursuant to\nthe government\u2019s regulatory mandate, that could help\npharmaceutical companies create better sales messages.\nIn my view, this effect on expression is inextricably related\nto a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial\nenterprise. The First Amendment does not require courts\nto apply a special \u201cheightened\u201d standard of review when\nreviewing such an effort. And, in any event, the statute\nmeets the First Amendment standard this Court has\npreviously applied when the government seeks to regulate\ncommercial speech. For any or all of these reasons, the\nCourt should uphold the statute as constitutional.\n                         I\n  The Vermont statute before us says pharmacies and\ncertain other entities\n    \u201cshall not [1] sell . . . regulated records containing\n    prescriber-identifiable information, nor [2] permit the\n    use of [such] records . . . for marketing or promoting a\n    prescription drug, unless the prescriber consents.\u201d Vt.\n    Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631(d) (Supp. 2010).\n2               SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nIt also says that\n    \u201c[3] [p]harmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceu\n    tical marketers shall not use prescriber-identifiable\n    information for marketing or promoting a prescription\n    drug unless the prescriber consents.\u201d Ibid.\nFor the most part, I shall focus upon the first and second\nof these prohibitions. In Part IV, I shall explain why the\nthird prohibition makes no difference to the result.\n                              II\n   In Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521\nU. S. 457 (1997), this Court considered the First Amend\nment\u2019s application to federal agricultural commodity mar\nketing regulations that required growers of fruit to\nmake compulsory contributions to pay for collective adver\ntising. The Court reviewed the lawfulness of the regula\ntion\u2019s negative impact on the growers\u2019 freedom voluntarily\nto choose their own commercial messages \u201cunder the\nstandard appropriate for the review of economic regula\ntion.\u201d Id., at 469.\n   In this case I would ask whether Vermont\u2019s regulatory\nprovisions work harm to First Amendment interests that\nis disproportionate to their furtherance of legitimate regu\nlatory objectives. And in doing so, I would give significant\nweight to legitimate commercial regulatory objectives\u2014as\nthis Court did in Glickman. The far stricter, specially\n\u201cheightened\u201d First Amendment standards that the major\nity would apply to this instance of commercial regulation\nare out of place here. Ante, at 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.\n                            A\n   Because many, perhaps most, activities of human beings\nliving together in communities take place through speech,\nand because speech-related risks and offsetting justifica\ntions differ depending upon context, this Court has distin\nguished for First Amendment purposes among different\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncontexts in which speech takes place. See, e.g., Snyder v.\nPhelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 5\u20136).\nThus, the First Amendment imposes tight constraints\nupon government efforts to restrict, e.g., \u201ccore\u201d political\nspeech, while imposing looser constraints when the gov\nernment seeks to restrict, e.g., commercial speech, the\nspeech of its own employees, or the regulation-related\nspeech of a firm subject to a traditional regulatory pro\ngram. Compare Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988)\n(political speech), with Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.\nv. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447 U.

S. 563 (1968)\n(government employees), and Glickman, supra (economic\nregulation).\n  These test-related distinctions reflect the constitutional\nimportance of maintaining a free marketplace of ideas,\na marketplace that provides access to \u201csocial, political,\nesthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences.\u201d Red\nLion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969);\nsee Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting). Without such a marketplace, the\npublic could not freely choose a government pledged to\nimplement policies that reflect the people\u2019s informed will.\n  At the same time, our cases make clear that the First\nAmendment offers considerably less protection to the\nmaintenance of a free marketplace for goods and services.\nSee Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623\n(1995) (\u201cWe have always been careful to distinguish com\nmercial speech from speech at the First Amendment\u2019s\ncore\u201d). And they also reflect the democratic importance of\npermitting an elected government to implement through\neffective programs policy choices for which the people\u2019s\nelected representatives have voted.\n  Thus this Court has recognized that commercial speech\nincluding advertising has an \u201cinformational function\u201d and\n4               SORRELL v.

S. 809,\n826 (1975). But at the same time it has applied a less\nthan strict, \u201cintermediate\u201d First Amendment test when\nthe government directly restricts commercial speech.\nUnder that test, government laws and regulations may\nsignificantly restrict speech, as long as they also \u201cdirectly\nadvance\u201d a \u201csubstantial\u201d government interest that could\nnot \u201cbe served as well by a more limited restriction.\u201d\nCentral Hudson, supra, at 564. Moreover, the Court has\nfound that \u201csales practices\u201d that are \u201cmisleading, decep\ntive, or aggressive\u201d lack the protection of even this \u201cinter\nmediate\u201d standard. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.

And the Court has emphasized the need, in\napplying an \u201cintermediate\u201d test, to maintain the\n    \u201c \u2018commonsense\u2019 distinction between speech proposing\n    a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area\n    traditionally subject to government regulation, and\n    other varieties of speech.\u201d Ohralik v.

In doing so, the\nCourt has taken account of the need in this area of law to\ndefer significantly to legislative judgment\u2014as the Court\nhas done in cases involving the Commerce Clause or the\nDue Process Clause.

Since ordinary regulatory pro\ngrams can affect speech, particularly commercial speech,\nin myriad ways, to apply a \u201cheightened\u201d First Amendment\nstandard of review whenever such a program burdens\nspeech would transfer from legislatures to judges the\nprimary power to weigh ends and to choose means, threat\nening to distort or undermine legitimate legislative ob\njectives.

S., at 589.\n                             B\n   There are several reasons why the Court should review\nVermont\u2019s law \u201cunder the standard appropriate for the\nreview of economic regulation,\u201d not \u201cunder a heightened\nstandard appropriate for the review of First Amendment\nissues.\u201d Glickman, 521 U. S., at 469. For one thing, Ver\nmont\u2019s statute neither forbids nor requires anyone to say\nanything, to engage in any form of symbolic speech, or to\nendorse any particular point of view, whether ideological\nor related to the sale of a product. Cf. id., at 469\u2013470.\n(And I here assume that Central Hudson might otherwise\napply. See Part III, infra.)\n   For another thing, the same First Amendment stan\ndards that apply to Vermont here would apply to similar\nregulatory actions taken by other States or by the Federal\nGovernment acting, for example, through Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) regulation. (And the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s ability to pre-empt state laws that interfere\nwith existing or contemplated federal forms of regulation\nis here irrelevant.)\n   Further, the statute\u2019s requirements form part of a tra\nditional, comprehensive regulatory regime. Cf. United\nFoods, supra, at 411. The pharmaceutical drug industry\nhas been heavily regulated at least since 1906. See Pure\nFood and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768.

Only then can the drugs be marketed, at which\npoint drug companies are subject to the FDA\u2019s exhaustive\nregulation of the content of drug labels and the manner in\nwhich drugs can be advertised and sold. \u00a7352(f)(2); 21\nCFR pts. 201\u2013203 (2010).\n   Finally, Vermont\u2019s statute is directed toward informa\ntion that exists only by virtue of government regulation.\nUnder federal law, certain drugs can be dispensed only by\na pharmacist operating under the orders of a medical\npractitioner. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b). Vermont regulates the\nqualifications, the fitness, and the practices of pharma\ncists themselves, and requires pharmacies to maintain a\n\u201cpatient record system\u201d that, among other things, tracks\nwho prescribed which drugs. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 26,\n\u00a7\u00a72041(a), 2022(14) (Supp. 2010); Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy\nAdmin. Rules (Pharmacy Rules) 9.1, 9.24(e) (2009). But\nfor these regulations, pharmacies would have no way to\nknow who had told customers to buy which drugs (as is\nthe case when a doctor tells a patient to take a daily dose\nof aspirin).\n   Regulators will often find it necessary to create tailored\nrestrictions on the use of information subject to their\nregulatory jurisdiction. A car dealership that obtains\ncredit scores for customers who want car loans can be\nprohibited from using credit data to search for new cus\ntomers. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681b (2006 ed. and Supp. III);\ncf. Trans Union Corp. v. FTC, 245 F. 3d 809, reh\u2019g denied,\n267 F. 3d 1138 (CADC 2001). Medical specialists who\nobtain medical records for their existing patients cannot\npurchase those records in order to identify new patients.\nSee 45 CFR \u00a7164.508(a)(3) (2010). Or, speaking hypo\nthetically, a public utilities commission that directs local\ngas distributors to gather usage information for individual\ncustomers might permit the distributors to share the data\nwith researchers (trying to lower energy costs) but forbid\n8              SORRELL v.

And they\nwould normally be subject to review under the Adminis\ntrative Procedure Act to make certain they are not \u201carbi\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A) (2006 ed.). In an appropriate case, such review\nmight be informed by First Amendment considerations.\nBut regulatory actions of the kind present here have not\npreviously been thought to raise serious additional consti\ntutional concerns under the First Amendment. But cf.\nTrans Union LLC v. FTC, 536 U. S. 915 (2002) (KENNEDY,\nJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (questioning ban\non use of consumer credit reports for target marketing).\nThe ease with which one can point to actual or hypothet\nical examples with potentially adverse speech-related\neffects at least roughly comparable to those at issue here\nindicates the danger of applying a \u201cheightened\u201d or \u201cinter\nmediate\u201d standard of First Amendment review where\ntypical regulatory actions affect commercial speech (say,\nby withholding information that a commercial speaker\nmight use to shape the content of a message).\n   Thus, it is not surprising that, until today, this Court\nhas never found that the First Amendment prohibits the\ngovernment from restricting the use of information gath\nered pursuant to a regulatory mandate\u2014whether the\ninformation rests in government files or has remained in\nthe hands of the private firms that gathered it. But cf.\nante, at 11\u201314. Nor has this Court ever previously applied\nany form of \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny in any even roughly\nsimilar case. See Los Angeles Police Dept. v.

It\nadds that \u201c[c]ommercial speech is no exception.\u201d Ante,\nat 10\u201311. And the Court then emphasizes that this is a\ncase involving both \u201ccontent-based\u201d and \u201cspeaker-based\u201d\nrestrictions. See ante, at 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22,\n24.\n   But neither of these categories\u2014\u201ccontent-based\u201d nor\n\u201cspeaker-based\u201d\u2014has ever before justified greater scrutiny\nwhen regulatory activity affects commercial speech.

And the absence of\nany such precedent is understandable.\n   Regulatory programs necessarily draw distinctions on\nthe basis of content. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S.,\nat 761, 762 (\u201cIf there is a kind of commercial speech that\nlacks all First Amendment protection, . . . it must be dis\ntinguished by its content\u201d). Electricity regulators, for\nexample, oversee company statements, pronouncements,\nand proposals, but only about electricity. See, e.g., Vt.\nPub. Serv. Bd. Rules 3.100 (1983), 4.200 (1986), 5.200\n(2004). The Federal Reserve Board regulates the content\nof statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest\nrate disclosures, but only when made by financial institu\ntions. See 12 CFR pts. 226, 230 (2011). And the FDA\n10              SORRELL v.

See 21 CFR\npts. 201\u2013203. Given the ubiquity of content-based regula\ntory categories, why should the \u201ccontent-based\u201d nature of\ntypical regulation require courts (other things being equal)\nto grant legislators and regulators less deference? Cf.\nBoard of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S.\n469, 481 (1989) (courts, in First Amendment area, should\n\u201cprovide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed\nleeway\u201d when regulated industries are at issue).\n   Nor, in the context of a regulatory program, is it un\nusual for particular rules to be \u201cspeaker-based,\u201d affecting\nonly a class of entities, namely, the regulated firms. An\nenergy regulator, for example, might require the manu\nfacturers of home appliances to publicize ways to reduce\nenergy consumption, while exempting producers of indus\ntrial equipment. See, e.g., 16 CFR pt. 305 (2011) (prescrib\ning labeling requirements for certain home appliances);\nNev. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7704.804, 704.808 (2010) (requiring\nutilities to provide consumers with information on conser\nvation). Or a trade regulator might forbid a particular\nfirm to make the true claim that its cosmetic product\ncontains \u201ccleansing grains that scrub away dirt and ex\ncess oil\u201d unless it substantiates that claim with detailed\nbackup testing, even though opponents of cosmetics use\nneed not substantiate their claims.

Or the FDA might control in detail just what a\npharmaceutical firm can, and cannot, tell potential pur\nchasers about its products. Such a firm, for example,\ncould not suggest to a potential purchaser (say, a doctor)\nthat he or she might put a pharmaceutical drug to an \u201coff\nlabel\u201d use, even if the manufacturer, in good faith and\nwith considerable evidence, believes the drug will help.\nAll the while, a third party (say, a researcher) is free to\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntell the doctor not to use the drug for that purpose. See 21\nCFR pt. 99; cf. Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm.,\n531 U. S. 341, 350\u2013351 (2001) (discussing effect of similar\nregulations in respect to medical devices); see also Pro\nposed Rule, Revised Effectiveness Determination; Sun\nscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,\n76 Fed. Reg. 35672 (2011) (proposing to prohibit market\ning of sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) of\ngreater than 50 due to insufficient data \u201cto indicate that\nthere is additional clinical benefit\u201d).\n   If the Court means to create constitutional barriers to\nregulatory rules that might affect the content of a com\nmercial message, it has embarked upon an unprecedented\ntask\u2014a task that threatens significant judicial interfer\nence with widely accepted regulatory activity. Cf., e.g., 21\nCFR pts. 201\u2013203. Nor would it ease the task to limit its\n\u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny to regulations that only affect cer\ntain speakers. As the examples that I have set forth\nillustrate, many regulations affect only messages sent by a\nsmall class of regulated speakers, for example, electricity\ngenerators or natural gas pipelines.\n   The Court also uses the words \u201caimed\u201d and \u201ctargeted\u201d\nwhen describing the relation of the statute to drug manu\nfacturers. Ante, at 8, 9, 12, 16. But, for the reasons just\nset forth, to require \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny on this basis is\nto require its application early and often when the State\nseeks to regulate industry. Any statutory initiative stems\nfrom a legislative agenda. See, e.g., Message to Congress,\nMay 24, 1937, H. R. Doc. No. 255, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 4\n(request from President Franklin Roosevelt for legislation\nto ease the plight of factory workers). Any administrative\ninitiative stems from a regulatory agenda. See, e.g., Exec.\nOrder No. 12866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (1993) (specifying\nhow to identify regulatory priorities and requiring agen\ncies to prepare agendas). The related statutes, regula\ntions, programs, and initiatives almost always reflect a\n12              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npoint of view, for example, of the Congress and the ad\nministration that enacted them and ultimately the voters.\nAnd they often aim at, and target, particular firms that\nengage in practices about the merits of which the Gov\nernment and the firms may disagree. Section 2 of the\nSherman Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a72, for example, which limits the\ntruthful, nonmisleading speech of firms that, due to their\nmarket power, can affect the competitive landscape, is\ndirectly aimed at, and targeted at, monopolists.\n   In short, the case law in this area reflects the need to\nensure that the First Amendment protects the \u201cmarket\nplace of ideas,\u201d thereby facilitating the democratic creation\nof sound government policies without improperly hamper\ning the ability of government to introduce an agenda, to\nimplement its policies, and to favor them to the exclusion\nof contrary policies. To apply \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny when\nthe regulation of commercial activities (which often in\nvolve speech) is at issue is unnecessarily to undercut the\nlatter constitutional goal. The majority\u2019s view of this case\npresents that risk.\n   Moreover, given the sheer quantity of regulatory initia\ntives that touch upon commercial messages, the Court\u2019s\nvision of its reviewing task threatens to return us to a\nhappily bygone era when judges scrutinized legislation for\nits interference with economic liberty. History shows that\nthe power was much abused and resulted in the constitu\ntionalization of economic theories preferred by individual\njurists. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75\u201376\n(1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). By inviting courts to\nscrutinize whether a State\u2019s legitimate regulatory inter\nests can be achieved in less restrictive ways whenever\nthey touch (even indirectly) upon commercial speech,\ntoday\u2019s majority risks repeating the mistakes of the past\nin a manner not anticipated by our precedents. See Cen\ntral Hudson, 447 U. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting);\ncf. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co.,\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. 573, 580\u2013581 (1940) (\u201cA controversy like this\nalways calls for fresh reminder that courts must not sub\nstitute their notions of expediency and fairness for those\nwhich have guided the agencies to whom the formulation\nand execution of policy have been entrusted\u201d).\n  Nothing in Vermont\u2019s statute undermines the ability of\npersons opposing the State\u2019s policies to speak their mind\nor to pursue a different set of policy objectives through\nthe democratic process. Whether Vermont\u2019s regulatory\nstatute \u201ctargets\u201d drug companies (as opposed to affecting\nthem unintentionally) must be beside the First Amendment\npoint.\n  This does not mean that economic regulation having\nsome effect on speech is always lawful. Courts typically\nreview the lawfulness of statutes for rationality and of\nregulations (if federal) to make certain they are not \u201carbi\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A). And our valuable free-speech tradition may\nplay an important role in such review. But courts do not\nnormally view these matters as requiring \u201cheightened\u201d\nFirst Amendment scrutiny\u2014and particularly not the un\nforgiving brand of \u201cintermediate\u201d scrutiny employed by\nthe majority. Because the imposition of \u201cheightened\u201d\nscrutiny in such instances would significantly change the\nlegislative/judicial balance, in a way that would signifi\ncantly weaken the legislature\u2019s authority to regulate\ncommerce and industry, I would not apply a \u201cheightened\u201d\nFirst Amendment standard of review in this case.\n                            III\n  Turning to the constitutional merits, I believe Vermont\u2019s\nstatute survives application of Central Hudson\u2019s \u201cinterme\ndiate\u201d commercial speech standard as well as any more\nlimited \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d test.\n14              SORRELL v.

I agree that it withholds from pharmaceutical\ncompanies information that would help those entities\ncreate a more effective selling message. But I cannot\nagree with the majority that the harm also involves unjus\ntified discrimination in that it permits \u201cpharmacies\u201d to\n\u201cshare prescriber-identifying information with anyone for\nany reason\u201d (but marketing). Ante, at 17. Whatever the\nFirst Amendment relevance of such discrimination, there\nis no evidence that it exists in Vermont. The record con\ntains no evidence that prescriber-identifying data is\nwidely disseminated. See App. 248, 255. Cf. Burson v.\nFreeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992) (plurality opinion)\n(\u201cStates adopt laws to address the problems that confront\nthem. The First Amendment does not require States to\nregulate for problems that do not exist\u201d); Bates v. State\nBar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 380 (1977) (\u201c[T]he justification\nfor the application of overbreadth analysis applies weakly,\nif at all, in the ordinary commercial context\u201d).\n   The absence of any such evidence likely reflects the\npresence of other legal rules that forbid widespread\nrelease of prescriber-identifying information. Vermont\u2019s\nPharmacy Rules, for example, define \u201cunprofessional\nconduct\u201d to include \u201c[d]ivulging or revealing to unauthor\nized persons patient or practitioner information or the\nnature of professional pharmacy services rendered.\u201d Rule\n20.1(i) (emphasis added); see also Reply Brief for Petition\ners 21. The statute reinforces this prohibition where\npharmaceutical marketing is at issue. And the exceptions\nthat it creates are narrow and concern common and often\nessential uses of prescription data. See Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n18, \u00a74631(e)(1) (pharmacy reimbursement, patient care\nmanagement, health care research); \u00a74631(e)(2) (drug\ndispensing); \u00a74631(e)(3) (communications between pre\nscriber and pharmacy); \u00a74631(e)(4) (information to pa\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The Court apparently means that the\nstatute (1) prevents pharmaceutical companies from creat\ning individualized messages that would help them sell\ntheir drugs more effectively, but (2) permits \u201ccounterde\ntailing\u201d programs, which often promote generic drugs, to\ncreate such messages using prescriber-identifying data. I\nam willing to assume, for argument\u2019s sake, that this con\nsequence would significantly increase the statute\u2019s nega\ntive impact upon commercial speech. But cf. 21 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii) (FDA\u2019s \u201cfair balance\u201d require\nment); App. 193 (no similar FDA requirement for nondrug\nmanufacturers). The record before us, however, contains\nno evidentiary basis for the conclusion that any such\nindividualized counterdetailing is widespread, or exists at\nall, in Vermont.\n    The majority points out, ante, at 4, that Act 80, of which\n\u00a74631 was a part, also created an \u201cevidence-based pre\nscription drug education program,\u201d in which the Vermont\nDepartment of Health, the Department of Vermont Health\nAccess, and the University of Vermont, among others,\nwork together \u201cto provide information and education on\nthe therapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescrip\ntion drugs\u201d to health professionals responsible for pre\nscribing and dispensing prescription drugs, Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 18, \u00a74622(a)(1). See generally \u00a7\u00a74621\u20134622. But that\nprogram does not make use of prescriber-identifying data.\n16             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nReply Brief for Petitioners 11.\n   The majority cites testimony by two witnesses in sup\nport of its statement that \u201cStates themselves may supply\nthe prescriber-identifying information used in [counterde\ntailing] programs.\u201d Ante, at 4. One witness explained that\nacademic detailers in Pennsylvania work with state health\nofficials to identify physicians serving patients whose\nhealth care is likewise state provided. App. 375. The\nother, an IMS Health officer, observed that Vermont has\nits own multipayer database containing prescriber\nidentifying data, which could be used to talk to doctors\nabout their prescription patterns and the lower costs\nassociated with generics. Id., at 313. But nothing in the\nrecord indicates that any \u201ccounterdetailing\u201d of this kind\nhas ever taken place in fact in Vermont. State-sponsored\nhealth care professionals sometimes meet with small\ngroups of doctors to discuss best practices and generic\ndrugs generally. See University of Vermont, College of\nMedicine, Office of Primary Care, Vermont Academic\nDetailing Program (July 2010), http://www.med.uvm.edu/\nahec/downloads/VTAD_overview_2010.07.08.pdf (all Inter\nnet materials as visited June 21, 2011, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file). Nothing in Vermont\u2019s statute\nprohibits brand-name manufacturers from undertaking a\nsimilar effort.\n   The upshot is that the only commercial-speech-related\nharm that the record shows this statute to have brought\nabout is the one I have previously described: The with\nholding of information collected through a regulatory\nprogram, thereby preventing companies from shaping a\ncommercial message they believe maximally effective. The\nabsence of precedent suggesting that this kind of harm\nis serious reinforces the conclusion that the harm here is\nmodest at most.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 564. Ver\nmont enacted its statute\n    \u201cto advance the state\u2019s interest in protecting the pub\n    lic health of Vermonters, protecting the privacy of\n    prescribers and prescribing information, and to en\n    sure costs are contained in the private health care\n    sector, as well as for state purchasers of prescription\n    drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and\n    ensuring prescribers receive unbiased information.\u201d\n    \u00a74631(a).\nThese objectives are important. And the interests they\nembody all are \u201cneutral\u201d in respect to speech. Cf. ante, at\n24.\n   The protection of public health falls within the tradi\ntional scope of a State\u2019s police powers. Hillsborough\nCounty v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S.\n707, 719 (1985). The fact that the Court normally exempts\nthe regulation of \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d information\neven from the rigors of its \u201cintermediate\u201d commercial\nspeech scrutiny testifies to the importance of securing\n\u201cunbiased information,\u201d see 44 Liquormart, 517 U. S., at\n501 (opinion of Stevens, J.); Central Hudson, supra, at\n563, as does the fact that the FDA sets forth as a federal\nregulatory goal the need to ensure a \u201cfair balance\u201d of\ninformation about marketed drugs, 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7202.1(e)(1),\n202.1(e)(5)(ii). As major payers in the health care system,\nhealth care spending is also of crucial state interest. And\nthis Court has affirmed the importance of maintaining\n\u201cprivacy\u201d as an important public policy goal\u2014even in\nrespect to information already disclosed to the public for\nparticular purposes (but not others). See Department of\nJustice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S.\n749, 762\u2013771 (1989); see also Solove, A Taxonomy of Pri\n18              SORRELL v.

S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139)\n(discussing privacy interests in nondisclosure).\n    At the same time, the record evidence is sufficient to\npermit a legislature to conclude that the statute \u201cdirectly\nadvances\u201d each of these objectives. The statute helps to\nfocus sales discussions on an individual drug\u2019s safety,\neffectiveness, and cost, perhaps compared to other drugs\n(including generics). These drug-related facts have every\nthing to do with general information that drug manufac\nturers likely possess. They have little, if anything, to do\nwith the name or prior prescription practices of the par\nticular doctor to whom a detailer is speaking. Shaping a\ndetailing message based on an individual doctor\u2019s prior\nprescription habits may help sell more of a particular\nmanufacturer\u2019s particular drugs. But it does so by divert\ning attention from scientific research about a drug\u2019s safety\nand effectiveness, as well as its cost. This diversion comes\nat the expense of public health and the State\u2019s fiscal\ninterests.\n    Vermont compiled a substantial legislative record to\ncorroborate this line of reasoning. See Testimony of Sean\nFlynn (Apr. 11, 2007), App. in No. 09\u20131913\u2013cv(L) etc.\n(CA2), p. A\u20131156 (hereinafter CA2 App.) (use of data\nmining helps drug companies \u201cto cover up information\nthat is not in the best of light of their drug and to high\nlight information that makes them look good\u201d); Volker &\nOutterson, New Legislative Trends Threaten the Way\nHealth Information Companies Operate, Pharmaceutical\nPricing & Reimbursement 2007, id., at A\u20134235 (one for\nmer detailer considered prescriber-identifying data the\n\u201c \u2018greatest tool in planning our approach to manipulating\ndoctors\u2019 \u201d (quoting Whitney, Big (Brother) Pharma: How\nDrug Reps Know Which Doctors to Target, New Republic,\nAug. 29, 2006, http://www.tnr.com/article/84056/health\ncare-eli-lilly-pfizer-ama); Testimony of Paul Harrington\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

And it is the job of regulatory agencies and\nlegislatures to make just these kinds of judgments. Ver\nmont\u2019s attempts to ensure a \u201cfair balance\u201d of information\nis no different from the FDA\u2019s similar requirement, see\n21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7202.1(e)(1), 202.1(e)(5)(ii). No one has yet sug\ngested that substantial portions of federal drug regulation\nare unconstitutional. Why then should we treat Vermont\u2019s\nlaw differently?\n  The record also adequately supports the State\u2019s privacy\nobjective. Regulatory rules in Vermont make clear that\nthe confidentiality of an individual doctor\u2019s prescribing\npractices remains the norm. See, e.g., Pharmacy Rule\n8.7(c) (\u201cPrescription and other patient health care infor\nmation shall be secure from access by the public, and the\ninformation shall be kept confidential\u201d); Pharmacy Rule\n20              SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n20.1(i) (forbidding disclosure of patient or prescriber in\nformation to \u201cunauthorized persons\u201d without consent).\nExceptions to this norm are comparatively few. See, e.g.,\nibid. (identifying \u201cauthorized persons\u201d); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n18, \u00a74631(e); App. 248, 255 (indicating that prescriber\nidentifying data is not widely disseminated). There is no\nindication that the State of Vermont, or others in the\nState, makes use of this information for counterdetailing\nefforts. See supra, at 15.\n   Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the data miners\nwho sell information to those manufacturers would like to\ncreate (and did create) an additional exception, which\nmeans additional circulation of otherwise largely confi\ndential information. Vermont\u2019s statute closes that door.\nAt the same time, the statute permits doctors who wish\nto permit use of their prescribing practices to do so.\n\u00a7\u00a74631(c)\u2013(d). For purposes of Central Hudson, this would\nseem sufficiently to show that the statute serves a mean\ningful interest in increasing the protection given to pre\nscriber privacy. See Fox, 492 U. S., at 480 (in commercial\nspeech area, First Amendment requires \u201ca fit that is not\nnecessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not\nnecessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope\nis in proportion to the interest served\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also United States v. Edge Broadcast\ning Co., 509 U. S. 418, 434 (1993) (The First Amendment\ndoes not \u201crequire that the Government make progress on\nevery front before it can make progress on any front\u201d);\nBurson, 504 U. S., at 207 (plurality opinion).\n                             C\n  The majority cannot point to any adequately supported,\nsimilarly effective \u201cmore limited restriction.\u201d Central\nHudson, 447 U.

In any event, physi\ncians are unlikely to turn detailers away at the door, for\nthose detailers, whether delivering a balanced or imbal\nanced message, are nonetheless providers of much useful\ninformation. See Manchanda & Honka, The Effects and\nRole of Direct-to-Physician Marketing in the Pharmaceuti\ncal Industry: An Integrative Review, 5 Yale J. Health Pol\u2019y\nL. & Ethics 785, 793\u2013797, 815\u2013816 (2005); Ziegler, Lew, &\nSinger, The Accuracy of Drug Information from Pharma\nceutical Sales Representatives, 273 JAMA 1296 (1995).\nForcing doctors to choose between targeted detailing and\nno detailing at all could therefore jeopardize the State\u2019s\ninterest in promoting public health.\n   The majority also suggests that if the \u201cstatute provided\nthat prescriber-identifying information could not be sold or\ndisclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State\nmight have a stronger position.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325; see also\nante, at 17. But the disclosure-permitting exceptions here\nare quite narrow, and they serve useful, indeed essential\npurposes. See supra, at 14. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n18, \u00a74631(e) with note following 42 U. S. C. \u00a71320d\u20132, p.\n1190, and 45 CFR \u00a7164.512 (uses and disclosures not\nrequiring consent under the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996). Regardless, this alterna\ntive is not \u201ca more limited restriction,\u201d Central Hudson,\nsupra, at 564 (emphasis added), for it would impose a\ngreater, not a lesser, burden upon the dissemination of\ninformation.\n   Respondents\u2019 alternatives are no more helpful. Respon\ndents suggest that \u201cVermont can simply inform physicians\nthat pharmaceutical companies . . . use prescription his\ntory information to communicate with doctors.\u201d Brief for\n22             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nRespondent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America 48. But how would that help serve the State\u2019s\nbasic purposes? It would not create the \u201cfair balance\u201d of\ninformation in pharmaceutical marketing that the State,\nlike the FDA, seeks. Cf. Reno v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, 521 U. S. 844, 874 (1997) (alternative must be \u201cat\nleast as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that\nthe statute was enacted to serve\u201d). Respondents also\nsuggest policies requiring use of generic drugs or educat\ning doctors about their benefits. Brief for Respondent\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\n54\u201355. Such programs have been in effect for some time\nin Vermont or other States, without indication that they\nhave prevented the imbalanced sales tactics at which\nVermont\u2019s statute takes aim. See, e.g., Written Statement\nof Jerry Avorn & Aaron Kesselheim, CA2 App. 4310; Doc.\n414, at 60\u201361. And in any event, such laws do not help\nprotect prescriber privacy.\n   Vermont has thus developed a record that sufficiently\nshows that its statute meaningfully furthers substantial\nstate interests. Neither the majority nor respondents\nsuggests any equally effective \u201cmore limited\u201d restriction.\nAnd the First Amendment harm that Vermont\u2019s statute\nworks is, at most, modest. I consequently conclude that,\neven if we apply an \u201cintermediate\u201d test such as that in\nCentral Hudson, this statute is constitutional.\n                           IV\n   What about the statute\u2019s third restriction, providing\nthat \u201c[p]harmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical\nmarketers\u201d may not \u201cuse prescriber-identifiable informa\ntion for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless\nthe prescriber consents\u201d? Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a74631(d)\n(emphasis added). In principle, I should not reach this\nquestion. That is because respondent pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers, marketers, and data miners seek a de\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

C. \u00a72201; App. 49\u2013\n128. And they have neither shown nor claimed that they\ncould obtain significant amounts of \u201cprescriber-identifiable\ninformation\u201d if the first two prohibitions are valid. If, as\nI believe, the first two statutory prohibitions (related to\nselling and disclosing the information) are valid, then\nthe dispute about the validity of the third provision is\nnot \u201c \u2018real and substantial\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018definite and concrete.\u2019 \u201d\nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127\n(2007) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S.\n227, 240\u2013241 (1937)) (Article III does not permit courts to\nentertain such disputes).\n  The Court, however, strikes down all three provisions,\nand so I add that I disagree with the majority as to the\nconstitutionality of the third restriction as well\u2014basically\nfor the reasons I have already set out. The prohibition\nagainst pharmaceutical firms using this prescriber\nidentifying information works no more than modest First\nAmendment harm; the prohibition is justified by the need\nto ensure unbiased sales presentations, prevent unneces\nsarily high drug costs, and protect the privacy of prescrib\ning physicians. There is no obvious equally effective, more\nlimited alternative.\n                              V\n   In sum, I believe that the statute before us satisfies the\n\u201cintermediate\u201d standards this Court has applied to restric\ntions on commercial speech. A fortiori it satisfies less\ndemanding standards that are more appropriately applied\nin this kind of commercial regulatory case\u2014a case where\nthe government seeks typical regulatory ends (lower drug\nprices, more balanced sales messages) through the use of\nordinary regulatory means (limiting the commercial use\nof data gathered pursuant to a regulatory mandate). The\nspeech-related consequences here are indirect, incidental,\n24             SORRELL v. IMS HEALTH INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand entirely commercial. See supra, at 6\u20139.\n  The Court reaches its conclusion through the use of\nimportant First Amendment categories\u2014\u201ccontent-based,\u201d\n\u201cspeaker-based,\u201d and \u201cneutral\u201d\u2014but without taking full\naccount of the regulatory context, the nature of the speech\neffects, the values these First Amendment categories seek\nto promote, and prior precedent. See supra, at 2\u20136, 9\u201313,\n17. At best the Court opens a Pandora\u2019s Box of First\nAmendment challenges to many ordinary regulatory\npractices that may only incidentally affect a commercial\nmessage. See, e.g., supra, at 7\u20138, 9\u201311. At worst, it re\nawakens Lochner\u2019s pre-New Deal threat of substituting\njudicial for democratic decisionmaking where ordinary\neconomic regulation is at issue. See Central Hudson, 447\nU. S., at 589 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n  Regardless, whether we apply an ordinary commercial\nspeech standard or a less demanding standard, I believe\nVermont\u2019s law is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
