MARSHALL, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF\n                  MARSHALL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 10\u2013179.     Argued January 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nArticle III, \u00a71, of the Constitution mandates that \u201c[t]he judicial Power\n  of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in\n  such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain\n  and establish,\u201d and provides that the judges of those constitutional\n  courts \u201cshall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\u201d and \u201creceive\n  for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ] [that] shall not be diminished\u201d\n  during their tenure. The questions presented in this case are\n  whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and\n  salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157 and Arti\n  cle III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn\n  Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall\n  (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n     Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierce\u2019s father, approxi\n  mately a year before his death. Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie\n  filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J.\n  Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tor\n  tiously interfered with that gift. After J. Howard died, Vickie filed\n  for bankruptcy in federal court. Pierce filed a proof of claim in that\n  proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from\n  Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by induc\n  ing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in con\n  trolling his father\u2019s assets. Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim\n  for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.\n     The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the\n  defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of\n  dollars in damages on her counterclaim. Pierce objected that the\n2                         STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on\n    that counterclaim because it was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d as defined\n    by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). As set forth in \u00a7157(a), Congress has di\n    vided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that\n    \u201caris[e] under title 11\u201d; those that \u201caris[e] in\u201d a Title 11 case; and\n    those that are \u201crelated to a case under title 11.\u201d District courts may\n    refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district,\n    and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in \u201call core pro\n    ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\u201d\n    \u00a7\u00a7157(a), (b)(1). In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy\n    judge may only \u201csubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\n    law to the district court.\u201d \u00a7157(c)(1). Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 cate\n    gories of core proceedings, including \u201ccounterclaims by the estate\n    against persons filing claims against the estate.\u201d \u00a7157(b)(2)(C).\n       The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was a\n    core proceeding. The District Court reversed, reading this Court\u2019s\n    precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line\n    Co., 458 U. S. 50, to \u201csuggest[ ] that it would be unconstitutional to\n    hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\u201d The court held that\n    Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat re\n    lated to Pierce\u2019s claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy\n    Court\u2019s judgment as proposed, not final. Although the Texas state\n    court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the par\n    ties\u2019 dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the District\n    Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickie\u2019s favor. The\n    Court of Appeals ultimately reversed. It held that the Bankruptcy\n    Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counter\n    claim because the claim was not \u201cso closely related to [Pierce\u2019s] proof\n    of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to re\n    solve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.\u201d Because that\n    holding made the Texas probate court\u2019s judgment the earliest final\n    judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held\n    that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclu\n    sive effect.\nHeld: Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to\n enter judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional\n authority to do so. Pp. 6\u201338.\n    1. Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final\n judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (a) The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter\n    final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as a core proceeding under\n    \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). Pierce argues that \u00a7157(b) authorizes bankruptcy\n    courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are\n    both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 it\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nself. But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of\ncore proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under\nbankruptcy law, and the structure of \u00a7157 makes clear that no such\ncategory exists. Pp. 8\u201311.\n      (b) In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court\nlacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim because his defa\nmation claim is a \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d that the Bankruptcy Court\nlacked jurisdiction to hear under \u00a7157(b)(5). The Court agrees with\nVickie that \u00a7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of the defamation claim. The\nCourt is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional\nbar when they are not framed as such. See generally Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___; Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500. Sec\ntion 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree,\nand the statutory context belies Pierce\u2019s claim that it is jurisdictional.\nPierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of the defama\ntion claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to\nlitigate his claim there. Pp. 12\u201316.\n   2. Although \u00a7157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judg\nment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.\nPp. 16\u201338.\n      (a) Article III is \u201can inseparable element of the constitutional\nsystem of checks and balances\u201d that \u201cboth defines the power and pro\ntects the independence of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion). Article III protects liberty not\nonly through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but\nalso by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to\nprotect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.\n   This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III chal\nlenge to a bankruptcy court\u2019s resolution of a debtor\u2019s suit. In North\nern Pipeline, the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serv\ning under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\u2014who also lacked the tenure\nand salary guarantees of Article III\u2014could \u201cconstitutionally be\nvested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\u201d against\nan entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.\nId., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion). The plurality in Northern\nPipeline recognized that there was a category of cases involving \u201cpub\nlic rights\u201d that Congress could constitutionally assign to \u201clegislative\u201d\ncourts for resolution. A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing\non the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not en\ncompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and\nrejected the debtor\u2019s argument that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise\nof jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was\nacting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.\n4                          STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 69\u201372; see id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judg\n    ment). After the decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress revised the\n    statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.\n    With respect to the \u201ccore\u201d proceedings listed in \u00a7157(b)(2), however,\n    the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Fed\n    eral Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded\n    under the 1978 Act. The authority exercised by the newly consti\n    tuted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickie\u2019s exceeds the bounds\n    of Article III. Pp. 16\u201322.\n          (b) Vickie\u2019s counterclaim does not fall within the public rights ex\n    ception, however defined. The Court has long recognized that, in\n    general, Congress may not \u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any\n    matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common\n    law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &\n    Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284. The Court has also recognized\n    that \u201c[a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights,\n    . . . which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which con\n    gress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the\n    United States, as it may deem proper.\u201d Ibid. Several previous deci\n    sions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights ex\n    ception\u2014those arising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject\n    to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitu\n    tional functions of the executive or legislative departments\u201d\u2014and\n    those that are instead matters \u201cof private right, that is, of the liabil\n    ity of one individual to another under the law as defined.\u201d Crowell v.\n    Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50, 51.\n        Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the limitation of\n    the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a\n    party. The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to\n    cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory\n    scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government\n    agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within\n    the agency\u2019s authority. In other words, it is still the case that what\n    makes a right \u201cpublic\u201d rather than private is that the right is inte\n    grally related to particular Federal Government action. See United\n    States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n    10\u201311); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473\n    U. S. 568, 584; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor,\n    478 U. S. 833, 844, 856.\n        In Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, the most recent\n    case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a\n    bankruptcy trustee\u2019s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action\n    filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a\n    bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception. Vickie\u2019s counter\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nclaim is similar. It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace\nof the other branches, as in Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18 How., at 284; it does\nnot flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S., at\n584\u2013585; and it is not \u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d adjudication of a\nclaim created by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. This case\ninvolves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of\na final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdic\ntion, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither de\nrives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime. If such\nan exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Arti\ncle III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous \u201cpublic\nright,\u201d then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of in\ndividual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recog\nnized into mere wishful thinking. Pp. 22\u201329.\n     (c) The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy\nproceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adju\ndicate Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. Initially, Pierce\u2019s defamation claim does\nnot affect the nature of Vickie\u2019s tortious interference counterclaim as\none at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy\nestate\u2014the type of claim that, under Northern Pipeline and Granfi\nnanciera, must be decided by an Article III court. The cases on which\nVickie relies, Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, and Langenkamp v.\nCulp, 498 U. S. 42 (per curiam), are inapposite. Katchen permitted a\nbankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustee\u2019s voidable\npreference claim against a creditor only where there was no question\nthat the referee was required to decide whether there had been a\nvoidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to al\nlow the creditor\u2019s claim. The Katchen Court \u201cintimate[d] no opinion\nconcerning whether\u201d the bankruptcy referee would have had \u201csum\nmary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee\nfor affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for\nwhich ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the\n[creditor\u2019s proof of ] claim.\u201d 382 U. S., at 333, n. 9. The per curiam\nopinion in Langenkamp is to the same effect. In this case, by con\ntrast, the Bankruptcy Court\u2014in order to resolve Vickie\u2019s counter\nclaim\u2014was required to and did make several factual and legal de\nterminations that were not \u201cdisposed of in passing on objections\u201d to\nPierce\u2019s proof of claim. In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover,\nthe trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of re\ncovery created by federal bankruptcy law. Vickie\u2019s claim is instead a\nstate tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy pro\nceeding. Pp. 29\u201334.\n     (d) The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not \u201cadjuncts\u201d\nof the district courts. The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts\n6                          STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    considered in Northern Pipeline, do not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, nar\n    rowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized\n    area of law\u201d or engage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding func\n    tions.\u201d 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). Whereas the adjunct\n    agency in Crowell v. Benson \u201cpossessed only a limited power to issue\n    compensation orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the\n    district court,\u201d ibid., a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim un\n    der \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders and\n    judgments\u201d\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to review only if a\n    party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), 158(a)\u2013(b). Such a court is\n    an adjunct of no one. Pp. 34\u201336.\n         (e) Finally, Vickie and her amici predict that restrictions on a\n    bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory\n    counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional\n    costs on the bankruptcy process. It goes without saying that \u201cthe fact\n    that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in\n    facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if\n    it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201d INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n    944. In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical conse\n    quences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests. The\n    framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates\n    that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by\n    state courts and district courts, see \u00a7\u00a7157(c), 1334(c), and the Court\n    does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from\n    core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of la\n    bor in the statute.

Innumerable children have been born into\nthe cause: innumerable young people have married into\nit;\u201d and, sadly, the original parties \u201chave died out of it.\u201d A\n\u201clong procession of [judges] has come in and gone out\u201d dur\u00ad\ning that time, and still the suit \u201cdrags its weary length\nbefore the Court.\u201d\n   Those words were not written about this case, see\nC. Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens\n4\u20135 (1891), but they could have been. This is the second\ntime we have had occasion to weigh in on this long\u00ad\nrunning dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E.\nPierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II,\na man believed to have been one of the richest people in\nTexas. The Marshalls\u2019 litigation has worked its way\n2                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and\nCalifornia, and two of those courts\u2014a Texas state probate\ncourt and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District\nof California\u2014have reached contrary decisions on its mer\u00ad\nits. The Court of Appeals below held that the Texas state\ndecision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy\nCourt lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a\ncounterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her\nbankruptcy proceeding.1 To determine whether the Court\nof Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two\nissues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statu\u00ad\ntory authority under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b) to issue a final\njudgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether\nconferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is\nconstitutional.\n   Although the history of this litigation is complicated, its\nresolution ultimately turns on very basic principles. Arti\u00ad\ncle III, \u00a71, of the Constitution commands that \u201c[t]he judi\u00ad\ncial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con\u00ad\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d That\nArticle further provides that the judges of those courts\nshall hold their offices during good behavior, without\ndiminution of salary. Ibid. Those requirements of Article\nIII were not honored here. The Bankruptcy Court in this\ncase exercised the judicial power of the United States by\nentering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even\nthough the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure\nduring good behavior nor salary protection. We conclude\nthat, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory\nauthority to enter judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, it\nlacked the constitutional authority to do so.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because both Vickie and Pierce passed away during this litigation,\n\nthe parties in this case are Vickie\u2019s estate and Pierce\u2019s estate.

Mar\nshall, 547 U. S. 293, 300\u2013305 (2006), we do not repeat\nthem in full here. Of current relevance are two claims\nVickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard\u2019s\nfortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith,\nVickie was J. Howard\u2019s third wife and married him about\na year before his death. Id., at 300; see In re Marshall,\n392 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard\nbestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during\ntheir courtship and marriage, he did not include her in\nhis will. 547 U. S., at 300. Before J. Howard passed away,\nVickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting\nthat Pierce\u2014J. Howard\u2019s younger son\u2014fraudulently in\u00ad\nduced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include\nher, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his\nproperty. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and de\u00ad\nfended the validity of J. Howard\u2019s trust and, eventually,\nhis will. 392 F. 3d, at 1122\u20131123, 1125.\n   After J. Howard\u2019s death, Vickie filed a petition for bank\u00ad\nruptcy in the Central District of California. Pierce filed a\ncomplaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that\nVickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell\nmembers of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain\ncontrol of his father\u2019s assets. 547 U. S., at 300\u2013301; In re\nMarshall, 600 F. 3d 1037, 1043\u20131044 (CA9 2010). The\ncomplaint sought a declaration that Pierce\u2019s defamation\nclaim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceed\u00ad\nings. Ibid.; see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a). Pierce subsequently\nfiled a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning\nthat he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. See \u00a7501(a). Vickie responded to\nPierce\u2019s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to\nthe alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for\ntortious interference with the gift she expected from J.\n4                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHoward. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that\nPierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking\nthe legal steps necessary to provide her with half his\nproperty. 547 U. S., at 301.\n  On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued\nan order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce\u2019s\nclaim for defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a\nbench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment\non Vickie\u2019s counterclaim in her favor. The court later\nawarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory dam\u00ad\nages and $25 million in punitive damages. 600 F. 3d, at\n1045; see 253 B. R. 550, 561\u2013562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.\n2000); 257 B. R. 35, 39\u201340 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).\n  In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counter\u00ad\nclaim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made\nearlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s authority over the counterclaim was limited be\u00ad\ncause Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B. R., at 39. As\nexplained below, bankruptcy courts may hear and en-\nter final judgments in \u201ccore proceedings\u201d in a bankruptcy\ncase. In non-core proceedings, the bankruptcy courts\ninstead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\nlaw to the district court, for that court\u2019s review and issu\u00ad\nance of final judgment. The Bankruptcy Court in this case\nconcluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was \u201ca core proceed\u00ad\ning\u201d under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had\nthe \u201cpower to enter judgment\u201d on the counterclaim under\n\u00a7157(b)(1). Id., at 40.\n  The District Court disagreed.         It recognized that\n\u201cVickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within\nthe literal language\u201d of the statute designating certain\nproceedings as \u201ccore,\u201d see \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), but understood\nthis Court\u2019s precedent to \u201csuggest[ ] that it would be un\u00ad\nconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Marathon Pipe Line Co.,\n458 U. S. 50, 79, n. 31 (1982) (plurality opinion)). The\nDistrict Court accordingly concluded that a \u201ccounterclaim\nshould not be characterized as core\u201d when it \u201cis only\nsomewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted,\nand when the unique characteristics and context of the\ncounterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off\nor other counterclaims that customarily arise.\u201d 264 B. R.,\nat 632.\n   Because the District Court concluded that Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim was not core, the court determined that it\nwas required to treat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment as\n\u201cproposed[,] rather than final,\u201d and engage in an \u201cinde\u00ad\npendent review\u201d of the record. Id., at 633; see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7157(c)(1). Although the Texas state court had by that\ntime conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\u2019\ndispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the\nDistrict Court declined to give that judgment preclusive\neffect and went on to decide the matter itself. 271 B. R.\n858, 862\u2013867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275 B. R. 5, 56\u201358 (CD\nCal. 2002). Like the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court\nfound that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\u2019s\nexpectancy of a gift from J. Howard. The District Court\nawarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each\nin the amount of $44,292,767.33. Id., at 58.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on a\ndifferent ground, 392 F. 3d, at 1137, and we\u2014in the first\nvisit of the case to this Court\u2014reversed the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals on that issue. 547 U. S., at 314\u2013315. On remand\nfrom this Court, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7157 man\u00ad\ndated \u201ca two-step approach\u201d under which a bankruptcy\njudge may issue a final judgment in a proceeding only\nif the matter both \u201cmeets Congress\u2019 definition of a core\nproceeding and arises under or arises in title 11,\u201d the\nBankruptcy Code. 600 F. 3d, at 1055. The court also\n6                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final\njudgments on all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy\nproceedings \u201cwould certainly run afoul\u201d of this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Northern Pipeline. 600 F. 3d, at 1057. With\nthose concerns in mind, the court concluded that \u201ca coun\u00ad\nterclaim under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) is properly a \u2018core\u2019 proceeding\n\u2018arising in a case under\u2019 the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the\ncounterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor\u2019s] proof of\nclaim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary\nto resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim it\u00ad\nself.\u201d Id., at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted;\nsecond brackets added). The court ruled that Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim did not meet that test. Id., at 1059. That\nholding made \u201cthe Texas probate court\u2019s judgment . . . the\nearliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this\nproceeding,\u201d and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat the District Court should have \u201cafford[ed] preclusive\neffect\u201d to the Texas \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of relevant legal\nand factual issues.\u201d Id., at 1064\u20131065.2\n   We again granted certiorari. 561 U.

S. 33, 50 (1989) (explaining\nthat Congress had designated certain actions as \u201c \u2018core\nproceedings,\u2019 which bankruptcy judges may adjudicate and\nin which they may issue final judgments, if a district court\nhas referred the matter to them\u201d (citations omitted)). We\nhave not directly addressed the question, however, and\nPierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final\njudgment on a core proceeding only if that proceeding also\n\u201caris[es] in\u201d a Title 11 case or \u201caris[es] under\u201d Title 11\nitself. Brief for Respondent 51 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy courts to \u201chear\nand determine all cases under title 11 and all core pro\u00ad\nceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under\ntitle 11.\u201d As written, \u00a7157(b)(1) is ambiguous. The \u201caris\u00ad\ning under\u201d and \u201carising in\u201d phrases might, as Pierce sug\u00ad\ngests, be read as referring to a limited category of those\ncore proceedings that are addressed in that section. On\nthe other hand, the phrases might be read as simply de\u00ad\nscribing what core proceedings are: matters arising under\nTitle 11 or in a Title 11 case. In this case the structure\nand context of \u00a7157 contradict Pierce\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a7157(b)(1).\n   As an initial matter, Pierce\u2019s reading of the statute\nnecessarily assumes that there is a category of core pro\u00ad\nceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a\nTitle 11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates\nthe bankruptcy courts\u2019 authority, however, makes plain\nthat no such category exists. Section 157(b)(1) authorizes\nbankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in \u201ccore pro\u00ad\nceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under\ntitle 11.\u201d Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to\ninstead submit proposed findings in \u201ca proceeding that is\nnot a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a\ncase under title 11.\u201d Nowhere does \u00a7157 specify what\n10                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbankruptcy courts are to do with respect to the category of\nmatters that Pierce posits\u2014core proceedings that do not\narise under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. To the contrary,\n\u00a7157(b)(3) only instructs a bankruptcy judge to \u201cdeter\u00ad\nmine, on the judge\u2019s own motion or on timely motion of a\nparty, whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under\nthis subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related\nto a case under title 11.\u201d Two options. The statute does\nnot suggest that any other distinctions need be made.\n   Under our reading of the statute, core proceedings are\nthose that arise in a bankruptcy case or under Title 11.\nThe detailed list of core proceedings in \u00a7157(b)(2) pro-\nvides courts with ready examples of such matters. Pierce\u2019s\nreading of \u00a7157, in contrast, supposes that some core pro\u00ad\nceedings will arise in a Title 11 case or under Title 11\nand some will not. Under that reading, the statute pro\u00ad\nvides no guidance on how to tell which are which.\n   We think it significant that Congress failed to provide\nany framework for identifying or adjudicating the asserted\ncategory of core but not \u201carising\u201d proceedings, given the\notherwise detailed provisions governing bankruptcy court\nauthority. It is hard to believe that Congress would go to\nthe trouble of cataloging 16 different types of proceedings\nthat should receive \u201ccore\u201d treatment, but then fail to spec\u00ad\nify how to determine whether those matters arise under\nTitle 11 or in a bankruptcy case if\u2014as Pierce asserts\u2014the\nlatter inquiry is determinative of the bankruptcy court\u2019s\nauthority.\n   Pierce argues that we should treat core matters that\narise neither under Title 11 nor in a Title 11 case as pro\u00ad\nceedings \u201crelated to\u201d a Title 11 case. Brief for Respondent\n60 (internal quotation marks omitted). We think that a\ncontradiction in terms. It does not make sense to describe\na \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceeding as merely \u201crelated to\u201d the\nbankruptcy case; oxymoron is not a typical feature of\ncongressional drafting.

Section 157(b)(5) provides that \u201c[t]he district court\nshall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death\nclaims shall be tried in the district court in which the\nbankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the\ndistrict in which the claim arose.\u201d Pierce asserts that\nhis defamation claim is a \u201cpersonal injury tort,\u201d that the\nBankruptcy Court therefore had no jurisdiction over that\nclaim, and that the court therefore necessarily lacked\njurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as well.

To begin, Vickie contends that \u00a7157(b)(5) does not\naddress subject matter jurisdiction at all, but simply\nspecifies the venue in which \u201cpersonal injury tort and\nwrongful death claims\u201d should be tried. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 16\u201317, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Dep\u00ad\nuty Solicitor General) (Section \u201c157(b)(5) is in [the United\nStates\u2019] view not jurisdictional\u201d). Given the limited scope\nof that provision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or for\u00ad\nfeit any objections under \u00a7157(b)(5), in the same way that\na party may waive or forfeit an objection to the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court finally resolving a non-core claim. Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 17\u201320; see \u00a7157(c)(2) (authorizing the\ndistrict court, \u201cwith the consent of all the parties to the\nproceeding,\u201d to refer a \u201crelated to\u201d matter to the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court for final judgment). Vickie asserts that in\nthis case Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\nadjudication of his defamation claim, and forfeited any\nargument to the contrary, by failing to seek withdrawal of\nthe claim until he had litigated it before the Bankruptcy\nCourt for 27 months. Id., at 20\u201323. On the merits, Vickie\ncontends that the statutory phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand wrongful death claims\u201d does not include non-physical\ntorts such as defamation. Id., at 25\u201326.\n  We need not determine what constitutes a \u201cpersonal\ninjury tort\u201d in this case because we agree with Vickie that\n\u00a7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented\nto the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defamation\nclaim.4 Because \u201c[b]randing a rule as going to a court\u2019s\nsubject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of\nour adversarial system,\u201d Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 4\u20135), we are not inclined to\ninterpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when\nthey are not framed as such. See generally Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 516 (2006) (\u201cwhen Congress\ndoes not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as juris\u00ad\ndictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjuris\u00ad\ndictional in character\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Although Pierce suggests that consideration of \u201cthe 157(b)(5) issue\u201d\n\nwould facilitate an \u201ceasy\u201d resolution of the case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348,\nhe is mistaken. Had Pierce preserved his argument under that provi\u00ad\nsion, we would have been confronted with several questions on which\nthere is little consensus or precedent. Those issues include: (1) the\nscope of the phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d\u2014a question over which there\nis at least a three-way divide, see In re Arnold, 407 B. R. 849, 851\u2013853\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2009); (2) whether, as Vickie argued in the Court of\nAppeals, the requirement that a personal injury tort claim be \u201ctried\u201d in\nthe district court nonetheless permits the bankruptcy court to resolve\nthe claim short of trial, see Appellee\u2019s/Cross-Appellant\u2019s Supplemental\nBrief in No. 02\u201356002 etc. (CA9), p. 24; see also In re Dow Corning\nCorp., 215 B. R. 346, 349\u2013351 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Mich. 1997) (noting\ndivide over whether, and on what grounds, a bankruptcy court may\nresolve a claim pretrial); and (3) even if Pierce\u2019s defamation claim\ncould be considered only by the District Court, whether the Bankruptcy\nCourt might retain jurisdiction over the counterclaim, cf. Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (\u201cwhen a court grants a motion\nto dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally\nretains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71367, over pendent state-law claims\u201d). We express no opinion\non any of these issues and simply note that the \u00a7157(b)(5) question is\nnot as straightforward as Pierce would have it.\n14                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a juris\u00ad\ndictional decree. To begin, the statutory text does not\nrefer to either district court or bankruptcy court \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntion,\u201d instead addressing only where personal injury tort\nclaims \u201cshall be tried.\u201d\n   The statutory context also belies Pierce\u2019s jurisdictional\nclaim. Section 157 allocates the authority to enter final\njudgment between the bankruptcy court and the district\ncourt. See \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), (c)(1). That allocation does not\nimplicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction. See\n\u00a7157(c)(2) (parties may consent to entry of final judgment\nby bankruptcy judge in non-core case).        By the same\ntoken, \u00a7157(b)(5) simply specifies where a particular cate\u00ad\ngory of cases should be tried. Pierce does not explain why\nthat statutory limitation may not be similarly waived.\n   We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only could but did\nconsent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defa\u00ad\nmation claim. Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie ob\u00ad\njected to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defamation, arguing\nthat Pierce\u2019s claim was unenforceable and that Pierce\nshould not receive any amount for it. See 29 Court of\nAppeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031, 6035\n(hereinafter Supplemental Record). Vickie also noted\nthat the Bankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objec\u00ad\ntion, given the litigation posture of Pierce\u2019s claim before\nthe Bankruptcy Court. See id., at 6031. Vickie\u2019s filing\nprompted Pierce to advise the Bankruptcy Court that \u201c[a]ll\nparties are in agreement that the amount of the contin\u00ad\ngent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce] shall be determined\nby the adversary proceedings\u201d that had been commenced\nin the Bankruptcy Court. 31 Supplemental Record 6801.\nPierce asserted that Vickie\u2019s objection should be overruled\nor, alternatively, that any ruling on the objection \u201cshould\nbe continued until the resolution of the pending adversary\nproceeding litigation.\u201d Ibid. Pierce identifies no point in\nthe record where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim be\u00ad\ncause the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.\n   Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court\nthat \u00a7157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from\nresolving his defamation claim until over two years\u2014and\nseveral adverse discovery rulings\u2014after he filed that\nclaim in June 1996. The first filing Pierce cites as rais-\ning that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the\nDistrict Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the\nBankruptcy Court. See Brief for Respondent 26\u201327. The\nDistrict Court did initially withdraw the reference as\nrequested, but it then returned the proceeding to the\nBankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce \u201cimplicated the\njurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a\nparty to that litigation.\u201d App. 129. Although Pierce had\nobjected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise of\njurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, he advised the\ncourt at that time that he was \u201chappy to litigate [his]\nclaim\u201d there. 29 Supplemental Record 6101. Counsel\nstated that even though Pierce thought it was \u201cprobably\ncheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce\u2019s claim] were sent back\nor joined back with the State Court litigation,\u201d Pierce \u201cdid\nchoose\u201d the Bankruptcy Court forum and \u201cwould be more\nthan pleased to do it [t]here.\u201d Id., at 6101\u20136102; see also\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n. 17 (District Court referring to\nthese statements).\n   Given Pierce\u2019s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy\nCourt, we conclude that he consented to that court\u2019s reso\u00ad\nlution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument\nto the contrary). We have recognized \u201cthe value of waiver\nand forfeiture rules\u201d in \u201ccomplex\u201d cases, Exxon Shipping\nCo. v. Baker, 554 U. S. 471, 487\u2013488, n. 6 (2008), and\nthis case is no exception. In such cases, as here, the\nconsequences of \u201ca litigant . . . \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014\nremaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising\nthe error only if the case does not conclude in his favor,\u201d\n16                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nPuckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 5) (some internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014can be\nparticularly severe. If Pierce believed that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court lacked the authority to decide his claim for\ndefamation, then he should have said so\u2014and said so\npromptly. See United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731\n(1993) (\u201c \u2018No procedural principle is more familiar to this\nCourt than that a constitutional right,\u2019 or a right of any\nother sort, \u2018may be forfeited . . . by the failure to make\ntimely assertion of the right before a tribunal having\njurisdiction to determine it\u2019 \u201d (quoting Yakus v. United\nStates, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). Instead, Pierce repeat\u00ad\nedly stated to the Bankruptcy Court that he was happy\nto litigate there. We will not consider his claim to the\ncontrary, now that he is sad.\n                              III\n  Although we conclude that \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) permits the\nBankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim, Article III of the Constitution does not.\n                              A\n   Article III, \u00a71, of the Constitution mandates that \u201c[t]he\njudicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con\u00ad\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d The\nsame section provides that the judges of those constitu\u00ad\ntional courts \u201cshall hold their Offices during good Behav\u00ad\niour\u201d and \u201creceive for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ]\n[that] shall not be diminished\u201d during their tenure.\n   As its text and our precedent confirm, Article III is \u201can\ninseparable element of the constitutional system of checks\nand balances\u201d that \u201cboth defines the power and protects\nthe independence of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Northern Pipe\nline, 458 U.

S. 683, 704 (1974) (quoting U. S. Const.,\nArt. III, \u00a71).\n   In establishing the system of divided power in the Con\u00ad\nstitution, the Framers considered it essential that \u201cthe\njudiciary remain[ ] truly distinct from both the legisla-\nture and the executive.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 466\n(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). As Hamilton put it,\nquoting Montesquieu, \u201c \u2018there is no liberty if the power of\njudging be not separated from the legislative and execu\u00ad\ntive powers.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 1 Montesquieu, Spirit of\nLaws 181).\n   We have recognized that the three branches are not\nhermetically sealed from one another, see Nixon v. Admin\nistrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977), but\nit remains true that Article III imposes some basic limita\u00ad\ntions that the other branches may not transgress. Those\nlimitations serve two related purposes. \u201cSeparation-of\u00ad\npowers principles are intended, in part, to protect each\nbranch of government from incursion by the others. Yet\nthe dynamic between and among the branches is not the\nonly object of the Constitution\u2019s concern. The structural\nprinciples secured by the separation of powers protect the\nindividual as well.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).\n   Article III protects liberty not only through its role in\nimplementing the separation of powers, but also by speci\u00ad\nfying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The\ncolonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand\nof the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons\nwhy: because the King of Great Britain \u201cmade Judges\n18                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices,\nand the amount and payment of their salaries.\u201d The\nDeclaration of Independence \u00b611. The Framers undertook\nin Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial\npower of the new Federal Government from a repeat of\nthose abuses. By appointing judges to serve without term\nlimits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to\nremove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers\nsought to ensure that each judicial decision would be\nrendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with\nCongress or the Executive, but rather with the \u201c[c]lear\nheads . . . and honest hearts\u201d deemed \u201cessential to good\njudges.\u201d 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed.\n1896).\n  Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system\nof checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judi\u00ad\ncial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal\nGovernment could confer the Government\u2019s \u201cjudicial\nPower\u201d on entities outside Article III. That is why we\nhave long recognized that, in general, Congress may not\n\u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,\nfrom its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,\nor in equity, or admiralty.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken\nLand & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).

In Northern Pipeline, we considered whether bank\u00ad\nruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\u2014\nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\nbut lacking the tenure and salary guarantees of Article\nIII\u2014could \u201cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to\ndecide [a] state-law contract claim\u201d against an entity that\nwas not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n458 U. S., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion); see id., at\n89\u201392 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). The Court\nconcluded that assignment of such state law claims for\nresolution by those judges \u201cviolates Art. III of the Con\u00ad\nstitution.\u201d Id., at 52, 87 (plurality opinion); id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n  The plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized that\nthere was a category of cases involving \u201cpublic rights\u201d\nthat Congress could constitutionally assign to \u201clegislative\u201d\ncourts for resolution. That opinion concluded that this\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d exception extended \u201conly to matters arising\nbetween\u201d individuals and the Government \u201cin connection\nwith the performance of the constitutional functions of the\nexecutive or legislative departments . . . that historically\ncould have been determined exclusively by those\u201d\nbranches. Id., at 67\u201368 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on\nthe scope of the exception, concluded that the doctrine did\nnot encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue\nin that case. Id., at 69\u201372; see id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cNone of the [previous cases\naddressing Article III power] has gone so far as to sanction\nthe type of adjudication to which Marathon will be sub\u00ad\njected . . . .

Id., at 71\u201372, 81\u201386\n(plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cthe bankruptcy court is not an \u2018adjunct\u2019 of\neither the district court or the court of appeals\u201d).\n   After our decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress re\u00ad\nvised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and\nbankruptcy judges. In the 1984 Act, Congress provided\nthat the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be\nappointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which\ntheir districts are located. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7152(a). And, as we\nhave explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted\nbankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d\nproceedings. See supra, at 7\u20138.\n   With respect to such \u201ccore\u201d matters, however, the bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same pow\u00ad\ners they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978\nAct), 92 Stat. 2549. As in Northern Pipeline, for example,\nthe newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged\nunder \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) with resolving \u201c[a]ll matters of fact\nand law in whatever domains of the law to which\u201d a coun\u00ad\nterclaim may lead. 458 U.

S., at 85\u201386\n(plurality opinion). And, as in Northern Pipeline, the\ndistrict courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy\ncourts in core proceedings only under the usual limited\nappellate standards. That requires marked deference to,\namong other things, the bankruptcy judges\u2019 findings of\nfact. See \u00a7158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of\nfact \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d).\n                              C\n   Vickie and the dissent argue that the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s entry of final judgment on her state common law\ncounterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities\nbetween the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and\nthose exercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We\ndisagree. It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this\ncase exercised the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d in\npurporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state\ncommon law claim, just as the court did in Northern Pipe\nline. No \u201cpublic right\u201d exception excuses the failure to\ncomply with Article III in doing so, any more than in\nNorthern Pipeline. Vickie argues that this case is different\nbecause the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy.\nBut the debtors\u2019 claims in the cases on which she relies\nwere themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law,\nwhich would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy\nprocess of allowing or disallowing claims. Here Vickie\u2019s\nclaim is a state law action independent of the federal\nbankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling\non the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in bankruptcy. Northern\nPipeline and our subsequent decision in Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S. 33, rejected the application of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d\nexception in such cases.\n   Nor can the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act be\n22                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III courts, any more\nthan could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act. The\njudicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this\nremain the same, and a court exercising such broad pow\u00ad\ners is no mere adjunct of anyone.\n                               1\n   Vickie\u2019s counterclaim cannot be deemed a matter of\n\u201cpublic right\u201d that can be decided outside the Judicial\nBranch. As explained above, in Northern Pipeline we\nrejected the argument that the public rights doctrine\npermitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law\nsuit brought by a debtor against a company that had not\nfiled a claim against the estate. See 458 U. S., at 69\u201372\n(plurality opinion); id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring\nin judgment). Although our discussion of the public rights\nexception since that time has not been entirely consistent,\nand the exception has been the subject of some debate,\nthis case does not fall within any of the various formula\u00ad\ntions of the concept that appear in this Court\u2019s opinions.\n   We first recognized the category of public rights in Mur\nray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18\n How. 272 (1856). That case involved the Treasury De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s sale of property belonging to a customs collec\u00ad\ntor who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal\nGovernment that he had collected on its behalf. Id., at\n274, 275. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land\nthrough a different transfer, objected that the Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the\nproperty was void, because it was a judicial act that could\nnot be assigned to the Executive under Article III. Id., at\n274\u2013275, 282\u2013283.\n   \u201cTo avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject,\u201d the\nCourt laid out the principles guiding its analysis. Id., at\n284. It confirmed that Congress cannot \u201cwithdraw from\njudicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or\nadmiralty.\u201d Ibid. The Court also recognized that \u201c[a]t the\nsame time there are matters, involving public rights,\nwhich may be presented in such form that the judicial\npower is capable of acting on them, and which are suscep\u00ad\ntible of judicial determination, but which congress may or\nmay not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the\nUnited States, as it may deem proper.\u201d Ibid.\n   As an example of such matters, the Court referred to\n\u201c[e]quitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded\nterritories\u201d and cited cases in which land issues were\nconclusively resolved by Executive Branch officials. Ibid.\n(citing Foley v. Harrison, 15 How. 433 (1854); Burgess v.\nGray, 16 How. 48 (1854)). In those cases \u201cit depends upon\nthe will of congress whether a remedy in the courts shall\nbe allowed at all,\u201d so Congress could limit the extent to\nwhich a judicial forum was available. Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18\nHow., at 284. The challenge in Murray\u2019s Lessee to the\nTreasury Department\u2019s sale of the collector\u2019s land likewise\nfell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category of cases, because it\ncould only be brought if the Federal Government chose to\nallow it by waiving sovereign immunity. Id., at 283\u2013284.\nThe point of Murray\u2019s Lessee was simply that Congress\nmay set the terms of adjudicating a suit when the suit\ncould not otherwise proceed at all.\n   Subsequent decisions from this Court contrasted cases\nwithin the reach of the public rights exception\u2014those\narising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject to\nits authority in connection with the performance of the\nconstitutional functions of the executive or legislative\ndepartments\u201d\u2014and those that were instead matters \u201cof\nprivate right, that is, of the liability of one individual to\nanother under the law as defined.\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285\nU. S. 22, 50, 51 (1932).6 See Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 Although   the Court in Crowell went on to decide that the facts of the\n24                       STERN v.

See\nalso Northern Pipeline, supra, at 68 (plurality opinion)\n(citing Ex parte Bakelite Corp. for the proposition that the\ndoctrine extended \u201conly to matters that historically could\nhave been determined exclusively by\u201d the Executive and\nLegislative Branches).\n   Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprivate dispute before it could be determined by a non-Article III\ntribunal in the first instance, subject to judicial review, the Court did so\nonly after observing that the administrative adjudicator had only\nlimited authority to make specialized, narrowly confined factual deter\u00ad\nminations regarding a particularized area of law and to issue orders\nthat could be enforced only by action of the District Court. 285 U. S., at\n38, 44\u201345, 54; see Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line\nCo., 458 U. S. 50, 78 (1982) (plurality opinion). In other words, the\nagency in Crowell functioned as a true \u201cadjunct\u201d of the District Court.\nThat is not the case here. See infra, at 34\u201336.\n   Although the dissent suggests that we understate the import of\nCrowell in this regard, the dissent itself recognizes\u2014repeatedly\u2014that\nCrowell by its terms addresses the determination of facts outside\nArticle III. See post, at 4 (Crowell \u201cupheld Congress\u2019 delegation of\nprimary factfinding authority to the agency\u201d); post, at 12 (quoting\nCrowell, 285 U. S., at 51, for the proposition that \u201c \u2018there is no require\u00ad\nment that, in order to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial\npower, all determinations of fact in constitutional courts shall be made\nby judges\u2019 \u201d). Crowell may well have additional significance in the\ncontext of expert administrative agencies that oversee particular\nsubstantive federal regimes, but we have no occasion to and do not\naddress those issues today. See infra, at 29. The United States appar\u00ad\nently agrees that any broader significance of Crowell is not pertinent in\nthis case, citing to Crowell in its brief only once, in the last footnote,\nagain for the limited proposition discussed above.

The Court has continued,\nhowever, to limit the exception to cases in which the claim\nat issue derives from a federal regulatory scheme, or in\nwhich resolution of the claim by an expert government\nagency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objec\u00ad\ntive within the agency\u2019s authority. In other words, it is\nstill the case that what makes a right \u201cpublic\u201d rather than\nprivate is that the right is integrally related to particular\nfederal government action. See United States v. Jicarilla\nApache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at\n10\u201311) (\u201cThe distinction between \u2018public rights\u2019 against\nthe Government and \u2018private rights\u2019 between private\nparties is well established,\u201d citing Murray\u2019s Lessee and\nCrowell).\n   Our decision in Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural\nProducts Co., for example, involved a data-sharing ar\u00ad\nrangement between companies under a federal statute pro\u00ad\nviding that disputes about compensation between the\ncompanies would be decided by binding arbitration. 473\nU. S. 568, 571\u2013575 (1985). This Court held that the\nscheme did not violate Article III, explaining that \u201c[a]ny\nright to compensation . . . results from [the statute] and\ndoes not depend on or replace a right to such compensa\u00ad\ntion under state law.\u201d Id., at 584.\n   Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor con\u00ad\ncerned a statutory scheme that created a procedure for\ncustomers injured by a broker\u2019s violation of the federal\ncommodities law to seek reparations from the broker\nbefore the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(CFTC). 478 U. S. 833, 836 (1986). A customer filed such\na claim to recover a debit balance in his account, while the\nbroker filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court to recover\nthe same amount as lawfully due from the customer. The\nbroker later submitted its claim to the CFTC, but after\nthat agency ruled against the customer, the customer\n26                  STERN v.

This Court\ndisagreed, but only after observing that (1) the claim and\nthe counterclaim concerned a \u201csingle dispute\u201d\u2014the same\naccount balance; (2) the CFTC\u2019s assertion of authority\ninvolved only \u201ca narrow class of common law claims\u201d in\na \u201c \u2018particularized area of law\u2019 \u201d; (3) the area of law in\nquestion was governed by \u201ca specific and limited federal\nregulatory scheme\u201d as to which the agency had \u201cobvious\nexpertise\u201d; (4) the parties had freely elected to resolve\ntheir differences before the CFTC; and (5) CFTC orders\nwere \u201cenforceable only by order of the district court.\u201d Id.,\nat 844, 852\u2013855 (quoting Northern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at\n85); see 478 U. S., at 843\u2013844; 849\u2013857. Most signifi\u00ad\ncantly, given that the customer\u2019s reparations claim before\nthe agency and the broker\u2019s counterclaim were competing\nclaims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly empha\u00ad\nsized that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the agency to exer\u00ad\ncise jurisdiction over the broker\u2019s claim, or else \u201cthe\nreparations procedure would have been confounded.\u201d\nId., at 856.\n   The most recent case in which we considered application\nof the public rights exception\u2014and the only case in which\nwe have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy con\u00ad\ntext since Northern Pipeline\u2014is Granfinanciera, S. A. v.\nNordberg, 492 U. S. 33 (1989). In Granfinanciera we\nrejected a bankruptcy trustee\u2019s argument that a fraudu\u00ad\nlent conveyance action filed on behalf of a bankruptcy\nestate against a noncreditor in a bankruptcy proceeding\nfell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d exception. We explained\nthat, \u201c[i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined with\na federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact,\nand if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the\nFederal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an\nArticle III court.\u201d Id., at 54\u201355. We reasoned that fraudu\u00ad\nlent conveyance suits were \u201cquintessentially suits at com\u00ad\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

As a consequence, we concluded that fraudulent\nconveyance actions were \u201cmore accurately characterized as\na private rather than a public right as we have used those\nterms in our Article III decisions.\u201d Id., at 55.7\n   Vickie\u2019s counterclaim\u2014like the fraudulent conveyance\nclaim at issue in Granfinanciera\u2014does not fall within any\nof the varied formulations of the public rights exception in\nthis Court\u2019s cases. It is not a matter that can be pursued\nonly by grace of the other branches, as in Murray\u2019s Lessee,\n18 How., at 284, or one that \u201chistorically could have been\ndetermined exclusively by\u201d those branches, Northern\nPipeline, supra, at 68 (citing Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279\nU. S., at 458). The claim is instead one under state com\u00ad\nmon law between two private parties. It does not \u201cde\u00ad\npend[ ] on the will of congress,\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, supra, at\n284; Congress has nothing to do with it.\n   In addition, Vickie\u2019s claimed right to relief does not flow\nfrom a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S.,\nat 584\u2013585, or Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at 458. It is not\n\u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d adjudication of a claim cre\u00ad\nated by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. And in\ncontrast to the objecting party in Schor, id., at 855\u2013856,\nPierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim\nin the bankruptcy court proceedings. He had nowhere else\nto go if he wished to recover from Vickie\u2019s estate. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We noted that we did not mean to \u201csuggest that the restructuring of\n\ndebtor-creditor relations is in fact a public right.\u201d 492 U. S., at 56,\nn. 11. Our conclusion was that, \u201ceven if one accepts this thesis,\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress could not constitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent\nconveyance action to a non-Article III court. Ibid. Because neither\nparty asks us to reconsider the public rights framework for bankruptcy,\nwe follow the same approach here.\n28                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nGranfinanciera, supra, at 59, n. 14 (noting that \u201c[p]arallel\nreasoning [to Schor] is unavailable in the context of bank\u00ad\nruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative\nforum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their\nclaims\u201d).8\n   Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide Vickie\u2019s\nclaim is not limited to a \u201cparticularized area of the law,\u201d\nas in Crowell, Thomas, and Schor. Northern Pipeline, 458\nU. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). We deal here not with an\nagency but with a court, with substantive jurisdiction\nreaching any area of the corpus juris. See ibid.; id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). This is not a\nsituation in which Congress devised an \u201cexpert and inex\u00ad\npensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact\nwhich are particularly suited to examination and determi\u00ad\nnation by an administrative agency specially assigned to\nthat task.\u201d Crowell, 285 U. S., at 46; see Schor, supra, at\n855\u2013856. The \u201cexperts\u201d in the federal system at resolving\ncommon law counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s are the Article\nIII courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must\nstay.\n   The dissent reads our cases differently, and in particu\u00ad\nlar contends that more recent cases view Northern Pipe\nline as \u201c \u2018establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in\na non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render\nfinal judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional\ncontract action arising under state law, without consent of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Contrary to the claims of the dissent, see post, at 12\u201313, Pierce did\n\nnot have another forum in which to pursue his claim to recover from\nVickie\u2019s pre-bankruptcy assets, rather than take his chances with\nwhatever funds might remain after the Title 11 proceedings. Creditors\nwho possess claims that do not satisfy the requirements for nondis\u00ad\nchargeability under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523 have no choice but to file their\nclaims in bankruptcy proceedings if they want to pursue the claims at\nall. That is why, as we recognized in Granfinanciera, the notion of\n\u201cconsent\u201d does not apply in bankruptcy proceedings as it might in other\ncontexts.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate re\u00ad\nview.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6 (quoting Thomas, supra, at 584). Just\nso: Substitute \u201ctort\u201d for \u201ccontract,\u201d and that statement\ndirectly covers this case.\n  We recognize that there may be instances in which the\ndistinction between public and private rights\u2014at least as\nframed by some of our recent cases\u2014fails to provide con\u00ad\ncrete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular\nagency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive\nregulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is\nso markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the\npublic rights exception in the context of such a regime,\nhowever, we do not in this opinion express any view on\nhow the doctrine might apply in that different context.\n  What is plain here is that this case involves the most\nprototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final,\nbinding judgment by a court with broad substantive juris\u00ad\ndiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action\nneither derives from nor depends upon any agency regula\u00ad\ntory regime. If such an exercise of judicial power may\nnonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply\nby deeming it part of some amorphous \u201cpublic right,\u201d then\nArticle III would be transformed from the guardian of\nindividual liberty and separation of powers we have long\nrecognized into mere wishful thinking.\n                              2\n  Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish\nNorthern Pipeline and Granfinanciera on the ground that\nPierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a\nproof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Given\nPierce\u2019s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues,\nthe Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her\ncounterclaim under our decisions in Katchen v. Landy, 382\nU. S. 323 (1966), and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42\n(1990) (per curiam).\n30                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not agree. As an initial matter, it is hard to see\nwhy Pierce\u2019s decision to file a claim should make any\ndifference with respect to the characterization of Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim. \u201c \u2018[P]roperty interests are created and de\u00ad\nfined by state law,\u2019 and \u2018[u]nless some federal interest\nrequires a different result, there is no reason why such\ninterests should be analyzed differently simply because an\ninterested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d\nTravelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas\n& Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 451 (2007) (quoting Butner v.\nUnited States, 440 U. S. 48, 55 (1979)). Pierce\u2019s claim for\ndefamation in no way affects the nature of Vickie\u2019s coun\u00ad\nterclaim for tortious interference as one at common law\nthat simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\u2014\nthe very type of claim that we held in Northern Pipeline\nand Granfinanciera must be decided by an Article III court.\n   Contrary to Vickie\u2019s contention, moreover, our decisions\nin Katchen and Langenkamp do not suggest a different\nresult. Katchen permitted a bankruptcy referee acting\nunder the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to a\nbankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as\n\u201csummary jurisdiction\u201d over a voidable preference claim\nbrought by the bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who\nhad filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.\nSee 382 U. S., at 325, 327\u2013328. A voidable preference\nclaim asserts that a debtor made a payment to a particu\u00ad\nlar creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect\nincrease that creditor\u2019s proportionate share of the estate.\nThe preferred creditor\u2019s claim in bankruptcy can be disal\u00ad\nlowed as a result of the preference, and the amounts paid\nto that creditor can be recovered by the trustee. See id., at\n330; see also 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7502(d), 547(b).\n   Although the creditor in Katchen objected that the\npreference issue should be resolved through a \u201cplenary\nsuit\u201d in an Article III court, this Court concluded that\nsummary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           31\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause it was not possible for the referee to rule on the\ncreditor\u2019s proof of claim without first resolving the void\u00ad\nable preference issue. 382 U. S., at 329\u2013330, 332\u2013333, and\nn. 9, 334. There was no question that the bankruptcy\nreferee could decide whether there had been a voidable\npreference in determining whether and to what extent\nto allow the creditor\u2019s claim. Once the referee did that,\n\u201cnothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit\u201d; such\na suit \u201cwould be a meaningless gesture.\u201d Id., at 334. The\nplenary proceeding the creditor sought could be brought\ninto the bankruptcy court because \u201cthe same issue [arose]\nas part of the process of allowance and disallowance of\nclaims.\u201d Id., at 336.\n  It was in that sense that the Court stated that \u201che who\ninvokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof\nof claim and demanding its allowance must abide the\nconsequences of that procedure.\u201d Id., at 333, n. 9. In\nKatchen one of those consequences was resolution of the\npreference issue as part of the process of allowing or disal\u00ad\nlowing claims, and accordingly there was no basis for the\ncreditor to insist that the issue be resolved in an Article\nIII court. See id., at 334. Indeed, the Katchen Court\nexpressly noted that it \u201cintimate[d] no opinion concerning\nwhether\u201d the bankruptcy referee would have had \u201csum\u00ad\nmary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bank\u00ad\nruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial\nfactual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed\nof in passing on objections to the [creditor\u2019s proof of]\nclaim.\u201d Id., at 333, n. 9.\n  Our per curiam opinion in Langenkamp is to the same\neffect. We explained there that a preferential transfer\nclaim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly\nfavored creditor has filed a claim, because then \u201cthe ensu\u00ad\ning preference action by the trustee become[s] integral to\nthe restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\u201d 498\nU. S., at 44. If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a\n32                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproof of claim, the trustee\u2019s preference action does not\n\u201cbecome[ ] part of the claims-allowance process\u201d subject to\nresolution by the bankruptcy court. Ibid.; see id., at 45.\n   In ruling on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, the Bankruptcy\nCourt was required to and did make several factual and\nlegal determinations that were not \u201cdisposed of in pass-\ning on objections\u201d to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defama-\ntion, which the court had denied almost a year earlier.\nKatchen, supra, at 332, n. 9. There was some overlap\nbetween Vickie\u2019s counterclaim and Pierce\u2019s defamation\nclaim that led the courts below to conclude that the coun\u00ad\nterclaim was compulsory, 600 F. 3d, at 1057, or at least in\nan \u201cattenuated\u201d sense related to Pierce\u2019s claim, 264 B. R.,\nat 631. But there was never any reason to believe that the\nprocess of adjudicating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would neces\u00ad\nsarily resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. See id., at 631, 632\n(explaining that \u201cthe primary facts at issue on Pierce\u2019s\nclaim were the relationship between Vickie and her attor\u00ad\nneys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,\u201d\nand \u201cthe counterclaim raises issues of law entirely dif\u00ad\nferent from those raise[d] on the defamation claim\u201d). The\nUnited States acknowledges the point. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae, p. (I) (question presented\nconcerns authority of a bankruptcy court to enter final\njudgment on a compulsory counterclaim \u201cwhen adjudica\u00ad\ntion of the counterclaim requires resolution of issues that\nare not implicated by the claim against the estate\u201d); id.,\nat 26.\n   The only overlap between the two claims in this case\nwas the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously\ntaken control of his father\u2019s estate in the manner alleged\nby Vickie in her counterclaim and described in the alleg\u00ad\nedly defamatory statements. From the outset, it was clear\nthat, even assuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it\ndid) rule in Vickie\u2019s favor on that question, the court could\nnot enter judgment for Vickie unless the court additionally\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tortious\ninterference with an expected gift as a valid cause of\naction, what the elements of that action were, and\nwhether those elements were met in this case. 275 B. R.,\nat 50\u201353. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted\nby other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to\nprove, above and beyond Pierce\u2019s tortious interference, (1)\nthe existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable\ncertainty that the expectancy would have been realized\nbut for the interference; and (3) damages. Id., at 51; see\n253 B. R., at 558\u2013561. Also, because Vickie sought puni\u00ad\ntive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the\nBankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in\nVickie\u2019s favor without determining whether to subject\nPierce to the sort of \u201cretribution,\u201d \u201cpunishment[,] and\ndeterrence,\u201d Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U. S., at 492, 504\n(internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are\ndesigned to impose. There thus was never reason to\nbelieve that the process of ruling on Pierce\u2019s proof of\nclaim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim.\n   In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trus\u00ad\ntee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of\nrecovery created by federal bankruptcy law. In Langen\nkamp, we noted that \u201cthe trustee instituted adversary\nproceedings under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7547(b) to recover, as avoid\u00ad\nable preferences,\u201d payments respondents received from the\ndebtor before the bankruptcy filings. 498 U. S., at 43; see,\ne.g., \u00a7547(b)(1) (\u201cthe trustee may avoid any transfer of an\ninterest of the debtor in property\u2014(1) to or for the benefit\nof a creditor\u201d). In Katchen, \u201c[t]he Trustee . . .

Vickie\u2019s claim, in\ncontrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon\nbankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without\nregard to any bankruptcy proceeding.\n   In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent\nthat there are no \u201crelevant distinction[s]\u201d between Pierce\u2019s\nclaim in this case and the claim at issue in Langenkamp.\nPost, at 14. We see no reason to treat Vickie\u2019s counter\u00ad\nclaim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance\naction in Granfinanciera. 492 U. S., at 56. Granfinanci\nera\u2019s distinction between actions that seek \u201cto augment\nthe bankruptcy estate\u201d and those that seek \u201ca pro rata\nshare of the bankruptcy res,\u201d ibid., reaffirms that Con\u00ad\ngress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceed\u00ad\ning may have some bearing on a bankruptcy case; the\nquestion is whether the action at issue stems from the bank\u00ad\nruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the\nclaims allowance process. Vickie has failed to demon\u00ad\nstrate that her counterclaim falls within one of the \u201clim\u00ad\nited circumstances\u201d covered by the public rights exception,\nparticularly given our conclusion that, \u201ceven with respect\nto matters that arguably fall within the scope of the \u2018public\nrights\u2019 doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art.

S., at 84\u201386 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist,\nJ., concurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds\ntrue today.\n   To begin, as explained above, it is still the bankruptcy\ncourt itself that exercises the essential attributes of judi\u00ad\ncial power over a matter such as Vickie\u2019s counterclaim.\nSee supra, at 20. The new bankruptcy courts, like the old,\ndo not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual\ndeterminations regarding a particularized area of law\u201d\nor engage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\u201d\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).\nInstead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve\n\u201c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the\nlaw to which\u201d the parties\u2019 counterclaims might lead. Id.,\nat 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   In addition, whereas the adjunct agency in Crowell v.\nBenson \u201cpossessed only a limited power to issue compensa\u00ad\ntion orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the\ndistrict court,\u201d Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85, a bank\u00ad\nruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders\nand judgments\u201d\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to\nreview only if a party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1),\n158(a)\u2013(b). It is thus no less the case here than it was in\nNorthern Pipeline that \u201c[t]he authority\u2014and the respon\u00ad\nsibility\u2014to make an informed, final determination . . .\nremains with\u201d the bankruptcy judge, not the district court.\n458 U. S., at 81 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Given that authority, a bankruptcy court\ncan no more be deemed a mere \u201cadjunct\u201d of the district\ncourt than a district court can be deemed such an \u201cad\u00ad\njunct\u201d of the court of appeals. We certainly cannot accept\nthe dissent\u2019s notion that judges who have the power to\nenter final, binding orders are the \u201cfunctional[ ]\u201d equiva\u00ad\nlent of \u201claw clerks[ ] and the Judiciary\u2019s administrative\n36                  STERN v.

And even were we wrong in this\nregard, that would only confirm that such judges should\nnot be in the business of entering final judgments in the\nfirst place.\n   It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes,\nbankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by\nthe Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 59. If\u2014as we have concluded\u2014the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court itself exercises \u201cthe essential attributes of\njudicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,\u201d\nSchor, 478 U. S., at 851 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy\njudge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in\nsuch proceedings. The constitutional bar remains. See The\nFederalist No. 78, at 471 (\u201cPeriodical appointments, however\nregulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or\nother, be fatal to [a judge\u2019s] necessary independence\u201d).\n                              D\n  Finally, Vickie and her amici predict as a practical\nmatter that restrictions on a bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to\nhear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will\ncreate significant delays and impose additional costs on\nthe bankruptcy process. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 34\u2013\n36, 57\u201358; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\u2013\n30. It goes without saying that \u201cthe fact that a given law\nor procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facili\u00ad\ntating functions of government, standing alone, will not\nsave it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201d INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983).\n  In addition, we are not convinced that the practical\nconsequences of such limitations on the authority of bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as\nVickie and the dissent suggest. See post, at 16\u201317. The\ndissent asserts that it is important that counterclaims\nsuch as Vickie\u2019s be resolved \u201cin a bankruptcy court,\u201d and\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

But the framework Congress\nadopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain\nstate law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by\njudges other than those of the bankruptcy courts. Section\n1334(c)(2), for example, requires that bankruptcy courts\nabstain from hearing specified non-core, state law claims\nthat \u201ccan be timely adjudicated[ ] in a State forum of ap\u00ad\npropriate jurisdiction.\u201d Section 1334(c)(1) similarly pro\u00ad\nvides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing\nany proceeding, including core matters, \u201cin the interest of\ncomity with State courts or respect for State law.\u201d\n   As described above, the current bankruptcy system also\nrequires the district court to review de novo and enter\nfinal judgment on any matters that are \u201crelated to\u201d the\nbankruptcy proceedings, \u00a7157(c)(1), and permits the dis\u00ad\ntrict court to withdraw from the bankruptcy court any\nreferred case, proceeding, or part thereof, \u00a7157(d). Pierce\nhas not argued that the bankruptcy courts \u201care barred\nfrom \u2018hearing\u2019 all counterclaims\u201d or proposing findings of\nfact and conclusions of law on those matters, but rather\nthat it must be the district court that \u201cfinally decide[s]\u201d\nthem. Brief for Respondent 61. We do not think the re\u00ad\nmoval of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from core bank\u00ad\nruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of\nlabor in the current statute; we agree with the United\nStates that the question presented here is a \u201cnarrow\u201d one.\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   If our decision today does not change all that much, then\nwhy the fuss? Is there really a threat to the separation of\npowers where Congress has conferred the judicial power\noutside Article III only over certain counterclaims in\nbankruptcy? The short but emphatic answer is yes. A\nstatute may no more lawfully chip away at the authority\nof the Judicial Branch than it may eliminate it entirely.\n38                   STERN v.

I adhere to\nmy view, however, that\u2014our contrary precedents notwith\nstanding\u2014\u201ca matter of public rights . . . must at a mini\nmum arise between the government and others,\u201d Granfi\nnanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 65 (1989)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The sheer surfeit of factors that the Court was required\nto consider in this case should arouse the suspicion that\nsomething is seriously amiss with our jurisprudence in\nthis area. I count at least seven different reasons given in\nthe Court\u2019s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge\nwas required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one\n\u201cunder state common law\u201d which was \u201cnot a matter that\ncan be pursued only by grace of the other branches,\u201d ante,\nat 27; that it was \u201cnot \u2018completely dependent upon\u2019 adjudi\ncation of a claim created by federal law,\u201d ibid.; that \u201cPierce\ndid not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim in the\nbankruptcy court proceedings,\u201d ibid.; that \u201cthe asserted\nauthority to decide Vickie\u2019s claim is not limited to a \u2018par\nticularized area of the law,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 28; that \u201cthere was\n2                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnever any reason to believe that the process of adjudi\ncating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily resolve\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim,\u201d ante, at 32; that the trustee was\nnot \u201casserting a right of recovery created by federal bank\nruptcy law,\u201d ante, at 33; and that the Bankruptcy Judge\n\u201cha[d] the power to enter \u2018appropriate orders and judg\nments\u2019\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to review only\nif a party chooses to appeal,\u201d ante, at 35.\n   Apart from their sheer numerosity, the more fundamen\ntal flaw in the many tests suggested by our jurisprudence\nis that they have nothing to do with the text or tradition of\nArticle III. For example, Article III gives no indication\nthat state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an\nArticle III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to\nwhich the area of the law is \u201cparticularized.\u201d The multi\nfactors relied upon today seem to have entered our juris\nprudence almost randomly.\n   Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal adminis\ntrative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse)\nby our landmark decision in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22 (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in all\nfederal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established\nhistorical practice to the contrary. For that reason\u2014and\nnot because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and\nharms\u2014I agree that Article III judges are not required in\nthe context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d cases. See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v.\nMarathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 71 (1982) (plurality\nopinion). Perhaps historical practice permits non-Article\nIII judges to process claims against the bankruptcy estate,\nsee, e.g., Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and\nShould Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567,\n607\u2013609 (1998); the subject has not been briefed, and so I\nstate no position on the matter. But Vickie points to no\nhistorical practice that authorizes a non-Article III judge\nto adjudicate a counterclaim of the sort at issue here.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

His claim\nasserted that Vickie Marshall had, through her lawyers,\naccused him of trying to prevent her from obtaining money\nthat his father had wanted her to have; that her accusa\u00ad\ntions violated state defamation law; and that she conse\u00ad\nquently owed Pierce Marshall damages. Vickie Marshall\nfiled a compulsory counterclaim in which she asserted that\nPierce Marshall had unlawfully interfered with her hus\u00ad\nband\u2019s efforts to grant her an inter vivos gift and that he\nconsequently owed her damages.\n   The Bankruptcy Court adjudicated the claim and the\ncounterclaim. In doing so, the court followed statutory\nprocedures applicable to \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceedings.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b). And ultimately the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered judgment in favor of Vickie Marshall. The\nquestion before us is whether the Bankruptcy Court pos\u00ad\nsessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Vickie Marshall\u2019s coun\u00ad\nterclaim. I agree with the Court that the bankruptcy\nstatute, \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), authorizes a bankruptcy court to\nadjudicate the counterclaim. But I do not agree with the\n2                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmajority about the statute\u2019s constitutionality. I believe\nthe statute is consistent with the Constitution\u2019s delegation\nof the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d to the Judicial\nBranch of Government. Art. III, \u00a71. Consequently, it is\nconstitutional.\n                              I\n   My disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion stems\nin part from my disagreement about the way in which it\ninterprets, or at least emphasizes, certain precedents. In\nmy view, the majority overstates the current relevance of\nstatements this Court made in an 1856 case, Murray\u2019s\nLessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272\n(1856), and it overstates the importance of an analysis\nthat did not command a Court majority in Northern Pipe\nline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.\n50 (1982), and that was subsequently disavowed. At the\nsame time, I fear the Court understates the importance of\na watershed opinion widely thought to demonstrate the\nconstitutional basis for the current authority of adminis\u00ad\ntrative agencies to adjudicate private disputes, namely,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932). And it fails to\nfollow the analysis that this Court more recently has held\napplicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before\nus here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation\nof adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers\nprinciples derived from Article III. See Thomas v. Union\nCarbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568 (1985);\nCommodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S.\n833 (1986).\n   I shall describe these cases in some detail in order to\nexplain why I believe we should put less weight than does\nthe majority upon the statement in Murray\u2019s Lessee and\nthe analysis followed by the Northern Pipeline plurality\nand instead should apply the approach this Court has\napplied in Crowell, Thomas, and Schor.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

In the course of its opinion, the\nCourt wrote:\n    \u201c[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw\n    from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its na-\n    ture, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or\n    in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it\n    bring under the judicial power a matter which, from\n    its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.\n    At the same time there are matters, involving public\n    rights, which may be presented in such form that the\n    judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\n    are susceptible of judicial determination, but which\n    congress may or may not bring within the cognizance\n    of the courts of the United States, as it may deem\n    proper.\u201d Id., at 284.\n  The majority reads the first part of the statement\u2019s first\nsentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of\nArticle III. Ante, at 18. I would read the statement in a\nless absolute way. For one thing, the statement is in effect\ndictum. For another, it is the remainder of the statement,\nannouncing a distinction between \u201cpublic rights\u201d and\n\u201cprivate rights,\u201d that has had the more lasting impact.\nLater Courts have seized on that distinction when uphold\ning non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it\ndown. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451\u2013452\n4                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1929) (Court of Customs Appeals); Williams v. United\nStates, 289 U. S. 553, 579\u2013580 (1933) (Court of Claims).\nThe one exception is Northern Pipeline, where the Court\nstruck down the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. But in that case\nthere was no majority. And a plurality, not a majority,\nread the statement roughly in the way the Court does\ntoday. See 458 U. S., at 67\u201370.\n                              B\n   At the same time, I believe the majority places insuf\u00ad\nficient weight on Crowell, a seminal case that clarified the\nscope of the dictum in Murray\u2019s Lessee. In that case,\nthe Court considered whether Congress could grant to an\nArticle I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an\nemployee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against his em\u00ad\nployer. The Court assumed that an Article III court would\nreview the agency\u2019s decision de novo in respect to ques\u00ad\ntions of law but it would conduct a less searching review\n(looking to see only if the agency\u2019s award was \u201csupported\nby evidence in the record\u201d) in respect to questions of fact.\nCrowell, 285 U. S., at 48\u201350. The Court pointed out that\nthe case involved a dispute between private persons (a\nmatter of \u201cprivate rights\u201d) and (with one exception not\nrelevant here) it upheld Congress\u2019 delegation of primary\nfactfinding authority to the agency.\n   Justice Brandeis, dissenting (from a here-irrelvant por\u00ad\ntion of the Court\u2019s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory\nscheme raised only a due process question: When does due\nprocess require decision by an Article III judge? He an\u00ad\nswered that question by finding constitutional the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency.\nId., at 87.\n   Crowell has been hailed as \u201cthe greatest of the cases\nvalidating administrative adjudication.\u201d Bator, The Con\u00ad\nstitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative\nCourts Under Article III, 65 Ind. L. J. 233, 251 (1990).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nYet, in a footnote, the majority distinguishes Crowell as a\ncase in which the Court upheld the delegation of adjudica\u00ad\ntory authority to an administrative agency simply because\nthe agency\u2019s power to make the \u201cspecialized, narrowly\nconfined factual determinations\u201d at issue arising in a\n\u201cparticularized area of law,\u201d made the agency a \u201ctrue\n\u2018adjunct\u2019 of the District Court.\u201d Ante, at 23, n. 6. Were\nCrowell\u2019s holding as narrow as the majority suggests,\none could question the validity of Congress\u2019 delegation of\nauthority to adjudicate disputes among private parties to\nother agencies such as the National Labor Relations\nBoard, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the\nSurface Transportation Board, and the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, thereby resurrecting\nimportant legal questions previously thought to have been\ndecided. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7160; 7 U. S. C. \u00a718; 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a710704; 42 U. S. C. \u00a73612(b).\n                             C\n   The majority, in my view, overemphasizes the preceden\u00ad\ntial effect of the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline.\nAnte, at 19\u201321. There, the Court held unconstitutional the\njurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\ngranting adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy judges who\nlack the protections of tenure and compensation that\nArticle III provides. Four Members of the Court wrote\nthat Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a non-\nArticle III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a \u201cterrito\u00ad\nrial cour[t]\u201d (2) the judge conducts a \u201ccourts-martial,\u201d or\n(3) the case involves a \u201cpublic right,\u201d namely, a \u201cmatter\u201d\nthat \u201cat a minimum arise[s] \u2018between the government and\nothers.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 64\u201370 (plurality opinion) (quoting\nEx parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451). Two other Mem\u00ad\nbers of the Court, without accepting these limitations,\nagreed with the result because the case involved a breach\u00ad\nof-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on\n6                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbehalf of the bankruptcy estate against a third party who\nwas not part of the bankruptcy proceeding, and none of\nthe Court\u2019s preceding cases (which, the two Members\nwrote, \u201cdo not admit of easy synthesis\u201d) had \u201cgone so far as\nto sanction th[is] type of adjudication.\u201d 458 U. S., at 90\u201391\n(Rehnquist, J. concurring in judgment).\n  Three years later, the Court held that Northern Pipeline\n    \u201cestablishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-\n    Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final\n    judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional\n    contract action arising under state law, without con\u00ad\n    sent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary ap\u00ad\n    pellate review.\u201d Thomas, 473 U. S., at 584.\n                             D\n   Rather than leaning so heavily on the approach taken\nby the plurality in Northern Pipeline, I would look to this\nCourt\u2019s more recent Article III cases Thomas and Schor\u2014\ncases that commanded a clear majority. In both cases\nthe Court took a more pragmatic approach to the constitu\u00ad\ntional question. It sought to determine whether, in the\nparticular instance, the challenged delegation of adjudica\u00ad\ntory authority posed a genuine and serious threat that one\nbranch of Government sought to aggrandize its own con\u00ad\nstitutionally delegated authority by encroaching upon a\nfield of authority that the Constitution assigns exclusively\nto another branch.\n                             1\n   In Thomas, the Court focused directly upon the nature\nof the Article III problem, illustrating how the Court\nshould determine whether a delegation of adjudicatory\nauthority to a non-Article III judge violates the Constitu\u00ad\ntion. The statute in question required pesticide manufac\u00ad\nturers to submit to binding arbitration claims for compen\u00ad\nsation owed for the use by one manufacturer of the data of\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

After\ndescribing Northern Pipeline\u2019s holding in the language I\nhave set forth above, supra, at 6, the Court stated that\n\u201cpractical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire\nreliance on formal categories should inform application of\nArticle III.\u201d Thomas, 473 U. S., at 587 (emphasis added).\nIt indicated that Article III\u2019s requirements could not be\n\u201cdetermined\u201d by \u201cthe identity of the parties alone,\u201d ibid.,\nor by the \u201cprivate rights\u201d/\u201cpublic rights\u201d distinction, id., at\n585\u2013586. And it upheld the arbitration provision of the\nstatute.\n  The Court pointed out that the right in question was\ncreated by a federal statute, it \u201crepresent[s] a pragmatic\nsolution to the difficult problem of spreading [certain]\ncosts,\u201d and the statute \u201cdoes not preclude review of the\narbitration proceeding by an Article III court.\u201d Id., at\n589\u2013592. The Court concluded:\n    \u201cGiven the nature of the right at issue and the con\u00ad\n    cerns motivating the Legislature, we do not think this\n    system threatens the independent role of the Judici\u00ad\n    ary in our constitutional scheme.\u201d Id., at 590.\n                             2\n   Most recently, in Schor, the Court described in greater\ndetail how this Court should analyze this kind of Article\nIII question. The question at issue in Schor involved a\ndelegation of authority to an agency to adjudicate a coun\u00ad\nterclaim. A customer brought before the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) a claim for repara\u00ad\ntions against his commodity futures broker. The customer\nnoted that his brokerage account showed that he owed the\nbroker money, but he said that the broker\u2019s unlawful\nactions had produced that debit balance, and he sought\ndamages. The broker brought a counterclaim seeking the\nmoney that the account showed the customer owed. This\nCourt had to decide whether agency adjudication of such a\n8                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncounterclaim is consistent with Article III.\n   In doing so, the Court expressly \u201cdeclined to adopt\nformalistic and unbending rules.\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851.\nRather, it \u201cweighed a number of factors, none of which has\nbeen deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical\neffect that the congressional action will have on the consti\u00ad\ntutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.\u201d Ibid.\nThose relevant factors include (1) \u201cthe origins and im\u00ad\nportance of the right to be adjudicated\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to\nwhich the non-Article III forum exercises the range of ju\u00ad\nrisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III\ncourts\u201d; (3) the extent to which the delegation nonetheless\nreserves judicial power for exercise by Article III courts;\n(4) the presence or \u201cabsence of consent to an initial adjudi\u00ad\ncation before a non-Article III tribunal\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe con\u00ad\ncerns that drove Congress to depart from\u201d adjudication in\nan Article III court. Id., at 849, 851.\n   The Court added that where \u201cprivate rights,\u201d rather\nthan \u201cpublic rights\u201d are involved, the \u201cdanger of encroach\u00ad\ning on the judicial powers\u201d is greater. Id., at 853\u2013854\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while non-\nArticle III adjudication of \u201cprivate rights\u201d is not necessar\u00ad\nily unconstitutional, the Court\u2019s constitutional \u201cexamina\u00ad\ntion\u201d of such a scheme must be more \u201csearching.\u201d Ibid.\n   Applying this analysis, the Court upheld the agency\u2019s\nauthority to adjudicate the counterclaim. The Court con\u00ad\nceded that the adjudication might be of a kind tradi\u00ad\ntionally decided by a court and that the rights at issue\nwere \u201cprivate,\u201d not \u201cpublic.\u201d Id., at 853. But, the Court\nsaid, the CFTC deals only with a \u201c \u2018particularized area of\nlaw\u2019 \u201d; the decision to invoke the CFTC forum is \u201cleft en\u00ad\ntirely to the parties\u201d; Article III courts can review the\nagency\u2019s findings of fact under \u201cthe same \u2018weight of the\nevidence\u2019 standard sustained in Crowell\u201d and review its\n\u201clegal determinations . . . de novo\u201d; and the agency\u2019s \u201ccoun\u00ad\nterclaim jurisdiction\u201d was necessary to make \u201cworkable\u201d a\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The Court concluded that for these and other\nreasons \u201cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial\nBranch can only be termed de minimis.\u201d Id., at 856.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   This case law, as applied in Thomas and Schor, requires\nus to determine pragmatically whether a congressional\ndelegation of adjudicatory authority to a non-Article III\njudge violates the separation-of-powers principles inherent\nin Article III. That is to say, we must determine through\nan examination of certain relevant factors whether that\ndelegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the\nLegislative or Executive Branches of Government upon\nthe realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise\nby the Judicial Branch of Government. Those factors\ninclude (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2)\nthe nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to\nwhich Article III courts exercise control over the proceed\u00ad\ning; (4) the presence or absence of the parties\u2019 consent; and\n(5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose\nserved by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal\nwith judges who lack Article III\u2019s tenure and compensa\u00ad\ntion protections. The presence of \u201cprivate rights\u201d does not\nautomatically determine the outcome of the question but\nrequires a more \u201csearching\u201d examination of the relevant\nfactors. Schor, supra, at 854.\n   Insofar as the majority would apply more formal stan\u00ad\ndards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent.\nThomas, supra, at 587 (\u201c[P]ractical attention to substance\nrather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories\nshould inform application of Article III\u201d); Schor, supra, at\n851 (\u201c[T]he Court has declined to adopt formalistic and\nunbending rules\u201d for deciding Article III cases).\n10                  STERN v. MARSHALL \n\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Applying Schor\u2019s approach here, I conclude that the\ndelegation of adjudicatory authority before us is consti\u00ad\ntutional. A grant of authority to a bankruptcy court\nto adjudicate compulsory counterclaims does not violate\nany constitutional separation-of-powers principle related to\nArticle III.\n   First, I concede that the nature of the claim to be adju\ndicated argues against my conclusion. Vickie Marshall\u2019s\ncounterclaim\u2014a kind of tort suit\u2014resembles \u201ca suit at the\ncommon law.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18 How., at 284. Although\nnot determinative of the question, see Schor, 478 U. S., at\n853, a delegation of authority to a non-Article III judge to\nadjudicate a claim of that kind poses a heightened risk of\nencroachment on the Federal Judiciary, id., at 854.\n   At the same time the significance of this factor is miti\u00ad\ngated here by the fact that bankruptcy courts often decide\nclaims that similarly resemble various common-law ac\u00ad\ntions. Suppose, for example, that ownership of 40 acres of\nland in the bankruptcy debtor\u2019s possession is disputed by a\ncreditor. If that creditor brings a claim in the bankruptcy\ncourt, resolution of that dispute requires the bankruptcy\ncourt to apply the same state property law that would\ngovern in a state court proceeding. This kind of dispute\narises with regularity in bankruptcy proceedings.\n   Of course, in this instance the state-law question is\nembedded in a debtor\u2019s counterclaim, not a creditor\u2019s\nclaim. But the counterclaim is \u201ccompulsory.\u201d It \u201carises\nout of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject\nmatter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n13(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7013. Thus, resolution of\nthe counterclaim will often turn on facts identical to, or at\nleast related to, those at issue in a creditor\u2019s claim that is\nundisputedly proper for the bankruptcy court to decide.\n   Second, the nature of the non-Article III tribunal argues\nin favor of constitutionality. That is because the tribunal\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis made up of judges who enjoy considerable protection\nfrom improper political influence. Unlike the 1978 Act\nwhich provided for the appointment of bankruptcy judges\nby the President with the advice and consent of the\nSenate, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7152 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), current\nlaw provides that the federal courts of appeals appoint fed\u00ad\neral bankruptcy judges, \u00a7152(a)(1) (2006 ed.). Bankruptcy\njudges are removable by the circuit judicial counsel (made\nup of federal court of appeals and district court judges)\nand only for cause. \u00a7152(e). Their salaries are pegged to\nthose of federal district court judges, \u00a7153(a), and the cost\nof their courthouses and other work-related expenses are\npaid by the Judiciary, \u00a7156. Thus, although Congress\ntechnically exercised its Article I power when it created\nbankruptcy courts, functionally, bankruptcy judges can be\ncompared to magistrate judges, law clerks, and the Judi\u00ad\nciary\u2019s administrative officials, whose lack of Article III\ntenure and compensation protections do not endanger the\nindependence of the Judicial Branch.\n   Third, the control exercised by Article III judges over\nbankruptcy proceedings argues in favor of constitutional\u00ad\nity. Article III judges control and supervise the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court\u2019s determinations\u2014at least to the same degree\nthat Article III judges supervised the agency\u2019s determina\u00ad\ntions in Crowell, if not more so. Any party may appeal\nthose determinations to the federal district court, where\nthe federal judge will review all determinations of fact for\nclear error and will review all determinations of law de\nnovo. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013; 10 Collier on Bank\u00ad\nruptcy \u00b68013.04 (16th ed. 2011). But for the here\u00ad\nirrelevant matter of what Crowell considered to be special\n\u201cconstitutional\u201d facts, the standard of review for factual\nfindings here (\u201cclearly erroneous\u201d) is more stringent than\nthe standard at issue in Crowell (whether the agency\u2019s\nfactfinding was \u201csupported by evidence in the record\u201d).\n285 U. S., at 48; see Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150,\n12                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n152, 153 (1999) (\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence\u201d\nmore deferential than \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted)). And, as Crowell noted, \u201cthere is no\nrequirement that, in order to maintain the essential at\u00ad\ntributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in\nconstitutional courts shall be made by judges.\u201d 285 U. S.,\nat 51.\n   Moreover, in one important respect Article III judges\nmaintain greater control over the bankruptcy court pro\u00ad\nceedings at issue here than they did over the relevant\nproceedings in any of the previous cases in which this\nCourt has upheld a delegation of adjudicatory power. The\nDistrict Court here may \u201cwithdraw, in whole or in part,\nany case or proceeding referred [to the Bankruptcy Court]\n. . . on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for\ncause shown.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(d); cf. Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion) (contrasting\npre-1978 law where \u201cpower to withdraw the case from\nthe [bankruptcy] referee\u201d gave district courts \u201ccontrol\u201d\nover case with the unconstitutional 1978 statute, which\nprovided no such district court authority).\n   Fourth, the fact that the parties have consented to Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court jurisdiction argues in favor of constitutional\u00ad\nity, and strongly so. Pierce Marshall, the counterclaim\ndefendant, is not a stranger to the litigation, forced to\nappear in Bankruptcy Court against his will. Cf. id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (suit was litigated\nin Bankruptcy Court \u201cover [the defendant\u2019s] objection\u201d).\nRather, he appeared voluntarily in Bankruptcy Court as\none of Vickie Marshall\u2019s creditors, seeking a favorable\nresolution of his claim against Vickie Marshall to the\ndetriment of her other creditors. He need not have filed a\nclaim, perhaps not even at the cost of bringing it in the\nfuture, for he says his claim is \u201cnondischargeable,\u201d in\nwhich case he could have litigated it in a state or federal\ncourt after distribution.

A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 59, n. 14\n(1989).\n   The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that\nthis type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordi\u00ad\nnary bankruptcy court proceedings. In Granfinanciera,\nthe Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to\nvoid a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual\non the ground that the transfer to that individual consti\u00ad\ntutes an unlawful \u201cpreference,\u201d the question of whether\nthe individual has a right to a jury trial \u201cdepends upon\nwhether the creditor has submitted a claim against the\nestate.\u201d Id., at 58. The following year, in Langenkamp v.\nCulp, 498 U. S. 42 (1990) (per curiam), the Court empha\u00ad\nsized that when the individual files a claim against the\nestate, that individual has\n    \u201ctrigger[ed] the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance\n    of claims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bank\u00ad\n    ruptcy court\u2019s equitable power. If the creditor is met,\n    in turn, with a preference action from the trustee,\n    that action becomes part of the claims-allowance proc\u00ad\n    ess which is triable only in equity. In other words, the\n    creditor\u2019s claim and the ensuing preference action by\n    the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the\n    debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy\n    court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 44 (quoting Granfi\n    nanciera, 492 U. S., at 58; citations omitted).\nAs we have recognized, the jury trial question and the\nArticle III question are highly analogous. See id., at 52\u2013\n53. And to that extent, Granfinanciera\u2019s and Langen\nkamp\u2019s basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even\nwhen private rights are at issue, non-Article III adjudica\u00ad\ntion may be appropriate when both parties consent. Cf.\nNorthern Pipeline, supra, at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion)\n14                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy juris\u00ad\ndiction). See also Schor, 478 U. S., at 849 (\u201c[A]bsence of\nconsent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III\ntribunal was relied on [in Northern Pipeline] as a signifi\u00ad\ncant factor in determining that Article III forbade such\nadjudication\u201d). The majority argues that Pierce Marshall\n\u201cdid not truly consent\u201d to bankruptcy jurisdiction, ante, at\n27\u201328, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in Lan\ngenkamp and Granfinanciera, and there is no relevant\ndistinction between the claims filed in those cases and the\nclaim filed here.\n   Fifth, the nature and importance of the legislative pur\npose served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to\nbankruptcy tribunals argues strongly in favor of constitu\u00ad\ntionality. Congress\u2019 delegation of adjudicatory powers\nover counterclaims asserted against bankruptcy claimants\nconstitutes an important means of securing a constitu\u00ad\ntionally authorized end. Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution\nexplicitly grants Congress the \u201cPower To . . . establish . . .\nuniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout\nthe United States.\u201d James Madison wrote in the Federal\u00ad\nist Papers that the\n     \u201cpower of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is\n     so intimately connected with the regulation of com\u00ad\n     merce, and will prevent so many frauds where the\n     parties or their property may lie or be removed into\n     different States, that the expediency of it seems not\n     likely to be drawn into question.\u201d The Federalist No.\n     42, p. 271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\n  Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800.\n2 Stat. 19. From the beginning, the \u201ccore\u201d of federal bank\u00ad\nruptcy proceedings has been \u201cthe restructuring of debtor\u00ad\ncreditor relations.\u201d Northern Pipeline, supra, at 71 (plu\u00ad\nrality opinion). And, to be effective, a single tribunal must\nhave broad authority to restructure those relations, \u201chav\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Landy, 382 U. S.\n323, 335 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The restructuring process requires a creditor to file a\nproof of claim in the bankruptcy court. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7501;\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3002(a). In doing so, the creditor\n\u201ctriggers the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance of\nclaims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s equitable power.\u201d Langenkamp, supra, at 44 (quot\u00ad\ning Granfinanciera, supra, at 58). By filing a proof of\nclaim, the creditor agrees to the bankruptcy court\u2019s resolu\u00ad\ntion of that claim, and if the creditor wins, the creditor will\nreceive a share of the distribution of the bankruptcy es\u00ad\ntate. When the bankruptcy estate has a related claim\nagainst that creditor, that counterclaim may offset the\ncreditor\u2019s claim, or even yield additional damages that\naugment the estate and may be distributed to the other\ncreditors.\n   The consequent importance to the total bankruptcy\nscheme of permitting the trustee in bankruptcy to assert\ncounterclaims against claimants, and resolving those\ncounterclaims in a bankruptcy court, is reflected in the\nfact that Congress included \u201ccounterclaims by the estate\nagainst persons filing claims against the estate\u201d on its list\nof \u201c[c]ore proceedings.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). And it\nexplains the difference, reflected in this Court\u2019s opinions,\nbetween a claimant\u2019s and a nonclaimant\u2019s constitutional\nright to a jury trial. Compare Granfinanciera, supra, at\n58\u201359 (\u201cBecause petitioners . . . have not filed claims\nagainst the estate\u201d they retain \u201ctheir Seventh Amendment\nright to a trial by jury\u201d), with Langenkamp, supra, at 45\n(\u201cRespondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate\u201d\nand \u201c[c]onsequently, they were not entitled to a jury\ntrial\u201d).\n   Consequently a bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of\n16                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsuch matters has more than \u201csome bearing on a bank\u00ad\nruptcy case.\u201d Ante, at 34 (emphasis deleted). It plays a\ncritical role in Congress\u2019 constitutionally based effort to\ncreate an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system.\nAt the least, that is what Congress concluded. We owe\ndeference to that determination, which shows the absence\nof any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or\ndesire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves\nto judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation\nprotections.\n  Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in\nSchor, \u201cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial\nBranch can only be termed de minimis.\u201d 478 U. S., at 856.\nI would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.\n                              III\n  The majority predicts that as a \u201cpractical matter\u201d to\u00ad\nday\u2019s decision \u201cdoes not change all that much.\u201d Ante, at\n36\u201337. But I doubt that is so. Consider a typical case:\nA tenant files for bankruptcy. The landlord files a claim\nfor unpaid rent. The tenant asserts a counterclaim for\ndamages suffered by the landlord\u2019s (1) failing to fulfill his\nobligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering pos\u00ad\nsession of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in\nhousing court. (These are close to the facts presented in\nIn re Beugen, 81 B. R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).)\nThis state-law counterclaim does not \u201cste[m] from the\nbankruptcy itself,\u201d ante, at 34, it would not \u201cnecessarily be\nresolved in the claims allowance process,\u201d ibid., and it\nwould require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the\nlessor\u2019s failures, the extent to which the landlord\u2019s repre\u00ad\nsentations to the housing court were untrue, and damages\nsuffered by improper recovery of possession of the prem\u00ad\nises, cf. ante, at 33-33. Thus, under the majority\u2019s holding,\nthe federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would\nhave to hear and resolve the counterclaim.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Why is that a problem? Because these types of disputes\narise in bankruptcy court with some frequency. See, e.g.,\nIn re CBI Holding Co., 529 F. 3d 432 (CA2 2008) (state\u00ad\nlaw claims and counterclaims); In re Winstar Communica\ntions, Inc., 348 B. R. 234 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2005) (same);\nIn re Ascher, 128 B. R. 639 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1991)\n(same); In re Sun West Distributors, Inc., 69 B. R. 861\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Cal. 1987) (same). Because the volume of\nbankruptcy cases is staggering, involving almost 1.6 mil\u00ad\nlion filings last year, compared to a federal district court\ndocket of around 280,000 civil cases and 78,000 criminal\ncases. Administrative Office of the United States Courts,\nJ. Duff, Judicial Business of the United States Courts:\nAnnual Report of the Director 14 (2010). Because unlike\nthe \u201crelated\u201d non-core state law claims that bankruptcy\ncourts must abstain from hearing, see ante, at 36, compul\u00ad\nsory counterclaims involve the same factual disputes as\nthe claims that may be finally adjudicated by the bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts. Because under these circumstances, a\nconstitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong\nbetween courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost,\ndelay, and needless additional suffering among those faced\nwith bankruptcy.\n   For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n",

Argued January 18, 2011\u2014Decided June 23, 2011\nArticle III, \u00a71, of the Constitution mandates that \u201c[t]he judicial Power\n  of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in\n  such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain\n  and establish,\u201d and provides that the judges of those constitutional\n  courts \u201cshall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\u201d and \u201creceive\n  for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ] [that] shall not be diminished\u201d\n  during their tenure. The questions presented in this case are\n  whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and\n  salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157 and Arti\n  cle III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn\n  Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall\n  (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n     Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierce\u2019s father, approxi\n  mately a year before his death. Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie\n  filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J.\n  Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tor\n  tiously interfered with that gift. After J. Howard died, Vickie filed\n  for bankruptcy in federal court. Pierce filed a proof of claim in that\n  proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from\n  Vickie\u2019s bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by induc\n  ing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in con\n  trolling his father\u2019s assets. Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim\n  for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard.\n     The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the\n  defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of\n  dollars in damages on her counterclaim. Pierce objected that the\n2                         STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on\n    that counterclaim because it was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d as defined\n    by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). As set forth in \u00a7157(a), Congress has di\n    vided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that\n    \u201caris[e] under title 11\u201d; those that \u201caris[e] in\u201d a Title 11 case; and\n    those that are \u201crelated to a case under title 11.\u201d District courts may\n    refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district,\n    and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in \u201call core pro\n    ceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.\u201d\n    \u00a7\u00a7157(a), (b)(1). In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy\n    judge may only \u201csubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\n    law to the district court.\u201d \u00a7157(c)(1). Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 cate\n    gories of core proceedings, including \u201ccounterclaims by the estate\n    against persons filing claims against the estate.\u201d \u00a7157(b)(2)(C).\n       The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was a\n    core proceeding. The District Court reversed, reading this Court\u2019s\n    precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line\n    Co., 458 U. S. 50, to \u201csuggest[ ] that it would be unconstitutional to\n    hold that any and all counterclaims are core.\u201d The court held that\n    Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat re\n    lated to Pierce\u2019s claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy\n    Court\u2019s judgment as proposed, not final. Although the Texas state\n    court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the par\n    ties\u2019 dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the District\n    Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickie\u2019s favor. The\n    Court of Appeals ultimately reversed. It held that the Bankruptcy\n    Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counter\n    claim because the claim was not \u201cso closely related to [Pierce\u2019s] proof\n    of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to re\n    solve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.\u201d Because that\n    holding made the Texas probate court\u2019s judgment the earliest final\n    judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held\n    that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclu\n    sive effect.\nHeld: Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to\n enter judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional\n authority to do so. Pp. 6\u201338.\n    1. Section 157(b) authorized the Bankruptcy Court to enter final\n judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (a) The Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter\n    final judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as a core proceeding under\n    \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). Pierce argues that \u00a7157(b) authorizes bankruptcy\n    courts to enter final judgments only in those proceedings that are\n    both core and either arise in a Title 11 case or arise under Title 11 it\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nself. But that reading necessarily assumes that there is a category of\ncore proceedings that do not arise in a bankruptcy case or under\nbankruptcy law, and the structure of \u00a7157 makes clear that no such\ncategory exists. Pp. 8\u201311.\n      (b) In the alternative, Pierce argues that the Bankruptcy Court\nlacked jurisdiction to resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim because his defa\nmation claim is a \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d that the Bankruptcy Court\nlacked jurisdiction to hear under \u00a7157(b)(5). The Court agrees with\nVickie that \u00a7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and Pierce consented to\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of the defamation claim. The\nCourt is not inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional\nbar when they are not framed as such. See generally Henderson v.\nShinseki, 562 U. S. ___; Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500. Sec\ntion 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a jurisdictional decree,\nand the statutory context belies Pierce\u2019s claim that it is jurisdictional.\nPierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of the defama\ntion claim by repeatedly advising that court that he was happy to\nlitigate his claim there. Pp. 12\u201316.\n   2. Although \u00a7157 allowed the Bankruptcy Court to enter final judg\nment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, Article III of the Constitution did not.\nPp. 16\u201338.\n      (a) Article III is \u201can inseparable element of the constitutional\nsystem of checks and balances\u201d that \u201cboth defines the power and pro\ntects the independence of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 58 (plurality opinion). Article III protects liberty not\nonly through its role in implementing the separation of powers, but\nalso by specifying the defining characteristics of Article III judges to\nprotect the integrity of judicial decisionmaking.\n   This is not the first time the Court has faced an Article III chal\nlenge to a bankruptcy court\u2019s resolution of a debtor\u2019s suit. In North\nern Pipeline, the Court considered whether bankruptcy judges serv\ning under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\u2014who also lacked the tenure\nand salary guarantees of Article III\u2014could \u201cconstitutionally be\nvested with jurisdiction to decide [a] state-law contract claim\u201d against\nan entity that was not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.\nId., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion). The plurality in Northern\nPipeline recognized that there was a category of cases involving \u201cpub\nlic rights\u201d that Congress could constitutionally assign to \u201clegislative\u201d\ncourts for resolution. A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing\non the scope of that exception, concluded that the doctrine did not en\ncompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue in that case, and\nrejected the debtor\u2019s argument that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise\nof jurisdiction was constitutional because the bankruptcy judge was\nacting merely as an adjunct of the district court or court of appeals.\n4                          STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 69\u201372; see id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judg\n    ment). After the decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress revised the\n    statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.\n    With respect to the \u201ccore\u201d proceedings listed in \u00a7157(b)(2), however,\n    the bankruptcy courts under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Fed\n    eral Judgeship Act of 1984 exercise the same powers they wielded\n    under the 1978 Act. The authority exercised by the newly consti\n    tuted courts over a counterclaim such as Vickie\u2019s exceeds the bounds\n    of Article III. Pp. 16\u201322.\n          (b) Vickie\u2019s counterclaim does not fall within the public rights ex\n    ception, however defined. The Court has long recognized that, in\n    general, Congress may not \u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any\n    matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common\n    law, or in equity, or admiralty.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &\n    Improvement Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87010\"><a href=\"/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284. The Court has also recognized\n    that \u201c[a]t the same time there are matters, involving public rights,\n    . . . which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which con\n    gress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the\n    United States, as it may deem proper.\u201d Ibid. Several previous deci\n    sions have contrasted cases within the reach of the public rights ex\n    ception\u2014those arising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject\n    to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitu\n    tional functions of the executive or legislative departments\u201d\u2014and\n    those that are instead matters \u201cof private right, that is, of the liabil\n    ity of one individual to another under the law as defined.\u201d Crowell v.\n    Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50, 51.\n        Shortly after Northern Pipeline, the Court rejected the limitation of\n    the public rights exception to actions involving the Government as a\n    party. The Court has continued, however, to limit the exception to\n    cases in which the claim at issue derives from a federal regulatory\n    scheme, or in which resolution of the claim by an expert Government\n    agency is deemed essential to a limited regulatory objective within\n    the agency\u2019s authority. In other words, it is still the case that what\n    makes a right \u201cpublic\u201d rather than private is that the right is inte\n    grally related to particular Federal Government action. See United\n    States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n    10\u201311); Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473\n    U. S. 568, 584; Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor,\n    478 U. S. 833, 844, 856.\n        In Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, the most recent\n    case considering the public rights exception, the Court rejected a\n    bankruptcy trustee\u2019s argument that a fraudulent conveyance action\n    filed on behalf of a bankruptcy estate against a noncreditor in a\n    bankruptcy proceeding fell within the exception. Vickie\u2019s counter\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nclaim is similar. It is not a matter that can be pursued only by grace\nof the other branches, as in Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18 How., at 284; it does\nnot flow from a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S., at\n584\u2013585; and it is not \u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d adjudication of a\nclaim created by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. This case\ninvolves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of\na final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdic\ntion, on a common law cause of action, when the action neither de\nrives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime. If such\nan exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Arti\ncle III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous \u201cpublic\nright,\u201d then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of in\ndividual liberty and separation of powers the Court has long recog\nnized into mere wishful thinking. Pp. 22\u201329.\n     (c) The fact that Pierce filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy\nproceedings did not give the Bankruptcy Court the authority to adju\ndicate Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. Initially, Pierce\u2019s defamation claim does\nnot affect the nature of Vickie\u2019s tortious interference counterclaim as\none at common law that simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy\nestate\u2014the type of claim that, under Northern Pipeline and Granfi\nnanciera, must be decided by an Article III court. The cases on which\nVickie relies, Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, and Langenkamp v.\nCulp, 498 U. S. 42 (per curiam), are inapposite. Katchen permitted a\nbankruptcy referee to exercise jurisdiction over a trustee\u2019s voidable\npreference claim against a creditor only where there was no question\nthat the referee was required to decide whether there had been a\nvoidable preference in determining whether and to what extent to al\nlow the creditor\u2019s claim. The Katchen Court \u201cintimate[d] no opinion\nconcerning whether\u201d the bankruptcy referee would have had \u201csum\nmary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bankruptcy] trustee\nfor affirmative relief, all of the substantial factual and legal bases for\nwhich ha[d] not been disposed of in passing on objections to the\n[creditor\u2019s proof of ] claim.\u201d 382 U. S., at 333, n. 9. The per curiam\nopinion in Langenkamp is to the same effect. In this case, by con\ntrast, the Bankruptcy Court\u2014in order to resolve Vickie\u2019s counter\nclaim\u2014was required to and did make several factual and legal de\nterminations that were not \u201cdisposed of in passing on objections\u201d to\nPierce\u2019s proof of claim. In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover,\nthe trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of re\ncovery created by federal bankruptcy law. Vickie\u2019s claim is instead a\nstate tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy pro\nceeding. Pp. 29\u201334.\n     (d) The bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act are not \u201cadjuncts\u201d\nof the district courts. The new bankruptcy courts, like the courts\n6                          STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    considered in Northern Pipeline, do not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, nar\n    rowly confined factual determinations regarding a particularized\n    area of law\u201d or engage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding func\n    tions.\u201d 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). Whereas the adjunct\n    agency in Crowell v. Benson \u201cpossessed only a limited power to issue\n    compensation orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the\n    district court,\u201d ibid., a bankruptcy court resolving a counterclaim un\n    der \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders and\n    judgments\u201d\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to review only if a\n    party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), 158(a)\u2013(b). Such a court is\n    an adjunct of no one. Pp. 34\u201336.\n         (e) Finally, Vickie and her amici predict that restrictions on a\n    bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to hear and finally resolve compulsory\n    counterclaims will create significant delays and impose additional\n    costs on the bankruptcy process. It goes without saying that \u201cthe fact\n    that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in\n    facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if\n    it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201d INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,\n    944. In addition, the Court is not convinced that the practical conse\n    quences of such limitations are as significant as Vickie suggests. The\n    framework Congress adopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates\n    that certain state law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by\n    state courts and district courts, see \u00a7\u00a7157(c), 1334(c), and the Court\n    does not think the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from\n    core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of la\n    bor in the statute.

Innumerable children have been born into\nthe cause: innumerable young people have married into\nit;\u201d and, sadly, the original parties \u201chave died out of it.\u201d A\n\u201clong procession of [judges] has come in and gone out\u201d dur\u00ad\ning that time, and still the suit \u201cdrags its weary length\nbefore the Court.\u201d\n   Those words were not written about this case, see\nC. Dickens, Bleak House, in 1 Works of Charles Dickens\n4\u20135 (1891), but they could have been. This is the second\ntime we have had occasion to weigh in on this long\u00ad\nrunning dispute between Vickie Lynn Marshall and E.\nPierce Marshall over the fortune of J. Howard Marshall II,\na man believed to have been one of the richest people in\nTexas. The Marshalls\u2019 litigation has worked its way\n2                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough state and federal courts in Louisiana, Texas, and\nCalifornia, and two of those courts\u2014a Texas state probate\ncourt and the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District\nof California\u2014have reached contrary decisions on its mer\u00ad\nits. The Court of Appeals below held that the Texas state\ndecision controlled, after concluding that the Bankruptcy\nCourt lacked the authority to enter final judgment on a\ncounterclaim that Vickie brought against Pierce in her\nbankruptcy proceeding.1 To determine whether the Court\nof Appeals was correct in that regard, we must resolve two\nissues: (1) whether the Bankruptcy Court had the statu\u00ad\ntory authority under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b) to issue a final\njudgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim; and (2) if so, whether\nconferring that authority on the Bankruptcy Court is\nconstitutional.\n   Although the history of this litigation is complicated, its\nresolution ultimately turns on very basic principles. Arti\u00ad\ncle III, \u00a71, of the Constitution commands that \u201c[t]he judi\u00ad\ncial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con\u00ad\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d That\nArticle further provides that the judges of those courts\nshall hold their offices during good behavior, without\ndiminution of salary. Ibid. Those requirements of Article\nIII were not honored here. The Bankruptcy Court in this\ncase exercised the judicial power of the United States by\nentering final judgment on a common law tort claim, even\nthough the judges of such courts enjoy neither tenure\nduring good behavior nor salary protection. We conclude\nthat, although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory\nauthority to enter judgment on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, it\nlacked the constitutional authority to do so.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because both Vickie and Pierce passed away during this litigation,\n\nthe parties in this case are Vickie\u2019s estate and Pierce\u2019s estate. We\ncontinue to refer to them as \u201cVickie\u201d and \u201cPierce.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n   Because we have already recounted the facts and proce\u00ad\ndural history of this case in detail, see Marshall v. Mar\nshall, 547 U. S. 293, 300\u2013305 (2006), we do not repeat\nthem in full here. Of current relevance are two claims\nVickie filed in an attempt to secure half of J. Howard\u2019s\nfortune. Known to the public as Anna Nicole Smith,\nVickie was J. Howard\u2019s third wife and married him about\na year before his death. Id., at 300; see In re Marshall,\n392 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2004). Although J. Howard\nbestowed on Vickie many monetary and other gifts during\ntheir courtship and marriage, he did not include her in\nhis will. 547 U. S., at 300. Before J. Howard passed away,\nVickie filed suit in Texas state probate court, asserting\nthat Pierce\u2014J. Howard\u2019s younger son\u2014fraudulently in\u00ad\nduced J. Howard to sign a living trust that did not include\nher, even though J. Howard meant to give her half his\nproperty. Pierce denied any fraudulent activity and de\u00ad\nfended the validity of J. Howard\u2019s trust and, eventually,\nhis will. 392 F. 3d, at 1122\u20131123, 1125.\n   After J. Howard\u2019s death, Vickie filed a petition for bank\u00ad\nruptcy in the Central District of California. Pierce filed a\ncomplaint in that bankruptcy proceeding, contending that\nVickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell\nmembers of the press that he had engaged in fraud to gain\ncontrol of his father\u2019s assets. 547 U. S., at 300\u2013301; In re\nMarshall, 600 F. 3d 1037, 1043\u20131044 (CA9 2010). The\ncomplaint sought a declaration that Pierce\u2019s defamation\nclaim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceed\u00ad\nings. Ibid.; see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a). Pierce subsequently\nfiled a proof of claim for the defamation action, meaning\nthat he sought to recover damages for it from Vickie\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. See \u00a7501(a). Vickie responded to\nPierce\u2019s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to\nthe alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for\ntortious interference with the gift she expected from J.\n4                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHoward. As she had in state court, Vickie alleged that\nPierce had wrongfully prevented J. Howard from taking\nthe legal steps necessary to provide her with half his\nproperty. 547 U. S., at 301.\n  On November 5, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued\nan order granting Vickie summary judgment on Pierce\u2019s\nclaim for defamation. On September 27, 2000, after a\nbench trial, the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment\non Vickie\u2019s counterclaim in her favor. The court later\nawarded Vickie over $400 million in compensatory dam\u00ad\nages and $25 million in punitive damages. 600 F. 3d, at\n1045; see 253 B. R. 550, 561\u2013562 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.\n2000); 257 B. R. 35, 39\u201340 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal. 2000).\n  In post-trial proceedings, Pierce argued that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counter\u00ad\nclaim. In particular, Pierce renewed a claim he had made\nearlier in the litigation, asserting that the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s authority over the counterclaim was limited be\u00ad\ncause Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was not a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). See 257 B. R., at 39. As\nexplained below, bankruptcy courts may hear and en-\nter final judgments in \u201ccore proceedings\u201d in a bankruptcy\ncase. In non-core proceedings, the bankruptcy courts\ninstead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\nlaw to the district court, for that court\u2019s review and issu\u00ad\nance of final judgment. The Bankruptcy Court in this case\nconcluded that Vickie\u2019s counterclaim was \u201ca core proceed\u00ad\ning\u201d under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), and the court therefore had\nthe \u201cpower to enter judgment\u201d on the counterclaim under\n\u00a7157(b)(1). Id., at 40.\n  The District Court disagreed.         It recognized that\n\u201cVickie\u2019s counterclaim for tortious interference falls within\nthe literal language\u201d of the statute designating certain\nproceedings as \u201ccore,\u201d see \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), but understood\nthis Court\u2019s precedent to \u201csuggest[ ] that it would be un\u00ad\nconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncore.\u201d 264 B. R. 609, 629\u2013630 (CD Cal. 2001) (citing\nNorthern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,\n458 U. S. 50, 79, n. 31 (1982) (plurality opinion)). The\nDistrict Court accordingly concluded that a \u201ccounterclaim\nshould not be characterized as core\u201d when it \u201cis only\nsomewhat related to the claim against which it is asserted,\nand when the unique characteristics and context of the\ncounterclaim place it outside of the normal type of set-off\nor other counterclaims that customarily arise.\u201d 264 B. R.,\nat 632.\n   Because the District Court concluded that Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim was not core, the court determined that it\nwas required to treat the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment as\n\u201cproposed[,] rather than final,\u201d and engage in an \u201cinde\u00ad\npendent review\u201d of the record. Id., at 633; see 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7157(c)(1). Although the Texas state court had by that\ntime conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties\u2019\ndispute and entered a judgment in Pierce\u2019s favor, the\nDistrict Court declined to give that judgment preclusive\neffect and went on to decide the matter itself. 271 B. R.\n858, 862\u2013867 (CD Cal. 2001); see 275 B. R. 5, 56\u201358 (CD\nCal. 2002). Like the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court\nfound that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickie\u2019s\nexpectancy of a gift from J. Howard. The District Court\nawarded Vickie compensatory and punitive damages, each\nin the amount of $44,292,767.33. Id., at 58.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court on a\ndifferent ground, 392 F. 3d, at 1137, and we\u2014in the first\nvisit of the case to this Court\u2014reversed the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals on that issue. 547 U. S., at 314\u2013315. On remand\nfrom this Court, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7157 man\u00ad\ndated \u201ca two-step approach\u201d under which a bankruptcy\njudge may issue a final judgment in a proceeding only\nif the matter both \u201cmeets Congress\u2019 definition of a core\nproceeding and arises under or arises in title 11,\u201d the\nBankruptcy Code. 600 F. 3d, at 1055. The court also\n6                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasoned that allowing a bankruptcy judge to enter final\njudgments on all counterclaims raised in bankruptcy\nproceedings \u201cwould certainly run afoul\u201d of this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Northern Pipeline. 600 F. 3d, at 1057. With\nthose concerns in mind, the court concluded that \u201ca coun\u00ad\nterclaim under \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) is properly a \u2018core\u2019 proceeding\n\u2018arising in a case under\u2019 the [Bankruptcy] Code only if the\ncounterclaim is so closely related to [a creditor\u2019s] proof of\nclaim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary\nto resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim it\u00ad\nself.\u201d Id., at 1058 (internal quotation marks omitted;\nsecond brackets added). The court ruled that Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim did not meet that test. Id., at 1059. That\nholding made \u201cthe Texas probate court\u2019s judgment . . . the\nearliest final judgment entered on matters relevant to this\nproceeding,\u201d and therefore the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat the District Court should have \u201cafford[ed] preclusive\neffect\u201d to the Texas \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of relevant legal\nand factual issues.\u201d Id., at 1064\u20131065.2\n   We again granted certiorari. 561 U.

That provision specifies that core proceed\u00ad\nings include \u201ccounterclaims by the estate against persons\nfiling claims against the estate.\u201d In past cases, we have\nsuggested that a proceeding\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d status alone author\u00ad\nizes a bankruptcy judge, as a statutory matter, to enter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   \u201c(E) orders to turn over property of the estate;\n   \u201c(F) proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover preferences;\n   \u201c(G) motions to terminate, annul, or modify the automatic stay;\n   \u201c(H) proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent convey\u00ad\nances;\n   \u201c(I) determinations as to the dischargeability of particular debts;\n   \u201c(J) objections to discharges;\n   \u201c(K) determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens;\n   \u201c(L) confirmations of plans;\n   \u201c(M) orders approving the use or lease of property, including the use\nof cash collateral;\n   \u201c(N) orders approving the sale of property other than property result\u00ad\ning from claims brought by the estate against persons who have not\nfiled claims against the estate;\n   \u201c(O) other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the\nestate or the adjustment of the debtor-creditor or the equity security\nholder relationship, except personal injury tort or wrongful death\nclaims; and\n   \u201c(P) recognition of foreign proceedings and other matters under\nchapter 15 of title 11.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. 33, 50 (1989) (explaining\nthat Congress had designated certain actions as \u201c \u2018core\nproceedings,\u2019 which bankruptcy judges may adjudicate and\nin which they may issue final judgments, if a district court\nhas referred the matter to them\u201d (citations omitted)). We\nhave not directly addressed the question, however, and\nPierce argues that a bankruptcy judge may enter final\njudgment on a core proceeding only if that proceeding also\n\u201caris[es] in\u201d a Title 11 case or \u201caris[es] under\u201d Title 11\nitself. Brief for Respondent 51 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Section 157(b)(1) authorizes bankruptcy courts to \u201chear\nand determine all cases under title 11 and all core pro\u00ad\nceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under\ntitle 11.\u201d As written, \u00a7157(b)(1) is ambiguous. The \u201caris\u00ad\ning under\u201d and \u201carising in\u201d phrases might, as Pierce sug\u00ad\ngests, be read as referring to a limited category of those\ncore proceedings that are addressed in that section. On\nthe other hand, the phrases might be read as simply de\u00ad\nscribing what core proceedings are: matters arising under\nTitle 11 or in a Title 11 case. In this case the structure\nand context of \u00a7157 contradict Pierce\u2019s interpretation of\n\u00a7157(b)(1).\n   As an initial matter, Pierce\u2019s reading of the statute\nnecessarily assumes that there is a category of core pro\u00ad\nceedings that neither arise under Title 11 nor arise in a\nTitle 11 case. The manner in which the statute delineates\nthe bankruptcy courts\u2019 authority, however, makes plain\nthat no such category exists. Section 157(b)(1) authorizes\nbankruptcy judges to enter final judgments in \u201ccore pro\u00ad\nceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under\ntitle 11.\u201d Section 157(c)(1) instructs bankruptcy judges to\ninstead submit proposed findings in \u201ca proceeding that is\nnot a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a\ncase under title 11.\u201d Nowhere does \u00a7157 specify what\n10                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbankruptcy courts are to do with respect to the category of\nmatters that Pierce posits\u2014core proceedings that do not\narise under Title 11 or in a Title 11 case. To the contrary,\n\u00a7157(b)(3) only instructs a bankruptcy judge to \u201cdeter\u00ad\nmine, on the judge\u2019s own motion or on timely motion of a\nparty, whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under\nthis subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related\nto a case under title 11.\u201d Two options. The statute does\nnot suggest that any other distinctions need be made.\n   Under our reading of the statute, core proceedings are\nthose that arise in a bankruptcy case or under Title 11.\nThe detailed list of core proceedings in \u00a7157(b)(2) pro-\nvides courts with ready examples of such matters. Pierce\u2019s\nreading of \u00a7157, in contrast, supposes that some core pro\u00ad\nceedings will arise in a Title 11 case or under Title 11\nand some will not. Under that reading, the statute pro\u00ad\nvides no guidance on how to tell which are which.\n   We think it significant that Congress failed to provide\nany framework for identifying or adjudicating the asserted\ncategory of core but not \u201carising\u201d proceedings, given the\notherwise detailed provisions governing bankruptcy court\nauthority. It is hard to believe that Congress would go to\nthe trouble of cataloging 16 different types of proceedings\nthat should receive \u201ccore\u201d treatment, but then fail to spec\u00ad\nify how to determine whether those matters arise under\nTitle 11 or in a bankruptcy case if\u2014as Pierce asserts\u2014the\nlatter inquiry is determinative of the bankruptcy court\u2019s\nauthority.\n   Pierce argues that we should treat core matters that\narise neither under Title 11 nor in a Title 11 case as pro\u00ad\nceedings \u201crelated to\u201d a Title 11 case. Brief for Respondent\n60 (internal quotation marks omitted). We think that a\ncontradiction in terms. It does not make sense to describe\na \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceeding as merely \u201crelated to\u201d the\nbankruptcy case; oxymoron is not a typical feature of\ncongressional drafting.

Core proceedings are, at most,\nthose that arise in title 11 cases or arise under title 11\u201d\n(footnote omitted)). And, as already discussed, the statute\nsimply does not provide for a proceeding that is simulta\u00ad\nneously core and yet only related to the bankruptcy case.\nSee \u00a7157(c)(1) (providing only for \u201ca proceeding that is\nnot a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case\nunder title 11\u201d).\n   As we explain in Part III, we agree with Pierce that\ndesignating all counterclaims as \u201ccore\u201d proceedings raises\nserious constitutional concerns. Pierce is also correct that\nwe will, where possible, construe federal statutes so as \u201cto\navoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.\u201d Commod\nity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833,\n841 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).

That we may not do. We agree with\nVickie that \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) permits the bankruptcy court\nto enter a final judgment on her tortious interference\ncounterclaim.\n12                  STERN v. MARSHALL \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n   Pierce argues, as another alternative to reaching the\nconstitutional question, that the Bankruptcy Court lacked\njurisdiction to enter final judgment on his defamation\nclaim. Section 157(b)(5) provides that \u201c[t]he district court\nshall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death\nclaims shall be tried in the district court in which the\nbankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the\ndistrict in which the claim arose.\u201d Pierce asserts that\nhis defamation claim is a \u201cpersonal injury tort,\u201d that the\nBankruptcy Court therefore had no jurisdiction over that\nclaim, and that the court therefore necessarily lacked\njurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim as well. Brief for\nRespondent 65\u201366.\n   Vickie objects to Pierce\u2019s statutory analysis across the\nboard. To begin, Vickie contends that \u00a7157(b)(5) does not\naddress subject matter jurisdiction at all, but simply\nspecifies the venue in which \u201cpersonal injury tort and\nwrongful death claims\u201d should be tried. See Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 16\u201317, 19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (Dep\u00ad\nuty Solicitor General) (Section \u201c157(b)(5) is in [the United\nStates\u2019] view not jurisdictional\u201d). Given the limited scope\nof that provision, Vickie argues, a party may waive or for\u00ad\nfeit any objections under \u00a7157(b)(5), in the same way that\na party may waive or forfeit an objection to the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court finally resolving a non-core claim. Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 17\u201320; see \u00a7157(c)(2) (authorizing the\ndistrict court, \u201cwith the consent of all the parties to the\nproceeding,\u201d to refer a \u201crelated to\u201d matter to the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court for final judgment). Vickie asserts that in\nthis case Pierce consented to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s\nadjudication of his defamation claim, and forfeited any\nargument to the contrary, by failing to seek withdrawal of\nthe claim until he had litigated it before the Bankruptcy\nCourt for 27 months. Id., at 20\u201323. On the merits, Vickie\ncontends that the statutory phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand wrongful death claims\u201d does not include non-physical\ntorts such as defamation. Id., at 25\u201326.\n  We need not determine what constitutes a \u201cpersonal\ninjury tort\u201d in this case because we agree with Vickie that\n\u00a7157(b)(5) is not jurisdictional, and that Pierce consented\nto the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defamation\nclaim.4 Because \u201c[b]randing a rule as going to a court\u2019s\nsubject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of\nour adversarial system,\u201d Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S.\n___, ___\u2013___ (2011) (slip op., at 4\u20135), we are not inclined to\ninterpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when\nthey are not framed as such. See generally Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 516 (2006) (\u201cwhen Congress\ndoes not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as juris\u00ad\ndictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjuris\u00ad\ndictional in character\u201d).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Although Pierce suggests that consideration of \u201cthe 157(b)(5) issue\u201d\n\nwould facilitate an \u201ceasy\u201d resolution of the case, Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\u201348,\nhe is mistaken. Had Pierce preserved his argument under that provi\u00ad\nsion, we would have been confronted with several questions on which\nthere is little consensus or precedent. Those issues include: (1) the\nscope of the phrase \u201cpersonal injury tort\u201d\u2014a question over which there\nis at least a three-way divide, see In re Arnold, 407 B. R. 849, 851\u2013853\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2009); (2) whether, as Vickie argued in the Court of\nAppeals, the requirement that a personal injury tort claim be \u201ctried\u201d in\nthe district court nonetheless permits the bankruptcy court to resolve\nthe claim short of trial, see Appellee\u2019s/Cross-Appellant\u2019s Supplemental\nBrief in No. 02\u201356002 etc. (CA9), p. 24; see also In re Dow Corning\nCorp., 215 B. R. 346, 349\u2013351 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Mich. 1997) (noting\ndivide over whether, and on what grounds, a bankruptcy court may\nresolve a claim pretrial); and (3) even if Pierce\u2019s defamation claim\ncould be considered only by the District Court, whether the Bankruptcy\nCourt might retain jurisdiction over the counterclaim, cf. Arbaugh v.\nY & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (\u201cwhen a court grants a motion\nto dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally\nretains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71367, over pendent state-law claims\u201d). We express no opinion\non any of these issues and simply note that the \u00a7157(b)(5) question is\nnot as straightforward as Pierce would have it.\n14                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 157(b)(5) does not have the hallmarks of a juris\u00ad\ndictional decree. To begin, the statutory text does not\nrefer to either district court or bankruptcy court \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntion,\u201d instead addressing only where personal injury tort\nclaims \u201cshall be tried.\u201d\n   The statutory context also belies Pierce\u2019s jurisdictional\nclaim. Section 157 allocates the authority to enter final\njudgment between the bankruptcy court and the district\ncourt. See \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1), (c)(1). That allocation does not\nimplicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction. See\n\u00a7157(c)(2) (parties may consent to entry of final judgment\nby bankruptcy judge in non-core case).        By the same\ntoken, \u00a7157(b)(5) simply specifies where a particular cate\u00ad\ngory of cases should be tried. Pierce does not explain why\nthat statutory limitation may not be similarly waived.\n   We agree with Vickie that Pierce not only could but did\nconsent to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s resolution of his defa\u00ad\nmation claim. Before the Bankruptcy Court, Vickie ob\u00ad\njected to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defamation, arguing\nthat Pierce\u2019s claim was unenforceable and that Pierce\nshould not receive any amount for it. See 29 Court of\nAppeals Supplemental Excerpts of Record 6031, 6035\n(hereinafter Supplemental Record). Vickie also noted\nthat the Bankruptcy Court could defer ruling on her objec\u00ad\ntion, given the litigation posture of Pierce\u2019s claim before\nthe Bankruptcy Court. See id., at 6031. Vickie\u2019s filing\nprompted Pierce to advise the Bankruptcy Court that \u201c[a]ll\nparties are in agreement that the amount of the contin\u00ad\ngent Proof of Claim filed by [Pierce] shall be determined\nby the adversary proceedings\u201d that had been commenced\nin the Bankruptcy Court. 31 Supplemental Record 6801.\nPierce asserted that Vickie\u2019s objection should be overruled\nor, alternatively, that any ruling on the objection \u201cshould\nbe continued until the resolution of the pending adversary\nproceeding litigation.\u201d Ibid. Pierce identifies no point in\nthe record where he argued to the Bankruptcy Court that\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit lacked the authority to adjudicate his proof of claim be\u00ad\ncause the claim sought recompense for a personal injury tort.\n   Indeed, Pierce apparently did not object to any court\nthat \u00a7157(b)(5) prohibited the Bankruptcy Court from\nresolving his defamation claim until over two years\u2014and\nseveral adverse discovery rulings\u2014after he filed that\nclaim in June 1996. The first filing Pierce cites as rais-\ning that objection is his September 22, 1998 motion to the\nDistrict Court to withdraw the reference of the case to the\nBankruptcy Court. See Brief for Respondent 26\u201327. The\nDistrict Court did initially withdraw the reference as\nrequested, but it then returned the proceeding to the\nBankruptcy Court, observing that Pierce \u201cimplicated the\njurisdiction of that bankruptcy court. He chose to be a\nparty to that litigation.\u201d App. 129. Although Pierce had\nobjected in July 1996 to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s exercise of\njurisdiction over Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, he advised the\ncourt at that time that he was \u201chappy to litigate [his]\nclaim\u201d there. 29 Supplemental Record 6101. Counsel\nstated that even though Pierce thought it was \u201cprobably\ncheaper for th[e] estate if [Pierce\u2019s claim] were sent back\nor joined back with the State Court litigation,\u201d Pierce \u201cdid\nchoose\u201d the Bankruptcy Court forum and \u201cwould be more\nthan pleased to do it [t]here.\u201d Id., at 6101\u20136102; see also\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 266, n. 17 (District Court referring to\nthese statements).\n   Given Pierce\u2019s course of conduct before the Bankruptcy\nCourt, we conclude that he consented to that court\u2019s reso\u00ad\nlution of his defamation claim (and forfeited any argument\nto the contrary). We have recognized \u201cthe value of waiver\nand forfeiture rules\u201d in \u201ccomplex\u201d cases, Exxon Shipping\nCo. v. Baker, 554 U. S. 471, 487\u2013488, n. 6 (2008), and\nthis case is no exception. In such cases, as here, the\nconsequences of \u201ca litigant . . . \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the court\u2014\nremaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising\nthe error only if the case does not conclude in his favor,\u201d\n16                  STERN v.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 5) (some internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014can be\nparticularly severe. If Pierce believed that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court lacked the authority to decide his claim for\ndefamation, then he should have said so\u2014and said so\npromptly. See United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731\n(1993) (\u201c \u2018No procedural principle is more familiar to this\nCourt than that a constitutional right,\u2019 or a right of any\nother sort, \u2018may be forfeited . . . by the failure to make\ntimely assertion of the right before a tribunal having\njurisdiction to determine it\u2019 \u201d (quoting Yakus v. United\nStates, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). Instead, Pierce repeat\u00ad\nedly stated to the Bankruptcy Court that he was happy\nto litigate there. We will not consider his claim to the\ncontrary, now that he is sad.\n                              III\n  Although we conclude that \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) permits the\nBankruptcy Court to enter final judgment on Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim, Article III of the Constitution does not.\n                              A\n   Article III, \u00a71, of the Constitution mandates that \u201c[t]he\njudicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one\nsupreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Con\u00ad\ngress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d The\nsame section provides that the judges of those constitu\u00ad\ntional courts \u201cshall hold their Offices during good Behav\u00ad\niour\u201d and \u201creceive for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ]\n[that] shall not be diminished\u201d during their tenure.\n   As its text and our precedent confirm, Article III is \u201can\ninseparable element of the constitutional system of checks\nand balances\u201d that \u201cboth defines the power and protects\nthe independence of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Northern Pipe\nline, 458 U.

Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). As Hamilton put it,\nquoting Montesquieu, \u201c \u2018there is no liberty if the power of\njudging be not separated from the legislative and execu\u00ad\ntive powers.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 1 Montesquieu, Spirit of\nLaws 181).\n   We have recognized that the three branches are not\nhermetically sealed from one another, see Nixon v. Admin\nistrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 443 (1977), but\nit remains true that Article III imposes some basic limita\u00ad\ntions that the other branches may not transgress. Those\nlimitations serve two related purposes. \u201cSeparation-of\u00ad\npowers principles are intended, in part, to protect each\nbranch of government from incursion by the others. Yet\nthe dynamic between and among the branches is not the\nonly object of the Constitution\u2019s concern.

S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).\n   Article III protects liberty not only through its role in\nimplementing the separation of powers, but also by speci\u00ad\nfying the defining characteristics of Article III judges. The\ncolonists had been subjected to judicial abuses at the hand\nof the Crown, and the Framers knew the main reasons\nwhy: because the King of Great Britain \u201cmade Judges\n18                  STERN v.

The Framers undertook\nin Article III to protect citizens subject to the judicial\npower of the new Federal Government from a repeat of\nthose abuses. By appointing judges to serve without term\nlimits, and restricting the ability of the other branches to\nremove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers\nsought to ensure that each judicial decision would be\nrendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with\nCongress or the Executive, but rather with the \u201c[c]lear\nheads . . . and honest hearts\u201d deemed \u201cessential to good\njudges.\u201d 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed.\n1896).\n  Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system\nof checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judi\u00ad\ncial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal\nGovernment could confer the Government\u2019s \u201cjudicial\nPower\u201d on entities outside Article III. That is why we\nhave long recognized that, in general, Congress may not\n\u201cwithdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which,\nfrom its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,\nor in equity, or admiralty.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v.

In Northern Pipeline, we considered whether bank\u00ad\nruptcy judges serving under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\u2014\nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\nbut lacking the tenure and salary guarantees of Article\nIII\u2014could \u201cconstitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to\ndecide [a] state-law contract claim\u201d against an entity that\nwas not otherwise part of the bankruptcy proceedings.\n458 U. S., at 53, 87, n. 40 (plurality opinion); see id., at\n89\u201392 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). The Court\nconcluded that assignment of such state law claims for\nresolution by those judges \u201cviolates Art. III of the Con\u00ad\nstitution.\u201d Id., at 52, 87 (plurality opinion); id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n  The plurality in Northern Pipeline recognized that\nthere was a category of cases involving \u201cpublic rights\u201d\nthat Congress could constitutionally assign to \u201clegislative\u201d\ncourts for resolution. That opinion concluded that this\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d exception extended \u201conly to matters arising\nbetween\u201d individuals and the Government \u201cin connection\nwith the performance of the constitutional functions of the\nexecutive or legislative departments . . . that historically\ncould have been determined exclusively by those\u201d\nbranches. Id., at 67\u201368 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). A full majority of the Court, while not agreeing on\nthe scope of the exception, concluded that the doctrine did\nnot encompass adjudication of the state law claim at issue\nin that case. Id., at 69\u201372; see id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cNone of the [previous cases\naddressing Article III power] has gone so far as to sanction\nthe type of adjudication to which Marathon will be sub\u00ad\njected . . . .

Id., at 71\u201372, 81\u201386\n(plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cthe bankruptcy court is not an \u2018adjunct\u2019 of\neither the district court or the court of appeals\u201d).\n   After our decision in Northern Pipeline, Congress re\u00ad\nvised the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and\nbankruptcy judges. In the 1984 Act, Congress provided\nthat the judges of the new bankruptcy courts would be\nappointed by the courts of appeals for the circuits in which\ntheir districts are located. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7152(a). And, as we\nhave explained, Congress permitted the newly constituted\nbankruptcy courts to enter final judgments only in \u201ccore\u201d\nproceedings. See supra, at 7\u20138.\n   With respect to such \u201ccore\u201d matters, however, the bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts under the 1984 Act exercise the same pow\u00ad\ners they wielded under the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (1978\nAct), 92 Stat. 2549. As in Northern Pipeline, for example,\nthe newly constituted bankruptcy courts are charged\nunder \u00a7157(b)(2)(C) with resolving \u201c[a]ll matters of fact\nand law in whatever domains of the law to which\u201d a coun\u00ad\nterclaim may lead. 458 U. S., at 91 (Rehnquist, J., concur\u00ad\nring in judgment); see, e.g., 275 B. R., at 50\u201351 (noting\nthat Vickie\u2019s counterclaim required the bankruptcy court\nto determine whether Texas recognized a cause of ac-\ntion for tortious interference with an inter vivos gift\u2014\nsomething the Supreme Court of Texas had yet to do). As\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The dissent is thus wrong in suggesting that less than a full Court\n\nagreed on the points pertinent to this case.

S., at 85\u201386\n(plurality opinion). And, as in Northern Pipeline, the\ndistrict courts review the judgments of the bankruptcy\ncourts in core proceedings only under the usual limited\nappellate standards. That requires marked deference to,\namong other things, the bankruptcy judges\u2019 findings of\nfact. See \u00a7158(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013 (findings of\nfact \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\u201d).\n                              C\n   Vickie and the dissent argue that the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s entry of final judgment on her state common law\ncounterclaim was constitutional, despite the similarities\nbetween the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act and\nthose exercising core jurisdiction under the 1984 Act. We\ndisagree. It is clear that the Bankruptcy Court in this\ncase exercised the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States\u201d in\npurporting to resolve and enter final judgment on a state\ncommon law claim, just as the court did in Northern Pipe\nline. No \u201cpublic right\u201d exception excuses the failure to\ncomply with Article III in doing so, any more than in\nNorthern Pipeline. Vickie argues that this case is different\nbecause the defendant is a creditor in the bankruptcy.\nBut the debtors\u2019 claims in the cases on which she relies\nwere themselves federal claims under bankruptcy law,\nwhich would be completely resolved in the bankruptcy\nprocess of allowing or disallowing claims. Here Vickie\u2019s\nclaim is a state law action independent of the federal\nbankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling\non the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in bankruptcy. Northern\nPipeline and our subsequent decision in Granfinanciera,\n492 U. S. 33, rejected the application of the \u201cpublic rights\u201d\nexception in such cases.\n   Nor can the bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act be\n22                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndismissed as mere adjuncts of Article III courts, any more\nthan could the bankruptcy courts under the 1978 Act. The\njudicial powers the courts exercise in cases such as this\nremain the same, and a court exercising such broad pow\u00ad\ners is no mere adjunct of anyone.\n                               1\n   Vickie\u2019s counterclaim cannot be deemed a matter of\n\u201cpublic right\u201d that can be decided outside the Judicial\nBranch. As explained above, in Northern Pipeline we\nrejected the argument that the public rights doctrine\npermitted a bankruptcy court to adjudicate a state law\nsuit brought by a debtor against a company that had not\nfiled a claim against the estate. See 458 U. S., at 69\u201372\n(plurality opinion); id., at 90\u201391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring\nin judgment). Although our discussion of the public rights\nexception since that time has not been entirely consistent,\nand the exception has been the subject of some debate,\nthis case does not fall within any of the various formula\u00ad\ntions of the concept that appear in this Court\u2019s opinions.\n   We first recognized the category of public rights in Mur\nray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87010\"><a href=\"/opinion/87010/murrays-lessee-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span>\n <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1856). That case involved the Treasury De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s sale of property belonging to a customs collec\u00ad\ntor who had failed to transfer payments to the Federal\nGovernment that he had collected on its behalf. Id., at\n274, 275. The plaintiff, who claimed title to the same land\nthrough a different transfer, objected that the Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s calculation of the deficiency and sale of the\nproperty was void, because it was a judicial act that could\nnot be assigned to the Executive under Article III.

The Court also recognized that \u201c[a]t the\nsame time there are matters, involving public rights,\nwhich may be presented in such form that the judicial\npower is capable of acting on them, and which are suscep\u00ad\ntible of judicial determination, but which congress may or\nmay not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the\nUnited States, as it may deem proper.\u201d Ibid.\n   As an example of such matters, the Court referred to\n\u201c[e]quitable claims to land by the inhabitants of ceded\nterritories\u201d and cited cases in which land issues were\nconclusively resolved by Executive Branch officials. Ibid.\n(citing Foley v.

In those cases \u201cit depends upon\nthe will of congress whether a remedy in the courts shall\nbe allowed at all,\u201d so Congress could limit the extent to\nwhich a judicial forum was available. Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18\nHow., at 284. The challenge in Murray\u2019s Lessee to the\nTreasury Department\u2019s sale of the collector\u2019s land likewise\nfell within the \u201cpublic rights\u201d category of cases, because it\ncould only be brought if the Federal Government chose to\nallow it by waiving sovereign immunity. Id., at 283\u2013284.\nThe point of Murray\u2019s Lessee was simply that Congress\nmay set the terms of adjudicating a suit when the suit\ncould not otherwise proceed at all.\n   Subsequent decisions from this Court contrasted cases\nwithin the reach of the public rights exception\u2014those\narising \u201cbetween the Government and persons subject to\nits authority in connection with the performance of the\nconstitutional functions of the executive or legislative\ndepartments\u201d\u2014and those that were instead matters \u201cof\nprivate right, that is, of the liability of one individual to\nanother under the law as defined.\u201d Crowell v.

In other words, the\nagency in Crowell functioned as a true \u201cadjunct\u201d of the District Court.\nThat is not the case here. See infra, at 34\u201336.\n   Although the dissent suggests that we understate the import of\nCrowell in this regard, the dissent itself recognizes\u2014repeatedly\u2014that\nCrowell by its terms addresses the determination of facts outside\nArticle III. See post, at 4 (Crowell \u201cupheld Congress\u2019 delegation of\nprimary factfinding authority to the agency\u201d); post, at 12 (quoting\nCrowell, 285 U.

In other words, it is\nstill the case that what makes a right \u201cpublic\u201d rather than\nprivate is that the right is integrally related to particular\nfederal government action.

Most signifi\u00ad\ncantly, given that the customer\u2019s reparations claim before\nthe agency and the broker\u2019s counterclaim were competing\nclaims to the same amount, the Court repeatedly empha\u00ad\nsized that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the agency to exer\u00ad\ncise jurisdiction over the broker\u2019s claim, or else \u201cthe\nreparations procedure would have been confounded.\u201d\nId., at 856.\n   The most recent case in which we considered application\nof the public rights exception\u2014and the only case in which\nwe have considered that doctrine in the bankruptcy con\u00ad\ntext since Northern Pipeline\u2014is Granfinanciera, S.

It is not a matter that can be pursued\nonly by grace of the other branches, as in Murray\u2019s Lessee,\n18 How., at 284, or one that \u201chistorically could have been\ndetermined exclusively by\u201d those branches, Northern\nPipeline, supra, at 68 (citing Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279\nU.

It does not \u201cde\u00ad\npend[ ] on the will of congress,\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, supra, at\n284; Congress has nothing to do with it.\n   In addition, Vickie\u2019s claimed right to relief does not flow\nfrom a federal statutory scheme, as in Thomas, 473 U. S.,\nat 584\u2013585, or Atlas Roofing, 430 U. S., at 458. It is not\n\u201ccompletely dependent upon\u201d adjudication of a claim cre\u00ad\nated by federal law, as in Schor, 478 U. S., at 856. And in\ncontrast to the objecting party in Schor, id., at 855\u2013856,\nPierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim\nin the bankruptcy court proceedings.

Our conclusion was that, \u201ceven if one accepts this thesis,\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress could not constitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent\nconveyance action to a non-Article III court. Ibid. Because neither\nparty asks us to reconsider the public rights framework for bankruptcy,\nwe follow the same approach here.\n28                      STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nGranfinanciera, supra, at 59, n. 14 (noting that \u201c[p]arallel\nreasoning [to Schor] is unavailable in the context of bank\u00ad\nruptcy proceedings, because creditors lack an alternative\nforum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their\nclaims\u201d).8\n   Furthermore, the asserted authority to decide Vickie\u2019s\nclaim is not limited to a \u201cparticularized area of the law,\u201d\nas in Crowell, Thomas, and Schor. Northern Pipeline, 458\nU. S., at 85 (plurality opinion). We deal here not with an\nagency but with a court, with substantive jurisdiction\nreaching any area of the corpus juris. See ibid.; id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). This is not a\nsituation in which Congress devised an \u201cexpert and inex\u00ad\npensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact\nwhich are particularly suited to examination and determi\u00ad\nnation by an administrative agency specially assigned to\nthat task.\u201d Crowell, 285 U. S., at 46; see Schor, supra, at\n855\u2013856. The \u201cexperts\u201d in the federal system at resolving\ncommon law counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s are the Article\nIII courts, and it is with those courts that her claim must\nstay.\n   The dissent reads our cases differently, and in particu\u00ad\nlar contends that more recent cases view Northern Pipe\nline as \u201c \u2018establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in\na non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render\nfinal judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional\ncontract action arising under state law, without consent of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Contrary to the claims of the dissent, see post, at 12\u201313, Pierce did\n\nnot have another forum in which to pursue his claim to recover from\nVickie\u2019s pre-bankruptcy assets, rather than take his chances with\nwhatever funds might remain after the Title 11 proceedings. Creditors\nwho possess claims that do not satisfy the requirements for nondis\u00ad\nchargeability under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523 have no choice but to file their\nclaims in bankruptcy proceedings if they want to pursue the claims at\nall. That is why, as we recognized in Granfinanciera, the notion of\n\u201cconsent\u201d does not apply in bankruptcy proceedings as it might in other\ncontexts.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate re\u00ad\nview.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6 (quoting Thomas, supra, at 584). Just\nso: Substitute \u201ctort\u201d for \u201ccontract,\u201d and that statement\ndirectly covers this case.\n  We recognize that there may be instances in which the\ndistinction between public and private rights\u2014at least as\nframed by some of our recent cases\u2014fails to provide con\u00ad\ncrete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular\nagency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive\nregulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is\nso markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the\npublic rights exception in the context of such a regime,\nhowever, we do not in this opinion express any view on\nhow the doctrine might apply in that different context.\n  What is plain here is that this case involves the most\nprototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final,\nbinding judgment by a court with broad substantive juris\u00ad\ndiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action\nneither derives from nor depends upon any agency regula\u00ad\ntory regime. If such an exercise of judicial power may\nnonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply\nby deeming it part of some amorphous \u201cpublic right,\u201d then\nArticle III would be transformed from the guardian of\nindividual liberty and separation of powers we have long\nrecognized into mere wishful thinking.\n                              2\n  Vickie and the dissent next attempt to distinguish\nNorthern Pipeline and Granfinanciera on the ground that\nPierce, unlike the defendants in those cases, had filed a\nproof of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings. Given\nPierce\u2019s participation in those proceedings, Vickie argues,\nthe Bankruptcy Court had the authority to adjudicate her\ncounterclaim under our decisions in Katchen v. Landy, 382\nU. S. 323 (1966), and Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U. S. 42\n(1990) (per curiam).\n30                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not agree. As an initial matter, it is hard to see\nwhy Pierce\u2019s decision to file a claim should make any\ndifference with respect to the characterization of Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim. \u201c \u2018[P]roperty interests are created and de\u00ad\nfined by state law,\u2019 and \u2018[u]nless some federal interest\nrequires a different result, there is no reason why such\ninterests should be analyzed differently simply because an\ninterested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d\nTravelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas\n& Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 451 (2007) (quoting Butner v.\nUnited States, 440 U. S. 48, 55 (1979)). Pierce\u2019s claim for\ndefamation in no way affects the nature of Vickie\u2019s coun\u00ad\nterclaim for tortious interference as one at common law\nthat simply attempts to augment the bankruptcy estate\u2014\nthe very type of claim that we held in Northern Pipeline\nand Granfinanciera must be decided by an Article III court.\n   Contrary to Vickie\u2019s contention, moreover, our decisions\nin Katchen and Langenkamp do not suggest a different\nresult. Katchen permitted a bankruptcy referee acting\nunder the Bankruptcy Acts of 1898 and 1938 (akin to a\nbankruptcy court today) to exercise what was known as\n\u201csummary jurisdiction\u201d over a voidable preference claim\nbrought by the bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who\nhad filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.\nSee 382 U. S., at 325, 327\u2013328. A voidable preference\nclaim asserts that a debtor made a payment to a particu\u00ad\nlar creditor in anticipation of bankruptcy, to in effect\nincrease that creditor\u2019s proportionate share of the estate.\nThe preferred creditor\u2019s claim in bankruptcy can be disal\u00ad\nlowed as a result of the preference, and the amounts paid\nto that creditor can be recovered by the trustee. See id., at\n330; see also 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7502(d), 547(b).\n   Although the creditor in Katchen objected that the\npreference issue should be resolved through a \u201cplenary\nsuit\u201d in an Article III court, this Court concluded that\nsummary adjudication in bankruptcy was appropriate,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           31\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause it was not possible for the referee to rule on the\ncreditor\u2019s proof of claim without first resolving the void\u00ad\nable preference issue. 382 U. S., at 329\u2013330, 332\u2013333, and\nn. 9, 334. There was no question that the bankruptcy\nreferee could decide whether there had been a voidable\npreference in determining whether and to what extent\nto allow the creditor\u2019s claim. Once the referee did that,\n\u201cnothing remains for adjudication in a plenary suit\u201d; such\na suit \u201cwould be a meaningless gesture.\u201d Id., at 334. The\nplenary proceeding the creditor sought could be brought\ninto the bankruptcy court because \u201cthe same issue [arose]\nas part of the process of allowance and disallowance of\nclaims.\u201d Id., at 336.\n  It was in that sense that the Court stated that \u201che who\ninvokes the aid of the bankruptcy court by offering a proof\nof claim and demanding its allowance must abide the\nconsequences of that procedure.\u201d Id., at 333, n. 9. In\nKatchen one of those consequences was resolution of the\npreference issue as part of the process of allowing or disal\u00ad\nlowing claims, and accordingly there was no basis for the\ncreditor to insist that the issue be resolved in an Article\nIII court. See id., at 334. Indeed, the Katchen Court\nexpressly noted that it \u201cintimate[d] no opinion concerning\nwhether\u201d the bankruptcy referee would have had \u201csum\u00ad\nmary jurisdiction to adjudicate a demand by the [bank\u00ad\nruptcy] trustee for affirmative relief, all of the substantial\nfactual and legal bases for which ha[d] not been disposed\nof in passing on objections to the [creditor\u2019s proof of]\nclaim.\u201d Id., at 333, n. 9.\n  Our per curiam opinion in Langenkamp is to the same\neffect. We explained there that a preferential transfer\nclaim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly\nfavored creditor has filed a claim, because then \u201cthe ensu\u00ad\ning preference action by the trustee become[s] integral to\nthe restructuring of the debtor-creditor relationship.\u201d 498\nU. S., at 44. If, in contrast, the creditor has not filed a\n32                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproof of claim, the trustee\u2019s preference action does not\n\u201cbecome[ ] part of the claims-allowance process\u201d subject to\nresolution by the bankruptcy court. Ibid.; see id., at 45.\n   In ruling on Vickie\u2019s counterclaim, the Bankruptcy\nCourt was required to and did make several factual and\nlegal determinations that were not \u201cdisposed of in pass-\ning on objections\u201d to Pierce\u2019s proof of claim for defama-\ntion, which the court had denied almost a year earlier.\nKatchen, supra, at 332, n. 9. There was some overlap\nbetween Vickie\u2019s counterclaim and Pierce\u2019s defamation\nclaim that led the courts below to conclude that the coun\u00ad\nterclaim was compulsory, 600 F. 3d, at 1057, or at least in\nan \u201cattenuated\u201d sense related to Pierce\u2019s claim, 264 B. R.,\nat 631. But there was never any reason to believe that the\nprocess of adjudicating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would neces\u00ad\nsarily resolve Vickie\u2019s counterclaim. See id., at 631, 632\n(explaining that \u201cthe primary facts at issue on Pierce\u2019s\nclaim were the relationship between Vickie and her attor\u00ad\nneys and her knowledge or approval of their statements,\u201d\nand \u201cthe counterclaim raises issues of law entirely dif\u00ad\nferent from those raise[d] on the defamation claim\u201d). The\nUnited States acknowledges the point. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae, p. (I) (question presented\nconcerns authority of a bankruptcy court to enter final\njudgment on a compulsory counterclaim \u201cwhen adjudica\u00ad\ntion of the counterclaim requires resolution of issues that\nare not implicated by the claim against the estate\u201d); id.,\nat 26.\n   The only overlap between the two claims in this case\nwas the question whether Pierce had in fact tortiously\ntaken control of his father\u2019s estate in the manner alleged\nby Vickie in her counterclaim and described in the alleg\u00ad\nedly defamatory statements. From the outset, it was clear\nthat, even assuming the Bankruptcy Court would (as it\ndid) rule in Vickie\u2019s favor on that question, the court could\nnot enter judgment for Vickie unless the court additionally\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nruled on the questions whether Texas recognized tortious\ninterference with an expected gift as a valid cause of\naction, what the elements of that action were, and\nwhether those elements were met in this case. 275 B. R.,\nat 50\u201353. Assuming Texas accepted the elements adopted\nby other jurisdictions, that meant Vickie would need to\nprove, above and beyond Pierce\u2019s tortious interference, (1)\nthe existence of an expectancy of a gift; (2) a reasonable\ncertainty that the expectancy would have been realized\nbut for the interference; and (3) damages. Id., at 51; see\n253 B. R., at 558\u2013561. Also, because Vickie sought puni\u00ad\ntive damages in connection with her counterclaim, the\nBankruptcy Court could not finally dispose of the case in\nVickie\u2019s favor without determining whether to subject\nPierce to the sort of \u201cretribution,\u201d \u201cpunishment[,] and\ndeterrence,\u201d Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U. S., at 492, 504\n(internal quotation marks omitted), those damages are\ndesigned to impose. There thus was never reason to\nbelieve that the process of ruling on Pierce\u2019s proof of\nclaim would necessarily result in the resolution of Vickie\u2019s\ncounterclaim.\n   In both Katchen and Langenkamp, moreover, the trus\u00ad\ntee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of\nrecovery created by federal bankruptcy law. In Langen\nkamp, we noted that \u201cthe trustee instituted adversary\nproceedings under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7547(b) to recover, as avoid\u00ad\nable preferences,\u201d payments respondents received from the\ndebtor before the bankruptcy filings. 498 U. S., at 43; see,\ne.g., \u00a7547(b)(1) (\u201cthe trustee may avoid any transfer of an\ninterest of the debtor in property\u2014(1) to or for the benefit\nof a creditor\u201d). In Katchen, \u201c[t]he Trustee . . . [asserted]\nthat the payments made [to the creditor] were preferences\ninhibited by Section 60a of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d Memo\u00ad\nrandum Opinion (Feb. 8, 1963), Tr. of Record in O. T.\n1965, No. 28, p. 3; see 382 U. S., at 334 (considering im\u00ad\npact of the claims allowance process on \u201caction by the\n34                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntrustee under \u00a760 to recover the preference\u201d); 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a796(b) (1964 ed.)

Vickie\u2019s claim, in\ncontrast, is in no way derived from or dependent upon\nbankruptcy law; it is a state tort action that exists without\nregard to any bankruptcy proceeding.\n   In light of all the foregoing, we disagree with the dissent\nthat there are no \u201crelevant distinction[s]\u201d between Pierce\u2019s\nclaim in this case and the claim at issue in Langenkamp.\nPost, at 14. We see no reason to treat Vickie\u2019s counter\u00ad\nclaim any differently from the fraudulent conveyance\naction in Granfinanciera. 492 U. S., at 56. Granfinanci\nera\u2019s distinction between actions that seek \u201cto augment\nthe bankruptcy estate\u201d and those that seek \u201ca pro rata\nshare of the bankruptcy res,\u201d ibid., reaffirms that Con\u00ad\ngress may not bypass Article III simply because a proceed\u00ad\ning may have some bearing on a bankruptcy case; the\nquestion is whether the action at issue stems from the bank\u00ad\nruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the\nclaims allowance process. Vickie has failed to demon\u00ad\nstrate that her counterclaim falls within one of the \u201clim\u00ad\nited circumstances\u201d covered by the public rights exception,\nparticularly given our conclusion that, \u201ceven with respect\nto matters that arguably fall within the scope of the \u2018public\nrights\u2019 doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Art. III\ncourts.\u201d Northern Pipeline, 458 U.

S., at 84\u201386 (plurality opinion); id., at 91 (Rehnquist,\nJ., concurring in judgment), and our reasoning there holds\ntrue today.\n   To begin, as explained above, it is still the bankruptcy\ncourt itself that exercises the essential attributes of judi\u00ad\ncial power over a matter such as Vickie\u2019s counterclaim.\nSee supra, at 20. The new bankruptcy courts, like the old,\ndo not \u201cma[k]e only specialized, narrowly confined factual\ndeterminations regarding a particularized area of law\u201d\nor engage in \u201cstatutorily channeled factfinding functions.\u201d\nNorthern Pipeline, 458 U. S., at 85 (plurality opinion).\nInstead, bankruptcy courts under the 1984 Act resolve\n\u201c[a]ll matters of fact and law in whatever domains of the\nlaw to which\u201d the parties\u2019 counterclaims might lead. Id.,\nat 91 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment).\n   In addition, whereas the adjunct agency in Crowell v.\nBenson \u201cpossessed only a limited power to issue compensa\u00ad\ntion orders . . . [that] could be enforced only by order of the\ndistrict court,\u201d Northern Pipeline, supra, at 85, a bank\u00ad\nruptcy court resolving a counterclaim under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7157(b)(2)(C) has the power to enter \u201cappropriate orders\nand judgments\u201d\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to\nreview only if a party chooses to appeal, see \u00a7\u00a7157(b)(1),\n158(a)\u2013(b). It is thus no less the case here than it was in\nNorthern Pipeline that \u201c[t]he authority\u2014and the respon\u00ad\nsibility\u2014to make an informed, final determination . . .\nremains with\u201d the bankruptcy judge, not the district court.\n458 U. S., at 81 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Given that authority, a bankruptcy court\ncan no more be deemed a mere \u201cadjunct\u201d of the district\ncourt than a district court can be deemed such an \u201cad\u00ad\njunct\u201d of the court of appeals. We certainly cannot accept\nthe dissent\u2019s notion that judges who have the power to\nenter final, binding orders are the \u201cfunctional[ ]\u201d equiva\u00ad\nlent of \u201claw clerks[ ] and the Judiciary\u2019s administrative\n36                  STERN v.

And even were we wrong in this\nregard, that would only confirm that such judges should\nnot be in the business of entering final judgments in the\nfirst place.\n   It does not affect our analysis that, as Vickie notes,\nbankruptcy judges under the current Act are appointed by\nthe Article III courts, rather than the President. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 59. If\u2014as we have concluded\u2014the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court itself exercises \u201cthe essential attributes of\njudicial power [that] are reserved to Article III courts,\u201d\nSchor, 478 U. S., at 851 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted), it does not matter who appointed the bankruptcy\njudge or authorized the judge to render final judgments in\nsuch proceedings. The constitutional bar remains. See The\nFederalist No. 78, at 471 (\u201cPeriodical appointments, however\nregulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or\nother, be fatal to [a judge\u2019s] necessary independence\u201d).\n                              D\n  Finally, Vickie and her amici predict as a practical\nmatter that restrictions on a bankruptcy court\u2019s ability to\nhear and finally resolve compulsory counterclaims will\ncreate significant delays and impose additional costs on\nthe bankruptcy process. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 34\u2013\n36, 57\u201358; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\u2013\n30. It goes without saying that \u201cthe fact that a given law\nor procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facili\u00ad\ntating functions of government, standing alone, will not\nsave it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\u201d INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944 (1983).\n  In addition, we are not convinced that the practical\nconsequences of such limitations on the authority of bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts to enter final judgments are as significant as\nVickie and the dissent suggest. See post, at 16\u201317. The\ndissent asserts that it is important that counterclaims\nsuch as Vickie\u2019s be resolved \u201cin a bankruptcy court,\u201d and\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

But the framework Congress\nadopted in the 1984 Act already contemplates that certain\nstate law matters in bankruptcy cases will be resolved by\njudges other than those of the bankruptcy courts. Section\n1334(c)(2), for example, requires that bankruptcy courts\nabstain from hearing specified non-core, state law claims\nthat \u201ccan be timely adjudicated[ ] in a State forum of ap\u00ad\npropriate jurisdiction.\u201d Section 1334(c)(1) similarly pro\u00ad\nvides that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing\nany proceeding, including core matters, \u201cin the interest of\ncomity with State courts or respect for State law.\u201d\n   As described above, the current bankruptcy system also\nrequires the district court to review de novo and enter\nfinal judgment on any matters that are \u201crelated to\u201d the\nbankruptcy proceedings, \u00a7157(c)(1), and permits the dis\u00ad\ntrict court to withdraw from the bankruptcy court any\nreferred case, proceeding, or part thereof, \u00a7157(d). Pierce\nhas not argued that the bankruptcy courts \u201care barred\nfrom \u2018hearing\u2019 all counterclaims\u201d or proposing findings of\nfact and conclusions of law on those matters, but rather\nthat it must be the district court that \u201cfinally decide[s]\u201d\nthem. Brief for Respondent 61. We do not think the re\u00ad\nmoval of counterclaims such as Vickie\u2019s from core bank\u00ad\nruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of\nlabor in the current statute; we agree with the United\nStates that the question presented here is a \u201cnarrow\u201d one.\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   If our decision today does not change all that much, then\nwhy the fuss? Is there really a threat to the separation of\npowers where Congress has conferred the judicial power\noutside Article III only over certain counterclaims in\nbankruptcy? The short but emphatic answer is yes. A\nstatute may no more lawfully chip away at the authority\nof the Judicial Branch than it may eliminate it entirely.\n38                   STERN v.

We conclude today that Congress, in one isolated\nrespect, exceeded that limitation in the Bankruptcy Act of\n1984. The Bankruptcy Court below lacked the constitu\u00ad\ntional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law\ncounterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling\non a creditor\u2019s proof of claim. Accordingly, the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

I adhere to\nmy view, however, that\u2014our contrary precedents notwith\nstanding\u2014\u201ca matter of public rights . . . must at a mini\nmum arise between the government and others,\u201d Granfi\nnanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 65 (1989)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The sheer surfeit of factors that the Court was required\nto consider in this case should arouse the suspicion that\nsomething is seriously amiss with our jurisprudence in\nthis area. I count at least seven different reasons given in\nthe Court\u2019s opinion for concluding that an Article III judge\nwas required to adjudicate this lawsuit: that it was one\n\u201cunder state common law\u201d which was \u201cnot a matter that\ncan be pursued only by grace of the other branches,\u201d ante,\nat 27; that it was \u201cnot \u2018completely dependent upon\u2019 adjudi\ncation of a claim created by federal law,\u201d ibid.; that \u201cPierce\ndid not truly consent to resolution of Vickie\u2019s claim in the\nbankruptcy court proceedings,\u201d ibid.; that \u201cthe asserted\nauthority to decide Vickie\u2019s claim is not limited to a \u2018par\nticularized area of the law,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 28; that \u201cthere was\n2                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnever any reason to believe that the process of adjudi\ncating Pierce\u2019s proof of claim would necessarily resolve\nVickie\u2019s counterclaim,\u201d ante, at 32; that the trustee was\nnot \u201casserting a right of recovery created by federal bank\nruptcy law,\u201d ante, at 33; and that the Bankruptcy Judge\n\u201cha[d] the power to enter \u2018appropriate orders and judg\nments\u2019\u2014including final judgments\u2014subject to review only\nif a party chooses to appeal,\u201d ante, at 35.\n   Apart from their sheer numerosity, the more fundamen\ntal flaw in the many tests suggested by our jurisprudence\nis that they have nothing to do with the text or tradition of\nArticle III. For example, Article III gives no indication\nthat state-law claims have preferential entitlement to an\nArticle III judge; nor does it make pertinent the extent to\nwhich the area of the law is \u201cparticularized.\u201d The multi\nfactors relied upon today seem to have entered our juris\nprudence almost randomly.\n   Leaving aside certain adjudications by federal adminis\ntrative agencies, which are governed (for better or worse)\nby our landmark decision in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.\n22 (1932), in my view an Article III judge is required in all\nfederal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established\nhistorical practice to the contrary. For that reason\u2014and\nnot because of some intuitive balancing of benefits and\nharms\u2014I agree that Article III judges are not required in\nthe context of territorial courts, courts-martial, or true\n\u201cpublic rights\u201d cases. See Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v.\nMarathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 71 (1982) (plurality\nopinion). Perhaps historical practice permits non-Article\nIII judges to process claims against the bankruptcy estate,\nsee, e.g., Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not and\nShould Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L. J. 567,\n607\u2013609 (1998); the subject has not been briefed, and so I\nstate no position on the matter. But Vickie points to no\nhistorical practice that authorizes a non-Article III judge\nto adjudicate a counterclaim of the sort at issue here.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

His claim\nasserted that Vickie Marshall had, through her lawyers,\naccused him of trying to prevent her from obtaining money\nthat his father had wanted her to have; that her accusa\u00ad\ntions violated state defamation law; and that she conse\u00ad\nquently owed Pierce Marshall damages. Vickie Marshall\nfiled a compulsory counterclaim in which she asserted that\nPierce Marshall had unlawfully interfered with her hus\u00ad\nband\u2019s efforts to grant her an inter vivos gift and that he\nconsequently owed her damages.\n   The Bankruptcy Court adjudicated the claim and the\ncounterclaim. In doing so, the court followed statutory\nprocedures applicable to \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceedings.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b). And ultimately the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered judgment in favor of Vickie Marshall. The\nquestion before us is whether the Bankruptcy Court pos\u00ad\nsessed jurisdiction to adjudicate Vickie Marshall\u2019s coun\u00ad\nterclaim. I agree with the Court that the bankruptcy\nstatute, \u00a7157(b)(2)(C), authorizes a bankruptcy court to\nadjudicate the counterclaim. But I do not agree with the\n2                   STERN v.

Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.\n50 (1982), and that was subsequently disavowed. At the\nsame time, I fear the Court understates the importance of\na watershed opinion widely thought to demonstrate the\nconstitutional basis for the current authority of adminis\u00ad\ntrative agencies to adjudicate private disputes, namely,\nCrowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22 (1932). And it fails to\nfollow the analysis that this Court more recently has held\napplicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before\nus here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation\nof adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers\nprinciples derived from Article III.

The Court found\nevidence in common law of \u201csummary method[s] for the\nrecovery of debts due to the crown, and especially those\ndue from receivers of the revenues,\u201d 18 How., at 277, and\nit analogized the Government\u2019s summary attachment\nprocess to the kind of self-help remedies available to pri\u00ad\nvate parties, id., at 283. In the course of its opinion, the\nCourt wrote:\n    \u201c[W]e do not consider congress can either withdraw\n    from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its na-\n    ture, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or\n    in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it\n    bring under the judicial power a matter which, from\n    its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.\n    At the same time there are matters, involving public\n    rights, which may be presented in such form that the\n    judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which\n    are susceptible of judicial determination, but which\n    congress may or may not bring within the cognizance\n    of the courts of the United States, as it may deem\n    proper.\u201d Id., at 284.\n  The majority reads the first part of the statement\u2019s first\nsentence as authoritatively defining the boundaries of\nArticle III. Ante, at 18. I would read the statement in a\nless absolute way. For one thing, the statement is in effect\ndictum. For another, it is the remainder of the statement,\nannouncing a distinction between \u201cpublic rights\u201d and\n\u201cprivate rights,\u201d that has had the more lasting impact.\nLater Courts have seized on that distinction when uphold\ning non-Article III adjudication, not when striking it\ndown. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451\u2013452\n4                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1929) (Court of Customs Appeals); Williams v. United\nStates, 289 U. S. 553, 579\u2013580 (1933) (Court of Claims).\nThe one exception is Northern Pipeline, where the Court\nstruck down the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. But in that case\nthere was no majority. And a plurality, not a majority,\nread the statement roughly in the way the Court does\ntoday. See 458 U. S., at 67\u201370.\n                              B\n   At the same time, I believe the majority places insuf\u00ad\nficient weight on Crowell, a seminal case that clarified the\nscope of the dictum in Murray\u2019s Lessee. In that case,\nthe Court considered whether Congress could grant to an\nArticle I administrative agency the power to adjudicate an\nemployee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim against his em\u00ad\nployer. The Court assumed that an Article III court would\nreview the agency\u2019s decision de novo in respect to ques\u00ad\ntions of law but it would conduct a less searching review\n(looking to see only if the agency\u2019s award was \u201csupported\nby evidence in the record\u201d) in respect to questions of fact.\nCrowell, 285 U. S., at 48\u201350. The Court pointed out that\nthe case involved a dispute between private persons (a\nmatter of \u201cprivate rights\u201d) and (with one exception not\nrelevant here) it upheld Congress\u2019 delegation of primary\nfactfinding authority to the agency.\n   Justice Brandeis, dissenting (from a here-irrelvant por\u00ad\ntion of the Court\u2019s holding), wrote that the adjudicatory\nscheme raised only a due process question: When does due\nprocess require decision by an Article III judge? He an\u00ad\nswered that question by finding constitutional the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s delegation of adjudicatory authority to an agency.\nId., at 87.\n   Crowell has been hailed as \u201cthe greatest of the cases\nvalidating administrative adjudication.\u201d Bator, The Con\u00ad\nstitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative\nCourts Under Article III, 65 Ind.

Were\nCrowell\u2019s holding as narrow as the majority suggests,\none could question the validity of Congress\u2019 delegation of\nauthority to adjudicate disputes among private parties to\nother agencies such as the National Labor Relations\nBoard, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the\nSurface Transportation Board, and the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, thereby resurrecting\nimportant legal questions previously thought to have been\ndecided. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7160; 7 U. S. C. \u00a718; 49 U. S. C.\n\u00a710704; 42 U. S. C. \u00a73612(b).\n                             C\n   The majority, in my view, overemphasizes the preceden\u00ad\ntial effect of the plurality opinion in Northern Pipeline.\nAnte, at 19\u201321. There, the Court held unconstitutional the\njurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978\ngranting adjudicatory authority to bankruptcy judges who\nlack the protections of tenure and compensation that\nArticle III provides. Four Members of the Court wrote\nthat Congress could grant adjudicatory authority to a non-\nArticle III judge only where (1) the judge sits on a \u201cterrito\u00ad\nrial cour[t]\u201d (2) the judge conducts a \u201ccourts-martial,\u201d or\n(3) the case involves a \u201cpublic right,\u201d namely, a \u201cmatter\u201d\nthat \u201cat a minimum arise[s] \u2018between the government and\nothers.\u2019 \u201d 458 U. S., at 64\u201370 (plurality opinion) (quoting\nEx parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451). Two other Mem\u00ad\nbers of the Court, without accepting these limitations,\nagreed with the result because the case involved a breach\u00ad\nof-contract claim brought by the bankruptcy trustee on\n6                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbehalf of the bankruptcy estate against a third party who\nwas not part of the bankruptcy proceeding, and none of\nthe Court\u2019s preceding cases (which, the two Members\nwrote, \u201cdo not admit of easy synthesis\u201d) had \u201cgone so far as\nto sanction th[is] type of adjudication.\u201d 458 U. S., at 90\u201391\n(Rehnquist, J. concurring in judgment).\n  Three years later, the Court held that Northern Pipeline\n    \u201cestablishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-\n    Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final\n    judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional\n    contract action arising under state law, without con\u00ad\n    sent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary ap\u00ad\n    pellate review.\u201d Thomas, 473 U. S., at 584.\n                             D\n   Rather than leaning so heavily on the approach taken\nby the plurality in Northern Pipeline, I would look to this\nCourt\u2019s more recent Article III cases Thomas and Schor\u2014\ncases that commanded a clear majority. In both cases\nthe Court took a more pragmatic approach to the constitu\u00ad\ntional question. It sought to determine whether, in the\nparticular instance, the challenged delegation of adjudica\u00ad\ntory authority posed a genuine and serious threat that one\nbranch of Government sought to aggrandize its own con\u00ad\nstitutionally delegated authority by encroaching upon a\nfield of authority that the Constitution assigns exclusively\nto another branch.\n                             1\n   In Thomas, the Court focused directly upon the nature\nof the Article III problem, illustrating how the Court\nshould determine whether a delegation of adjudicatory\nauthority to a non-Article III judge violates the Constitu\u00ad\ntion. The statute in question required pesticide manufac\u00ad\nturers to submit to binding arbitration claims for compen\u00ad\nsation owed for the use by one manufacturer of the data of\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

After\ndescribing Northern Pipeline\u2019s holding in the language I\nhave set forth above, supra, at 6, the Court stated that\n\u201cpractical attention to substance rather than doctrinaire\nreliance on formal categories should inform application of\nArticle III.\u201d Thomas, 473 U. S., at 587 (emphasis added).\nIt indicated that Article III\u2019s requirements could not be\n\u201cdetermined\u201d by \u201cthe identity of the parties alone,\u201d ibid.,\nor by the \u201cprivate rights\u201d/\u201cpublic rights\u201d distinction, id., at\n585\u2013586. And it upheld the arbitration provision of the\nstatute.\n  The Court pointed out that the right in question was\ncreated by a federal statute, it \u201crepresent[s] a pragmatic\nsolution to the difficult problem of spreading [certain]\ncosts,\u201d and the statute \u201cdoes not preclude review of the\narbitration proceeding by an Article III court.\u201d Id., at\n589\u2013592. The Court concluded:\n    \u201cGiven the nature of the right at issue and the con\u00ad\n    cerns motivating the Legislature, we do not think this\n    system threatens the independent role of the Judici\u00ad\n    ary in our constitutional scheme.\u201d Id., at 590.\n                             2\n   Most recently, in Schor, the Court described in greater\ndetail how this Court should analyze this kind of Article\nIII question. The question at issue in Schor involved a\ndelegation of authority to an agency to adjudicate a coun\u00ad\nterclaim. A customer brought before the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) a claim for repara\u00ad\ntions against his commodity futures broker. The customer\nnoted that his brokerage account showed that he owed the\nbroker money, but he said that the broker\u2019s unlawful\nactions had produced that debit balance, and he sought\ndamages. The broker brought a counterclaim seeking the\nmoney that the account showed the customer owed. This\nCourt had to decide whether agency adjudication of such a\n8                   STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncounterclaim is consistent with Article III.\n   In doing so, the Court expressly \u201cdeclined to adopt\nformalistic and unbending rules.\u201d Schor, 478 U. S., at 851.\nRather, it \u201cweighed a number of factors, none of which has\nbeen deemed determinative, with an eye to the practical\neffect that the congressional action will have on the consti\u00ad\ntutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.\u201d Ibid.\nThose relevant factors include (1) \u201cthe origins and im\u00ad\nportance of the right to be adjudicated\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to\nwhich the non-Article III forum exercises the range of ju\u00ad\nrisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III\ncourts\u201d; (3) the extent to which the delegation nonetheless\nreserves judicial power for exercise by Article III courts;\n(4) the presence or \u201cabsence of consent to an initial adjudi\u00ad\ncation before a non-Article III tribunal\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe con\u00ad\ncerns that drove Congress to depart from\u201d adjudication in\nan Article III court. Id., at 849, 851.\n   The Court added that where \u201cprivate rights,\u201d rather\nthan \u201cpublic rights\u201d are involved, the \u201cdanger of encroach\u00ad\ning on the judicial powers\u201d is greater. Id., at 853\u2013854\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while non-\nArticle III adjudication of \u201cprivate rights\u201d is not necessar\u00ad\nily unconstitutional, the Court\u2019s constitutional \u201cexamina\u00ad\ntion\u201d of such a scheme must be more \u201csearching.\u201d Ibid.\n   Applying this analysis, the Court upheld the agency\u2019s\nauthority to adjudicate the counterclaim. The Court con\u00ad\nceded that the adjudication might be of a kind tradi\u00ad\ntionally decided by a court and that the rights at issue\nwere \u201cprivate,\u201d not \u201cpublic.\u201d Id., at 853. But, the Court\nsaid, the CFTC deals only with a \u201c \u2018particularized area of\nlaw\u2019 \u201d; the decision to invoke the CFTC forum is \u201cleft en\u00ad\ntirely to the parties\u201d; Article III courts can review the\nagency\u2019s findings of fact under \u201cthe same \u2018weight of the\nevidence\u2019 standard sustained in Crowell\u201d and review its\n\u201clegal determinations . . . de novo\u201d; and the agency\u2019s \u201ccoun\u00ad\nterclaim jurisdiction\u201d was necessary to make \u201cworkable\u201d a\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

That is to say, we must determine through\nan examination of certain relevant factors whether that\ndelegation constitutes a significant encroachment by the\nLegislative or Executive Branches of Government upon\nthe realm of authority that Article III reserves for exercise\nby the Judicial Branch of Government. Those factors\ninclude (1) the nature of the claim to be adjudicated; (2)\nthe nature of the non-Article III tribunal; (3) the extent to\nwhich Article III courts exercise control over the proceed\u00ad\ning; (4) the presence or absence of the parties\u2019 consent; and\n(5) the nature and importance of the legislative purpose\nserved by the grant of adjudicatory authority to a tribunal\nwith judges who lack Article III\u2019s tenure and compensa\u00ad\ntion protections. The presence of \u201cprivate rights\u201d does not\nautomatically determine the outcome of the question but\nrequires a more \u201csearching\u201d examination of the relevant\nfactors. Schor, supra, at 854.\n   Insofar as the majority would apply more formal stan\u00ad\ndards, it simply disregards recent, controlling precedent.\nThomas, supra, at 587 (\u201c[P]ractical attention to substance\nrather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories\nshould inform application of Article III\u201d); Schor, supra, at\n851 (\u201c[T]he Court has declined to adopt formalistic and\nunbending rules\u201d for deciding Article III cases).\n10                  STERN v. MARSHALL \n\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Applying Schor\u2019s approach here, I conclude that the\ndelegation of adjudicatory authority before us is consti\u00ad\ntutional. A grant of authority to a bankruptcy court\nto adjudicate compulsory counterclaims does not violate\nany constitutional separation-of-powers principle related to\nArticle III.\n   First, I concede that the nature of the claim to be adju\ndicated argues against my conclusion. Vickie Marshall\u2019s\ncounterclaim\u2014a kind of tort suit\u2014resembles \u201ca suit at the\ncommon law.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 18 How., at 284. Although\nnot determinative of the question, see Schor, 478 U. S., at\n853, a delegation of authority to a non-Article III judge to\nadjudicate a claim of that kind poses a heightened risk of\nencroachment on the Federal Judiciary, id., at 854.\n   At the same time the significance of this factor is miti\u00ad\ngated here by the fact that bankruptcy courts often decide\nclaims that similarly resemble various common-law ac\u00ad\ntions. Suppose, for example, that ownership of 40 acres of\nland in the bankruptcy debtor\u2019s possession is disputed by a\ncreditor. If that creditor brings a claim in the bankruptcy\ncourt, resolution of that dispute requires the bankruptcy\ncourt to apply the same state property law that would\ngovern in a state court proceeding. This kind of dispute\narises with regularity in bankruptcy proceedings.\n   Of course, in this instance the state-law question is\nembedded in a debtor\u2019s counterclaim, not a creditor\u2019s\nclaim. But the counterclaim is \u201ccompulsory.\u201d It \u201carises\nout of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject\nmatter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n13(a); Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7013. Thus, resolution of\nthe counterclaim will often turn on facts identical to, or at\nleast related to, those at issue in a creditor\u2019s claim that is\nundisputedly proper for the bankruptcy court to decide.\n   Second, the nature of the non-Article III tribunal argues\nin favor of constitutionality. That is because the tribunal\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis made up of judges who enjoy considerable protection\nfrom improper political influence. Unlike the 1978 Act\nwhich provided for the appointment of bankruptcy judges\nby the President with the advice and consent of the\nSenate, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7152 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), current\nlaw provides that the federal courts of appeals appoint fed\u00ad\neral bankruptcy judges, \u00a7152(a)(1) (2006 ed.). Bankruptcy\njudges are removable by the circuit judicial counsel (made\nup of federal court of appeals and district court judges)\nand only for cause. \u00a7152(e). Their salaries are pegged to\nthose of federal district court judges, \u00a7153(a), and the cost\nof their courthouses and other work-related expenses are\npaid by the Judiciary, \u00a7156. Thus, although Congress\ntechnically exercised its Article I power when it created\nbankruptcy courts, functionally, bankruptcy judges can be\ncompared to magistrate judges, law clerks, and the Judi\u00ad\nciary\u2019s administrative officials, whose lack of Article III\ntenure and compensation protections do not endanger the\nindependence of the Judicial Branch.\n   Third, the control exercised by Article III judges over\nbankruptcy proceedings argues in favor of constitutional\u00ad\nity. Article III judges control and supervise the bank\u00ad\nruptcy court\u2019s determinations\u2014at least to the same degree\nthat Article III judges supervised the agency\u2019s determina\u00ad\ntions in Crowell, if not more so. Any party may appeal\nthose determinations to the federal district court, where\nthe federal judge will review all determinations of fact for\nclear error and will review all determinations of law de\nnovo. Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 8013; 10 Collier on Bank\u00ad\nruptcy \u00b68013.04 (16th ed. 2011). But for the here\u00ad\nirrelevant matter of what Crowell considered to be special\n\u201cconstitutional\u201d facts, the standard of review for factual\nfindings here (\u201cclearly erroneous\u201d) is more stringent than\nthe standard at issue in Crowell (whether the agency\u2019s\nfactfinding was \u201csupported by evidence in the record\u201d).\n285 U. S., at 48; see Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150,\n12                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n152, 153 (1999) (\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence\u201d\nmore deferential than \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted)). And, as Crowell noted, \u201cthere is no\nrequirement that, in order to maintain the essential at\u00ad\ntributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in\nconstitutional courts shall be made by judges.\u201d 285 U. S.,\nat 51.\n   Moreover, in one important respect Article III judges\nmaintain greater control over the bankruptcy court pro\u00ad\nceedings at issue here than they did over the relevant\nproceedings in any of the previous cases in which this\nCourt has upheld a delegation of adjudicatory power. The\nDistrict Court here may \u201cwithdraw, in whole or in part,\nany case or proceeding referred [to the Bankruptcy Court]\n. . . on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for\ncause shown.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(d); cf. Northern Pipeline,\n458 U. S., at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion) (contrasting\npre-1978 law where \u201cpower to withdraw the case from\nthe [bankruptcy] referee\u201d gave district courts \u201ccontrol\u201d\nover case with the unconstitutional 1978 statute, which\nprovided no such district court authority).\n   Fourth, the fact that the parties have consented to Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court jurisdiction argues in favor of constitutional\u00ad\nity, and strongly so. Pierce Marshall, the counterclaim\ndefendant, is not a stranger to the litigation, forced to\nappear in Bankruptcy Court against his will. Cf. id., at 91\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (suit was litigated\nin Bankruptcy Court \u201cover [the defendant\u2019s] objection\u201d).\nRather, he appeared voluntarily in Bankruptcy Court as\none of Vickie Marshall\u2019s creditors, seeking a favorable\nresolution of his claim against Vickie Marshall to the\ndetriment of her other creditors. He need not have filed a\nclaim, perhaps not even at the cost of bringing it in the\nfuture, for he says his claim is \u201cnondischargeable,\u201d in\nwhich case he could have litigated it in a state or federal\ncourt after distribution. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(6). Thus,\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nPierce Marshall likely had \u201can alternative forum to the\nbankruptcy court in which to pursue [his] clai[m].\u201d Gran\nfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 59, n. 14\n(1989).\n   The Court has held, in a highly analogous context, that\nthis type of consent argues strongly in favor of using ordi\u00ad\nnary bankruptcy court proceedings. In Granfinanciera,\nthe Court held that when a bankruptcy trustee seeks to\nvoid a transfer of assets from the debtor to an individual\non the ground that the transfer to that individual consti\u00ad\ntutes an unlawful \u201cpreference,\u201d the question of whether\nthe individual has a right to a jury trial \u201cdepends upon\nwhether the creditor has submitted a claim against the\nestate.\u201d Id., at 58. The following year, in Langenkamp v.\nCulp, 498 U. S. 42 (1990) (per curiam), the Court empha\u00ad\nsized that when the individual files a claim against the\nestate, that individual has\n    \u201ctrigger[ed] the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance\n    of claims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bank\u00ad\n    ruptcy court\u2019s equitable power. If the creditor is met,\n    in turn, with a preference action from the trustee,\n    that action becomes part of the claims-allowance proc\u00ad\n    ess which is triable only in equity. In other words, the\n    creditor\u2019s claim and the ensuing preference action by\n    the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the\n    debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy\n    court\u2019s equity jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 44 (quoting Granfi\n    nanciera, 492 U. S., at 58; citations omitted).\nAs we have recognized, the jury trial question and the\nArticle III question are highly analogous. See id., at 52\u2013\n53. And to that extent, Granfinanciera\u2019s and Langen\nkamp\u2019s basic reasoning and conclusion apply here: Even\nwhen private rights are at issue, non-Article III adjudica\u00ad\ntion may be appropriate when both parties consent. Cf.\nNorthern Pipeline, supra, at 80, n. 31 (plurality opinion)\n14                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(noting the importance of consent to bankruptcy juris\u00ad\ndiction). See also Schor, 478 U. S., at 849 (\u201c[A]bsence of\nconsent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III\ntribunal was relied on [in Northern Pipeline] as a signifi\u00ad\ncant factor in determining that Article III forbade such\nadjudication\u201d). The majority argues that Pierce Marshall\n\u201cdid not truly consent\u201d to bankruptcy jurisdiction, ante, at\n27\u201328, but filing a proof of claim was sufficient in Lan\ngenkamp and Granfinanciera, and there is no relevant\ndistinction between the claims filed in those cases and the\nclaim filed here.\n   Fifth, the nature and importance of the legislative pur\npose served by the grant of adjudicatory authority to\nbankruptcy tribunals argues strongly in favor of constitu\u00ad\ntionality. Congress\u2019 delegation of adjudicatory powers\nover counterclaims asserted against bankruptcy claimants\nconstitutes an important means of securing a constitu\u00ad\ntionally authorized end. Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution\nexplicitly grants Congress the \u201cPower To . . . establish . . .\nuniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout\nthe United States.\u201d James Madison wrote in the Federal\u00ad\nist Papers that the\n     \u201cpower of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is\n     so intimately connected with the regulation of com\u00ad\n     merce, and will prevent so many frauds where the\n     parties or their property may lie or be removed into\n     different States, that the expediency of it seems not\n     likely to be drawn into question.\u201d The Federalist No.\n     42, p. 271 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\n  Congress established the first Bankruptcy Act in 1800.\n2 Stat. 19. From the beginning, the \u201ccore\u201d of federal bank\u00ad\nruptcy proceedings has been \u201cthe restructuring of debtor\u00ad\ncreditor relations.\u201d Northern Pipeline, supra, at 71 (plu\u00ad\nrality opinion). And, to be effective, a single tribunal must\nhave broad authority to restructure those relations, \u201chav\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought\nbefore them,\u201d \u201cdecid[ing] all matters in dispute,\u201d and\n\u201cdecree[ing] complete relief.\u201d Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S.\n323, 335 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The restructuring process requires a creditor to file a\nproof of claim in the bankruptcy court. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7501;\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3002(a). In doing so, the creditor\n\u201ctriggers the process of \u2018allowance and disallowance of\nclaims,\u2019 thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s equitable power.\u201d Langenkamp, supra, at 44 (quot\u00ad\ning Granfinanciera, supra, at 58). By filing a proof of\nclaim, the creditor agrees to the bankruptcy court\u2019s resolu\u00ad\ntion of that claim, and if the creditor wins, the creditor will\nreceive a share of the distribution of the bankruptcy es\u00ad\ntate. When the bankruptcy estate has a related claim\nagainst that creditor, that counterclaim may offset the\ncreditor\u2019s claim, or even yield additional damages that\naugment the estate and may be distributed to the other\ncreditors.\n   The consequent importance to the total bankruptcy\nscheme of permitting the trustee in bankruptcy to assert\ncounterclaims against claimants, and resolving those\ncounterclaims in a bankruptcy court, is reflected in the\nfact that Congress included \u201ccounterclaims by the estate\nagainst persons filing claims against the estate\u201d on its list\nof \u201c[c]ore proceedings.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7157(b)(2)(C). And it\nexplains the difference, reflected in this Court\u2019s opinions,\nbetween a claimant\u2019s and a nonclaimant\u2019s constitutional\nright to a jury trial. Compare Granfinanciera, supra, at\n58\u201359 (\u201cBecause petitioners . . . have not filed claims\nagainst the estate\u201d they retain \u201ctheir Seventh Amendment\nright to a trial by jury\u201d), with Langenkamp, supra, at 45\n(\u201cRespondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate\u201d\nand \u201c[c]onsequently, they were not entitled to a jury\ntrial\u201d).\n   Consequently a bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of\n16                  STERN v. MARSHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsuch matters has more than \u201csome bearing on a bank\u00ad\nruptcy case.\u201d Ante, at 34 (emphasis deleted). It plays a\ncritical role in Congress\u2019 constitutionally based effort to\ncreate an efficient, effective federal bankruptcy system.\nAt the least, that is what Congress concluded. We owe\ndeference to that determination, which shows the absence\nof any legislative or executive motive, intent, purpose, or\ndesire to encroach upon areas that Article III reserves\nto judges to whom it grants tenure and compensation\nprotections.\n  Considering these factors together, I conclude that, as in\nSchor, \u201cthe magnitude of any intrusion on the Judicial\nBranch can only be termed de minimis.\u201d 478 U. S., at 856.\nI would similarly find the statute before us constitutional.\n                              III\n  The majority predicts that as a \u201cpractical matter\u201d to\u00ad\nday\u2019s decision \u201cdoes not change all that much.\u201d Ante, at\n36\u201337. But I doubt that is so. Consider a typical case:\nA tenant files for bankruptcy. The landlord files a claim\nfor unpaid rent. The tenant asserts a counterclaim for\ndamages suffered by the landlord\u2019s (1) failing to fulfill his\nobligations as lessor, and (2) improperly recovering pos\u00ad\nsession of the premises by misrepresenting the facts in\nhousing court. (These are close to the facts presented in\nIn re Beugen, 81 B. R. 994 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Cal. 1988).)\nThis state-law counterclaim does not \u201cste[m] from the\nbankruptcy itself,\u201d ante, at 34, it would not \u201cnecessarily be\nresolved in the claims allowance process,\u201d ibid., and it\nwould require the debtor to prove damages suffered by the\nlessor\u2019s failures, the extent to which the landlord\u2019s repre\u00ad\nsentations to the housing court were untrue, and damages\nsuffered by improper recovery of possession of the prem\u00ad\nises, cf. ante, at 33-33. Thus, under the majority\u2019s holding,\nthe federal district judge, not the bankruptcy judge, would\nhave to hear and resolve the counterclaim.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Why is that a problem? Because these types of disputes\narise in bankruptcy court with some frequency. See, e.g.,\nIn re CBI Holding Co., 529 F. 3d 432 (CA2 2008) (state\u00ad\nlaw claims and counterclaims); In re Winstar Communica\ntions, Inc., 348 B. R. 234 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2005) (same);\nIn re Ascher, 128 B. R. 639 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1991)\n(same); In re Sun West Distributors, Inc., 69 B. R. 861\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Cal. 1987) (same). Because the volume of\nbankruptcy cases is staggering, involving almost 1.6 mil\u00ad\nlion filings last year, compared to a federal district court\ndocket of around 280,000 civil cases and 78,000 criminal\ncases. Administrative Office of the United States Courts,\nJ. Duff, Judicial Business of the United States Courts:\nAnnual Report of the Director 14 (2010). Because unlike\nthe \u201crelated\u201d non-core state law claims that bankruptcy\ncourts must abstain from hearing, see ante, at 36, compul\u00ad\nsory counterclaims involve the same factual disputes as\nthe claims that may be finally adjudicated by the bank\u00ad\nruptcy courts. Because under these circumstances, a\nconstitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong\nbetween courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost,\ndelay, and needless additional suffering among those faced\nwith bankruptcy.\n   For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
