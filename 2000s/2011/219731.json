JUVENILE MALE\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 09–940    Decided June 27, 2011\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  The Court of Appeals in this case held that the require\nments of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification\nAct (SORNA), 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq., violate the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 3,\nwhen applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before\nSORNA’s enactment. We conclude that the Court of Ap\npeals had no authority to enter that judgment because it\nhad no live controversy before it.\n                               I\n   Respondent Juvenile Male was 13 years old when he\nbegan sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy on the Fort\nBelknap Indian Reservation in Montana. The abuse\ncontinued for approximately two years, until respondent\nwas 15 and his victim 12. In 2005, respondent was\ncharged in the District of Montana with delinquency\nunder the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U. S. C.\n§5031 et seq. Respondent pleaded “true” to charges that\nhe knowingly engaged in sexual acts with a child under\n12, which would have been a federal crime had respondent\nbeen an adult. See §§2241(c), 1153(a). The court sen\ntenced respondent to two years of juvenile detention,\nfollowed by juvenile supervision until his 21st birthday.\nRespondent was to spend the first six months of his post\nconfinement supervision in a prerelease center. See\nUnited States v. Juvenile Male, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 1).\n   In 2006, while respondent remained in juvenile deten\n2              UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ntion, Congress enacted SORNA. 120 Stat. 590. Under\nSORNA, a sex offender must “register, and keep the re\ngistration current, in each jurisdiction” where the offen\nder resides, is employed, or attends school. 42 U. S. C.\n§16913(a). This registration requirement extends to cer\ntain juveniles adjudicated as delinquent for serious sex\noffenses. §16911(8). In addition, an interim rule issued by\nthe Attorney General mandates that SORNA’s require\nments apply retroactively to sex offenders convicted before\nthe statute’s enactment. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codi\nfied at 28 CFR pt. 72 (2010)); see 42 U. S. C. §16913(d).1\n   In July 2007, the District Court determined that re\nspondent had failed to comply with the requirements of\nhis prerelease program. The court revoked respondent’s\njuvenile supervision, imposed an additional 6-month term\nof detention, and ordered that the detention be followed by\nsupervision until respondent’s 21st birthday. 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1–2). At the Government’s urging, and\nover respondent’s objection, the court also imposed a\n“special conditio[n]” of supervision requiring respondent to\nregister and keep current as a sex offender. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Pet.\nfor Cert. 9 (noting the Government’s argument in the\nDistrict Court that respondent should be required to regis\nter under SORNA “ ‘at least until’ ” his release from juve\nnile supervision on his 21st birthday).\n   On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged\nthis “special conditio[n]” of supervision.

Then, in May 2008, with his appeal still\npending in the Ninth Circuit, respondent turned 21, and\nthe juvenile-supervision order requiring him to register as\na sex offender expired. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\n  Over a year after respondent’s 21st birthday, the Court\nof Appeals handed down its decision. 581 F. 3d 977 (CA9\n2009), amended, 590 F. 3d 924 (2010). No party had\nraised any issue of mootness in the Ninth Circuit, and the\nCourt of Appeals did not address the issue sua sponte.\nThe court’s opinion discussed only the merits and con\ncluded that applying SORNA to juvenile delinquents who\ncommitted their offenses “before SORNA’s passage vio\nlates the Ex Post Facto Clause.” Id., at 927. On that\nbasis, the court vacated the District Court’s condition of\nsupervision requiring sex-offender registration and report\ning. Id., at 942. The United States petitioned for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n  While that petition was pending, this Court entered a\nper curiam opinion in this case certifying a preliminary\nquestion of Montana law to the Montana Supreme Court.\n560 U. S. ___ (2010). The opinion noted that a “threshold\nissue of mootness” might prevent us from reviewing the\ndecision below on the merits. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\nWe explained that, because respondent is “no longer . . .\nsubject” to the District Court’s “sex-offender-registration\nconditions,” respondent must “show that a decision invali\ndating” those conditions “would be sufficiently likely to\nredress ‘collateral consequences adequate to meet Article\nIII’s injury-in-fact requirement.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n2–3) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998)).\nWe noted that by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s decision,\n“respondent had become registered as a sex offender in\n4             UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nMontana.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Thus, “[p]erhaps the most likely\npotential ‘collateral consequenc[e]’ that might be remedied\nby a judgment in respondent’s favor is the requirement\nthat respondent remain registered as a sex offender under\nMontana law.” Ibid. In order to ascertain whether a\ndecision invalidating the District Court’s registration\nconditions would enable respondent to remove his name\nfrom the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certi\nfied the following question to the Montana Supreme\nCourt:\n    “Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex\n    offender under Montana law contingent upon the\n    validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal\n    juvenile-supervision order that required him to regis\n    ter as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent\n    requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by\n    the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile\n    supervision conditions?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n    (citations omitted).\n   The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our\ncertified question.

Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]hroughout the\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Conti\nnental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477 (1990)).\n   In criminal cases, this requirement means that a defen\ndant wishing to continue his appeals after the expiration\nof his sentence must suffer some “continuing injury” or\n“collateral consequence” sufficient to satisfy Article III.\nSee Spencer, 523 U. S., at 7–8. When the defendant chal\nlenges his underlying conviction, this Court’s cases have\nlong presumed the existence of collateral consequences.\nId., at 8; see Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56\n(1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired\nsentence, no such presumption applies, and the defendant\nmust bear the burden of identifying some ongoing “collat\neral consequenc[e]” that is “traceable” to the challenged\nportion of the sentence and “likely to be redressed by a\nfavorable judicial decision.” See Spencer, supra, at 7, 14.\n   At the time of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in this case,\nthe District Court’s order of juvenile supervision had\nexpired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex\noffender-registration conditions that he sought to chal\nlenge on appeal. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As a\nresult, respondent’s challenge was moot before the Ninth\nCircuit unless he could “show that a decision invalidating”\nthe District Court’s order would likely redress some collat\neral consequence of the registration conditions. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2–3) (citing Spencer, supra, at 14).\n   As we noted in our prior opinion, one “potential collat\neral consequence that might be remedied” by an order\ninvalidating the registration conditions “is the require\nment that respondent remain registered” under Montana\nlaw. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Su\npreme Court has now clarified, respondent’s “state law\n6               UNITED STATES v.

True, a\nfavorable decision in this case might serve as a useful\nprecedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit chal\nlenging Montana’s registration requirement on ex post\nfacto grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a\nfuture lawsuit cannot save this case from mootness. See\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n16); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Board of\nTrade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner,\nJ.) (“[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a\ndecision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .\ncontrol the outcome of another suit. But if that were\nenough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot”).\n  Respondent also argues that this case “cannot be con\nsidered moot in any practical sense” because, under cur\nrent law, respondent may have “an independent duty to\nregister as a sex offender” under SORNA itself. Brief in\nOpposition 6.2 But the duty to register under SORNA is\nnot a consequence—collateral or otherwise—of the District\nCourt’s special conditions of supervision. The statutory\nduty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that\nexists “independent” of those conditions. That continuing\nobligation might provide grounds for a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to SORNA’s registration requirements. It does\nnot, however, render the current controversy regarding\nthe validity of respondent’s sentence any less moot.\n  Respondent further argues that this case falls within\n——————\n  2 See 42 U. S. C. §16911(8) (SORNA applicable if the juvenile was “14\n\nyears of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudi\ncated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse\n(as described in section 2241 of title 18)”); 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at\n28 CFR pt. 72) (SORNA’s requirements extend to sex offenders con\nvicted before the statute’s enactment).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148–149\n(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies\nonly where “(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration\ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira\ntion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subject to the same\naction again.” Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot\nsatisfy the second of these requirements. He has now\nturned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order\nimposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,\ne.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu\nriam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness\nthus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked\nthe authority under Article III to decide this case on the\nmerits.\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case\nis remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit\nfor that court’s consideration of mootness in the first\ninstance.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>", "id": 219731, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/06/27/United_States_v._Juvenile_Male.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 7–8. When the defendant chal\nlenges his underlying conviction, this Court’s cases have\nlong presumed the existence of collateral consequences.\nId., at 8; see Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56\n(1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired\nsentence, no such presumption applies, and the defendant\nmust bear the burden of identifying some ongoing “collat\neral consequenc[e]” that is “traceable” to the challenged\nportion of the sentence and “likely to be redressed by a\nfavorable judicial decision.” See Spencer, supra, at 7, 14.\n   At the time of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in this case,\nthe District Court’s order of juvenile supervision had\nexpired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex\noffender-registration conditions that he sought to chal\nlenge on appeal. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As a\nresult, respondent’s challenge was moot before the Ninth\nCircuit unless he could “show that a decision invalidating”\nthe District Court’s order would likely redress some collat\neral consequence of the registration conditions. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2–3) (citing Spencer, supra, at 14).\n   As we noted in our prior opinion, one “potential collat\neral consequence that might be remedied” by an order\ninvalidating the registration conditions “is the require\nment that respondent remain registered” under Montana\nlaw. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Su\npreme Court has now clarified, respondent’s “state law\n6               UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nduty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contin\ngent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal\nsupervision order,” 2011 WL 2162807, *1, and continues to\napply regardless of the outcome in this case. True, a\nfavorable decision in this case might serve as a useful\nprecedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit chal\nlenging Montana’s registration requirement on ex post\nfacto grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a\nfuture lawsuit cannot save this case from mootness. See\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n16); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Board of\nTrade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner,\nJ.) (“[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a\ndecision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .\ncontrol the outcome of another suit. But if that were\nenough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot”).\n  Respondent also argues that this case “cannot be con\nsidered moot in any practical sense” because, under cur\nrent law, respondent may have “an independent duty to\nregister as a sex offender” under SORNA itself. Brief in\nOpposition 6.2 But the duty to register under SORNA is\nnot a consequence—collateral or otherwise—of the District\nCourt’s special conditions of supervision. The statutory\nduty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that\nexists “independent” of those conditions. That continuing\nobligation might provide grounds for a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to SORNA’s registration requirements. It does\nnot, however, render the current controversy regarding\nthe validity of respondent’s sentence any less moot.\n  Respondent further argues that this case falls within\n——————\n  2 See 42 U. S. C. §16911(8) (SORNA applicable if the juvenile was “14\n\nyears of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudi\ncated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse\n(as described in section 2241 of title 18)”); 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at\n28 CFR pt. 72) (SORNA’s requirements extend to sex offenders con\nvicted before the statute’s enactment).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthe established exception to mootness for disputes that are\n“ ‘capable of repetition, yet evading review.’ ” Id., at 8\n(quoting Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148–149\n(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies\nonly where “(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration\ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira\ntion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subject to the same\naction again.” Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot\nsatisfy the second of these requirements. He has now\nturned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order\nimposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,\ne.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu\nriam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness\nthus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked\nthe authority under Article III to decide this case on the\nmerits.\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case\nis remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit\nfor that court’s consideration of mootness in the first\ninstance.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/219731/", "sha1": "166bdd68c41a14562c1d55b28ed08563ef14a836", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-27T07:12:10"}
