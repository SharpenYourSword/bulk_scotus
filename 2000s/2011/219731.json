JUVENILE MALE\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 09\u2013940    Decided June 27, 2011\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  The Court of Appeals in this case held that the require\nments of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification\nAct (SORNA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a716901 et seq., violate the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3,\nwhen applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before\nSORNA\u2019s enactment. We conclude that the Court of Ap\npeals had no authority to enter that judgment because it\nhad no live controversy before it.\n                               I\n   Respondent Juvenile Male was 13 years old when he\nbegan sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy on the Fort\nBelknap Indian Reservation in Montana. The abuse\ncontinued for approximately two years, until respondent\nwas 15 and his victim 12. In 2005, respondent was\ncharged in the District of Montana with delinquency\nunder the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a75031 et seq. Respondent pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to charges that\nhe knowingly engaged in sexual acts with a child under\n12, which would have been a federal crime had respondent\nbeen an adult. See \u00a7\u00a72241(c), 1153(a). The court sen\ntenced respondent to two years of juvenile detention,\nfollowed by juvenile supervision until his 21st birthday.\nRespondent was to spend the first six months of his post\nconfinement supervision in a prerelease center. See\nUnited States v. Juvenile Male, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 1).\n   In 2006, while respondent remained in juvenile deten\n2              UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\ntion, Congress enacted SORNA. 120 Stat. 590. Under\nSORNA, a sex offender must \u201cregister, and keep the re\ngistration current, in each jurisdiction\u201d where the offen\nder resides, is employed, or attends school. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716913(a). This registration requirement extends to cer\ntain juveniles adjudicated as delinquent for serious sex\noffenses. \u00a716911(8). In addition, an interim rule issued by\nthe Attorney General mandates that SORNA\u2019s require\nments apply retroactively to sex offenders convicted before\nthe statute\u2019s enactment. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codi\nfied at 28 CFR pt. 72 (2010)); see 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(d).1\n   In July 2007, the District Court determined that re\nspondent had failed to comply with the requirements of\nhis prerelease program. The court revoked respondent\u2019s\njuvenile supervision, imposed an additional 6-month term\nof detention, and ordered that the detention be followed by\nsupervision until respondent\u2019s 21st birthday. 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1\u20132). At the Government\u2019s urging, and\nover respondent\u2019s objection, the court also imposed a\n\u201cspecial conditio[n]\u201d of supervision requiring respondent to\nregister and keep current as a sex offender. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Pet.\nfor Cert. 9 (noting the Government\u2019s argument in the\nDistrict Court that respondent should be required to regis\nter under SORNA \u201c \u2018at least until\u2019 \u201d his release from juve\nnile supervision on his 21st birthday).\n   On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged\nthis \u201cspecial conditio[n]\u201d of supervision.

Then, in May 2008, with his appeal still\npending in the Ninth Circuit, respondent turned 21, and\nthe juvenile-supervision order requiring him to register as\na sex offender expired. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\n  Over a year after respondent\u2019s 21st birthday, the Court\nof Appeals handed down its decision. 581 F. 3d 977 (CA9\n2009), amended, 590 F. 3d 924 (2010). No party had\nraised any issue of mootness in the Ninth Circuit, and the\nCourt of Appeals did not address the issue sua sponte.\nThe court\u2019s opinion discussed only the merits and con\ncluded that applying SORNA to juvenile delinquents who\ncommitted their offenses \u201cbefore SORNA\u2019s passage vio\nlates the Ex Post Facto Clause.\u201d Id., at 927. On that\nbasis, the court vacated the District Court\u2019s condition of\nsupervision requiring sex-offender registration and report\ning. Id., at 942. The United States petitioned for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n  While that petition was pending, this Court entered a\nper curiam opinion in this case certifying a preliminary\nquestion of Montana law to the Montana Supreme Court.\n560 U. S. ___ (2010). The opinion noted that a \u201cthreshold\nissue of mootness\u201d might prevent us from reviewing the\ndecision below on the merits. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\nWe explained that, because respondent is \u201cno longer . . .\nsubject\u201d to the District Court\u2019s \u201csex-offender-registration\nconditions,\u201d respondent must \u201cshow that a decision invali\ndating\u201d those conditions \u201cwould be sufficiently likely to\nredress \u2018collateral consequences adequate to meet Article\nIII\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n2\u20133) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998)).\nWe noted that by the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision,\n\u201crespondent had become registered as a sex offender in\n4             UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nMontana.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[p]erhaps the most likely\npotential \u2018collateral consequenc[e]\u2019 that might be remedied\nby a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor is the requirement\nthat respondent remain registered as a sex offender under\nMontana law.\u201d Ibid. In order to ascertain whether a\ndecision invalidating the District Court\u2019s registration\nconditions would enable respondent to remove his name\nfrom the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certi\nfied the following question to the Montana Supreme\nCourt:\n    \u201cIs respondent\u2019s duty to remain registered as a sex\n    offender under Montana law contingent upon the\n    validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal\n    juvenile-supervision order that required him to regis\n    ter as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent\n    requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by\n    the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile\n    supervision conditions?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n    (citations omitted).\n   The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our\ncertified question. See United States v. Juvenile Male, ___\nP. 3d ___, 2011 WL 2162807 (2011). Its answer is that\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cstate law duty to remain registered as a sex\noffender is not contingent upon the validity of the condi\ntions of his federal supervision order, but is an independ\nent requirement of Montana law.\u201d Id., at ___, 2011 WL\n2162807,*1.\n                                II\n   It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable case\nor controversy must remain \u201cextant at all stages of review,\nnot merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d Arizonans\nfor Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]hroughout the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlitigation,\u201d the party seeking relief \u201c \u2018must have suffered,\nor be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the de\nfendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\ndecision.\u2019 \u201d Spencer, supra, at 7 (quoting Lewis v. Conti\nnental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477 (1990)).\n   In criminal cases, this requirement means that a defen\ndant wishing to continue his appeals after the expiration\nof his sentence must suffer some \u201ccontinuing injury\u201d or\n\u201ccollateral consequence\u201d sufficient to satisfy Article III.\nSee Spencer, 523 U. S., at 7\u20138. When the defendant chal\nlenges his underlying conviction, this Court\u2019s cases have\nlong presumed the existence of collateral consequences.\nId., at 8; see Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55\u201356\n(1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired\nsentence, no such presumption applies, and the defendant\nmust bear the burden of identifying some ongoing \u201ccollat\neral consequenc[e]\u201d that is \u201ctraceable\u201d to the challenged\nportion of the sentence and \u201clikely to be redressed by a\nfavorable judicial decision.\u201d See Spencer, supra, at 7, 14.\n   At the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case,\nthe District Court\u2019s order of juvenile supervision had\nexpired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex\noffender-registration conditions that he sought to chal\nlenge on appeal. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As a\nresult, respondent\u2019s challenge was moot before the Ninth\nCircuit unless he could \u201cshow that a decision invalidating\u201d\nthe District Court\u2019s order would likely redress some collat\neral consequence of the registration conditions. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2\u20133) (citing Spencer, supra, at 14).\n   As we noted in our prior opinion, one \u201cpotential collat\neral consequence that might be remedied\u201d by an order\ninvalidating the registration conditions \u201cis the require\nment that respondent remain registered\u201d under Montana\nlaw. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Su\npreme Court has now clarified, respondent\u2019s \u201cstate law\n6               UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nduty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contin\ngent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal\nsupervision order,\u201d 2011 WL 2162807, *1, and continues to\napply regardless of the outcome in this case. True, a\nfavorable decision in this case might serve as a useful\nprecedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit chal\nlenging Montana\u2019s registration requirement on ex post\nfacto grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a\nfuture lawsuit cannot save this case from mootness. See\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n16); Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Board of\nTrade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner,\nJ.) (\u201c[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a\ndecision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .\ncontrol the outcome of another suit. But if that were\nenough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot\u201d).\n  Respondent also argues that this case \u201ccannot be con\nsidered moot in any practical sense\u201d because, under cur\nrent law, respondent may have \u201can independent duty to\nregister as a sex offender\u201d under SORNA itself. Brief in\nOpposition 6.2 But the duty to register under SORNA is\nnot a consequence\u2014collateral or otherwise\u2014of the District\nCourt\u2019s special conditions of supervision. The statutory\nduty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that\nexists \u201cindependent\u201d of those conditions. That continuing\nobligation might provide grounds for a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. It does\nnot, however, render the current controversy regarding\nthe validity of respondent\u2019s sentence any less moot.\n  Respondent further argues that this case falls within\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See 42 U. S. C. \u00a716911(8) (SORNA applicable if the juvenile was \u201c14\n\nyears of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudi\ncated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse\n(as described in section 2241 of title 18)\u201d); 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at\n28 CFR pt. 72) (SORNA\u2019s requirements extend to sex offenders con\nvicted before the statute\u2019s enactment).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthe established exception to mootness for disputes that are\n\u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 8\n(quoting Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148\u2013149\n(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies\nonly where \u201c(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration\ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira\ntion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subject to the same\naction again.\u201d Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot\nsatisfy the second of these requirements. He has now\nturned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order\nimposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,\ne.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu\nriam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness\nthus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked\nthe authority under Article III to decide this case on the\nmerits.\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case\nis remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit\nfor that court\u2019s consideration of mootness in the first\ninstance.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n",

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\nWe explained that, because respondent is \u201cno longer . . .\nsubject\u201d to the District Court\u2019s \u201csex-offender-registration\nconditions,\u201d respondent must \u201cshow that a decision invali\ndating\u201d those conditions \u201cwould be sufficiently likely to\nredress \u2018collateral consequences adequate to meet Article\nIII\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n2\u20133) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998)).\nWe noted that by the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision,\n\u201crespondent had become registered as a sex offender in\n4             UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nMontana.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[p]erhaps the most likely\npotential \u2018collateral consequenc[e]\u2019 that might be remedied\nby a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor is the requirement\nthat respondent remain registered as a sex offender under\nMontana law.\u201d Ibid. In order to ascertain whether a\ndecision invalidating the District Court\u2019s registration\nconditions would enable respondent to remove his name\nfrom the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certi\nfied the following question to the Montana Supreme\nCourt:\n    \u201cIs respondent\u2019s duty to remain registered as a sex\n    offender under Montana law contingent upon the\n    validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal\n    juvenile-supervision order that required him to regis\n    ter as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent\n    requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by\n    the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile\n    supervision conditions?\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n    (citations omitted).\n   The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our\ncertified question.

Its answer is that\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cstate law duty to remain registered as a sex\noffender is not contingent upon the validity of the condi\ntions of his federal supervision order, but is an independ\nent requirement of Montana law.\u201d Id., at ___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889813\"><a href=\"/opinion/889813/united-states-v-juvenile-male/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2162807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,*1.\n                                II\n   It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable case\nor controversy must remain \u201cextant at all stages of review,\nnot merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d Arizonans\nfor Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[T]hroughout the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nlitigation,\u201d the party seeking relief \u201c \u2018must have suffered,\nor be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the de\nfendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\ndecision.\u2019 \u201d Spencer, supra, at 7 (quoting Lewis v. Conti\nnental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477 (1990)).\n   In criminal cases, this requirement means that a defen\ndant wishing to continue his appeals after the expiration\nof his sentence must suffer some \u201ccontinuing injury\u201d or\n\u201ccollateral consequence\u201d sufficient to satisfy Article III.\nSee Spencer, 523 U. S., at 7\u20138. When the defendant chal\nlenges his underlying conviction, this Court\u2019s cases have\nlong presumed the existence of collateral consequences.\nId., at 8; see Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55\u201356\n(1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired\nsentence, no such presumption applies, and the defendant\nmust bear the burden of identifying some ongoing \u201ccollat\neral consequenc[e]\u201d that is \u201ctraceable\u201d to the challenged\nportion of the sentence and \u201clikely to be redressed by a\nfavorable judicial decision.\u201d See Spencer, supra, at 7, 14.\n   At the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case,\nthe District Court\u2019s order of juvenile supervision had\nexpired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex\noffender-registration conditions that he sought to chal\nlenge on appeal. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As a\nresult, respondent\u2019s challenge was moot before the Ninth\nCircuit unless he could \u201cshow that a decision invalidating\u201d\nthe District Court\u2019s order would likely redress some collat\neral consequence of the registration conditions. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 2\u20133) (citing Spencer, supra, at 14).\n   As we noted in our prior opinion, one \u201cpotential collat\neral consequence that might be remedied\u201d by an order\ninvalidating the registration conditions \u201cis the require\nment that respondent remain registered\u201d under Montana\nlaw. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Su\npreme Court has now clarified, respondent\u2019s \u201cstate law\n6               UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nduty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contin\ngent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal\nsupervision order,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889813\"><a href=\"/opinion/889813/united-states-v-juvenile-male/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2162807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1, and continues to\napply regardless of the outcome in this case. True, a\nfavorable decision in this case might serve as a useful\nprecedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit chal\nlenging Montana\u2019s registration requirement on ex post\nfacto grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a\nfuture lawsuit cannot save this case from mootness. See\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n16); Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Board of\nTrade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner,\nJ.) (\u201c[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a\ndecision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .\ncontrol the outcome of another suit. But if that were\nenough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot\u201d).\n  Respondent also argues that this case \u201ccannot be con\nsidered moot in any practical sense\u201d because, under cur\nrent law, respondent may have \u201can independent duty to\nregister as a sex offender\u201d under SORNA itself. Brief in\nOpposition 6.2 But the duty to register under SORNA is\nnot a consequence\u2014collateral or otherwise\u2014of the District\nCourt\u2019s special conditions of supervision. The statutory\nduty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that\nexists \u201cindependent\u201d of those conditions. That continuing\nobligation might provide grounds for a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. It does\nnot, however, render the current controversy regarding\nthe validity of respondent\u2019s sentence any less moot.\n  Respondent further argues that this case falls within\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See 42 U. S. C. \u00a716911(8) (SORNA applicable if the juvenile was \u201c14\n\nyears of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudi\ncated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse\n(as described in section 2241 of title 18)\u201d); 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at\n28 CFR pt. 72) (SORNA\u2019s requirements extend to sex offenders con\nvicted before the statute\u2019s enactment).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthe established exception to mootness for disputes that are\n\u201c \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 8\n(quoting Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148\u2013149\n(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies\nonly where \u201c(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration\ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira\ntion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subject to the same\naction again.\u201d Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot\nsatisfy the second of these requirements. He has now\nturned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order\nimposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,\ne.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu\nriam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness\nthus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked\nthe authority under Article III to decide this case on the\nmerits.\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case\nis remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit\nfor that court\u2019s consideration of mootness in the first\ninstance.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
