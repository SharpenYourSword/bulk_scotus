Argued January 11, 2011 —Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondents, North Carolina residents whose sons died in a bus acci\n  dent outside Paris, France, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in\n  North Carolina state court. Alleging that the accident was caused by\n  tire failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corpo\n  ration, and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized\n  and operating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France. Pe\n  titioners’ tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian\n  markets and differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold\n  in the United States. Petitioners are not registered to do business in\n  North Carolina; have no place of business, employees, or bank ac\n  counts in the State; do not design, manufacture, or advertise their\n  products in the State; and do not solicit business in the State or sell\n  or ship tires to North Carolina customers. Even so, a small percent\n  age of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Good\n  year USA affiliates. The trial court denied petitioners’ motion to\n  dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.\n  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the\n  North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over petitioners,\n  whose tires had reached the State through “the stream of commerce.”\nHeld: Petitioners were not amenable to suit in North Carolina on\n claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.\n Pp. 6–14.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause sets the\n outer boundaries of a state tribunal’s authority to proceed against a\n defendant. The pathmarking decision of International Shoe Co. v.\n Washington, 326 U. S. 310, provides that state courts may exercise\n2           GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                         v. BROWN\n                          Syllabus\n\n    personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has “certain\n    minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the\n    suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial\n    justice.’ ” Id., at 316. Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair\n    play and substantial justice” concept, the Court in International Shoe\n    classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First,\n    the Court recognized that jurisdiction could be asserted where the\n    corporation’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and\n    gave rise to the episode-in-suit. Id., at 317. It also observed that the\n    commission of “single or occasional acts” in a State may be sufficient\n    to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those\n    acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum con\n    nections. Id., at 318. These two categories compose what is now\n    known as “specific jurisdiction.” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colom\n    bia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distin\n    guished from cases that fit within the “specific jurisdiction” catego\n    ries, “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n    state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit\n    against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct\n    from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318. Adjudicatory authority so\n    grounded is now called “general jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S.,\n    at 414, n. 9. Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have\n    elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of\n    specific jurisdiction. In only two decisions postdating International\n    Shoe has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate de\n    fendant’s in-state contacts were sufficiently “continuous and system\n    atic” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unre\n    lated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342\n    U. S. 437; and Helicopteros, 466 U. S. 408. Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) Petitioners lack “the kind of continuous and systematic general\n    business contacts” necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a\n    suit against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the\n    State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416. The stream-of-commerce cases\n    on which the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of specific\n    jurisdiction in products liability actions, in which a nonresident de\n    fendant, acting outside the forum, places in the stream of commerce a\n    product that ultimately causes harm inside the forum. Many state\n    long-arm statutes authorize courts to exercise specific jurisdiction\n    over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, oc\n    curred within the forum State. The North Carolina court’s stream-of\n    commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case\n    specific and general jurisdiction. Flow of a manufacturer’s products\n    into the forum may bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdic\n    tion, see, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                        3\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  286, 297; but ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdic\n  tion do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the fo\n  rum has general jurisdiction over a defendant. A corporation’s “con\n  tinuous activity of some sorts within a state,” International Shoe\n  instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that the corporation\n  be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n     Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Carolina is not\n  a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to\n  general jurisdiction. In the 1952 Perkins case, general jurisdiction\n  was appropriately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in\n  Ohio, where the company’s affairs were overseen during World War\n  II. In Helicopteros, however, the survivors of U. S. citizens killed\n  when a helicopter owned by a Colombian corporation crashed in Peru\n  could not maintain wrongful-death actions against that corporation\n  in Texas, where the company’s contacts “consisted of sending its chief\n  executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accept\n  ing into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank;\n  purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\n  Texas enterprise]; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.”\n  466 U. S., at 416. These links to Texas did not “constitute the kind of\n  continuous and systematic general business contacts . . . found to ex\n  ist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support the exercise of juris\n  diction over a claim that neither “ ‘ar[o]se out of’ . . . no[r] related to”\n  the defendant’s activities in Texas. Id., at 415–416. This Court sees\n  no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in\n  Helicopteros, the sales of petitioners’ tires sporadically made in North\n  Carolina through intermediaries. Pp. 9–13.\n     (c) Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for\n  certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners’ discrete\n  status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a\n  “unitary business,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in\n  the subsidiaries as well. Respondents have therefore forfeited this\n  contention. Pp. 13–14.\n199 N. C. App. 50, 681 S.

We address,\nin particular, this question: Are foreign subsidiaries of a\nUnited States parent corporation amenable to suit in state\ncourt on claims unrelated to any activity of the subsidiar\nies in the forum State?\n  A bus accident outside Paris that took the lives of two\n13-year-old boys from North Carolina gave rise to the liti\ngation we here consider. Attributing the accident to a\ndefective tire manufactured in Turkey at the plant of a\nforeign subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Com\npany (Goodyear USA), the boys’ parents commenced an\naction for damages in a North Carolina state court; they\nnamed as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corporation,\nand three of its subsidiaries, organized and operating,\nrespectively, in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg. Good\nyear USA, which had plants in North Carolina and regu\nlarly engaged in commercial activity there, did not contest\n2       GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nthe North Carolina court’s jurisdiction over it; Goodyear\nUSA’s foreign subsidiaries, however, maintained that\nNorth Carolina lacked adjudicatory authority over them.\n    A state court’s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defen\ndants to the State’s coercive power, and is therefore sub\nject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause. International Shoe\nCo. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945) (assertion of\njurisdiction over out-of-state corporation must comply with\n“ ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’ ”\n(quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940))).\nOpinions in the wake of the pathmarking International\nShoe decision have differentiated between general or all\npurpose jurisdiction, and specific or case-linked jurisdic\ntion. Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall,\n466 U. S. 408, 414, nn. 8, 9 (1984).\n    A court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign\n(sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any\nand all claims against them when their affiliations with\nthe State are so “continuous and systematic” as to render\nthem essentially at home in the forum State. See Interna\ntional Shoe, 326 U. S., at 317. Specific jurisdiction, on the\nother hand, depends on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum\nand the underlying controversy,” principally, activity or an\noccurrence that takes place in the forum State and is\ntherefore subject to the State’s regulation. von Mehren &\nTrautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analy\nsis, 79 Harv.

In contrast to general, all\npurpose jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction is confined to\nadjudication of “issues deriving from, or connected with,\nthe very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” von\nMehren & Trautman 1136.\n    Because the episode-in-suit, the bus accident, occurred\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Meter, 199 N. C. App. 50, 57–58, 681 S. E. 2d\n382, 388 (2009). Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless\namenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?\nConfusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional\ninquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some\nof the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiar\nies, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had\nreached North Carolina through “the stream of com\nmerce”; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed,\ngave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corpora\ntions. Id., at 67–68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394–395.\n   A connection so limited between the forum and the for\neign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction. Such a connection does\nnot establish the “continuous and systematic” affiliation\nnecessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain\nclaims unrelated to the foreign corporation’s contacts with\nthe State.\n                              I\n  On April 18, 2004, a bus destined for Charles de Gaulle\nAirport overturned on a road outside Paris, France. Pas\nsengers on the bus were young soccer players from North\nCarolina beginning their journey home. Two 13-year-olds,\nJulian Brown and Matthew Helms, sustained fatal inju\nries. The boys’ parents, respondents in this Court, filed a\nsuit for wrongful-death damages in the Superior Court of\nOnslow County, North Carolina, in their capacity as ad\nministrators of the boys’ estates. Attributing the accident\nto a tire that failed when its plies separated, the parents\nalleged negligence in the “design, construction, testing,\n4        GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S.

E.\n2d, at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Goodyear Luxembourg Tires, SA (Goodyear Luxem\nbourg), Goodyear Lastikleri T. A. S. (Goodyear Turkey),\nand Goodyear Dunlop Tires France, SA (Goodyear\nFrance), petitioners here, were named as defendants.\nIncorporated in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France, respec\ntively, petitioners are indirect subsidiaries of Goodyear\nUSA, an Ohio corporation also named as a defendant in\nthe suit. Petitioners manufacture tires primarily for sale\nin European and Asian markets. Their tires differ in size\nand construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United\nStates. They are designed to carry significantly heavier\nloads, and to serve under road conditions and speed limits\nin the manufacturers’ primary markets.1\n   In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA,\nwhich does not contest the North Carolina courts’ personal\njurisdiction over it, petitioners are not registered to do\nbusiness in North Carolina. They have no place of busi\nness, employees, or bank accounts in North Carolina.\nThey do not design, manufacture, or advertise their prod\nucts in North Carolina. And they do not solicit business in\nNorth Carolina or themselves sell or ship tires to North\nCarolina customers. Even so, a small percentage of peti\ntioners’ tires (tens of thousands out of tens of millions\nmanufactured between 2004 and 2007) were distributed\nwithin North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.\nThese tires were typically custom ordered to equip special\nized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste haulers, and\nboat and horse trailers. Petitioners state, and respondents\n——————\n   1 Respondents portray Goodyear USA’s structure as a reprehensible\n\neffort to “outsource” all manufacturing, and correspondingly, tort\nlitigation, to foreign jurisdictions. See Brief for Respondents 51–53.\nYet Turkey, where the tire alleged to have caused the accident-in-suit\nwas made, is hardly a strange location for a facility that primarily\nsupplies markets in Europe and Asia.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

The trial court denied\nthe motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals af\nfirmed. Acknowledging that the claims neither “related\nto, nor . . . ar[o]se from, [petitioners’] contacts with North\nCarolina,” the Court of Appeals confined its analysis to\n“general rather than specific jurisdiction,” which the court\nrecognized required a “higher threshold” showing: A de\nfendant must have “continuous and systematic contacts”\nwith the forum. Id., at 58, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That threshold was crossed,\nthe court determined, when petitioners placed their tires\n“in the stream of interstate commerce without any limita\ntion on the extent to which those tires could be sold in\nNorth Carolina.” Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394.\n   Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated\nthat petitioners “took any affirmative action to cause tires\nwhich they had manufactured to be shipped into North\nCarolina.” Id., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392. The court\nfound, however, that tires made by petitioners reached\nNorth Carolina as a consequence of a “highly-organized\ndistribution process” involving other Goodyear USA sub\nsidiaries. Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. Petitioners, the\ncourt noted, made “no attempt to keep these tires from\nreaching the North Carolina market.” Id., at 66, 681 S. E.\n2d, at 393. Indeed, the very tire involved in the accident,\nthe court observed, conformed to tire standards estab\nlished by the U. S. Department of Transportation and bore\nmarkings required for sale in the United States.

Id., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394.\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court denied discretionary\nreview. Brown v. Meter, 364 N. C. 128, 695 S. E. 2d 756\n(2010).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the general\njurisdiction the North Carolina courts asserted over peti\ntioners is consistent with the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. 561 U.

Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S.\n186, 207 (1977). The canonical opinion in this area re\nmains International Shoe, 326 U. S. 310, in which we held\nthat a State may authorize its courts to exercise personal\njurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant if the defendant\nhas “certain minimum contacts with [the State] such that\nthe maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional\nnotions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” Id., at 316\n(quoting Meyer, 311 U. S., at 463).\n   Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair play and\nsubstantial justice” concept, the Court in International\nShoe classified cases involving out-of-state corporate\ndefendants.

S., at\n317. Further, the Court observed, the commission of\ncertain “single or occasional acts” in a State may be suffi\ncient to render a corporation answerable in that State\nwith respect to those acts, though not with respect to\nmatters unrelated to the forum connections. Id., at 318.\nThe heading courts today use to encompass these two\nInternational Shoe categories is “specific jurisdiction.” See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1144–1163. Adjudicatory au\nthority is “specific” when the suit “aris[es] out of or relate[s]\nto the defendant’s contacts with the forum.” Helicopteros,\n466 U. S., at 414, n. 8.\n   International Shoe distinguished from cases that fit\nwithin the “specific jurisdiction” categories, “instances in\nwhich the continuous corporate operations within a state\n[are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit\nagainst it on causes of action arising from dealings en\ntirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.\nAdjudicatory authority so grounded is today called “gen\neral jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 414, n. 9. For\nan individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a\ncorporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the\ncorporation is fairly regarded as at home. See Brilmayer\n728 (identifying domicile, place of incorporation, and\nprincipal place of business as “paradig[m]” bases for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction).\n   Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have\nelaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction, particularly in cases in\nvolving “single or occasional acts” occurring or having\ntheir impact within the forum State. As a rule in these\ncases, this Court has inquired whether there was “some\nact by which the defendant purposefully avail[ed] itself of\nthe privilege of conducting activities within the forum\n8       GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S.

S. 408 (helicopter\nowned by Colombian corporation crashed in Peru; survi\nvors of U. S. citizens who died in the crash, the Court\nheld, could not maintain wrongful-death actions against the\nColombian corporation in Texas, for the corporation’s\nhelicopter purchases and purchase-linked activity in\nTexas were insufficient to subject it to Texas court’s gen\neral jurisdiction).\n                              B\n   To justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over peti\ntioners, the North Carolina courts relied on the petition\ners’ placement of their tires in the “stream of commerce.”\nSee supra, at 5. The stream-of-commerce metaphor has\nbeen invoked frequently in lower court decisions permit\nting “jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the\nproduct has traveled through an extensive chain of distri\nbution before reaching the ultimate consumer.” 18 W.\nFletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §8640.40,\np. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresi\ndent defendant, acting outside the forum, places in the\nstream of commerce a product that ultimately causes\nharm inside the forum. See generally Dayton, Personal\nJurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce, 7 Rev. Litiga\ntion 239, 262–268 (1988) (discussing origins and evolution\nof the stream-of-commerce doctrine).\n   Many States have enacted long-arm statutes authoriz\ning courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufac\nturers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred\nwithin the forum state. For example, the “Local Injury;\nForeign Act” subsection of North Carolina’s long-arm\nstatute authorizes North Carolina courts to exercise per\n10        GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                        v. BROWN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nsonal jurisdiction in “any action claiming injury to person\nor property within this State arising out of [the defen\ndant’s] act or omission outside this State,” if, “in addi\ntion[,] at or about the time of the injury,” ”[p]roducts . . .\nmanufactured by the defendant were used or consumed,\nwithin this State in the ordinary course of trade.” N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009).3 As the North\nCarolina Court of Appeals recognized, this provision of the\nState’s long-arm statute “does not apply to this case,” for\nboth the act alleged to have caused injury (the fabrication\nof the allegedly defective tire) and its impact (the accident)\noccurred outside the forum. See 199 N. C. App., at 61,\nn. 6, 681 S. E. 2d, at 390, n. 6.4\n   The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis\nelided the essential difference between case-specific and\nall-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufac\nturer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may\nbolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 297 (where “the\nsale of a product . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence,\nbut arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distribu\ntor to serve . . . the market for its product in [several]\n\n——————\n   3 Cf. D. C. Code §13–423(a)(4) (2001) (providing for specific jurisdic\n\ntion over defendant who “caus[es] tortious injury in the [forum] by an\nact or omission outside the [forum]” when, in addition, the defendant\n“derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed . . . in the\n[forum]”).\n   4 The court instead relied on N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(1)(d), see\n\n199 N. C. App., at 57, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388, which provides for jurisdic\ntion, “whether the claim arises within or without [the] State,” when the\ndefendant “[i]s engaged in substantial activity within this State,\nwhether such activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”\nThis provision, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held, was “in\ntended to make available to the North Carolina courts the full juris\ndictional powers permissible under federal due process.” Dillon v.\nNumismatic Funding Corp., 291 N. C. 674, 676, 231 S. E. 2d 629, 630\n(1977).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one\nof those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has\nthere been the source of injury to its owner or to others” (em\nphasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise\nof specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination\nthat, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdic\ntion over a defendant. See, e.g., Stabilisierungsfonds Fur\nWein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., 647 F. 2d\n200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981) (defendants’ marketing ar\nrangements, although “adequate to permit litigation of\nclaims relating to [their] introduction of . . . wine into\nthe United States stream of commerce, . . . would not be\nadequate to support general, ‘all purpose’ adjudicatory\nauthority”).\n   A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within\na state,” International Shoe instructed, “is not enough to\nsupport the demand that the corporation be amenable to\nsuits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318. Our\n1952 decision in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co.\nremains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appro\npriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not\nconsented to suit in the forum.” Donahue v. Far Eastern\nAir Transport Corp., 652 F. 2d 1032, 1037 (CADC 1981).\n   Sued in Ohio, the defendant in Perkins was a Philippine\nmining corporation that had ceased activities in the Phil\nippines during World War II. To the extent that the com\npany was conducting any business during and immedi\nately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it\nwas doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president main\ntained his office there, kept the company files in that\noffice, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily\nlimited wartime activities of the company.” Perkins, 342\nU. S., at 447–448. Although the claim-in-suit did not arise\nin Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due\nprocess for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. Ibid.; see\nKeeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 779–780,\n12      GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nn. 11 (1984) (Ohio’s exercise of general jurisdiction was\npermissible in Perkins because “Ohio was the corporation’s\nprincipal, if temporary, place of business”).\n   We next addressed the exercise of general jurisdiction\nover an out-of-state corporation over three decades later,\nin Helicopteros. In that case, survivors of United States\ncitizens who died in a helicopter crash in Peru instituted\nwrongful-death actions in a Texas state court against the\nowner and operator of the helicopter, a Colombian corpo\nration. The Colombian corporation had no place of busi\nness in Texas and was not licensed to do business there.\n“Basically, [the company’s] contacts with Texas consisted\nof sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a\ncontract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York\nbank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchas\ning helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\nTexas enterprise] for substantial sums; and sending per\nsonnel to [Texas] for training.” 466 U. S., at 416. These\nlinks to Texas, we determined, did not “constitute the kind\nof continuous and systematic general business contacts . . .\nfound to exist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support\nthe exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither\n“ar[o]se out of . . . no[r] related to” the defendant’s activi\nties in Texas. Id., at 415–416 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Helicopteros concluded that “mere purchases [made in\nthe forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals,\nare not enough to warrant a State’s assertion of [general]\njurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of\naction not related to those purchase transactions.” Id., at\n418. We see no reason to differentiate from the ties to\nTexas held insufficient in Helicopteros, the sales of peti\ntioners’ tires sporadically made in North Carolina through\nintermediaries. Under the sprawling view of general\njurisdiction urged by respondents and embraced by the\nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals, any substantial manu\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfacturer or seller of goods would be amenable to suit, on\nany claim for relief, wherever its products are distributed.\nBut cf. World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296 (every\nseller of chattels does not, by virtue of the sale, “appoint\nthe chattel his agent for service of process”).\n   Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Caro\nlina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to\nsubject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the\ndefendant in Perkins, whose sole wartime business activ\nity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at\nhome in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to\nthe State, see supra, at 4–5, fall far short of the “the con\ntinuous and systematic general business contacts” neces\nsary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against\nthem on claims unrelated to anything that connects them\nto the State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.5\n                           C\n  Respondents belatedly assert a “single enterprise” the\nory, asking us to consolidate petitioners’ ties to North\nCarolina with those of Goodyear USA and other Goodyear\nentities. See Brief for Respondents 44–50. In effect,\n——————\n  5 As earlier noted, see supra, at 6, the North Carolina Court of Ap\n\npeals invoked the State’s “well-recognized interest in providing a forum\nin which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have\nsustained.” 199 N. C. App., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. But “[g]eneral\njurisdiction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been\nbased on the plaintiff’s relationship to the forum. There is nothing in\n[our] law comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804)\nunder which the French nationality of the plaintiff is a sufficient\nground for jurisdiction.” von Mehren & Trautman 1137; see Clermont\n& Palmer, Exorbitant Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492–495 (2006)\n(French law permitting plaintiff-based jurisdiction is rarely invoked\nin the absence of other supporting factors). When a defendant’s act\noutside the forum causes injury in the forum, by contrast, a plaintiff’s\nresidence in the forum may strengthen the case for the exercise of\nspecific jurisdiction. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788 (1984); von\nMehren & Trautman 1167–1173.\n14        GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                        v.

See Brilmayer &\nPaisley, Personal Jurisdiction and Substantive Legal\nRelations: Corporations, Conspiracies, and Agency, 74 Cal.\nL. Rev. 1, 14, 29–30 (1986) (merging parent and subsidiary\nfor jurisdictional purposes requires an inquiry “compara\nble to the corporate law question of piercing the corporate\nveil”). But see 199 N. C. App., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392\n(North Carolina Court of Appeals understood that peti\ntioners are “separate corporate entities . . . not directly re\nsponsible for the presence in North Carolina of tires that\nthey had manufactured”). Neither below nor in their brief\nin opposition to the petition for certiorari did respondents\nurge disregard of petitioners’ discrete status as subsidiar\nies and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a “unitary\nbusiness,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw\nin the subsidiaries as well.6 Brief for Respondents 44.\nRespondents have therefore forfeited this contention, and\nwe do not address it.

Argued January 11, 2011 —Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondents, North Carolina residents whose sons died in a bus acci\n  dent outside Paris, France, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in\n  North Carolina state court. Alleging that the accident was caused by\n  tire failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corpo\n  ration, and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized\n  and operating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France. Pe\n  titioners’ tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian\n  markets and differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold\n  in the United States. Petitioners are not registered to do business in\n  North Carolina; have no place of business, employees, or bank ac\n  counts in the State; do not design, manufacture, or advertise their\n  products in the State; and do not solicit business in the State or sell\n  or ship tires to North Carolina customers. Even so, a small percent\n  age of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Good\n  year USA affiliates. The trial court denied petitioners’ motion to\n  dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.\n  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the\n  North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over petitioners,\n  whose tires had reached the State through “the stream of commerce.”\nHeld: Petitioners were not amenable to suit in North Carolina on\n claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.\n Pp. 6–14.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause sets the\n outer boundaries of a state tribunal’s authority to proceed against a\n defendant. The pathmarking decision of International Shoe Co. v.\n Washington, 326 U. S. 310, provides that state courts may exercise\n2           GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                         v. BROWN\n                          Syllabus\n\n    personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has “certain\n    minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the\n    suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial\n    justice.’ ” Id., at 316. Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair\n    play and substantial justice” concept, the Court in International Shoe\n    classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First,\n    the Court recognized that jurisdiction could be asserted where the\n    corporation’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and\n    gave rise to the episode-in-suit. Id., at 317. It also observed that the\n    commission of “single or occasional acts” in a State may be sufficient\n    to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those\n    acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum con\n    nections. Id., at 318. These two categories compose what is now\n    known as “specific jurisdiction.” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colom\n    bia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distin\n    guished from cases that fit within the “specific jurisdiction” catego\n    ries, “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n    state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit\n    against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct\n    from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318. Adjudicatory authority so\n    grounded is now called “general jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S.,\n    at 414, n. 9. Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have\n    elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of\n    specific jurisdiction. In only two decisions postdating International\n    Shoe has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate de\n    fendant’s in-state contacts were sufficiently “continuous and system\n    atic” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unre\n    lated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342\n    U. S. 437; and Helicopteros, 466 U. S. 408. Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) Petitioners lack “the kind of continuous and systematic general\n    business contacts” necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a\n    suit against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the\n    State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416. The stream-of-commerce cases\n    on which the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of specific\n    jurisdiction in products liability actions, in which a nonresident de\n    fendant, acting outside the forum, places in the stream of commerce a\n    product that ultimately causes harm inside the forum. Many state\n    long-arm statutes authorize courts to exercise specific jurisdiction\n    over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, oc\n    curred within the forum State. The North Carolina court’s stream-of\n    commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case\n    specific and general jurisdiction. Flow of a manufacturer’s products\n    into the forum may bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdic\n    tion, see, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S.\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                        3\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n  286, 297; but ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdic\n  tion do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the fo\n  rum has general jurisdiction over a defendant. A corporation’s “con\n  tinuous activity of some sorts within a state,” International Shoe\n  instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that the corporation\n  be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n     Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Carolina is not\n  a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to\n  general jurisdiction. In the 1952 Perkins case, general jurisdiction\n  was appropriately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in\n  Ohio, where the company’s affairs were overseen during World War\n  II. In Helicopteros, however, the survivors of U. S. citizens killed\n  when a helicopter owned by a Colombian corporation crashed in Peru\n  could not maintain wrongful-death actions against that corporation\n  in Texas, where the company’s contacts “consisted of sending its chief\n  executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accept\n  ing into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank;\n  purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\n  Texas enterprise]; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.”\n  466 U. S., at 416. These links to Texas did not “constitute the kind of\n  continuous and systematic general business contacts . . . found to ex\n  ist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support the exercise of juris\n  diction over a claim that neither “ ‘ar[o]se out of’ . . . no[r] related to”\n  the defendant’s activities in Texas. Id., at 415–416. This Court sees\n  no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in\n  Helicopteros, the sales of petitioners’ tires sporadically made in North\n  Carolina through intermediaries. Pp. 9–13.\n     (c) Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for\n  certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners’ discrete\n  status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a\n  “unitary business,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in\n  the subsidiaries as well.

See Interna\ntional Shoe, 326 U. S., at 317. Specific jurisdiction, on the\nother hand, depends on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum\nand the underlying controversy,” principally, activity or an\noccurrence that takes place in the forum State and is\ntherefore subject to the State’s regulation. von Mehren &\nTrautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analy\nsis, 79 Harv.

Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless\namenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?\nConfusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional\ninquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some\nof the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiar\nies, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had\nreached North Carolina through “the stream of com\nmerce”; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed,\ngave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corpora\ntions. Id., at 67–68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394–395.\n   A connection so limited between the forum and the for\neign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction. Such a connection does\nnot establish the “continuous and systematic” affiliation\nnecessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain\nclaims unrelated to the foreign corporation’s contacts with\nthe State.\n                              I\n  On April 18, 2004, a bus destined for Charles de Gaulle\nAirport overturned on a road outside Paris, France.

(Goodyear Turkey),\nand Goodyear Dunlop Tires France, SA (Goodyear\nFrance), petitioners here, were named as defendants.\nIncorporated in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France, respec\ntively, petitioners are indirect subsidiaries of Goodyear\nUSA, an Ohio corporation also named as a defendant in\nthe suit. Petitioners manufacture tires primarily for sale\nin European and Asian markets. Their tires differ in size\nand construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United\nStates. They are designed to carry significantly heavier\nloads, and to serve under road conditions and speed limits\nin the manufacturers’ primary markets.1\n   In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA,\nwhich does not contest the North Carolina courts’ personal\njurisdiction over it, petitioners are not registered to do\nbusiness in North Carolina. They have no place of busi\nness, employees, or bank accounts in North Carolina.\nThey do not design, manufacture, or advertise their prod\nucts in North Carolina. And they do not solicit business in\nNorth Carolina or themselves sell or ship tires to North\nCarolina customers. Even so, a small percentage of peti\ntioners’ tires (tens of thousands out of tens of millions\nmanufactured between 2004 and 2007) were distributed\nwithin North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.\nThese tires were typically custom ordered to equip special\nized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste haulers, and\nboat and horse trailers.

The trial court denied\nthe motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals af\nfirmed. Acknowledging that the claims neither “related\nto, nor . . . ar[o]se from, [petitioners’] contacts with North\nCarolina,” the Court of Appeals confined its analysis to\n“general rather than specific jurisdiction,” which the court\nrecognized required a “higher threshold” showing: A de\nfendant must have “continuous and systematic contacts”\nwith the forum. Id., at 58, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That threshold was crossed,\nthe court determined, when petitioners placed their tires\n“in the stream of interstate commerce without any limita\ntion on the extent to which those tires could be sold in\nNorth Carolina.” Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394.\n   Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated\nthat petitioners “took any affirmative action to cause tires\nwhich they had manufactured to be shipped into North\nCarolina.” Id., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392. The court\nfound, however, that tires made by petitioners reached\nNorth Carolina as a consequence of a “highly-organized\ndistribution process” involving other Goodyear USA sub\nsidiaries. Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. Petitioners, the\ncourt noted, made “no attempt to keep these tires from\nreaching the North Carolina market.” Id., at 66, 681 S. E.\n2d, at 393.

Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S.\n186, 207 (1977). The canonical opinion in this area re\nmains International Shoe, 326 U.

Further, the Court observed, the commission of\ncertain “single or occasional acts” in a State may be suffi\ncient to render a corporation answerable in that State\nwith respect to those acts, though not with respect to\nmatters unrelated to the forum connections. Id., at 318.\nThe heading courts today use to encompass these two\nInternational Shoe categories is “specific jurisdiction.” See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1144–1163. Adjudicatory au\nthority is “specific” when the suit “aris[es] out of or relate[s]\nto the defendant’s contacts with the forum.” Helicopteros,\n466 U. S., at 414, n. 8.\n   International Shoe distinguished from cases that fit\nwithin the “specific jurisdiction” categories, “instances in\nwhich the continuous corporate operations within a state\n[are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit\nagainst it on causes of action arising from dealings en\ntirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.\nAdjudicatory authority so grounded is today called “gen\neral jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 414, n. 9. For\nan individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a\ncorporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the\ncorporation is fairly regarded as at home. See Brilmayer\n728 (identifying domicile, place of incorporation, and\nprincipal place of business as “paradig[m]” bases for the\nexercise of general jurisdiction).\n   Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have\nelaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction, particularly in cases in\nvolving “single or occasional acts” occurring or having\ntheir impact within the forum State. As a rule in these\ncases, this Court has inquired whether there was “some\nact by which the defendant purposefully avail[ed] itself of\nthe privilege of conducting activities within the forum\n8       GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S.

The stream-of-commerce metaphor has\nbeen invoked frequently in lower court decisions permit\nting “jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the\nproduct has traveled through an extensive chain of distri\nbution before reaching the ultimate consumer.” 18 W.\nFletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §8640.40,\np. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresi\ndent defendant, acting outside the forum, places in the\nstream of commerce a product that ultimately causes\nharm inside the forum. See generally Dayton, Personal\nJurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce, 7 Rev. Litiga\ntion 239, 262–268 (1988) (discussing origins and evolution\nof the stream-of-commerce doctrine).\n   Many States have enacted long-arm statutes authoriz\ning courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufac\nturers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred\nwithin the forum state. For example, the “Local Injury;\nForeign Act” subsection of North Carolina’s long-arm\nstatute authorizes North Carolina courts to exercise per\n10        GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                        v. BROWN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nsonal jurisdiction in “any action claiming injury to person\nor property within this State arising out of [the defen\ndant’s] act or omission outside this State,” if, “in addi\ntion[,] at or about the time of the injury,” ”[p]roducts . . .\nmanufactured by the defendant were used or consumed,\nwithin this State in the ordinary course of trade.” N. C.\nGen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009).3 As the North\nCarolina Court of Appeals recognized, this provision of the\nState’s long-arm statute “does not apply to this case,” for\nboth the act alleged to have caused injury (the fabrication\nof the allegedly defective tire) and its impact (the accident)\noccurred outside the forum. See 199 N. C. App., at 61,\nn. 6, 681 S. E. 2d, at 390, n. 6.4\n   The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis\nelided the essential difference between case-specific and\nall-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufac\nturer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may\nbolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 297 (where “the\nsale of a product . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence,\nbut arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distribu\ntor to serve . . . the market for its product in [several]\n\n——————\n   3 Cf. D. C. Code §13–423(a)(4) (2001) (providing for specific jurisdic\n\ntion over defendant who “caus[es] tortious injury in the [forum] by an\nact or omission outside the [forum]” when, in addition, the defendant\n“derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed . . . in the\n[forum]”).\n   4 The court instead relied on N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(1)(d), see\n\n199 N. C. App., at 57, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388, which provides for jurisdic\ntion, “whether the claim arises within or without [the] State,” when the\ndefendant “[i]s engaged in substantial activity within this State,\nwhether such activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”\nThis provision, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held, was “in\ntended to make available to the North Carolina courts the full juris\ndictional powers permissible under federal due process.” Dillon v.\nNumismatic Funding Corp., 291 N. C. 674, 676, 231 S. E. 2d 629, 630\n(1977).\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one\nof those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has\nthere been the source of injury to its owner or to others” (em\nphasis added)). But ties serving to bolster the exercise\nof specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination\nthat, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdic\ntion over a defendant. See, e.g., Stabilisierungsfonds Fur\nWein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., 647 F. 2d\n200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981) (defendants’ marketing ar\nrangements, although “adequate to permit litigation of\nclaims relating to [their] introduction of . . . wine into\nthe United States stream of commerce, . . . would not be\nadequate to support general, ‘all purpose’ adjudicatory\nauthority”).\n   A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within\na state,” International Shoe instructed, “is not enough to\nsupport the demand that the corporation be amenable to\nsuits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318. Our\n1952 decision in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co.\nremains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appro\npriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not\nconsented to suit in the forum.” Donahue v. Far Eastern\nAir Transport Corp., 652 F. 2d 1032, 1037 (CADC 1981).\n   Sued in Ohio, the defendant in Perkins was a Philippine\nmining corporation that had ceased activities in the Phil\nippines during World War II. To the extent that the com\npany was conducting any business during and immedi\nately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it\nwas doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president main\ntained his office there, kept the company files in that\noffice, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily\nlimited wartime activities of the company.” Perkins, 342\nU. S., at 447–448. Although the claim-in-suit did not arise\nin Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due\nprocess for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. Ibid.; see\nKeeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 779–780,\n12      GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                      v. BROWN\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nn. 11 (1984) (Ohio’s exercise of general jurisdiction was\npermissible in Perkins because “Ohio was the corporation’s\nprincipal, if temporary, place of business”).\n   We next addressed the exercise of general jurisdiction\nover an out-of-state corporation over three decades later,\nin Helicopteros. In that case, survivors of United States\ncitizens who died in a helicopter crash in Peru instituted\nwrongful-death actions in a Texas state court against the\nowner and operator of the helicopter, a Colombian corpo\nration. The Colombian corporation had no place of busi\nness in Texas and was not licensed to do business there.\n“Basically, [the company’s] contacts with Texas consisted\nof sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a\ncontract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York\nbank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchas\ning helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\nTexas enterprise] for substantial sums; and sending per\nsonnel to [Texas] for training.” 466 U. S., at 416. These\nlinks to Texas, we determined, did not “constitute the kind\nof continuous and systematic general business contacts . . .\nfound to exist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support\nthe exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither\n“ar[o]se out of . . . no[r] related to” the defendant’s activi\nties in Texas. Id., at 415–416 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Helicopteros concluded that “mere purchases [made in\nthe forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals,\nare not enough to warrant a State’s assertion of [general]\njurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of\naction not related to those purchase transactions.” Id., at\n418. We see no reason to differentiate from the ties to\nTexas held insufficient in Helicopteros, the sales of peti\ntioners’ tires sporadically made in North Carolina through\nintermediaries. Under the sprawling view of general\njurisdiction urged by respondents and embraced by the\nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals, any substantial manu\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296 (every\nseller of chattels does not, by virtue of the sale, “appoint\nthe chattel his agent for service of process”).\n   Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Caro\nlina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to\nsubject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the\ndefendant in Perkins, whose sole wartime business activ\nity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at\nhome in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to\nthe State, see supra, at 4–5, fall far short of the “the con\ntinuous and systematic general business contacts” neces\nsary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against\nthem on claims unrelated to anything that connects them\nto the State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.5\n                           C\n  Respondents belatedly assert a “single enterprise” the\nory, asking us to consolidate petitioners’ ties to North\nCarolina with those of Goodyear USA and other Goodyear\nentities. See Brief for Respondents 44–50. In effect,\n——————\n  5 As earlier noted, see supra, at 6, the North Carolina Court of Ap\n\npeals invoked the State’s “well-recognized interest in providing a forum\nin which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have\nsustained.” 199 N. C. App., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. But “[g]eneral\njurisdiction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been\nbased on the plaintiff’s relationship to the forum. There is nothing in\n[our] law comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804)\nunder which the French nationality of the plaintiff is a sufficient\nground for jurisdiction.” von Mehren & Trautman 1137; see Clermont\n& Palmer, Exorbitant Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492–495 (2006)\n(French law permitting plaintiff-based jurisdiction is rarely invoked\nin the absence of other supporting factors). When a defendant’s act\noutside the forum causes injury in the forum, by contrast, a plaintiff’s\nresidence in the forum may strengthen the case for the exercise of\nspecific jurisdiction. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788 (1984); von\nMehren & Trautman 1167–1173.\n14        GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.\n                        v.

See Brilmayer &\nPaisley, Personal Jurisdiction and Substantive Legal\nRelations: Corporations, Conspiracies, and Agency, 74 Cal.\nL. Rev. 1, 14, 29–30 (1986) (merging parent and subsidiary\nfor jurisdictional purposes requires an inquiry “compara\nble to the corporate law question of piercing the corporate\nveil”). But see 199 N. C. App., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392\n(North Carolina Court of Appeals understood that peti\ntioners are “separate corporate entities . . . not directly re\nsponsible for the presence in North Carolina of tires that\nthey had manufactured”). Neither below nor in their brief\nin opposition to the petition for certiorari did respondents\nurge disregard of petitioners’ discrete status as subsidiar\nies and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a “unitary\nbusiness,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw\nin the subsidiaries as well.6 Brief for Respondents 44.\nRespondents have therefore forfeited this contention, and\nwe do not address it.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16).\n                        *     *    *\n   For the reasons stated, the judgment of the North Caro\nlina Court of Appeals is\n                                                 Reversed.\n——————\n  6 In the brief they filed in the North Carolina Court of Appeals, re\n\nspondents stated that petitioners were part of an “integrated world\nwide efforts to design, manufacture, market and sell their tires in the\nUnited States, including in North Carolina.” App. 485 (emphasis\nadded). See also Brief in Opposition 18. Read in context, that assertion\nwas offered in support of a narrower proposition: The distribution of\npetitioners’ tires in North Carolina, respondents maintained, demon\nstrated petitioners’ own “calculated and deliberate efforts to take\nadvantage of the North Carolina market.” App. 485. As already\nexplained, see supra, at 12–13, even regularly occurring sales of a\nproduct in a State do not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim\nunrelated to those sales.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/219732/", "sha1": "a72bdd7d6cd548120b11e06d8ef453440643b297", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-27T07:12:10"}
