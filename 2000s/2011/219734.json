Argued November 2, 2010\u2014Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondents, representing the video-game and software industries,\n  filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the\n  sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District\n  Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and\n  permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Act does not comport with the First Amendment. Pp. 2\u201318.\n    (a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like pro\n tected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through fa\n miliar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And\n \u201cthe basic principles of freedom of speech . . . do not vary\u201d with a new\n and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wil\n son, 343 U. S. 495, 503. The most basic principle\u2014that government\n lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas,\n subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Un\n ion, 535 U. S. 564, 573\u2014is subject to a few limited exceptions for his\n torically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fight\n ing words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of\n unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular\n category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the\n test. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the\n New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, Cali\n fornia\u2019s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of\n unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is\n not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to cre\n ate a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permis\n sible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and\n2         BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting chil\n    dren\u2019s access to depictions of violence. And California\u2019s claim that\n    \u201cinteractive\u201d video games present special problems, in that the player\n    participates in the violent action on screen and determines its out\n    come, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2\u201311.\n       (b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of pro\n    tected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it\n    passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government\n    interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St.\n    Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 395. California cannot meet that standard. Psy\n    chological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure\n    to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove\n    that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demon\n    strated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects pro\n    duced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those\n    other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regula\n    tion is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether\n    the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring\n    a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that\n    the Act\u2019s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents\n    who wish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent videos. The\n    video-game industry\u2019s voluntary rating system already accomplishes\n    that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the\n    Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are pro\n    hibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who dis\n    approve of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.\n    Pp. 11\u201318.\n556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.\n\n  SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\nGINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

Civ. Code\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a71746\u20131746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale\nor rental of \u201cviolent video games\u201d to minors, and requires\ntheir packaging to be labeled \u201c18.\u201d The Act covers games\n\u201cin which the range of options available to a player in\ncludes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually as\nsaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are\ndepicted\u201d in a manner that \u201c[a] reasonable person, consid\nering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant\nor morbid interest of minors,\u201d that is \u201cpatently offensive to\nprevailing standards in the community as to what is suit\nable for minors,\u201d and that \u201ccauses the game, as a whole, to\nlack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\nfor minors.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is pun\nishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. \u00a71746.3.\n2      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents, representing the video-game and software\nindustries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act\nin the United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of California. That court concluded that the Act\nviolated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined\nits enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwar\nzenegger, No. C\u201305\u201304188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software\nDealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9\n2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).\n                             II\n  California correctly acknowledges that video games\nqualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech\nClause exists principally to protect discourse on public\nmatters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to\ndistinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to\ntry. \u201cEveryone is familiar with instances of propaganda\nthrough fiction. What is one man\u2019s amusement, teaches\nanother\u2019s doctrine.\u201d Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507,\n510 (1948). Like the protected books, plays, and movies\nthat preceded them, video games communicate ideas\u2014and\neven social messages\u2014through many familiar literary\ndevices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and\nthrough features distinctive to the medium (such as the\nplayer\u2019s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices\nto confer First Amendment protection. Under our Consti\ntution, \u201cesthetic and moral judgments about art and lit\nerature . . . are for the individual to make, not for the\nGovernment to decree, even with the mandate or approval\nof a majority.\u201d United States v. Playboy Entertainment\nGroup, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). And whatever the\nchallenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing\ntechnology, \u201cthe basic principles of freedom of speech and\nthe press, like the First Amendment\u2019s command, do not\nvary\u201d when a new and different medium for communica\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S.\n495, 503 (1952).\n   The most basic of those principles is this: \u201c[A]s a general\nmatter, . . . government has no power to restrict expres\nsion because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or\nits content.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,\n535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). There are of course exceptions. \u201c \u2018From 1791 to the\npresent,\u2019 . . . the First Amendment has \u2018permitted restric\ntions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,\u2019\nand has never \u2018include[d] a freedom to disregard these\ntraditional limitations.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 382\u2013383 (1992)). These limited ar\neas\u2014such as obscenity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.\n476, 483 (1957), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395\nU. S. 444, 447\u2013449 (1969) (per curiam), and fighting\nwords, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568,\n572 (1942)\u2014represent \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited\nclasses of speech, the prevention and punishment of which\nhave never been thought to raise any Constitutional prob\nlem,\u201d id., at 571\u2013572.\n   Last Term, in Stevens, we held that new categories of\nunprotected speech may not be added to the list by a\nlegislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to\nbe tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purport\ning to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of cer\ntain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a748\n(amended 2010). The statute covered depictions \u201cin which\na living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tor\ntured, wounded, or killed\u201d if that harm to the animal was\nillegal where the \u201cthe creation, sale, or possession t[ook]\nplace,\u201d \u00a748(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from\nour obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15, 24 (1973), exempted depictions with \u201cserious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\n4        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nhistorical, or artistic value,\u201d \u00a748(b). We held that statute\nto be an impermissible content-based restriction on\nspeech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the\ndepiction of animal cruelty\u2014though States have long had\nlaws against committing it.\n   The Government argued in Stevens that lack of a his\ntorical warrant did not matter; that it could create new\ncategories of unprotected speech by applying a \u201csimple\nbalancing test\u201d that weighs the value of a particular cate\ngory of speech against its social costs and then punishes\nthat category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that\n\u201cstartling and dangerous\u201d proposition. Ibid. \u201cMaybe there\nare some categories of speech that have been historically\nunprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified\nor discussed as such in our case law.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel re\nstriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrec\nognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not\nrevise the \u201cjudgment [of] the American people,\u201d embodied\nin the First Amendment, \u201cthat the benefits of its restric\ntions on the Government outweigh the costs.\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 7).\n   That holding controls this case.1 As in Stevens, Califor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 JUSTICE ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to\n\nus ill founded. He suggests, post, at 10 (opinion concurring in judg\nment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we\ndoubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 9, 10,\nthat the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the\n\u201ccreation\u201d or \u201cpossession\u201d of violent depictions. That distinction ap\npears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make\npermissible the prohibition of printing or selling books\u2014though not the\nwriting of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating,\ndistributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally,\nJUSTICE ALITO points out, post, at 10, that Stevens \u201cleft open the possi\nbility that a more narrowly drawn statute\u201d would be constitutional.\nTrue, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnia has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like\nobscenity regulation by appending a saving clause re\nquired for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases\nhave been clear that the obscenity exception to the First\nAmendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds\nshocking, but only depictions of \u201csexual conduct,\u201d Miller,\nsupra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15,\n20 (1971); Roth, supra, at 487, and n. 20.\n   Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and\nrejected a State\u2019s attempt to shoehorn speech about vio\nlence into obscenity. In Winters, we considered a New\nYork criminal statute \u201cforbid[ding] the massing of stories\nof bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime\nagainst the person,\u201d 333 U. S., at 514. The New York\nCourt of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against\nobscenity. \u201c[T]here can be no more precise test of written\nindecency or obscenity,\u201d it said, \u201cthan the continuing and\nchangeable experience of the community as to what types\nof books are likely to bring about the corruption of public\nmorals or other analogous injury to the public order. \u201d Id.,\nat 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of\ncourse the same expansive view of governmental power to\nabridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing\nthat we rejected in Stevens. Our opinion in Winters, which\nconcluded that the New York statute failed a heightened\nvagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech\nentitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517\u2013\n519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity\nthat the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech\nreached by the statute contained \u201cno indecency or obscen\nity in any sense heretofore known to the law.\u201d Id., at 519.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n19), that the \u201ccrush-video\u201d statute at issue there might pass muster if it\nwere limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law\nwhere the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the\nvirtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are\ncriminally liable.\n6        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no\nconsequence that California\u2019s statute mimics the New\nYork statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we\nupheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968).\nThat case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of\nsexual material that would be obscene from the perspec\ntive of a child.2 We held that the legislature could\n\u201cadjus[t] the definition of obscenity \u2018to social realities by\npermitting the appeal of this type of material to be as\nsessed in terms of the sexual interests . . .\u2019 of . . . minors. \u201d\nId., at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,\n509 (1966)). And because \u201cobscenity is not protected\nexpression,\u201d the New York statute could be sustained so\nlong as the legislature\u2019s judgment that the proscribed\nmaterials were harmful to children \u201cwas not irrational.\u201d\n390 U. S., at 641.\n   The California Act is something else entirely. It does\nnot adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unpro\ntected speech to ensure that a definition designed for\nadults is not uncritically applied to children. California\ndoes not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling\noffensively violent works to adults\u2014and it is wise not to,\nsince that is but a hair\u2019s breadth from the argument re\njected in Stevens. Instead, it wishes to create a wholly\nnew category of content-based regulation that is permissi\nble only for speech directed at children.\n   That is unprecedented and mistaken. \u201c[M]inors are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of\n\n\u201cnudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,\u201d\nthat were \u201c\u2018[h]armful to minors.\u2019 \u201d A depiction was harmful to minors if it:\n  \u201c(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid\ninterests of minors, and\n  \u201c(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult commu\nnity as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and\n  \u201c(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\u201d 390\nU. S., at 646 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (quoting N. Y. Penal\nLaw \u00a7484\u2013h(1)(f)).\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to a significant measure of First Amendment\nprotection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined\ncircumstances may government bar public dissemination\nof protected materials to them.\u201d Erznoznik v. Jackson\nville, 422 U. S. 205, 212\u2013213 (1975) (citation omitted). No\ndoubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect chil\ndren from harm, Ginsberg, supra, at 640\u2013641; Prince v.\nMassachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944), but that does\nnot include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to\nwhich children may be exposed. \u201cSpeech that is neither\nobscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate\nproscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the\nyoung from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks\nunsuitable for them.\u201d Erznoznik, supra, at 213\u2013214.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE  THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that\npersons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to\nwithout their parents\u2019 consent. He cites no case, state or federal,\nsupporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his\ndissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had\nthe power to control what their children hear and say. This is true\nenough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power\nto enforce parental prohibitions\u2014to require, for example, that the\npromoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have\nadvised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But\nit does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from\nhearing or saying anything without their parents\u2019 prior consent. The\nlatter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit\npersons under 18 to a political rally without their parents\u2019 prior written\nconsent\u2014even a political rally in support of laws against corporal\npunishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors.\nAnd what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good\nfor First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made crimi\nnal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a\nreligious tract, without his parents\u2019 prior consent. Our point is not, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS believes, post, at 16, n. 2, merely that such laws are\n\u201cundesirable.\u201d They are obviously an infringement upon the religious\nfreedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young\npeople. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children\u2019s\nspeech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only\n8        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  California\u2019s argument would fare better if there were a\nlongstanding tradition in this country of specially restrict\ning children\u2019s access to depictions of violence, but there is\nnone. Certainly the books we give children to read\u2014or\nread to them when they are younger\u2014contain no shortage\nof gore. Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim in\ndeed.

The latter feature is nothing new: Since\nat least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugar\ncane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own\nadventure stories have been able to make decisions that\ndetermine the plot by following instructions about which\npage to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v.\nSt. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957\u2013958 (CA8 2003).

But it does arouse the reader\u2019s ire, and the\nreader\u2019s desire to put an end to this horrible message.\nThus, ironically, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s argument highlights the\nprecise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas\nexpressed by speech\u2014whether it be violence, or gore, or\nracism\u2014and not its objective effects, may be the real\nreason for governmental proscription.\n                             III\n  Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of\nprotected speech, it is invalid unless California can dem\nonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny\u2014that is, unless it is\njustified by a compelling government interest and is nar\nrowly drawn to serve that interest.

The State must specifically identify an \u201cactual prob\nlem\u201d in need of solving, Playboy, 529 U. S., at 822\u2013823,\nand the curtailment of free speech must be actually neces\nsary to the solution, see R. A. V., supra, at 395. That is a\ndemanding standard. \u201cIt is rare that a regulation restrict\ning speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\u201d\nPlayboy, supra, at 818.\n  California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it\nacknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link\nbetween violent video games and harm to minors. Rather,\nrelying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994), the State claims that it\nneed not produce such proof because the legislature can\nmake a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based\non competing psychological studies. But reliance on\nTurner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied\nintermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id.,\nat 661\u2013662. California\u2019s burden is much higher, and\nbecause it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy,\nsupra, at 816\u2013817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.\n  The State\u2019s evidence is not compelling. California relies\nprimarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few\nother research psychologists whose studies purport to\nshow a connection between exposure to violent video\ngames and harmful effects on children. These studies\nhave been rejected by every court to consider them,6 and\nwith good reason: They do not prove that violent video\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Video Software Dealers Assn. v.

The studies in\nquestion pertain to that new and rapidly evolving technology, and fail\nto show, with the degree of certitude that strict scrutiny requires, that\nthis subject-matter restriction on speech is justified.

ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict\nSaturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for\nyoung children, or the distribution of pictures of guns.\nThe consequence is that its regulation is wildly underin\nclusive when judged against its asserted justification,\nwhich in our view is alone enough to defeat it. Underin\nclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the gov\nernment is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather\nthan disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See\nCity of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994); Florida\nStar v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989). Here, Califor\nnia has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfa\nvored treatment\u2014at least when compared to booksellers,\ncartoonists, and movie producers\u2014and has given no per\nsuasive reason why.\n   The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another\nrespect\u2014and a respect that renders irrelevant the conten\ntions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play\nthem. But there are all sorts of \u201cproblems\u201d\u2014some of them surely more\nserious than this one\u2014that cannot be addressed by governmental\nrestriction of free expression: for example, the problem of encouraging\nanti-Semitism (National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S.\n43 (1977) (per curiam)), the problem of spreading a political philosophy\nhostile to the Constitution (Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290 (1961)),\nor the problem of encouraging disrespect for the Nation\u2019s flag (Texas v.\nJohnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989)).\n  JUSTICE BREYER would hold that California has satisfied strict\nscrutiny based upon his own research into the issue of the harmfulness\nof violent video games. See post, at 20\u201335 (Appendixes to dissenting\nopinion) (listing competing academic articles discussing the harmful\nness vel non of violent video games). The vast preponderance of this\nresearch is outside the record\u2014and in any event we do not see how it\ncould lead to JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s conclusion, since he admits he cannot\nsay whether the studies on his side are right or wrong.

The California Legislature is perfectly willing to\nleave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands\nof children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle)\nsays it\u2019s OK. And there are not even any requirements as\nto how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be\nverified; apparently the child\u2019s or putative parent\u2019s, aunt\u2019s,\nor uncle\u2019s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a\nserious social problem.\n   California claims that the Act is justified in aid of pa\nrental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent\nvideo games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures\nthat parents can decide what games are appropriate. At\nthe outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties\nfor conveying protected speech to children just in case\ntheir parents disapprove of that speech is a proper gov\nernmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting\nthat position would largely vitiate the rule that \u201conly in\nrelatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may\ngovernment bar public dissemination of protected materi\nals to [minors].\u201d Erznoznik, 422 U. S., at 212\u2013213.\n   But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the\nAct\u2019s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who\nwish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent video\ngames but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in\nplace a voluntary rating system designed to inform con\nsumers about the content of games. The system, imple\nmented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board\n(ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game\nsubmitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+\n(Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and\nAO (Adults Only\u201418 and older). App. 86. The Video\nSoftware Dealers Association encourages retailers to\nprominently display information about the ESRB system\nin their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults\nonly games to minors; and to rent or sell \u201cM\u201d rated games\n16       BROWN v.

In 2009,\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a\nresult of this system, \u201cthe video game industry outpaces\nthe movie and music industries\u201d in \u201c(1) restricting target\nmarketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly\nand prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re\nstricting children\u2019s access to mature-rated products at\nretail.\u201d FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent\nEntertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http://\nwww.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/P994511violententertainment.pdf\n(as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure\nthat minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on\ntheir own, and that parents who care about the matter can\nreadily evaluate the games their children bring home.\nFilling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents\u2019\ncontrol can hardly be a compelling state interest.9\n   And finally, the Act\u2019s purported aid to parental author\nity is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are\nforbidden to purchase violent video games on their own\nhave parents who care whether they purchase violent\nvideo games. While some of the legislation\u2019s effect may\nindeed be in support of what some parents of the re\nstricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in\nsupport of what the State thinks parents ought to want.\nThis is not the narrow tailoring to \u201cassisting parents\u201d that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE  BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling\nbecause, according to the FTC\u2019s report, some \u201c20% of those under 17 are\nstill able to buy M-rated games.\u201d Post, at 18 (citing FTC Report 28).\nBut some gap in compliance is unavoidable.

Our task is only to say\nwhether or not such works constitute a \u201cwell-defined and\nnarrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and\npunishment of which have never been thought to raise any\nConstitutional problem,\u201d Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 571\u2013\n572 (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the\nregulation of such works is justified by that high degree of\nnecessity we have described as a compelling state interest\n(it is not). Even where the protection of children is the\nobject, the constitutional limits on governmental action\napply.\n   California\u2019s legislation straddles the fence between (1)\naddressing a serious social problem and (2) helping con\ncerned parents control their children. Both ends are\nlegitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights\nthey must be pursued by means that are neither seriously\nunderinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546\n(1993).

Although the California statute is well\nintentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision\nthat the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with\nthe Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.\n   I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. In considering the application of un\nchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly\nevolving technology, this Court should proceed with cau\ntion. We should make every effort to understand the new\ntechnology. We should take into account the possibility\nthat developing technology may have important societal\nimplications that will become apparent only with time.\nWe should not jump to the conclusion that new technology\nis fundamentally the same as some older thing with which\nwe are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the\njudgment of legislators, who may be in a better position\n2          BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthan we are to assess the implications of new technology.\nThe opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.\n  In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the\neffects of violent video games\u2014federal and state legisla\ntors, educators, social scientists, and parents\u2014are unduly\nfearful, for violent video games really present no serious\nproblem. See ante, at 10\u201313, 15\u201316. Spending hour upon\nhour controlling the actions of a character who guns down\nscores of innocent victims is not different in \u201ckind\u201d from\nreading a description of violence in a work of literature.\nSee ante, at 10\u201311.\n  The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to\nsuspect that the experience of playing violent video games\njust might be very different from reading a book, listening\nto the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.\n                             I\n   Respondents in this case, representing the video-game\nindustry, ask us to strike down the California law on two\ngrounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the\nnarrower ground that the law\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent video\ngame,\u201d see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009),\nis impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23\u201361.\nBecause I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to\nreach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by\nthe Court.1\n                             A\n  Due process requires that laws give people of ordinary\nintelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.

These principles apply to\nlaws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting\nchildren. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U. S.\n676, 689 (1968).\n  Here, the California law does not define \u201cviolent video\ngames\u201d with the \u201cnarrow specificity\u201d that the Constitution\ndemands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment prob\nlems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video\ngame statute on the New York law that this Court upheld\nin Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968)\u2014a law that\nprohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to\nminors, see id., at 631\u2013633. But the California Legisla\nture departed from the Ginsberg model in an important\nrespect, and the legislature overlooked important differ\nences between the materials falling within the scope of the\ntwo statutes.\n                            B\n  The law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to\nminors of materials that were deemed \u201charmful to mi\nnors,\u201d and the law defined \u201charmful to minors\u201d simply by\nadding the words \u201cfor minors\u201d to each element of the\n4      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                 ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndefinition of obscenity set out in what were then the\nCourt\u2019s leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United\nStates, 354 U. S. 476 (1957), and Book Named \u201cJohn Cle\nland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney Gen\neral of Mass., 383 U. S. 413 (1966).\n   Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the\nprotection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began\nwith the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests\npreviously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature\nthen made certain modifications to accommodate the aim\nof the violent video game law.\n   Under Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh\nold limitation that restricts the statute\u2019s scope to specifi\ncally described \u201chard core\u201d materials. See 413 U. S.,\nat 23\u201325, 27. Materials that fall within this \u201chard core\u201d\ncategory may be deemed to be obscene if three additional\nrequirements are met:\n     (1) an \u201caverage person, applying contemporary com\n     munity standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a\n     whole, appeals to the prurient interest\u201d;\n     (2) \u201cthe work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a pat\n     ently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically de\n     fined by the applicable state law; and\u201d\n     (3) \u201cthe work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious\n     literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d Id., at\n     24 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Adapting these standards, the California law imposes\nthe following threshold limitation: \u201c[T]he range of options\navailable to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming,\ndismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a hu\nman being.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this\nthreshold test is subject to the law\u2019s restrictions if it also\nsatisfies three further requirements:\n       \u201c(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

As noted, the\nGinsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and\nthe current adult obscenity test, which was set out in\nMiller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold\nlimitation that restricts the statute\u2019s coverage to specifi\ncally defined \u201chard core\u201d depictions. See 413 U. S., at 23\u2013\n25, 27. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute\nthat applies to only \u201c[p]atently offensive representations\nor descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\u201d \u201cmasturbation,\nexcretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d\nId., at 25. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold\nlimitation as serving a vital notice function. \u201cWe are\nsatisfied,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cthat these specific prerequi\nsites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials\nthat his public and commercial activities may bring prose\ncution.\u201d Id., at 27; see also Reno, supra, at 873 (observing\nthat Miller\u2019s threshold limitation \u201creduces the vagueness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold require\n\nment set out in text also qualifies as \u201cviolent\u201d if it \u201c[e]nables the player\nto virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or\ncharacters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which\nis especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or\nserious physical abuse to the victim.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of\nAppeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is uncon\nstitutional, 556 F. 3d 950, 954, n. 5 (CA9 2009), and therefore only the\nrequirements set out in text are now before us.\n6       BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninherent in the open-ended term \u2018patently offensive\u2019 \u201d).3\n  By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California\nlaw does not perform the narrowing function served by the\nlimitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided,\ndepictions of \u201chard core\u201d sexual conduct were not a com\nmon feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing\nsimilar can be said about much of the conduct covered by\nthe California law. It provides that a video game cannot\nqualify as \u201cviolent\u201d unless \u201cthe range of options available\nto a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or\nsexually assaulting an image of a human being.\u201d\n\u00a71746(d)(1).\n  For better or worse, our society has long regarded many\ndepictions of killing and maiming4 as suitable features of\npopular entertainment, including entertainment that is\nwidely available to minors. The California law\u2019s threshold\nrequirement would more closely resemble the limitation in\nMiller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.\n  Because of this feature of the California law\u2019s threshold\ntest, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part\nto the three requirements that follow, but those elements\nare also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video\ngame law, the California Legislature could have made its\nown judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence\nthat is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors\nin particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied\non undefined societal or community standards.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was con\n\nvicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision\napplied to depictions of \u201cnudity\u201d and \u201csexual conduct,\u201d and both those\nterms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U. S., at\n645\u2013647 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).\n  4 The California law does not define the term \u201cmaiming,\u201d nor has the\n\nState cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this\ncontext. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning,\nwhich includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly\nto \u201cprevailing standards in the community as to what is\nsuitable for minors.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element\npoints in the same direction, asking whether \u201c[a] reason\nable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\u201d would find\nthat it \u201cappeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\u201d\n\u00a71746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\n   The terms \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cmorbid\u201d are not defined in\nthe statute, and California offers no reason to think that\nits courts would give the terms anything other than their\nordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (argu\ning that \u201c[a] reasonable person can make this judgment\nthrough . . . a common understanding and definition of the\napplicable terms\u201d). I therefore assume that \u201cdeviant\u201d and\n\u201cmorbid\u201d carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary\nspeech. The adjective \u201cdeviant\u201d ordinarily means \u201cdeviat\ning . . . from some accepted norm,\u201d and the term \u201cmorbid\u201d\nmeans \u201cof, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\u201d Web\nster\u2019s 618, 1469. A \u201cdeviant or morbid interest\u201d in\nviolence, therefore, appears to be an interest that de\nviates from what is regarded\u2014presumably in accordance\nwith some generally accepted standard\u2014as normal and\nhealthy. Thus, the application of the California law is\nheavily dependent on the identification of generally ac\ncepted standards regarding the suitability of violent enter\ntainment for minors.\n   The California Legislature seems to have assumed that\nthese standards are sufficiently well known so that a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to\nwhether the kind and degree of violence in a particular\ngame is enough to qualify the game as \u201cviolent.\u201d And\nbecause the Miller test looks to community standards, the\nlegislature may have thought that the use of undefined\ncommunity standards in the violent video game law would\nnot present vagueness problems.\n   There is a critical difference, however, between obscen\n8      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment.\nBy the time of this Court\u2019s landmark obscenity cases in\nthe 1960\u2019s, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth,\n354 U. S., at 484\u2013485, and this experience had helped to\nshape certain generally accepted norms concerning ex\npression related to sex.\n   There is no similar history regarding expression related\nto violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains\ndescriptions of great violence, and even children\u2019s stories\nsometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 8\u20139.\n   Although our society does not generally regard all depic\ntions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the\nprevalence of violent depictions in children\u2019s literature and\nentertainment creates numerous opportunities for reason\nable people to disagree about which depictions may excite\n\u201cdeviant\u201d or \u201cmorbid\u201d impulses. See Edwards & Berman,\nRegulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1487,\n1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be diffi\ncult to apply to violent expression because \u201cthere is noth\ning even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\u201d).\n   Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community\nstandards incorporated into the California law is com\npounded by the legislature\u2019s decision to lump all minors\ntogether. The California law draws no distinction between\nyoung children and adolescents who are nearing the age of\nmajority.\n   In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney\ndefending the constitutionality of the California law said\nthat the State would accept a narrowing construction of\nthe law under which the law\u2019s references to \u201cminors\u201d\nwould be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors\u2014that is,\nthose just short of 18.

S.\n157, 174 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).\n   In this case, California has not provided any evidence\nthat the California Legislature intended the law to be\nlimited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts\nthat would support an \u201coldest minors\u201d construction.5\n   For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent\nvideo game law fails to provide the fair notice that the\nConstitution requires. And I would go no further. I would\nnot express any view on whether a properly drawn statute\nwould or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.\nWe should address that question only if and when it is\nnecessary to do so.\n                           II\n  Having outlined how I would decide this case, I will now\nbriefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wis\ndom of the Court\u2019s approach. Some of these reasons are\ntouched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared\nat this time to go as far as either JUSTICE THOMAS or\nJUSTICE BREYER, they raise valid concerns.\n                              A\n  The Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United\nStates v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), \u201ccontrols this case.\u201d\nAnte, at 4. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply\nfrom the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law\nthat broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling,\nor possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial\ngain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 At oral argument, California also proposed that the term \u201cminors\u201d\n\ncould be interpreted as referring to the \u201ctypical age group of minors\u201d\nwho play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law\u2019s\ntext supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions\nindicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there\nis nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.\n10     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlimited to the sale or rental of violent video games to\nminors. The California law imposes no restriction on the\ncreation of violent video games, or on the possession of\nsuch games by anyone, whether above or below the age of\n18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental\nof violent games by adults. And the California law does\nnot prevent parents and certain other close relatives from\nbuying or renting violent games for their children or other\nyoung relatives if they see fit.\n  Second, Stevens does not support the proposition that a\nlaw like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The\nportion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s contention that depictions of animal cruelty\nwere categorically outside the range of any First Amend\nment protection. 559 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5). Going\nwell beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law\nthat attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent\nvideo games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the\nmore lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U. S. 629,\nour most closely related precedent. As a result of today\u2019s\ndecision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what\nGinsberg described as \u201cgirlie magazines,\u201d but a State must\nsurmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable)\nobstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing\nthe most violent and depraved video games imaginable.\n  Third, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a\nmore narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of\nanimal cruelty might be compatible with the First\nAmendment. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In this\ncase, the Court\u2019s sweeping opinion will likely be read by\nmany, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as\nsuggesting that no regulation of minors\u2019 access to violent\nvideo games is allowed\u2014at least without supporting evi\ndence that may not be realistically obtainable given the\nnature of the phenomenon in question.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

I certainly agree with the Court that the government\nhas no \u201cfree-floating power to restrict the ideas to which\nchildren may be exposed,\u201d ante, at 7, but the California\nlaw does not exercise such a power. If parents want their\nchild to have a violent video game, the California law does\nnot interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the\nCalifornia law reinforces parental decisionmaking in\nexactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in\nGinsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from\npurchasing certain materials; and under both laws, par\nents are free to supply their children with these items if\nthat is their wish.\n  Citing the video-game industry\u2019s voluntary rating sys\ntem, the Court argues that the California law does not\n\u201cmeet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict\ntheir children\u2019s access to violent video games but cannot\ndo so.\u201d Ante, at 15. The Court does not mention the fact\nthat the industry adopted this system in response to the\nthreat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard,\nInc., as Amicus Curiae 7\u201310, a threat that the Court\u2019s\nopinion may now be seen as largely eliminating.

And on this point, the game developers\nare surely correct.\n   It is certainly true, as the Court notes, that \u201c \u2018[l]it\nerature, when it is successful draws the reader into the\nstory, makes him identify with the characters, invites\nhim to judge them and quarrel with them, to experience\ntheir joys and sufferings as the reader\u2019s own.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11\n(quoting American Amusement Machine Assn. v. Kendrick,\n244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001)). But only an extraordinar\nily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing\nin a literary work will experience that event as vividly as\nhe might if he played the role of the killer in a video game.\nTo take an example, think of a person who reads the\npassage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolni-\nkov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F.\nDostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library\ned. 1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player\nwho creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees\na realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing\nin high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to\ndecide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do\nso; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the\nhead of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears\nthe thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain;\nwho sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on\nhis face and hands. For most people, the two experiences\nwill not be the same.19\n   When all of the characteristics of video games are taken\ninto account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 As the Court notes, there are a few children\u2019s books that ask young\n\nreaders to step into the shoes of a character and to make choices that\ntake the stories along one of a very limited number of possible lines.\nSee ante, at 10. But the very nature of the print medium makes it\nimpossible for a book to offer anything like the same number of choices\nas those provided by a video game.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See, e.g., J.\nReinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood,\n1775\u20131850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children\ncame to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank\nslates requiring careful and deliberate development. But\nthe same overarching principles remained. Parents con\ntinued to have both the right and duty to ensure the\nproper development of their children. They exercised\nsignificant authority over their children, including control\nover the books that children read. And laws at the time\ncontinued to reflect strong support for parental author-\nity and the sense that children were not fit to govern\nthemselves.\n                           1\n    The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Brewer, By\nBirth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Cal\nvert, Children in the House 59\u201360 (1992) (hereinafter\nCalvert). Locke taught that children\u2019s minds were blank\nslates and that parents therefore had to be careful and\ndeliberate about what their children were told and ob\nserved. Parents had only themselves to blame if, \u201cby hu\nmouring and cockering\u201d their children, they \u201cpoison\u2019d\nthe fountain\u201d and later \u201ctaste[d] the bitter waters.\u201d Some\nThoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English\nPhilosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\n27\u201328 (C.

All vices, he explained, were\nsowed by parents and \u201cthose about children.\u201d Id., at 29.\nSignificantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing paren\ntal authority but rather articulated a new basis for it.\nRousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but\nhis philosophy was similarly premised on parental control\nover a child\u2019s development. Although Rousseau advocated\nthat children should be allowed to develop naturally, he\ninstructed that the environment be directed by \u201ca tutor\nwho is given total control over the child and who removes\nhim from society, from all competing sources of authority\nand influence.\u201d J.

Children were increasingly viewed as\nmalleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an\nimportant period of growth, development, and preparation\nfor adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Gross\nberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Gross\nberg).

See, e.g., Letter to Martha Jefferson (Nov. 28, 1783),\nin S.

John Abbott, the author of The Mother\nat Home, likewise advised that \u201c[o]bedience is absolutely\nessential to proper family government.\u201d Abbott 18.

Stories written for children were dedicated to\nmoral instruction and were relatively austere, lacking\ndetails that might titillate children\u2019s minds. See MacLeod\n24\u201325, 42\u201348; see also id., at 42 (\u201cThe authors of juvenile\nfiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the\nname of duty, and for the sake of giving children what\nthey thought children should have, although they were\noften well aware that children might prefer more excit\ning fare\u201d); Francis, American Children\u2019s Literature,\n1646\u20131880, in American Childhood 208\u2013209 (J.

John Newbery, the publisher often\ncredited with creating the genre of children\u2019s literature,\nremoved traditional folk characters, like Tom Thumb,\nfrom their original stories and placed them in new moral\nity tales in which good children were rewarded and dis\nobedient children punished.

According to Sir\nWilliam Blackstone, parents were responsible for main\ntaining, protecting, and education their children, and\ntherefore had \u201cpower\u201d over their children. 1 Commentar\nies on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 712 (1997) (Blackstone\u2019s\nCommentaries was \u201ca primary legal authority for 18th-\nand 19th-century American lawyers\u201d). Chancellor James\nKent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189\u2013\n*207. The law entitled parents to \u201cthe custody of their\n[children],\u201d \u201cthe value of th[e] [children\u2019s] labor and ser\nvices,\u201d and the \u201cright to the exercise of such discipline as\nmay be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\u201d\nId., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with\n\u201cobedience and assistance during their own minority, and\ngratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.\u201d Id.,\nat *207.\n  Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents\nhad a right to the child\u2019s labor and services until the child\nreached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusetts explained, \u201cThere is no question but that a\nfather, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and\nfor whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common\nlaw, assign those services to others, for a consideration to\nenure to himself.\u201d Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see\nalso Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opin\nion of Parsons, C. J.) (\u201cThe law is very well settled, that\nparents are under obligations to support their children,\n14     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand that they are entitled to their earnings\u201d). Similarly,\nthe Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted\nthat the right of parents to recover for the services of their\nchild, while a minor, \u201ccannot be contested.\u201d Gale v. Parrot,\n1 N. H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits\nagainst those who knowingly enticed a minor away from\nthem. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276 (S. C.\nConstitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 4 Litt. 25 (Ky.\nApp. 1823).\n   Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without\nparental consent. Many of those who did so during the\nRevolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers\nwere entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Sol\ndiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21\u201324. And\nafter the war, minors who enlisted without parental con\nsent in violation of federal law could find themselves\nreturned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their\nparents\u2019 request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24\nF. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth\nv. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) (per curiam).\n   Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without\nparental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least\n1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the\nmarriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at\nLarge of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds.\n1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of\nPennsylvania 82\u201383 (J. Dunlop 2d ed. 1849) (including the\n1730 marriage law with no amendments); see also Perpet\nual Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 253\n(1788), in The First Laws of the Commonwealth of Massa\nchusetts (J.

See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could\nthey swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at\nLarge 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens\nthe ability to become citizens provided that those under 21\nwere deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize.\nSee, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29,\n1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.\n                              C\n   The history clearly shows a founding generation that\nbelieved parents to have complete authority over their\nminor children and expected parents to direct the devel\nopment of those children. The Puritan tradition in New\nEngland laid the foundation of American parental author\nity and duty. See MacDonald 6 (\u201cThe Puritans are virtu\nally the inventors of the family as we know it today\u201d). In\nthe decades leading up to and following the Revolution,\nthe conception of the child\u2019s mind evolved but the duty and\nauthority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer\nattention to potential influences on children than before.\nSee Mintz 72 (\u201cBy weakening earlier forms of patriarchal\nauthority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of\nchildrearing and education in ensuring social stability\u201d).\nTeachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children\u2019s\nreading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected\nthese concerns and often supported parental authority\nwith the coercive power of the state.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n  In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly\nhave understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include an\nunqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am\nsure that the founding generation would not have under\n16       BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include a right to speak to\nchildren without going through their parents. As a conse\nquence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech\u2014\nfor example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a\nminor\u2014\u201cabridg[e] the freedom of speech\u201d within the origi\nnal meaning of the First Amendment.\n   We have recently noted that this Court does not have\n\u201cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of\nspeech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\u201d Ste\nvens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But we also recog\nnized that there may be \u201csome categories of speech that\nhave been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been\nspecifically identified or discussed as such in our case\nlaw.\u201d Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here\nplainly reveals one such category.2\n                            B\n  Admittedly, the original public understanding of a\nconstitutional provision does not always comport with\nmodern sensibilities.    See Morse, 551 U. S., at 419\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students \u201cas though it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The majority responds that \u201cit does not follow\u201d from the historical\n\nevidence \u201cthat the state has the power to prevent children from hearing\n. . . anything without their parents\u2019 prior consent.\u201d Ante, at 7, n. 3.\nSuch a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its\nview, would be undesirable and \u201cobviously\u201d unconstitutional. Ibid.\n    The majority\u2019s circular argument misses the point. The question is\nnot whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators\ntoday, but rather what the public likely understood \u201cthe freedom of\nspeech\u201d to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District\nof Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 634\u2013635 (2008). I believe it is\nclear that the founding public would not have understood \u201cthe freedom\nof speech\u201d to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.\nIt follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state\nregulation of such speech. To note that there may not be \u201cprecedent for\n[such] state control,\u201d ante, at 8, n. 3, \u201cis not to establish that [there] is a\nconstitutional right,\u201d McIntyre v.

Although much has\nchanged in this country since the Revolution, the notion\nthat parents have authority over their children and that\nthe law can support that authority persists today. For\nexample, at least some States make it a crime to lure or\nentice a minor away from the minor\u2019s parent. See, e.g.,\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes\na minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial\nconsent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 558 (Ap\npendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than\n18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental\nconsent. 10 U. S. C. \u00a7505(a). And minors remain subject\nto curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana\net al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent\nto most medical procedures, id., at 15.\n  Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot\ndo at all, whether they have parental consent or not.\nState laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.\nSee Roper, supra, at 581\u2013585 (Appendixes B and C to\nopinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here),\nminors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal.\nVeh. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase\ntobacco, Cal.

Probate\nCode Ann. \u00a76220 (West 2009).\n  My understanding of \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d is also\nconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents. To be sure, the\n18     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt has held that children are entitled to the protection\nof the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jackson\nville, 422 U. S. 205, 212\u2013213 (1975), and the government\nmay not unilaterally dictate what children can say or\nhear, see id., at 213\u2013214; Tinker v. Des Moines Independ\nent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511 (1969).\nBut this Court has never held, until today, that \u201cthe free\ndom of speech\u201d includes a right to speak to minors (or a\nright of minors to access speech) without going through\nthe minors\u2019 parents. To the contrary, \u201c[i]t is well settled\nthat a State or municipality can adopt more stringent\ncontrols on communicative materials available to youths\nthan on those available to adults.\u201d Erznoznik, supra, at\n212; cf. post, at 3 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n  The Court\u2019s constitutional jurisprudence \u201chistorically\nhas reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as\na unit with broad parental authority over minor children.\u201d\nParham v.

Under that\ncase law, \u201clegislature[s] [can] properly conclude that par\nents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . pri\nmary responsibility for children\u2019s well-being are entitled to\nthe support of laws designed to aid discharge of that re\nsponsibility.\u201d Ginsberg v.

The Court holds\nthat video games are speech for purposes of the First\nAmendment and finds the statute facially unconstitu\ntional. See ante, at 2\u20133, 11\u201317. I disagree.\n   Under any of this Court\u2019s standards for a facial First\nAmendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game\nassociations cannot show \u201cthat no set of circumstances\nexists under which [the law] would be valid,\u201d \u201cthat\nthe statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d or that\n\u201ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitu\ntional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Stevens, 559 U.

All that the law\ndoes is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video\ngame to a minor by someone other than the minor\u2019s par\nent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a\nminor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law\ndoes not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video\n20       BROWN v.

In the typical\ncase, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a\nminor\u2019s parent or guardian. Because such speech does not\nfall within \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d as originally under\nstood, California\u2019s law does not ordinarily implicate the\nFirst Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.3\n                         *  *     *\n  \u201cThe freedom of speech,\u201d as originally understood, does\nnot include a right to speak to minors without going\nthrough the minors\u2019 parents or guardians.

Moreover, it is more difficult to\nmount a facial First Amendment attack on a statute that\nseeks to regulate activity that involves action as well as\nspeech. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 614\u2013\n615 (1973). Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within\nwhich I believe the State can legitimately apply its stat\u00ad\nute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age\ncutoff used by the industry\u2019s own ratings system), of\nhighly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable\ngame maker would know meet the Act\u2019s criteria. That\narea lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that\nthe number of instances in which the State will enforce\nthe statute within that area is comparatively large, and\nthat the number outside that area (for example, sales to\n17-year-olds) is comparatively small. And the activity the\nstatute regulates combines speech with action (a virtual\nform of target practice).\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

In doing so,\nthe special First Amendment category I find relevant is\nnot (as the Court claims) the category of \u201cdepictions of\nviolence,\u201d ante, at 8, but rather the category of \u201cprotection\nof children.\u201d This Court has held that the \u201cpower of the\nstate to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the\nscope of its authority over adults.\u201d Prince v. Massachu\nsetts, 321 U. S. 158, 170 (1944). And the \u201c \u2018regulatio[n] of\ncommunication addressed to [children] need not conform\nto the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the\nsame way as those applicable to adults.\u2019 \u201d Ginsberg v. New\nYork, 390 U. S. 629, 638, n. 6 (1968) (quoting Emerson,\nToward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72\nYale L. J. 877, 939 (1963)).\n   The majority\u2019s claim that the California statute, if up\u00ad\nheld, would create a \u201cnew categor[y] of unprotected\nspeech,\u201d ante, at 3, 6, is overstated. No one here argues\nthat depictions of violence, even extreme violence, auto\nmatically fall outside the First Amendment\u2019s protective\nscope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child\npornography. We properly speak of categories of expres\u00ad\nsion that lack protection when, like \u201cchild pornography,\u201d\nthe category is broad, when it applies automatically, and\nwhen the State can prohibit everyone, including adults,\nfrom obtaining access to the material within it. But\nwhere, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower\njudicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of\n\u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terror\u00ad\nist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations),\nwe do not normally describe the result as creating a \u201cnew\ncategory of unprotected speech.\u201d See Schenck v. United\nStates, 249 U. S. 47, 52 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. __ (2010).\n4        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                       BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Thus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all de\u00ad\npictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the\nFirst Amendment\u2019s protective scope, we went on to decide\nwhether the particular statute at issue violates the First\nAmendment under traditional standards; and we held\nthat, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid.\nSimilarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional\nFirst Amendment standards, this statute does, or does\nnot, pass muster.\n                             II\n   In my view, California\u2019s statute provides \u201cfair notice of\nwhat is prohibited,\u201d and consequently it is not impermis\u00ad\nsibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304\n(2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there\nconsidered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors\nof a\n       \u201cpicture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion pic\u00ad\n       ture film, or similar visual representation or image of\n       a person or portion of the human body which depicts\n       nudity . . . ,\u201d\nthat\n       \u201cpredominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or\n       morbid interest of minors,\u201d\nand\n       \u201cis patently offensive to prevailing standards in the\n       adult community as a whole with respect to what is\n       suitable material for minors,\u201d\nand\n       \u201cis utterly without redeeming social importance for\n       minors.\u201d 390 U.

Why are the words\n\u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and \u201cdismember\u201d any more difficult to\nunderstand than the word \u201cnudity?\u201d JUSTICE ALITO ob\u00ad\njects that these words do \u201cnot perform the narrowing\nfunction\u201d that this Court has required in adult obscenity\ncases, where statutes can only cover \u201c \u2018hard core\u2019 \u201d depic\u00ad\ntions. Ante, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment). But\nthe relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but\nto Ginsberg, which dealt with \u201cnudity,\u201d a category no more\n\u201cnarrow\u201d than killing and maiming. And in any event,\nnarrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have any\u00ad\nthing to do with one another. All that is required for\nvagueness purposes is that the terms \u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and\n\u201cdismember\u201d give fair notice as to what they cover, which\nthey do.\n   The remainder of California\u2019s definition copies, almost\nword for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.\nCalifornia, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), in permitting a total ban\non material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with\ncriminal penalties). The California law\u2019s reliance on\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d adheres to Miller, and in Fort\nWayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 57\u201358 (1989),\nthis Court specifically upheld the use of Miller\u2019s language\nagainst charges of vagueness. California only departed\nfrom the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It\n6      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsubstituted the word \u201cdeviant\u201d for the words \u201cprurient\u201d\nand \u201cshameful,\u201d and it three times added the words \u201cfor\nminors.\u201d The word \u201cdeviant\u201d differs from \u201cprurient\u201d and\n\u201cshameful,\u201d but it would seem no less suited to defining\nand narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition\nof \u201cfor minors\u201d to a version of the Miller standard was\napproved in Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 643, even though the\nNew York law \u201cdr[ew] no distinction between young chil\u00ad\ndren and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\u201d\nante, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\n   Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Gins\nberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the dif\u00ad\nficulty of the Court\u2019s long search for words capable of\nprotecting expression without depriving the State of a\nlegitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well\nknown, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do\nno better in defining obscenity than, \u201cI know it when I see\nit.\u201d Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) (concur\u00ad\nring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller\u2019s\nstandard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U. S.,\nat 39\u201340. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d tests used in Miller and Ginsberg.\nThey reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise\nstandard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify\ninstances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And\nthey seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free ex\u00ad\npression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the\nwords necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional\nobjective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304 (the Constitution\ndoes not always require \u201c \u2018perfect clarity and precise guid\u00ad\nance,\u2019 \u201d even when \u201c \u2018expressive activity\u2019 \u201d is involved).\n   What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and\nMiller on the one hand and the California law on the\nother? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which\nCalifornia\u2019s statute directly aims, involving, say, a charac\u00ad\nter who shoots out a police officer\u2019s knee, douses him with\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

(Foot-\nage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the\nrecord.) See also ante, at 14\u201315 (ALITO, J., concurring in\njudgment).

And it is easier here than in Miller\nor Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the\nstatute\u2019s border. That is because here the industry it-\nself has promulgated standards and created a review\nprocess, in which adults who \u201ctypically have experience\nwith children\u201d assess what games are inappropriate for\nminors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating\nProcess, online at http://www.esrb.org/ratings/&ratings_\nprocess.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24,\n2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg\nstatute concerned depictions of \u201cnudity,\u201d while California\u2019s\nstatute concerns extremely violent video games. But for\npurposes of vagueness, why should that matter? JUSTICE\nALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because\nthere are \u201ccertain generally accepted norms concerning\nexpression related to sex,\u201d whereas there are no similarly\n\u201caccepted standards regarding the suitability of violent\nentertainment.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. But there is no evidence\nthat is so. The Court relied on \u201ccommunity standards\u201d in\nMiller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating\n\u201caccepted norms\u201d about depictions of sex. I can find no\ndifference\u2014historical or otherwise\u2014that is relevant to the\nvagueness question. Indeed, the majority\u2019s examples of\nliterary descriptions of violence, on which JUSTICE ALITO\nrelies, do not show anything relevant at all.\n   After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more)\ndescriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence.\nIndeed, sex \u201chas been a theme in art and literature\n8      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthroughout the ages.\u201d Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n535 U. S. 234, 246 (2002). For every Homer, there is a\nTitian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the\nteenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm\u2019s\nFairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story\nof Lady Godiva.\n   Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif\u00ad\nferences between California\u2019s law and the New York law\nupheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness\nproblems, the state courts can cure them through inter\u00ad\npretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,\n216 (1975) (\u201c[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially\ninvalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing\nconstruction by the state courts\u201d). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at\n644 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals\nwould read a knowledge requirement into the statute);\nBerry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088\u2013\n1089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowl\u00ad\nedge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for pur\u00ad\nposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute\nunconstitutionally vague.\n                             III\n  Video games combine physical action with expression.\nWere physical activity to predominate in a game, govern\u00ad\nment could appropriately intervene, say by requiring\nparents to accompany children when playing a game in\u00ad\nvolving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of\ntoys presenting physical dangers to children. See gener\u00ad\nally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 3016 (\u201cTitle I\u2014Children\u2019s Product Safety\u201d). But\nbecause video games also embody important expressive\nand artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First\nAmendment significantly limits the State\u2019s power to regu\u00ad\nlate. And I would determine whether the State has ex\u00ad\nceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

American Civil\nLiberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874, 875, 879 (1997). I\nwould not apply this strict standard \u201cmechanically.\u201d\nUnited States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529\nU. S. 803, 841 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and O\u2019Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather,\nin applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the\nstatute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the\npotentially-justifying \u201ccompelling interests,\u201d the degree to\nwhich the statute furthers that interest, the nature and\neffectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this\nevaluation, whether, overall, \u201cthe statute works speech\u00ad\nrelated harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the\nstatute seeks to provide.\u201d Ibid. See also Burson v. Free\nman, 504 U. S. 191, 210 (1992) (plurality opinion) (apply\u00ad\ning strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a\n\u201csignificant impingement\u201d on speech).\n   First Amendment standards applied in this way are\ndifficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying \u201cstrict\nscrutiny\u201d the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that,\nfor example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolu\u00ad\ntion to a group on the State Department\u2019s list of terrorist\norganizations, Holder, 561 U.

And applying less clearly\ndefined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed\nStates to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v.\nReed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign con\u00ad\ntribution limits that were \u201c \u2018closely drawn\u2019 to match a\n\u2018sufficiently important interest,\u2019 \u201d Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387\u2013388 (2000).\n   Moreover, although the Court did not specify the \u201clevel\n10     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof scrutiny\u201d it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently\ndescribed that case as finding a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in\nprotecting children from harm sufficient to justify limita\u00ad\ntions on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.\nFCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). Since the Court in Gins\nberg specified that the statute\u2019s prohibition applied to\nmaterial that was not obscene, 390 U. S., at 634, I cannot\ndismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscen\u00ad\nity. But cf. ante, at 6 (majority opinion). Nor need I de\u00ad\npend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted\nonly that the legislature have a \u201crational\u201d basis for finding\nthe depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390\nU. S., at 639. For in this case, California has substan\u00ad\ntiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger\nevidence.\n                             A\n   California\u2019s law imposes no more than a modest restric\u00ad\ntion on expression. The statute prevents no one from\nplaying a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a\nvideo game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from\nobtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.\n\u00a71746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from\nbuying, without a parent\u2019s assistance, a gruesomely vio\u00ad\nlent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it\nwants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of\n17. See Brief for Respondents 8.\n   Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a prece-\ndent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or\nvideos, or books. A typical video game involves a signifi\u00ad\ncant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 13\u201314\n(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the\nincreasing interactivity of video game controllers).

See infra, at 14.\n                                B\n   The interest that California advances in support of the\nstatute is compelling. As this Court has previously de\u00ad\nscribed that interest, it consists of both (1) the \u201cbasic\u201d\nparental claim \u201cto authority in their own household to\ndirect the rearing of their children,\u201d which makes it proper\nto enact \u201claws designed to aid discharge of [parental]\nresponsibility,\u201d and (2) the State\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in\nthe well-being of its youth.\u201d Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639\u2013\n640. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7 (\u201c \u2018[O]ne can well distinguish laws\nwhich do not impose a morality on children, but which\nsupport the right of parents to deal with the morals of\ntheir children as they see fit\u2019 \u201d (quoting Henkin, Morals\nand the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.\nL. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests\nwork in tandem, it is not fatally \u201cunderinclusive\u201d for a\nState to advance its interests in protecting children\nagainst the special harms present in an interactive video\ngame medium through a default rule that still allows\nparents to provide their children with what their parents\nwish.\n   Both interests are present here. As to the need to help\nparents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968\nthat \u201c \u2018parental control or guidance cannot always be\nprovided.\u2019 \u201d 390 U. S., at 640. Today, 5.3 million grade\u00ad\nschool-age children of working parents are routinely\nhome alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau,\nWho\u2019s Minding the Kids?

Thus, it has,\nif anything, become more important to supplement par\u00ad\nents\u2019 authority to guide their children\u2019s development.\n   As to the State\u2019s independent interest, we have pointed\nout that juveniles are more likely to show a \u201c \u2018lack of ma\u00ad\n12     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nturity\u2019 \u201d and are \u201cmore vulnerable or susceptible to nega\u00ad\ntive influences and outside pressures,\u201d and that their\n\u201ccharacter . . . is not as well formed as that of an adult.\u201d\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569\u2013570 (2005). And we\nhave therefore recognized \u201ca compelling interest in pro\u00ad\ntecting the physical and psychological well-being of mi\u00ad\nnors.\u201d Sable Communications, supra, at 126.\n   At the same time, there is considerable evidence that\nCalifornia\u2019s statute significantly furthers this compelling\ninterest. That is, in part, because video games are excel\u00ad\nlent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means\ndeveloping habits, becoming accustomed to performing the\ntask, and receiving positive reinforcement when perform\u00ad\ning that task well. Video games can help develop habits,\naccustom the player to performance of the task, and\nreward the player for performing that task well. Why\nelse would the Armed Forces incorporate video games\ninto its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Train\u00ad\ning Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at\nhttp://articles.cnn.com/2001\u201311\u20132 / tech / war.games_1_ict-\n                                             2\n\n\n\nbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.\n   When the military uses video games to help soldiers\ntrain for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial\npurpose. But California argues that when the teaching\nfeatures of video games are put to less desirable ends,\nharm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games\ncan harm children by rewarding them for being violently\naggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be\nviolently aggressive in life. And video games can cause\nmore harm in this respect than can typically passive\nmedia, such as books or films or television programs.\n   There are many scientific studies that support Califor\u00ad\nnia\u2019s views. Social scientists, for example, have found\ncausal evidence that playing these games results in harm.\nLongitudinal studies, which measure changes over time,\nhave found that increased exposure to violent video games\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

In essence, they\nsay that the closer a child\u2019s behavior comes, not to watch\u00ad\ning, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the\npotential psychological harm.

I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise\nto say definitively who is right. But associations of public\nhealth professionals who do possess that expertise have\nreviewed many of these studies and found a significant\nrisk that violent video games, when compared with more\npassive media, are particularly likely to cause children\nharm.\n   Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy\nof Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adoles\u00ad\ncent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association,\nthe American Medical Association, the American Academy\nof Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Asso\u00ad\nciation released a joint statement, which said:\n    \u201c[O]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a\n    causal connection between media violence and aggres\u00ad\n    sive behavior in some children . . .

YouTube viewers,\nfor example, have watched one of those guides (called\n\u201cHow to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360\u201d) more\nthan 47,000 times. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\nCFlVfVmvN6k.\n                               IV\n   The upshot is that California\u2019s statute, as applied to its\nheartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely\nviolent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on\nspeech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified\nby a compelling interest (supplementing parents\u2019 efforts to\nprevent their children from purchasing potentially harm\u00ad\nful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally\neffective, less restrictive alternative. California\u2019s statute\nis consequently constitutional on its face\u2014though litigants\nremain free to challenge the statute as applied in particu\u00ad\nlar instances, including any effort by the State to apply it\nto minors aged 17.\n   I add that the majority\u2019s different conclusion creates a\nserious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg\nmakes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of\ndepictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nState cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most vio\u00ad\nlent interactive video games. But what sense does it make\nto forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an\nimage of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13\u00ad\nyear-old of an interactive video game in which he actively,\nbut virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures\nand kills her? What kind of First Amendment would\npermit the government to protect children by restrict-\ning sales of that extremely violent video game only when\nthe woman\u2014bound, gagged, tortured, and killed\u2014is also\ntopless?\n   This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.\nIt disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence,\nwhere interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar\njustification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to\nchildren as photographs of nudity. And the record here is\nmore than adequate to support such a view. That is why I\nbelieve that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori.\nAnd it is why I believe California\u2019s law is constitutional on\nits face.\n   This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is\nabout education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in\nsecuring the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can\nraise future generations committed cooperatively to mak\u00ad\ning our system of government work. Education, however,\nis about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by\nmaking choices for themselves. Other times, choices are\nmade for children\u2014by their parents, by their teachers,\nand by the people acting democratically through their\ngovernments. In my view, the First Amendment does not\ndisable government from helping parents make such a\nchoice here\u2014a choice not to have their children buy ex\u00ad\ntremely violent, interactive video games, which they more\nthan reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those\nchildren.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n20     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n             Appendix A to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                       APPENDIXES\n   With the assistance of the Supreme Court Library, I\nhave compiled these two appendixes listing peer-reviewed\nacademic journal articles on the topic of psychological\nharm resulting from playing violent video games. The\nlibrary conducted a search for relevant articles on the\nfollowing databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic\nSearch Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1,\n7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149). The following search terms\nwere used: \u201c(video* or computer or arcade or online) and\n(game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or violen* or\nhostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens*\nor empathy).\u201d After eliminating irrelevant matches based\non title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either\nsupporting the hypothesis that violent video games are\nharmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/rejecting\nthe hypothesis that violent video games are harmful\n(listed in Appendix B).\n   Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the\nCalifornia Legislature or the parties in briefing this case.\nI list them because they suggest that there is substantial\n(though controverted) evidence supporting the expert\nassociations of public health professionals that have con\u00ad\ncluded that violent video games can cause children psycho\u00ad\nlogical harm. See supra, at 15\u201316. And consequently,\nthese studies help to substantiate the validity of the origi\u00ad\nnal judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that\njudgment\u2019s continuing validity.\n                            A\nAnderson & Bushman, Effects of Violent Video Games on\n Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive\n Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A\n Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature, 12\n Psychological Science: J.

Argued November 2, 2010\u2014Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondents, representing the video-game and software industries,\n  filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the\n  sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District\n  Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and\n  permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Act does not comport with the First Amendment. Pp. 2\u201318.\n    (a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like pro\n tected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through fa\n miliar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And\n \u201cthe basic principles of freedom of speech . . . do not vary\u201d with a new\n and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wil\n son, 343 U. S. 495, 503. The most basic principle\u2014that government\n lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas,\n subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Un\n ion, 535 U. S. 564, 573\u2014is subject to a few limited exceptions for his\n torically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fight\n ing words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of\n unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular\n category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the\n test. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the\n New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, Cali\n fornia\u2019s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of\n unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is\n not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to cre\n ate a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permis\n sible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and\n2         BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting chil\n    dren\u2019s access to depictions of violence. And California\u2019s claim that\n    \u201cinteractive\u201d video games present special problems, in that the player\n    participates in the violent action on screen and determines its out\n    come, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2\u201311.\n       (b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of pro\n    tected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it\n    passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government\n    interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St.\n    Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 395. California cannot meet that standard. Psy\n    chological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure\n    to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove\n    that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demon\n    strated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects pro\n    duced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those\n    other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regula\n    tion is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether\n    the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring\n    a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that\n    the Act\u2019s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents\n    who wish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent videos. The\n    video-game industry\u2019s voluntary rating system already accomplishes\n    that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the\n    Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are pro\n    hibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who dis\n    approve of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.\n    Pp. 11\u201318.\n556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.\n\n  SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\nGINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

Civ. Code\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a71746\u20131746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale\nor rental of \u201cviolent video games\u201d to minors, and requires\ntheir packaging to be labeled \u201c18.\u201d The Act covers games\n\u201cin which the range of options available to a player in\ncludes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually as\nsaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are\ndepicted\u201d in a manner that \u201c[a] reasonable person, consid\nering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant\nor morbid interest of minors,\u201d that is \u201cpatently offensive to\nprevailing standards in the community as to what is suit\nable for minors,\u201d and that \u201ccauses the game, as a whole, to\nlack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\nfor minors.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(A). Violation of the Act is pun\nishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. \u00a71746.3.\n2      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents, representing the video-game and software\nindustries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act\nin the United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of California. That court concluded that the Act\nviolated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined\nits enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwar\nzenegger, No. C\u201305\u201304188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software\nDealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9\n2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).\n                             II\n  California correctly acknowledges that video games\nqualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech\nClause exists principally to protect discourse on public\nmatters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to\ndistinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to\ntry. \u201cEveryone is familiar with instances of propaganda\nthrough fiction. What is one man\u2019s amusement, teaches\nanother\u2019s doctrine.\u201d Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507,\n510 (1948). Like the protected books, plays, and movies\nthat preceded them, video games communicate ideas\u2014and\neven social messages\u2014through many familiar literary\ndevices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and\nthrough features distinctive to the medium (such as the\nplayer\u2019s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices\nto confer First Amendment protection. Under our Consti\ntution, \u201cesthetic and moral judgments about art and lit\nerature . . . are for the individual to make, not for the\nGovernment to decree, even with the mandate or approval\nof a majority.\u201d United States v. Playboy Entertainment\nGroup, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). And whatever the\nchallenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing\ntechnology, \u201cthe basic principles of freedom of speech and\nthe press, like the First Amendment\u2019s command, do not\nvary\u201d when a new and different medium for communica\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S.\n495, 503 (1952).\n   The most basic of those principles is this: \u201c[A]s a general\nmatter, . . . government has no power to restrict expres\nsion because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or\nits content.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,\n535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). There are of course exceptions. \u201c \u2018From 1791 to the\npresent,\u2019 . . . the First Amendment has \u2018permitted restric\ntions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,\u2019\nand has never \u2018include[d] a freedom to disregard these\ntraditional limitations.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Stevens, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St.\nPaul, 505 U. S. 377, 382\u2013383 (1992)). These limited ar\neas\u2014such as obscenity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.\n476, 483 (1957), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395\nU. S. 444, 447\u2013449 (1969) (per curiam), and fighting\nwords, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568,\n572 (1942)\u2014represent \u201cwell-defined and narrowly limited\nclasses of speech, the prevention and punishment of which\nhave never been thought to raise any Constitutional prob\nlem,\u201d id., at 571\u2013572.\n   Last Term, in Stevens, we held that new categories of\nunprotected speech may not be added to the list by a\nlegislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to\nbe tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purport\ning to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of cer\ntain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a748\n(amended 2010). The statute covered depictions \u201cin which\na living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tor\ntured, wounded, or killed\u201d if that harm to the animal was\nillegal where the \u201cthe creation, sale, or possession t[ook]\nplace,\u201d \u00a748(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from\nour obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15, 24 (1973), exempted depictions with \u201cserious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\n4        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nhistorical, or artistic value,\u201d \u00a748(b). We held that statute\nto be an impermissible content-based restriction on\nspeech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the\ndepiction of animal cruelty\u2014though States have long had\nlaws against committing it.\n   The Government argued in Stevens that lack of a his\ntorical warrant did not matter; that it could create new\ncategories of unprotected speech by applying a \u201csimple\nbalancing test\u201d that weighs the value of a particular cate\ngory of speech against its social costs and then punishes\nthat category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens, 559\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that\n\u201cstartling and dangerous\u201d proposition. Ibid. \u201cMaybe there\nare some categories of speech that have been historically\nunprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified\nor discussed as such in our case law.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel re\nstriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrec\nognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not\nrevise the \u201cjudgment [of] the American people,\u201d embodied\nin the First Amendment, \u201cthat the benefits of its restric\ntions on the Government outweigh the costs.\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 7).\n   That holding controls this case.1 As in Stevens, Califor\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 JUSTICE ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to\n\nus ill founded. He suggests, post, at 10 (opinion concurring in judg\nment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we\ndoubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 9, 10,\nthat the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the\n\u201ccreation\u201d or \u201cpossession\u201d of violent depictions. That distinction ap\npears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make\npermissible the prohibition of printing or selling books\u2014though not the\nwriting of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating,\ndistributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally,\nJUSTICE ALITO points out, post, at 10, that Stevens \u201cleft open the possi\nbility that a more narrowly drawn statute\u201d would be constitutional.\nTrue, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnia has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like\nobscenity regulation by appending a saving clause re\nquired for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases\nhave been clear that the obscenity exception to the First\nAmendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds\nshocking, but only depictions of \u201csexual conduct,\u201d Miller,\nsupra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15,\n20 (1971); Roth, supra, at 487, and n. 20.\n   Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and\nrejected a State\u2019s attempt to shoehorn speech about vio\nlence into obscenity. In Winters, we considered a New\nYork criminal statute \u201cforbid[ding] the massing of stories\nof bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime\nagainst the person,\u201d 333 U.

The New York\nCourt of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against\nobscenity. \u201c[T]here can be no more precise test of written\nindecency or obscenity,\u201d it said, \u201cthan the continuing and\nchangeable experience of the community as to what types\nof books are likely to bring about the corruption of public\nmorals or other analogous injury to the public order. \u201d Id.,\nat 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of\ncourse the same expansive view of governmental power to\nabridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing\nthat we rejected in Stevens. Our opinion in Winters, which\nconcluded that the New York statute failed a heightened\nvagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech\nentitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517\u2013\n519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity\nthat the Constitution permits to be regulated.

ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no\nconsequence that California\u2019s statute mimics the New\nYork statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we\nupheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968).\nThat case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of\nsexual material that would be obscene from the perspec\ntive of a child.2 We held that the legislature could\n\u201cadjus[t] the definition of obscenity \u2018to social realities by\npermitting the appeal of this type of material to be as\nsessed in terms of the sexual interests . . .\u2019 of . . . minors. \u201d\nId., at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,\n509 (1966)). And because \u201cobscenity is not protected\nexpression,\u201d the New York statute could be sustained so\nlong as the legislature\u2019s judgment that the proscribed\nmaterials were harmful to children \u201cwas not irrational.\u201d\n390 U. S., at 641.\n   The California Act is something else entirely. It does\nnot adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unpro\ntected speech to ensure that a definition designed for\nadults is not uncritically applied to children. California\ndoes not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling\noffensively violent works to adults\u2014and it is wise not to,\nsince that is but a hair\u2019s breadth from the argument re\njected in Stevens. Instead, it wishes to create a wholly\nnew category of content-based regulation that is permissi\nble only for speech directed at children.\n   That is unprecedented and mistaken. \u201c[M]inors are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of\n\n\u201cnudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,\u201d\nthat were \u201c\u2018[h]armful to minors.\u2019 \u201d A depiction was harmful to minors if it:\n  \u201c(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid\ninterests of minors, and\n  \u201c(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult commu\nnity as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and\n  \u201c(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\u201d 390\nU.

Jackson\nville, 422 U. S. 205, 212\u2013213 (1975) (citation omitted). No\ndoubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect chil\ndren from harm, Ginsberg, supra, at 640\u2013641; Prince v.\nMassachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944), but that does\nnot include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to\nwhich children may be exposed. \u201cSpeech that is neither\nobscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate\nproscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the\nyoung from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks\nunsuitable for them.\u201d Erznoznik, supra, at 213\u2013214.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE  THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that\npersons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to\nwithout their parents\u2019 consent. He cites no case, state or federal,\nsupporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his\ndissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had\nthe power to control what their children hear and say. This is true\nenough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power\nto enforce parental prohibitions\u2014to require, for example, that the\npromoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have\nadvised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But\nit does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from\nhearing or saying anything without their parents\u2019 prior consent. The\nlatter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit\npersons under 18 to a political rally without their parents\u2019 prior written\nconsent\u2014even a political rally in support of laws against corporal\npunishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors.\nAnd what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good\nfor First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made crimi\nnal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a\nreligious tract, without his parents\u2019 prior consent. Our point is not, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS believes, post, at 16, n. 2, merely that such laws are\n\u201cundesirable.\u201d They are obviously an infringement upon the religious\nfreedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young\npeople.

Certainly the books we give children to read\u2014or\nread to them when they are younger\u2014contain no shortage\nof gore. Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim in\ndeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White,\nthe wicked queen is made to dance in red hot slippers \u201ctill\nshe fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jeal\nousy.\u201d The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales 198\n(2006 ed.).

The latter feature is nothing new: Since\nat least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugar\ncane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own\nadventure stories have been able to make decisions that\ndetermine the plot by following instructions about which\npage to turn to. Cf. Interactive Digital Software Assn. v.\nSt. Louis County, 329 F. 3d 954, 957\u2013958 (CA8 2003).

But it does arouse the reader\u2019s ire, and the\nreader\u2019s desire to put an end to this horrible message.\nThus, ironically, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s argument highlights the\nprecise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas\nexpressed by speech\u2014whether it be violence, or gore, or\nracism\u2014and not its objective effects, may be the real\nreason for governmental proscription.\n                             III\n  Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of\nprotected speech, it is invalid unless California can dem\nonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny\u2014that is, unless it is\njustified by a compelling government interest and is nar\nrowly drawn to serve that interest.

The State must specifically identify an \u201cactual prob\nlem\u201d in need of solving, Playboy, 529 U. S., at 822\u2013823,\nand the curtailment of free speech must be actually neces\nsary to the solution, see R. A. V., supra, at 395. That is a\ndemanding standard. \u201cIt is rare that a regulation restrict\ning speech because of its content will ever be permissible.\u201d\nPlayboy, supra, at 818.\n  California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it\nacknowledges that it cannot show a direct causal link\nbetween violent video games and harm to minors. Rather,\nrelying upon our decision in Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994), the State claims that it\nneed not produce such proof because the legislature can\nmake a predictive judgment that such a link exists, based\non competing psychological studies. But reliance on\nTurner Broadcasting is misplaced. That decision applied\nintermediate scrutiny to a content-neutral regulation. Id.,\nat 661\u2013662. California\u2019s burden is much higher, and\nbecause it bears the risk of uncertainty, see Playboy,\nsupra, at 816\u2013817, ambiguous proof will not suffice.\n  The State\u2019s evidence is not compelling. California relies\nprimarily on the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few\nother research psychologists whose studies purport to\nshow a connection between exposure to violent video\ngames and harmful effects on children. These studies\nhave been rejected by every court to consider them,6 and\nwith good reason: They do not prove that violent video\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 See Video Software Dealers Assn. v.

Underin\nclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the gov\nernment is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather\nthan disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint. See\nCity of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51 (1994); Florida\nStar v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540 (1989). Here, Califor\nnia has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfa\nvored treatment\u2014at least when compared to booksellers,\ncartoonists, and movie producers\u2014and has given no per\nsuasive reason why.\n   The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another\nrespect\u2014and a respect that renders irrelevant the conten\ntions of the concurrence and the dissents that video games\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na problem, and perhaps none of us would allow our own children to play\nthem.

The vast preponderance of this\nresearch is outside the record\u2014and in any event we do not see how it\ncould lead to JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s conclusion, since he admits he cannot\nsay whether the studies on his side are right or wrong. Post, at 15.\nSimilarly, JUSTICE ALITO says he is not \u201csure\u201d whether there are any\nconstitutionally dispositive differences between video games and other\nmedia. Post, at 2. If that is so, then strict scrutiny plainly has not been\nsatisfied.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The California Legislature is perfectly willing to\nleave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands\nof children so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle)\nsays it\u2019s OK. And there are not even any requirements as\nto how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be\nverified; apparently the child\u2019s or putative parent\u2019s, aunt\u2019s,\nor uncle\u2019s say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a\nserious social problem.\n   California claims that the Act is justified in aid of pa\nrental authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent\nvideo games can be made only by adults, the Act ensures\nthat parents can decide what games are appropriate. At\nthe outset, we note our doubts that punishing third parties\nfor conveying protected speech to children just in case\ntheir parents disapprove of that speech is a proper gov\nernmental means of aiding parental authority. Accepting\nthat position would largely vitiate the rule that \u201conly in\nrelatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may\ngovernment bar public dissemination of protected materi\nals to [minors].\u201d Erznoznik, 422 U. S., at 212\u2013213.\n   But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the\nAct\u2019s restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who\nwish to restrict their children\u2019s access to violent video\ngames but cannot do so. The video-game industry has in\nplace a voluntary rating system designed to inform con\nsumers about the content of games. The system, imple\nmented by the Entertainment Software Rating Board\n(ESRB), assigns age-specific ratings to each video game\nsubmitted: EC (Early Childhood); E (Everyone); E10+\n(Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older); and\nAO (Adults Only\u201418 and older). App. 86. The Video\nSoftware Dealers Association encourages retailers to\nprominently display information about the ESRB system\nin their stores; to refrain from renting or selling adults\nonly games to minors; and to rent or sell \u201cM\u201d rated games\n16       BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto minors only with parental consent. Id., at 47. In 2009,\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a\nresult of this system, \u201cthe video game industry outpaces\nthe movie and music industries\u201d in \u201c(1) restricting target\nmarketing of mature-rated products to children; (2) clearly\nand prominently disclosing rating information; and (3) re\nstricting children\u2019s access to mature-rated products at\nretail.\u201d FTC, Report to Congress, Marketing Violent\nEntertainment to Children 30 (Dec. 2009), online at http://\nwww.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/P994511violententertainment.pdf\n(as visited June 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file) (FTC Report). This system does much to ensure\nthat minors cannot purchase seriously violent games on\ntheir own, and that parents who care about the matter can\nreadily evaluate the games their children bring home.\nFilling the remaining modest gap in concerned-parents\u2019\ncontrol can hardly be a compelling state interest.9\n   And finally, the Act\u2019s purported aid to parental author\nity is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who are\nforbidden to purchase violent video games on their own\nhave parents who care whether they purchase violent\nvideo games. While some of the legislation\u2019s effect may\nindeed be in support of what some parents of the re\nstricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in\nsupport of what the State thinks parents ought to want.\nThis is not the narrow tailoring to \u201cassisting parents\u201d that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE  BREYER concludes that the remaining gap is compelling\nbecause, according to the FTC\u2019s report, some \u201c20% of those under 17 are\nstill able to buy M-rated games.\u201d Post, at 18 (citing FTC Report 28).\nBut some gap in compliance is unavoidable.

Our task is only to say\nwhether or not such works constitute a \u201cwell-defined and\nnarrowly limited clas[s] of speech, the prevention and\npunishment of which have never been thought to raise any\nConstitutional problem,\u201d Chaplinsky, 315 U.

Both ends are\nlegitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights\nthey must be pursued by means that are neither seriously\nunderinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. See Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546\n(1993). As a means of protecting children from portrayals\nof violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not\nonly because it excludes portrayals other than video\ngames, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular\n18     BROWN v.

Although the California statute is well\nintentioned, its terms are not framed with the precision\nthat the Constitution demands, and I therefore agree with\nthe Court that this particular law cannot be sustained.\n   I disagree, however, with the approach taken in the\nCourt\u2019s opinion. In considering the application of un\nchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly\nevolving technology, this Court should proceed with cau\ntion. We should make every effort to understand the new\ntechnology. We should take into account the possibility\nthat developing technology may have important societal\nimplications that will become apparent only with time.\nWe should not jump to the conclusion that new technology\nis fundamentally the same as some older thing with which\nwe are familiar. And we should not hastily dismiss the\njudgment of legislators, who may be in a better position\n2          BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthan we are to assess the implications of new technology.\nThe opinion of the Court exhibits none of this caution.\n  In the view of the Court, all those concerned about the\neffects of violent video games\u2014federal and state legisla\ntors, educators, social scientists, and parents\u2014are unduly\nfearful, for violent video games really present no serious\nproblem. See ante, at 10\u201313, 15\u201316. Spending hour upon\nhour controlling the actions of a character who guns down\nscores of innocent victims is not different in \u201ckind\u201d from\nreading a description of violence in a work of literature.\nSee ante, at 10\u201311.\n  The Court is sure of this; I am not. There are reasons to\nsuspect that the experience of playing violent video games\njust might be very different from reading a book, listening\nto the radio, or watching a movie or a television show.\n                             I\n   Respondents in this case, representing the video-game\nindustry, ask us to strike down the California law on two\ngrounds: The broad ground adopted by the Court and the\nnarrower ground that the law\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent video\ngame,\u201d see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71746(d)(1)(A) (West 2009),\nis impermissibly vague. See Brief for Respondents 23\u201361.\nBecause I agree with the latter argument, I see no need to\nreach the broader First Amendment issues addressed by\nthe Court.1\n                             A\n  Due process requires that laws give people of ordinary\nintelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.

These principles apply to\nlaws that regulate expression for the purpose of protecting\nchildren. See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U. S.\n676, 689 (1968).\n  Here, the California law does not define \u201cviolent video\ngames\u201d with the \u201cnarrow specificity\u201d that the Constitution\ndemands. In an effort to avoid First Amendment prob\nlems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video\ngame statute on the New York law that this Court upheld\nin Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968)\u2014a law that\nprohibited the sale of certain sexually related materials to\nminors, see id., at 631\u2013633. But the California Legisla\nture departed from the Ginsberg model in an important\nrespect, and the legislature overlooked important differ\nences between the materials falling within the scope of the\ntwo statutes.\n                            B\n  The law at issue in Ginsberg prohibited the sale to\nminors of materials that were deemed \u201charmful to mi\nnors,\u201d and the law defined \u201charmful to minors\u201d simply by\nadding the words \u201cfor minors\u201d to each element of the\n4      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                 ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndefinition of obscenity set out in what were then the\nCourt\u2019s leading obscenity decisions, see Roth v. United\nStates, 354 U. S. 476 (1957), and Book Named \u201cJohn Cle\nland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney Gen\neral of Mass., 383 U. S. 413 (1966).\n   Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the\nprotection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began\nwith the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests\npreviously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature\nthen made certain modifications to accommodate the aim\nof the violent video game law.\n   Under Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh\nold limitation that restricts the statute\u2019s scope to specifi\ncally described \u201chard core\u201d materials. See 413 U. S.,\nat 23\u201325, 27. Materials that fall within this \u201chard core\u201d\ncategory may be deemed to be obscene if three additional\nrequirements are met:\n     (1) an \u201caverage person, applying contemporary com\n     munity standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a\n     whole, appeals to the prurient interest\u201d;\n     (2) \u201cthe work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a pat\n     ently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically de\n     fined by the applicable state law; and\u201d\n     (3) \u201cthe work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious\n     literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d Id., at\n     24 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Adapting these standards, the California law imposes\nthe following threshold limitation: \u201c[T]he range of options\navailable to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming,\ndismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a hu\nman being.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this\nthreshold test is subject to the law\u2019s restrictions if it also\nsatisfies three further requirements:\n       \u201c(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

As noted, the\nGinsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and\nthe current adult obscenity test, which was set out in\nMiller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold\nlimitation that restricts the statute\u2019s coverage to specifi\ncally defined \u201chard core\u201d depictions. See 413 U. S., at 23\u2013\n25, 27. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute\nthat applies to only \u201c[p]atently offensive representations\nor descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,\u201d \u201cmasturbation,\nexcretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d\nId., at 25. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold\nlimitation as serving a vital notice function. \u201cWe are\nsatisfied,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cthat these specific prerequi\nsites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials\nthat his public and commercial activities may bring prose\ncution.\u201d Id., at 27; see also Reno, supra, at 873 (observing\nthat Miller\u2019s threshold limitation \u201creduces the vagueness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold require\n\nment set out in text also qualifies as \u201cviolent\u201d if it \u201c[e]nables the player\nto virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or\ncharacters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which\nis especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or\nserious physical abuse to the victim.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of\nAppeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is uncon\nstitutional, 556 F. 3d 950, 954, n. 5 (CA9 2009), and therefore only the\nrequirements set out in text are now before us.\n6       BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninherent in the open-ended term \u2018patently offensive\u2019 \u201d).3\n  By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California\nlaw does not perform the narrowing function served by the\nlimitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided,\ndepictions of \u201chard core\u201d sexual conduct were not a com\nmon feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing\nsimilar can be said about much of the conduct covered by\nthe California law. It provides that a video game cannot\nqualify as \u201cviolent\u201d unless \u201cthe range of options available\nto a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or\nsexually assaulting an image of a human being.\u201d\n\u00a71746(d)(1).\n  For better or worse, our society has long regarded many\ndepictions of killing and maiming4 as suitable features of\npopular entertainment, including entertainment that is\nwidely available to minors. The California law\u2019s threshold\nrequirement would more closely resemble the limitation in\nMiller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.\n  Because of this feature of the California law\u2019s threshold\ntest, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part\nto the three requirements that follow, but those elements\nare also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video\ngame law, the California Legislature could have made its\nown judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence\nthat is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors\nin particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied\non undefined societal or community standards.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was con\n\nvicted in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision\napplied to depictions of \u201cnudity\u201d and \u201csexual conduct,\u201d and both those\nterms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U. S., at\n645\u2013647 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).\n  4 The California law does not define the term \u201cmaiming,\u201d nor has the\n\nState cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this\ncontext. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning,\nwhich includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly\nto \u201cprevailing standards in the community as to what is\nsuitable for minors.\u201d \u00a71746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element\npoints in the same direction, asking whether \u201c[a] reason\nable person, considering [a] game as a whole,\u201d would find\nthat it \u201cappeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.\u201d\n\u00a71746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\n   The terms \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cmorbid\u201d are not defined in\nthe statute, and California offers no reason to think that\nits courts would give the terms anything other than their\nordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (argu\ning that \u201c[a] reasonable person can make this judgment\nthrough . . . a common understanding and definition of the\napplicable terms\u201d). I therefore assume that \u201cdeviant\u201d and\n\u201cmorbid\u201d carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary\nspeech. The adjective \u201cdeviant\u201d ordinarily means \u201cdeviat\ning . . . from some accepted norm,\u201d and the term \u201cmorbid\u201d\nmeans \u201cof, relating to, or characteristic of disease.\u201d Web\nster\u2019s 618, 1469. A \u201cdeviant or morbid interest\u201d in\nviolence, therefore, appears to be an interest that de\nviates from what is regarded\u2014presumably in accordance\nwith some generally accepted standard\u2014as normal and\nhealthy. Thus, the application of the California law is\nheavily dependent on the identification of generally ac\ncepted standards regarding the suitability of violent enter\ntainment for minors.\n   The California Legislature seems to have assumed that\nthese standards are sufficiently well known so that a\nperson of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to\nwhether the kind and degree of violence in a particular\ngame is enough to qualify the game as \u201cviolent.\u201d And\nbecause the Miller test looks to community standards, the\nlegislature may have thought that the use of undefined\ncommunity standards in the violent video game law would\nnot present vagueness problems.\n   There is a critical difference, however, between obscen\n8      BROWN v.

S., at 484\u2013485, and this experience had helped to\nshape certain generally accepted norms concerning ex\npression related to sex.\n   There is no similar history regarding expression related\nto violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains\ndescriptions of great violence, and even children\u2019s stories\nsometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 8\u20139.\n   Although our society does not generally regard all depic\ntions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the\nprevalence of violent depictions in children\u2019s literature and\nentertainment creates numerous opportunities for reason\nable people to disagree about which depictions may excite\n\u201cdeviant\u201d or \u201cmorbid\u201d impulses.

Rev. 1487,\n1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be diffi\ncult to apply to violent expression because \u201cthere is noth\ning even approaching a consensus on low-value violence\u201d).\n   Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community\nstandards incorporated into the California law is com\npounded by the legislature\u2019s decision to lump all minors\ntogether. The California law draws no distinction between\nyoung children and adolescents who are nearing the age of\nmajority.\n   In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney\ndefending the constitutionality of the California law said\nthat the State would accept a narrowing construction of\nthe law under which the law\u2019s references to \u201cminors\u201d\nwould be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors\u2014that is,\nthose just short of 18.

S.\n157, 174 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)).\n   In this case, California has not provided any evidence\nthat the California Legislature intended the law to be\nlimited in this way, or cited any decisions from its courts\nthat would support an \u201coldest minors\u201d construction.5\n   For these reasons, I conclude that the California violent\nvideo game law fails to provide the fair notice that the\nConstitution requires. And I would go no further. I would\nnot express any view on whether a properly drawn statute\nwould or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.\nWe should address that question only if and when it is\nnecessary to do so.\n                           II\n  Having outlined how I would decide this case, I will now\nbriefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wis\ndom of the Court\u2019s approach. Some of these reasons are\ntouched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared\nat this time to go as far as either JUSTICE THOMAS or\nJUSTICE BREYER, they raise valid concerns.\n                              A\n  The Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United\nStates v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), \u201ccontrols this case.\u201d\nAnte, at 4. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply\nfrom the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law\nthat broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling,\nor possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial\ngain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 At oral argument, California also proposed that the term \u201cminors\u201d\n\ncould be interpreted as referring to the \u201ctypical age group of minors\u201d\nwho play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law\u2019s\ntext supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions\nindicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there\nis nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.\n10     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlimited to the sale or rental of violent video games to\nminors. The California law imposes no restriction on the\ncreation of violent video games, or on the possession of\nsuch games by anyone, whether above or below the age of\n18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental\nof violent games by adults. And the California law does\nnot prevent parents and certain other close relatives from\nbuying or renting violent games for their children or other\nyoung relatives if they see fit.\n  Second, Stevens does not support the proposition that a\nlaw like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The\nportion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the\nGovernment\u2019s contention that depictions of animal cruelty\nwere categorically outside the range of any First Amend\nment protection. 559 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5). Going\nwell beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law\nthat attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent\nvideo games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the\nmore lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U. S. 629,\nour most closely related precedent. As a result of today\u2019s\ndecision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what\nGinsberg described as \u201cgirlie magazines,\u201d but a State must\nsurmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable)\nobstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing\nthe most violent and depraved video games imaginable.\n  Third, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a\nmore narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of\nanimal cruelty might be compatible with the First\nAmendment. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In this\ncase, the Court\u2019s sweeping opinion will likely be read by\nmany, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as\nsuggesting that no regulation of minors\u2019 access to violent\nvideo games is allowed\u2014at least without supporting evi\ndence that may not be realistically obtainable given the\nnature of the phenomenon in question.\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011) \n              11\n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                              B\n\n  The Court\u2019s opinion distorts the effect of the California\nlaw. I certainly agree with the Court that the government\nhas no \u201cfree-floating power to restrict the ideas to which\nchildren may be exposed,\u201d ante, at 7, but the California\nlaw does not exercise such a power. If parents want their\nchild to have a violent video game, the California law does\nnot interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the\nCalifornia law reinforces parental decisionmaking in\nexactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in\nGinsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from\npurchasing certain materials; and under both laws, par\nents are free to supply their children with these items if\nthat is their wish.\n  Citing the video-game industry\u2019s voluntary rating sys\ntem, the Court argues that the California law does not\n\u201cmeet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict\ntheir children\u2019s access to violent video games but cannot\ndo so.\u201d Ante, at 15. The Court does not mention the fact\nthat the industry adopted this system in response to the\nthreat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard,\nInc., as Amicus Curiae 7\u201310, a threat that the Court\u2019s\nopinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does\nthe Court acknowledge that compliance with this system\nat the time of the enactment of the California law left\nmuch to be desired6\u2014or that future enforcement may\ndecline if the video-game industry perceives that any\nthreat of government regulation has vanished. Nor does\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6A 2004 Federal Trade Commission Report showed that 69 percent of\nunaccompanied children ages 13 to 16 were able to buy M-rated games\nand that 56 percent of 13-year-olds were able to buy an M-rated game.\nMarketing Violent Entertainment to Children: A Fourth Follow-Up\nReview of Industry Practices in the Motion Picture, Music Recording &\nElectronic Game Industries 26\u201328 (July 2004), http://www.ftc.gov/os/\n2004/07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf (all Internet materials as visited\nJune 24, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n12       BROWN v.

Victims are\ndismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and\nchopped into little pieces. They cry out in agony and beg\nfor mercy. Blood gushes, splatters, and pools.

Kendrick,\n244 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA7 2001)). But only an extraordinar\nily imaginative reader who reads a description of a killing\nin a literary work will experience that event as vividly as\nhe might if he played the role of the killer in a video game.\nTo take an example, think of a person who reads the\npassage in Crime and Punishment in which Raskolni-\nkov kills the old pawn broker with an axe. See F.\nDostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment 78 (Modern Library\ned. 1950). Compare that reader with a video-game player\nwho creates an avatar that bears his own image; who sees\na realistic image of the victim and the scene of the killing\nin high definition and in three dimensions; who is forced to\ndecide whether or not to kill the victim and decides to do\nso; who then pretends to grasp an axe, to raise it above the\nhead of the victim, and then to bring it down; who hears\nthe thud of the axe hitting her head and her cry of pain;\nwho sees her split skull and feels the sensation of blood on\nhis face and hands. For most people, the two experiences\nwill not be the same.19\n   When all of the characteristics of video games are taken\ninto account, there is certainly a reasonable basis for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 As the Court notes, there are a few children\u2019s books that ask young\n\nreaders to step into the shoes of a character and to make choices that\ntake the stories along one of a very limited number of possible lines.\nSee ante, at 10.

McIntyre, supra,\nat 360. The historical evidence shows that the founding\ngeneration believed parents had absolute authority over\ntheir minor children and expected parents to use that\nauthority to direct the proper development of their chil\ndren. It would be absurd to suggest that such a society\nunderstood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include a right to\nspeak to minors (or a corresponding right of minors to\naccess speech) without going through the minors\u2019 parents.\nCf.

The founding generation would not have considered\nit an abridgment of \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to support\nparental authority by restricting speech that bypasses\nminors\u2019 parents.\n                               A\n  Attitudes toward children were in a state of transition\naround the time that the States ratified the Bill of Rights.\nA complete understanding of the founding generation\u2019s\nviews on children and the parent-child relationship must\ntherefore begin roughly a century earlier, in colonial New\nEngland.\n  In the Puritan tradition common in the New England\nColonies, fathers ruled families with absolute authority.\n\u201cThe patriarchal family was the basic building block of\nPuritan society.\u201d S. Mintz, Huck\u2019s Raft 13 (2004) (herein\nafter Mintz); see also R. MacDonald, Literature for Chil\ndren in England and America from 1646 to 1774, p. 7\n(1982) (hereinafter MacDonald).

See, e.g., J.\nReinier, From Virtue to Character: American Childhood,\n1775\u20131850, p. 1 (1996) (hereinafter Reinier). Children\ncame to be seen less as innately sinful and more as blank\nslates requiring careful and deliberate development. But\nthe same overarching principles remained. Parents con\ntinued to have both the right and duty to ensure the\nproper development of their children. They exercised\nsignificant authority over their children, including control\nover the books that children read. And laws at the time\ncontinued to reflect strong support for parental author-\nity and the sense that children were not fit to govern\nthemselves.\n                           1\n    The works of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Brewer, By\nBirth or Consent 97 (2005) (hereinafter Brewer); K. Cal\nvert, Children in the House 59\u201360 (1992) (hereinafter\nCalvert). Locke taught that children\u2019s minds were blank\nslates and that parents therefore had to be careful and\ndeliberate about what their children were told and ob\nserved. Parents had only themselves to blame if, \u201cby hu\nmouring and cockering\u201d their children, they \u201cpoison\u2019d\nthe fountain\u201d and later \u201ctaste[d] the bitter waters.\u201d Some\nThoughts Concerning Education (1692), in 37 English\nPhilosophers of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\n27\u201328 (C.

All vices, he explained, were\nsowed by parents and \u201cthose about children.\u201d Id., at 29.\nSignificantly, Locke did not suggest circumscribing paren\ntal authority but rather articulated a new basis for it.\nRousseau disagreed with Locke in important respects, but\nhis philosophy was similarly premised on parental control\nover a child\u2019s development. Although Rousseau advocated\nthat children should be allowed to develop naturally, he\ninstructed that the environment be directed by \u201ca tutor\nwho is given total control over the child and who removes\nhim from society, from all competing sources of authority\nand influence.\u201d J. Fliegelman, Prodigals and Pilgrims 30\n(1982) (hereinafter Fliegelman); see also Reinier 15.\n  These writings received considerable attention in Amer\nica. Locke\u2019s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nand his Some Thoughts Concerning Education were sig\nnificantly more popular than his Two Treatises of Gov\nernment, according to a study of 92 colonial libraries\nbetween 1700 and 1776.

Children were increasingly viewed as\nmalleable creatures, and childhood came to be seen as an\nimportant period of growth, development, and preparation\nfor adulthood. See Mintz & Kellogg 17, 21, 47; M. Gross\nberg, Governing the Hearth 8 (1985) (hereinafter Gross\nberg).

Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 712 (1997) (Blackstone\u2019s\nCommentaries was \u201ca primary legal authority for 18th-\nand 19th-century American lawyers\u201d). Chancellor James\nKent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189\u2013\n*207. The law entitled parents to \u201cthe custody of their\n[children],\u201d \u201cthe value of th[e] [children\u2019s] labor and ser\nvices,\u201d and the \u201cright to the exercise of such discipline as\nmay be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.\u201d\nId., at *193, *203.

In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusetts explained, \u201cThere is no question but that a\nfather, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and\nfor whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common\nlaw, assign those services to others, for a consideration to\nenure to himself.\u201d Day v.

See Cox, Boy Sol\ndiers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21\u201324. And\nafter the war, minors who enlisted without parental con\nsent in violation of federal law could find themselves\nreturned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their\nparents\u2019 request.

For example, from 1730 until at least\n1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the\nmarriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at\nLarge of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell & H.

See Brewer 43, 145, 148, 159. Nor could\nthey swear loyalty to a State. See, e.g., 9 Pa. Stats. at\nLarge 111 (1903 ed.). Early federal laws granting aliens\nthe ability to become citizens provided that those under 21\nwere deemed citizens if their fathers chose to naturalize.\nSee, e.g., Act of Mar. 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 104; Act of Jan. 29,\n1795, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 415.\n                              C\n   The history clearly shows a founding generation that\nbelieved parents to have complete authority over their\nminor children and expected parents to direct the devel\nopment of those children. The Puritan tradition in New\nEngland laid the foundation of American parental author\nity and duty. See MacDonald 6 (\u201cThe Puritans are virtu\nally the inventors of the family as we know it today\u201d). In\nthe decades leading up to and following the Revolution,\nthe conception of the child\u2019s mind evolved but the duty and\nauthority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer\nattention to potential influences on children than before.\nSee Mintz 72 (\u201cBy weakening earlier forms of patriarchal\nauthority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of\nchildrearing and education in ensuring social stability\u201d).\nTeachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children\u2019s\nreading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected\nthese concerns and often supported parental authority\nwith the coercive power of the state.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n  In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly\nhave understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include an\nunqualified right to speak to minors. Specifically, I am\nsure that the founding generation would not have under\n16       BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                           THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nstood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to include a right to speak to\nchildren without going through their parents. As a conse\nquence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech\u2014\nfor example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a\nminor\u2014\u201cabridg[e] the freedom of speech\u201d within the origi\nnal meaning of the First Amendment.\n   We have recently noted that this Court does not have\n\u201cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of\nspeech outside the scope of the First Amendment.\u201d Ste\nvens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But we also recog\nnized that there may be \u201csome categories of speech that\nhave been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been\nspecifically identified or discussed as such in our case\nlaw.\u201d Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here\nplainly reveals one such category.2\n                            B\n  Admittedly, the original public understanding of a\nconstitutional provision does not always comport with\nmodern sensibilities.    See Morse, 551 U. S., at 419\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students \u201cas though it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The majority responds that \u201cit does not follow\u201d from the historical\n\nevidence \u201cthat the state has the power to prevent children from hearing\n. . . anything without their parents\u2019 prior consent.\u201d Ante, at 7, n. 3.\nSuch a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its\nview, would be undesirable and \u201cobviously\u201d unconstitutional. Ibid.\n    The majority\u2019s circular argument misses the point. The question is\nnot whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators\ntoday, but rather what the public likely understood \u201cthe freedom of\nspeech\u201d to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District\nof Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 634\u2013635 (2008). I believe it is\nclear that the founding public would not have understood \u201cthe freedom\nof speech\u201d to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.\nIt follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state\nregulation of such speech. To note that there may not be \u201cprecedent for\n[such] state control,\u201d ante, at 8, n. 3, \u201cis not to establish that [there] is a\nconstitutional right,\u201d McIntyre v.

Although much has\nchanged in this country since the Revolution, the notion\nthat parents have authority over their children and that\nthe law can support that authority persists today. For\nexample, at least some States make it a crime to lure or\nentice a minor away from the minor\u2019s parent. See, e.g.,\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes\na minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial\nconsent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 558 (Ap\npendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than\n18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental\nconsent. 10 U. S. C. \u00a7505(a). And minors remain subject\nto curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana\net al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent\nto most medical procedures, id., at 15.\n  Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot\ndo at all, whether they have parental consent or not.\nState laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.\nSee Roper, supra, at 581\u2013585 (Appendixes B and C to\nopinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here),\nminors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal.\nVeh. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase\ntobacco, Cal.

Probate\nCode Ann. \u00a76220 (West 2009).\n  My understanding of \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d is also\nconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents. To be sure, the\n18     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt has held that children are entitled to the protection\nof the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jackson\nville, 422 U. S. 205, 212\u2013213 (1975), and the government\nmay not unilaterally dictate what children can say or\nhear, see id., at 213\u2013214; Tinker v. Des Moines Independ\nent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511 (1969).\nBut this Court has never held, until today, that \u201cthe free\ndom of speech\u201d includes a right to speak to minors (or a\nright of minors to access speech) without going through\nthe minors\u2019 parents. To the contrary, \u201c[i]t is well settled\nthat a State or municipality can adopt more stringent\ncontrols on communicative materials available to youths\nthan on those available to adults.\u201d Erznoznik, supra, at\n212; cf. post, at 3 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\n  The Court\u2019s constitutional jurisprudence \u201chistorically\nhas reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as\na unit with broad parental authority over minor children.\u201d\nParham v.

Under that\ncase law, \u201clegislature[s] [can] properly conclude that par\nents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . pri\nmary responsibility for children\u2019s well-being are entitled to\nthe support of laws designed to aid discharge of that re\nsponsibility.\u201d Ginsberg v.

Criti\ncally, the law does not prohibit adults from buying or\nrenting violent video games for a minor or prohibit minors\nfrom playing such games. Cf. ante, at 10 (ALITO, J., con\ncurring in judgment); post, at 10 (BREYER, J., dissenting).\nThe law also does not restrict a \u201cminor\u2019s parent, grandpar\nent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian\u201d from selling or renting\nhim a violent video game. \u00a71746.1(c).\n   Respondents, associations of companies in the video\ngame industry, brought a preenforcement challenge to\nCalifornia\u2019s law, claiming that on its face the law violates\nthe free speech rights of their members. The Court holds\nthat video games are speech for purposes of the First\nAmendment and finds the statute facially unconstitu\ntional. See ante, at 2\u20133, 11\u201317. I disagree.\n   Under any of this Court\u2019s standards for a facial First\nAmendment challenge, this one must fail. The video game\nassociations cannot show \u201cthat no set of circumstances\nexists under which [the law] would be valid,\u201d \u201cthat\nthe statute lacks any plainly legitimate sweep,\u201d or that\n\u201ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitu\ntional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Stevens, 559 U.

All that the law\ndoes is prohibit the direct sale or rental of a violent video\ngame to a minor by someone other than the minor\u2019s par\nent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or legal guardian. Where a\nminor has a parent or guardian, as is usually true, the law\ndoes not prevent that minor from obtaining a violent video\n20       BROWN v.

In the typical\ncase, the only speech affected is speech that bypasses a\nminor\u2019s parent or guardian. Because such speech does not\nfall within \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d as originally under\nstood, California\u2019s law does not ordinarily implicate the\nFirst Amendment and is not facially unconstitutional.3\n                         *  *     *\n  \u201cThe freedom of speech,\u201d as originally understood, does\nnot include a right to speak to minors without going\nthrough the minors\u2019 parents or guardians.

Hence, I shall focus here upon an area within\nwhich I believe the State can legitimately apply its stat\u00ad\nute, namely sales to minors under the age of 17 (the age\ncutoff used by the industry\u2019s own ratings system), of\nhighly realistic violent video games, which a reasonable\ngame maker would know meet the Act\u2019s criteria. That\narea lies at the heart of the statute. I shall assume that\nthe number of instances in which the State will enforce\nthe statute within that area is comparatively large, and\nthat the number outside that area (for example, sales to\n17-year-olds) is comparatively small.

No one here argues\nthat depictions of violence, even extreme violence, auto\nmatically fall outside the First Amendment\u2019s protective\nscope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child\npornography. We properly speak of categories of expres\u00ad\nsion that lack protection when, like \u201cchild pornography,\u201d\nthe category is broad, when it applies automatically, and\nwhen the State can prohibit everyone, including adults,\nfrom obtaining access to the material within it. But\nwhere, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower\njudicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of\n\u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terror\u00ad\nist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations),\nwe do not normally describe the result as creating a \u201cnew\ncategory of unprotected speech.\u201d See Schenck v. United\nStates, 249 U. S. 47, 52 (1919); Holder v. Humanitarian\nLaw Project, 561 U. S. __ (2010).\n4        BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                       BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Thus, in Stevens, after rejecting the claim that all de\u00ad\npictions of animal cruelty (a category) fall outside the\nFirst Amendment\u2019s protective scope, we went on to decide\nwhether the particular statute at issue violates the First\nAmendment under traditional standards; and we held\nthat, because the statute was overly broad, it was invalid.\nSimilarly, here the issue is whether, applying traditional\nFirst Amendment standards, this statute does, or does\nnot, pass muster.\n                             II\n   In my view, California\u2019s statute provides \u201cfair notice of\nwhat is prohibited,\u201d and consequently it is not impermis\u00ad\nsibly vague. United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304\n(2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there\nconsidered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors\nof a\n       \u201cpicture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion pic\u00ad\n       ture film, or similar visual representation or image of\n       a person or portion of the human body which depicts\n       nudity . . . ,\u201d\nthat\n       \u201cpredominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or\n       morbid interest of minors,\u201d\nand\n       \u201cis patently offensive to prevailing standards in the\n       adult community as a whole with respect to what is\n       suitable material for minors,\u201d\nand\n       \u201cis utterly without redeeming social importance for\n       minors.\u201d 390 U. S., at 646\u2013647.\nThis Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg\n(which is sometimes unfortunately confused with a very\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The five-Justice majority, in an opinion writ\u00ad\nten by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was suf-\nficiently clear. 390 U. S., at 643\u2013645. No Member of the\nCourt voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648\u2013650\n(Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650\u2013671 (Doug\u00ad\nlas, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671\u2013675\n(Fortas, J., dissenting).\n   Comparing the language of California\u2019s statute (set\nforth supra, at 1\u20132) with the language of New York\u2019s\nstatute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find\nany vagueness-related difference. Why are the words\n\u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and \u201cdismember\u201d any more difficult to\nunderstand than the word \u201cnudity?\u201d JUSTICE ALITO ob\u00ad\njects that these words do \u201cnot perform the narrowing\nfunction\u201d that this Court has required in adult obscenity\ncases, where statutes can only cover \u201c \u2018hard core\u2019 \u201d depic\u00ad\ntions. Ante, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment). But\nthe relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but\nto Ginsberg, which dealt with \u201cnudity,\u201d a category no more\n\u201cnarrow\u201d than killing and maiming. And in any event,\nnarrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have any\u00ad\nthing to do with one another. All that is required for\nvagueness purposes is that the terms \u201ckill,\u201d \u201cmaim,\u201d and\n\u201cdismember\u201d give fair notice as to what they cover, which\nthey do.\n   The remainder of California\u2019s definition copies, almost\nword for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.\nCalifornia, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), in permitting a total ban\non material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with\ncriminal penalties). The California law\u2019s reliance on\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d adheres to Miller, and in Fort\nWayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 57\u201358 (1989),\nthis Court specifically upheld the use of Miller\u2019s language\nagainst charges of vagueness. California only departed\nfrom the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It\n6      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsubstituted the word \u201cdeviant\u201d for the words \u201cprurient\u201d\nand \u201cshameful,\u201d and it three times added the words \u201cfor\nminors.\u201d The word \u201cdeviant\u201d differs from \u201cprurient\u201d and\n\u201cshameful,\u201d but it would seem no less suited to defining\nand narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition\nof \u201cfor minors\u201d to a version of the Miller standard was\napproved in Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 643, even though the\nNew York law \u201cdr[ew] no distinction between young chil\u00ad\ndren and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,\u201d\nante, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.).\n   Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Gins\nberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the dif\u00ad\nficulty of the Court\u2019s long search for words capable of\nprotecting expression without depriving the State of a\nlegitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well\nknown, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do\nno better in defining obscenity than, \u201cI know it when I see\nit.\u201d Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) (concur\u00ad\nring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller\u2019s\nstandard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U. S.,\nat 39\u201340. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d tests used in Miller and Ginsberg.\nThey reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise\nstandard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify\ninstances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And\nthey seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free ex\u00ad\npression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the\nwords necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional\nobjective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304 (the Constitution\ndoes not always require \u201c \u2018perfect clarity and precise guid\u00ad\nance,\u2019 \u201d even when \u201c \u2018expressive activity\u2019 \u201d is involved).\n   What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and\nMiller on the one hand and the California law on the\nother? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which\nCalifornia\u2019s statute directly aims, involving, say, a charac\u00ad\nter who shoots out a police officer\u2019s knee, douses him with\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body,\nand finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Foot-\nage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the\nrecord.) See also ante, at 14\u201315 (ALITO, J., concurring in\njudgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law\nclearly protects even the most violent games that possess\nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\u00a71746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller\nor Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the\nstatute\u2019s border. That is because here the industry it-\nself has promulgated standards and created a review\nprocess, in which adults who \u201ctypically have experience\nwith children\u201d assess what games are inappropriate for\nminors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating\nProcess, online at http://www.esrb.org/ratings/&ratings_\nprocess.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24,\n2011, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg\nstatute concerned depictions of \u201cnudity,\u201d while California\u2019s\nstatute concerns extremely violent video games. But for\npurposes of vagueness, why should that matter? JUSTICE\nALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because\nthere are \u201ccertain generally accepted norms concerning\nexpression related to sex,\u201d whereas there are no similarly\n\u201caccepted standards regarding the suitability of violent\nentertainment.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. But there is no evidence\nthat is so. The Court relied on \u201ccommunity standards\u201d in\nMiller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating\n\u201caccepted norms\u201d about depictions of sex. I can find no\ndifference\u2014historical or otherwise\u2014that is relevant to the\nvagueness question. Indeed, the majority\u2019s examples of\nliterary descriptions of violence, on which JUSTICE ALITO\nrelies, do not show anything relevant at all.\n   After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more)\ndescriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence.\nIndeed, sex \u201chas been a theme in art and literature\n8      BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthroughout the ages.\u201d Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n535 U. S. 234, 246 (2002). For every Homer, there is a\nTitian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the\nteenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm\u2019s\nFairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story\nof Lady Godiva.\n   Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif\u00ad\nferences between California\u2019s law and the New York law\nupheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness\nproblems, the state courts can cure them through inter\u00ad\npretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,\n216 (1975) (\u201c[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially\ninvalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing\nconstruction by the state courts\u201d). Cf.

Consequently, for pur\u00ad\nposes of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute\nunconstitutionally vague.\n                             III\n  Video games combine physical action with expression.\nWere physical activity to predominate in a game, govern\u00ad\nment could appropriately intervene, say by requiring\nparents to accompany children when playing a game in\u00ad\nvolving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of\ntoys presenting physical dangers to children. See gener\u00ad\nally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,\n122 Stat. 3016 (\u201cTitle I\u2014Children\u2019s Product Safety\u201d). But\nbecause video games also embody important expressive\nand artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First\nAmendment significantly limits the State\u2019s power to regu\u00ad\nlate. And I would determine whether the State has ex\u00ad\nceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

American Civil\nLiberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874, 875, 879 (1997). I\nwould not apply this strict standard \u201cmechanically.\u201d\nUnited States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529\nU. S. 803, 841 (2000) (BREYER, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and O\u2019Connor and SCALIA, JJ., dissenting). Rather,\nin applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the\nstatute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the\npotentially-justifying \u201ccompelling interests,\u201d the degree to\nwhich the statute furthers that interest, the nature and\neffectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this\nevaluation, whether, overall, \u201cthe statute works speech\u00ad\nrelated harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the\nstatute seeks to provide.\u201d Ibid. See also Burson v. Free\nman, 504 U. S. 191, 210 (1992) (plurality opinion) (apply\u00ad\ning strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a\n\u201csignificant impingement\u201d on speech).\n   First Amendment standards applied in this way are\ndifficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying \u201cstrict\nscrutiny\u201d the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that,\nfor example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolu\u00ad\ntion to a group on the State Department\u2019s list of terrorist\norganizations, Holder, 561 U.

And applying less clearly\ndefined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed\nStates to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v.\nReed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign con\u00ad\ntribution limits that were \u201c \u2018closely drawn\u2019 to match a\n\u2018sufficiently important interest,\u2019 \u201d Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387\u2013388 (2000).\n   Moreover, although the Court did not specify the \u201clevel\n10     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof scrutiny\u201d it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently\ndescribed that case as finding a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in\nprotecting children from harm sufficient to justify limita\u00ad\ntions on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.\nFCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). Since the Court in Gins\nberg specified that the statute\u2019s prohibition applied to\nmaterial that was not obscene, 390 U. S., at 634, I cannot\ndismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscen\u00ad\nity. But cf. ante, at 6 (majority opinion). Nor need I de\u00ad\npend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted\nonly that the legislature have a \u201crational\u201d basis for finding\nthe depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390\nU. S., at 639. For in this case, California has substan\u00ad\ntiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger\nevidence.\n                             A\n   California\u2019s law imposes no more than a modest restric\u00ad\ntion on expression. The statute prevents no one from\nplaying a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a\nvideo game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from\nobtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.\n\u00a71746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from\nbuying, without a parent\u2019s assistance, a gruesomely vio\u00ad\nlent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it\nwants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of\n17. See Brief for Respondents 8.\n   Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a prece-\ndent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or\nvideos, or books. A typical video game involves a signifi\u00ad\ncant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 13\u201314\n(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the\nincreasing interactivity of video game controllers). And\npushing buttons that achieve an interactive, virtual form\nof target practice (using images of human beings as tar\u00ad\ngets), while containing an expressive component, is not\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

See infra, at 14.\n                                B\n   The interest that California advances in support of the\nstatute is compelling. As this Court has previously de\u00ad\nscribed that interest, it consists of both (1) the \u201cbasic\u201d\nparental claim \u201cto authority in their own household to\ndirect the rearing of their children,\u201d which makes it proper\nto enact \u201claws designed to aid discharge of [parental]\nresponsibility,\u201d and (2) the State\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in\nthe well-being of its youth.\u201d Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639\u2013\n640. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7 (\u201c \u2018[O]ne can well distinguish laws\nwhich do not impose a morality on children, but which\nsupport the right of parents to deal with the morals of\ntheir children as they see fit\u2019 \u201d (quoting Henkin, Morals\nand the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.\nL. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests\nwork in tandem, it is not fatally \u201cunderinclusive\u201d for a\nState to advance its interests in protecting children\nagainst the special harms present in an interactive video\ngame medium through a default rule that still allows\nparents to provide their children with what their parents\nwish.\n   Both interests are present here. As to the need to help\nparents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968\nthat \u201c \u2018parental control or guidance cannot always be\nprovided.\u2019 \u201d 390 U. S., at 640. Today, 5.3 million grade\u00ad\nschool-age children of working parents are routinely\nhome alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau,\nWho\u2019s Minding the Kids? Child Care Arrangements:\nSpring 2005/Summer 2006, p. 12 (2010), online at http://\nwww.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p70-121.pdf. Thus, it has,\nif anything, become more important to supplement par\u00ad\nents\u2019 authority to guide their children\u2019s development.\n   As to the State\u2019s independent interest, we have pointed\nout that juveniles are more likely to show a \u201c \u2018lack of ma\u00ad\n12     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nturity\u2019 \u201d and are \u201cmore vulnerable or susceptible to nega\u00ad\ntive influences and outside pressures,\u201d and that their\n\u201ccharacter . . . is not as well formed as that of an adult.\u201d\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 569\u2013570 (2005). And we\nhave therefore recognized \u201ca compelling interest in pro\u00ad\ntecting the physical and psychological well-being of mi\u00ad\nnors.\u201d Sable Communications, supra, at 126.\n   At the same time, there is considerable evidence that\nCalifornia\u2019s statute significantly furthers this compelling\ninterest. That is, in part, because video games are excel\u00ad\nlent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means\ndeveloping habits, becoming accustomed to performing the\ntask, and receiving positive reinforcement when perform\u00ad\ning that task well. Video games can help develop habits,\naccustom the player to performance of the task, and\nreward the player for performing that task well. Why\nelse would the Armed Forces incorporate video games\ninto its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Train\u00ad\ning Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at\nhttp://articles.cnn.com/2001\u201311\u20132 / tech / war.games_1_ict-\n                                             2\n\n\n\nbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.\n   When the military uses video games to help soldiers\ntrain for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial\npurpose. But California argues that when the teaching\nfeatures of video games are put to less desirable ends,\nharm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games\ncan harm children by rewarding them for being violently\naggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be\nviolently aggressive in life. And video games can cause\nmore harm in this respect than can typically passive\nmedia, such as books or films or television programs.\n   There are many scientific studies that support Califor\u00ad\nnia\u2019s views. Social scientists, for example, have found\ncausal evidence that playing these games results in harm.\nLongitudinal studies, which measure changes over time,\nhave found that increased exposure to violent video games\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

In essence, they\nsay that the closer a child\u2019s behavior comes, not to watch\u00ad\ning, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the\npotential psychological harm.

I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise\nto say definitively who is right. But associations of public\nhealth professionals who do possess that expertise have\nreviewed many of these studies and found a significant\nrisk that violent video games, when compared with more\npassive media, are particularly likely to cause children\nharm.\n   Eleven years ago, for example, the American Academy\nof Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child & Adoles\u00ad\ncent Psychiatry, the American Psychological Association,\nthe American Medical Association, the American Academy\nof Family Physicians, and the American Psychiatric Asso\u00ad\nciation released a joint statement, which said:\n    \u201c[O]ver 1000 studies . . . point overwhelmingly to a\n    causal connection between media violence and aggres\u00ad\n    sive behavior in some children . . . [and, though less\n    research had been done at that time, preliminary\n    studies indicated that] the impact of violent interac\u00ad\n    tive entertainment (video games and other interactive\n    media) on young people . . . may be significantly more\n    severe than that wrought by television, movies, or mu\u00ad\n    sic.\u201d Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment\n    Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online\n    at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.\n  Five years later, after more research had been done, the\nAmerican Psychological Association adopted a resolution\nthat said:\n    \u201c[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive\n    video game research suggests such exposure . . .\n    increases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggres\u00ad\n    sive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . de\u00ad\n    creases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physio-\n    logical arousal.\u201d Resolution on Violence in Video\n    Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at\n16      BROWN v.

(empha\u00ad\n     sis added).\nFour years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of\nPediatrics issued a statement in significant part about\ninteractive media. It said:\n     \u201cStudies of these rapidly growing and ever-more\u00ad\n     sophisticated types of media have indicated that the\n     effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even\n     more profound than those of passive media such as\n     television. In many games the child or teenager is\n     \u2018embedded\u2019 in the game and uses a \u2018joystick\u2019 (handheld\n     controller) that enhances both the experience and the\n     aggressive feelings.\u201d Policy Statement\u2014Media Vio\u00ad\n     lence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis\n     added).\nIt added:\n     \u201cCorrelational and experimental studies have re\u00ad\n     vealed that violent video games lead to increases in\n     aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and de\u00ad\n     creases in prosocial behavior.

This\nCourt has always thought it owed an elected legislature\nsome degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of\nthis kind, particularly when they involve technical mat\u00ad\nters that are beyond our competence, and even in First\nAmendment cases. See Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 28\u201329) (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the\nGovernment\u2019s national security judgments); Turner\nBroadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 195\u2013196\n(1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to\nthe Government\u2019s technological judgments). The majority,\nin reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity\nof the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference\nat all. Compare ante, at 12\u201313 (stating that the studies do\nnot provide evidence that violent video games \u201ccause\u201d\nharm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 12\u201313 (citing\nlongitudinal studies finding causation).\n                               C\n   I can find no \u201cless restrictive\u201d alternative to California\u2019s\nlaw that would be \u201cat least as effective.\u201d See Reno, 521\nU. S., at 874. The majority points to a voluntary alterna\u00ad\ntive: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from\nbuying extremely violent games by labeling those games\nwith an \u201cM\u201d (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict\ntheir sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 15\u201316. But\nthis voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps.\nWhen California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Com\u00ad\nmission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unac\u00ad\ncompanied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated\nvideo games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to\nChildren 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/\n07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf. Subsequently the volun-\ntary program has become more effective. But as of\nthe FTC\u2019s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those\n18     BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nunder 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and,\nbreaking down sales by store, one finds that this num-\nber rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national\nchain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Chil-\ndren 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/\nP994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could\neasily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that\nexisted in 2004, particularly after today\u2019s broad ruling\nreduces the industry\u2019s incentive to police itself.\n  The industry also argues for an alternative technological\nsolution, namely \u201cfiltering at the console level.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondents 53. But it takes only a quick search of\nthe Internet to find guides explaining how to circum\u00ad\nvent any such technological controls. YouTube viewers,\nfor example, have watched one of those guides (called\n\u201cHow to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360\u201d) more\nthan 47,000 times. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\nCFlVfVmvN6k.\n                               IV\n   The upshot is that California\u2019s statute, as applied to its\nheartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely\nviolent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on\nspeech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified\nby a compelling interest (supplementing parents\u2019 efforts to\nprevent their children from purchasing potentially harm\u00ad\nful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally\neffective, less restrictive alternative. California\u2019s statute\nis consequently constitutional on its face\u2014though litigants\nremain free to challenge the statute as applied in particu\u00ad\nlar instances, including any effort by the State to apply it\nto minors aged 17.\n   I add that the majority\u2019s different conclusion creates a\nserious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg\nmakes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of\ndepictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nState cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most vio\u00ad\nlent interactive video games. But what sense does it make\nto forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an\nimage of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13\u00ad\nyear-old of an interactive video game in which he actively,\nbut virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures\nand kills her? What kind of First Amendment would\npermit the government to protect children by restrict-\ning sales of that extremely violent video game only when\nthe woman\u2014bound, gagged, tortured, and killed\u2014is also\ntopless?\n   This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.\nIt disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence,\nwhere interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar\njustification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to\nchildren as photographs of nudity. And the record here is\nmore than adequate to support such a view. That is why I\nbelieve that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori.\nAnd it is why I believe California\u2019s law is constitutional on\nits face.\n   This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is\nabout education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in\nsecuring the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can\nraise future generations committed cooperatively to mak\u00ad\ning our system of government work. Education, however,\nis about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by\nmaking choices for themselves. Other times, choices are\nmade for children\u2014by their parents, by their teachers,\nand by the people acting democratically through their\ngovernments. In my view, the First Amendment does not\ndisable government from helping parents make such a\nchoice here\u2014a choice not to have their children buy ex\u00ad\ntremely violent, interactive video games, which they more\nthan reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those\nchildren.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n20     BROWN v.

The\nlibrary conducted a search for relevant articles on the\nfollowing databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Academic\nSearch Premier, ArticleFirst (OCLC), and Dialog (files 1,\n7, 34, 98, 121, 142, 144, 149). The following search terms\nwere used: \u201c(video* or computer or arcade or online) and\n(game*) and (attack* or fight* or aggress* or violen* or\nhostil* or ang* or arous* or prosocial or help* or desens*\nor empathy).\u201d After eliminating irrelevant matches based\non title or abstract, I categorized these articles as either\nsupporting the hypothesis that violent video games are\nharmful (listed in Appendix A), or not supporting/rejecting\nthe hypothesis that violent video games are harmful\n(listed in Appendix B).\n   Many, but not all, of these articles were available to the\nCalifornia Legislature or the parties in briefing this case.\nI list them because they suggest that there is substantial\n(though controverted) evidence supporting the expert\nassociations of public health professionals that have con\u00ad\ncluded that violent video games can cause children psycho\u00ad\nlogical harm. See supra, at 15\u201316. And consequently,\nthese studies help to substantiate the validity of the origi\u00ad\nnal judgment of the California Legislature, as well as that\njudgment\u2019s continuing validity.\n                            A\nAnderson & Bushman, Effects of Violent Video Games on\n Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive\n Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A\n Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature, 12\n Psychological Science: J.
