BENNETT, SECRETARY OF\n\n             STATE OF ARIZONA, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 10\u2013238.      Argued March 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 27, 2011*\nThe Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act created a public financing\n  system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candi\n  dates for state office. Candidates who opt to participate, and who ac\n  cept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an\n  initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign. They are\n  also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candi\n  date\u2019s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent\n  groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in op\n  position to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed\n  candidate\u2019s initial state allotment. Once matching funds are trig\n  gered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for\n  every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate\u2014\n  including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate\n  spends on his campaign\u2014and for every dollar spent by independent\n  groups that support the privately financed candidate. When there\n  are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives\n  matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed can\n  didates and independent expenditure groups. Matching funds top\n  out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.\n    Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independ\n  ent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Ari\n  zona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 10\u2013239, McComish et al. v.

BENNETT\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    funds provision, arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their\n    speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their First Amend\n    ment rights. The District Court entered a permanent injunction\n    against the enforcement of the matching funds provision. The Ninth\n    Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a mini\n    mal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizona\u2019s interest in\n    reducing quid pro quo political corruption.\nHeld: Arizona\u2019s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political\n speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to\n survive First Amendment scrutiny. Pp. 8\u201330.\n    (a) The matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on\n the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expendi\n ture groups. Pp. 8\u201322.\n      (1) Petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially\n burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the so-called\n \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment\u201d of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\n of 2002, which was invalidated in Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n,\n 554 U. S. 724. That law\u2014which permitted the opponent of a candi\n date who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple\n the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the\n personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap\u2014\n unconstitutionally forced a candidate \u201cto choose between the First\n Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjec\n tion to discriminatory fundraising limitations.\u201d Id., at 739. This\n \u201cunprecedented penalty\u201d \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the ex\n ercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for cam\n paign speech\u201d that was not justified by a compelling government in\n terest. Id., at 739\u2013740. Pp. 8\u201310.\n      (2) The logic of Davis largely controls here. Once a privately fi\n nanced candidate has raised or spent more than the State\u2019s initial\n grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the pri\n vately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one\n additional dollar to his opponent. The privately financed candidate\n must \u201cshoulder a special and potentially significant burden\u201d when\n choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his\n own candidacy. 554 U. S., at 739. If the law at issue in Davis im\n posed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably\n does so as well.\n    The differences between the matching funds provision and the law\n struck down in Davis make the Arizona law more constitutionally\n problematic, not less. First, the penalty in Davis consisted of raising\n the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to\n raise the additional funds. Here, the direct and automatic release of\n public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\nburden. Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly fi\nnanced candidates\u2014a frequent occurrence in Arizona\u2014the matching\nfunds provision can create a multiplier effect. Each dollar spent by\nthe privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of fund\ning to each of that candidate\u2019s publicly financed opponents. Third,\nunlike the law in Davis, all of this is to some extent out of the pri\nvately financed candidate\u2019s hands. Spending by independent expen\nditure groups to promote a privately financed candidate\u2019s election\ntriggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome\nor helpful. Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate\nto use as he sees fit. That disparity in control\u2014giving money directly\nto a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expendi\ntures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candi\ndate\u2014is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.\n   The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expendi\nture groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed can\ndidates themselves. The more money spent on behalf of a privately\nfinanced candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,\nthe more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the\nState. The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed\nfinancial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes,\nand spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple\ncandidates. In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent\ngroups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed\non privately financed candidates. Independent groups, of course, are\nnot eligible for public financing. As a result, those groups can only\navoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to\nspeak altogether. Presenting independent expenditure groups with\nsuch a choice\u2014trigger matching funds, change your message, or do\nnot speak\u2014makes the matching funds provision particularly burden\nsome to those groups and certainly contravenes \u201cthe fundamental\nrule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the\nautonomy to choose the content of his own message.\u201d Hurley v. Irish-\nAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.\n557, 573. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     (3) The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and\namicus United States attempting to explain away the existence or\nsignificance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersua\nsive.\n   Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law\ninvalidated in Davis, but there is no doubt that the burden on speech\nis significantly greater here than in Davis. Arizona argues that the\nprovision actually creates more speech. But even if that were the\ncase, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by\n4          ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                     CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    the state law. And burdening the speech of some\u2014here privately fi\n    nanced candidates and independent expenditure groups\u2014to increase\n    the speech of others is a concept \u201cwholly foreign to the First Amend\n    ment,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 48\u201349; cf. Miami Herald Pub\n    lishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258. That no candidate or\n    group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that\n    the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially\n    since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary\n    subsidy to a political rival. And precedents upholding government\n    subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for\n    matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were\n    granted in response to the speech of another.\n       The burden on privately financed candidates and independent ex\n    penditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on\n    speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in\n    Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___. A political\n    candidate\u2019s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a\n    cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure ob\n    ligations.\n       The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident\n    and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candi\n    dates and independent expenditure groups. Indeed every court to\n    have considered the question after Davis has concluded that a candi\n    date or independent group might not spend money if the direct result\n    of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries. Ari\n    zona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a\n    lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that\n    a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be imper\n    missible. But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides\n    that is constitutionally problematic. It is the manner in which that\n    funding is provided\u2014in direct response to the political speech of pri\n    vately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.\n    Pp. 14\u201322.\n       (b) Arizona\u2019s matching funds provision is not \u201c \u2018justified by a com\n    pelling state interest,\u2019 \u201d Davis, supra, at 740. Pp. 22\u201328.\n         (1) There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of\n    the matching funds provision is to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d in terms of\n    candidate resources. The clearest evidence is that the provision op\n    erates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times\n    the initial public funding allotment. The text of the Arizona Act con\n    firms this purpose. The provision setting up the matching funds re\n    gime is titled \u201cEqual funding of candidates,\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n    \u00a716\u2013952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as \u201cequaliz\n    ing funds,\u201d e.g., \u00a716\u2013952(C)(4). This Court has repeatedly rejected\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthe argument that the government has a compelling state interest in\n\u201cleveling the playing field\u201d that can justify undue burdens on political\nspeech, see, e.g., Citizens United, supra, at ___, and the burdens im\nposed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an\ninterest. Pp. 22\u201325.\n     (2) Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to\ncombat corruption\u2014and not \u201clevel the playing field\u201d\u2014the burdens\nthat the matching funds provision imposes on protected political\nspeech are not justified. Burdening a candidate\u2019s expenditure of his\nown funds on his own campaign does not further the State\u2019s anticor\nruption interest. Indeed, \u201creliance on personal funds reduces the\nthreat of corruption.\u201d Davis, supra, at 740\u2013741; see Buckley, supra,\nat 53. The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be sup\nported by the anticorruption interest. Such expenditures are \u201cpoliti\ncal speech . . . not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Citizens United,\n558 U. S., at ___. That separation negates the possibility that the ex\npenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with\nwhich this Court\u2019s case law is concerned. See e.g., id., at ___\u2013___.\nMoreover, \u201c[t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of\nlarge contributions is served by . . . contribution limitations.\u201d Buck\nley, supra, at 55. Given Arizona\u2019s contribution limits, some of the\nmost austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and\nthe general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what\nmarginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching\nfunds provision.\n   The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if\nthe matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorrup\ntion interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates\nparticipate in the State\u2019s public funding system, which in turn helps\ncombat corruption. But the fact that burdening constitutionally pro\ntected speech might indirectly serve the State\u2019s anticorruption inter\nest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not es\ntablish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision. The\nmatching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even\ngreater extent than the law invalidated in Davis. Those burdens\ncannot be justified by a desire to \u201clevel the playing field,\u201d and much of\nthe speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a\ndanger of corruption. The fact that the State may feel that the\nmatching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its pub\nlic funding system to achieve its desired level of participation\u2014\nwithout an undue drain on public resources\u2014is not a sufficient justi\nfication for the burden.\n   The flaw in the State\u2019s argument is apparent in what its reasoning\nwould allow. By the State\u2019s logic it could award publicly financed\n6          ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                     CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed\n    candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to\n    pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public\n    funding regime. Such measures might well promote such participa\n    tion, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political\n    speech. How the State chooses to encourage participation in its pub\n    lic funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State\n    may burden political speech\u2014to the extent the matching funds provi\n    sion does\u2014to ensure adequate participation in a public funding sys\n    tem. Pp. 25\u201328.\n       (c) Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of fund\n    ing political candidacy is not the Court\u2019s business. But determining\n    whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amend\n    ment is. The government \u201cmay engage in public financing of election\n    campaigns,\u201d and doing so can further \u201csignificant governmental in\n    terest[s].\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92\u201393, 96. But the goal of\n    creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a\n    manner consistent with the First Amendment. Arizona\u2019s program\n    gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech\n    of an opposing candidate or an independent group. It does this when\n    the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and\n    has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State. This\n    goes too far; Arizona\u2019s matching funds provision substantially bur\n    dens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent\n    expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.\n    Pp. 28\u201330.\n611 F. 3d 510, reversed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

In an election where a pri\nvately funded candidate faces multiple publicly financed\ncandidates, one dollar raised or spent by the privately fi\nnanced candidate results in an almost one dollar increase\nin public funding to each of the publicly financed candi\ndates.\n   Once the public financing cap is exceeded, additional\nexpenditures by independent groups can result in dollar\nfor-dollar matching funds as well. Spending by independ\nent groups on behalf of a privately funded candidate, or\nin opposition to a publicly funded candidate, results in\nmatching funds. \u00a716\u2013952(C). Independent expenditures\nmade in support of a publicly financed candidate can\nresult in matching funds for other publicly financed candi\ndates in a race. Ibid. The matching funds provision is not\nactivated, however, when independent expenditures are\nmade in opposition to a privately financed candidate.\nMatching funds top out at two times the initial authorized\ngrant of public funding to the publicly financed candidate.\n\u00a716\u2013952(E).\n   Under Arizona law, a privately financed candidate may\nraise and spend unlimited funds, subject to state-imposed\ncontribution limits and disclosure requirements. Contri\nbutions to candidates for statewide office are limited to\n$840 per contributor per election cycle and contributions\nto legislative candidates are limited to $410 per contribu\ntor per election cycle.

Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724 (2008).\nIn Davis, we considered a First Amendment challenge to\nthe so-called \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment\u201d of the Biparti-\nsan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441a\u20131(a).\nUnder that Amendment, if a candidate for the\nUnited States House of Representatives spent more than\n$350,000 of his personal funds, \u201ca new, asymmetrical\nregulatory scheme [came] into play.\u201d 554 U. S., at 729.\nThe opponent of the candidate who exceeded that limit\nwas permitted to collect individual contributions up to\n$6,900 per contributor\u2014three times the normal contribu\ntion limit of $2,300. See ibid. The candidate who spent\nmore than the personal funds limit remained subject to\n10     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe original contribution cap. Davis argued that this\nscheme \u201cburden[ed] his exercise of his First Amendment\nright to make unlimited expenditures of his personal\nfunds because\u201d doing so had \u201cthe effect of enabling his\nopponent to raise more money and to use that money to\nfinance speech that counteract[ed] and thus diminishe[d]\nthe effectiveness of Davis\u2019 own speech.\u201d Id., at 736.\n   In addressing the constitutionality of the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment, we acknowledged that the provision did not\nimpose an outright cap on a candidate\u2019s personal expendi\ntures. Id., at 738\u2013739. We nonetheless concluded that\nthe Amendment was unconstitutional because it forced a\ncandidate \u201cto choose between the First Amendment right\nto engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to\ndiscriminatory fundraising limitations.\u201d Id., at 739. Any\ncandidate who chose to spend more than $350,000 of his\nown money was forced to \u201cshoulder a special and poten\ntially significant burden\u201d because that choice gave fund\nraising advantages to the candidate\u2019s adversary. Ibid. We\ndetermined that this constituted an \u201cunprecedented pen\nalty\u201d and \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise\nof the First Amendment right to use personal funds for\ncampaign speech,\u201d and concluded that the Government\nhad failed to advance any compelling interest that would\njustify such a burden.

Much like the burden placed on speech in Davis, the\nmatching funds provision \u201cimposes an unprecedented\npenalty on any candidate who robustly exercises [his]\nFirst Amendment right[s].\u201d Id., at 739. Under that provi\nsion, \u201cthe vigorous exercise of the right to use personal\nfunds to finance campaign speech\u201d leads to \u201cadvantages\nfor opponents in the competitive context of electoral poli\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntics.\u201d Ibid.\n   Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent\nmore than the State\u2019s initial grant to a publicly financed\ncandidate, each personal dollar spent by the privately\nfinanced candidate results in an award of almost one\nadditional dollar to his opponent. That plainly forces the\nprivately financed candidate to \u201cshoulder a special and\npotentially significant burden\u201d when choosing to exercise\nhis First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his\ncandidacy. Ibid. If the law at issue in Davis imposed a\nburden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unques\ntionably does so as well.\n   The penalty imposed by Arizona\u2019s matching funds provi\nsion is different in some respects from the penalty imposed\nby the law we struck down in Davis. But those differences\nmake the Arizona law more constitutionally problematic,\nnot less. See Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F. 3d\n213, 244\u2013245 (CA2 2010). First, the penalty in Davis\nconsisted of raising the contribution limits for one of the\ncandidates. The candidate who benefited from the in\ncreased limits still had to go out and raise the funds. He\nmay or may not have been able to do so. The other candi\ndate, therefore, faced merely the possibility that his oppo\nnent would be able to raise additional funds, through\ncontribution limits that remained subject to a cap. And\nstill the Court held that this was an \u201cunprecedented pen\nalty,\u201d a \u201cspecial and potentially significant burden\u201d that\nhad to be justified by a compelling state interest\u2014a rigor\nous First Amendment hurdle. 554 U. S., at 739\u2013740.\nHere the benefit to the publicly financed candidate is the\ndirect and automatic release of public money. That is a\nfar heavier burden than in Davis.\n   Second, depending on the specifics of the election at\nissue, the matching funds provision can create a multiplier\neffect. In the Arizona Fourth District House election pre\nviously discussed, see supra, at 4\u20136, if the spending cap\n12      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwere exceeded, each dollar spent by the privately funded\ncandidate would result in an additional dollar of campaign\nfunding to each of that candidate\u2019s publicly financed oppo\nnents. In such a situation, the matching funds provi\nsion forces privately funded candidates to fight a political\nhydra of sorts. Each dollar they spend generates two\nadversarial dollars in response. Again, a markedly more\nsignificant burden than in Davis.\n   Third, unlike the law at issue in Davis, all of this is\nto some extent out of the privately financed candidate\u2019s\nhands. Even if that candidate opted to spend less than the\ninitial public financing cap, any spending by independent\nexpenditure groups to promote the privately financed\ncandidate\u2019s election\u2014regardless whether such support\nwas welcome or helpful\u2014could trigger matching funds.\nWhat is more, that state money would go directly to the\npublicly funded candidate to use as he saw fit. That\ndisparity in control\u2014giving money directly to a publicly\nfinanced candidate, in response to independent expendi\ntures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded\ncandidate\u2014is a substantial advantage for the publicly\nfunded candidate. That candidate can allocate the money\naccording to his own campaign strategy, which the pri\nvately financed candidate could not do with the independ\nent group expenditures that triggered the matching funds.\nCf. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 41) (\u201c \u2018The\nabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expen\nditure with the candidate or his agent . . . undermines the\nvalue of the expenditure to the candidate\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buck\nley, 424 U. S., at 47)).\n   The burdens that this regime places on independent\nexpenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the\nprivately financed candidates themselves. Just as with\nthe candidate the independent group supports, the more\nmoney spent on that candidate\u2019s behalf or in opposition to\na publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfunded candidate receives from the State. And just as\nwith the privately financed candidate, the effect of a dollar\nspent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout\nto the publicly funded candidate the group opposes. More\nover, spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars\nto multiple candidates the group disapproves of, dollars\ndirectly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or\ncandidates.\n   In some ways, the burden the Arizona law imposes on\nindependent expenditure groups is worse than the burden\nit imposes on privately financed candidates, and thus\nsubstantially worse than the burden we found constitu\ntionally impermissible in Davis. If a candidate contem\nplating an electoral run in Arizona surveys the campaign\nlandscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the\nmatching funds regime make a privately funded campaign\nunattractive, he at least has the option of taking public\nfinancing. Independent expenditure groups, of course, do\nnot.\n   Once the spending cap is reached, an independent ex\npenditure group that wants to support a particular candi\ndate\u2014because of that candidate\u2019s stand on an issue of con\ncern to the group\u2014can only avoid triggering matching\nfunds in one of two ways. The group can either opt to\nchange its message from one addressing the merits of the\ncandidates to one addressing the merits of an issue, or\nrefrain from speaking altogether. Presenting independent\nexpenditure groups with such a choice makes the match\ning funds provision particularly burdensome to those\ngroups. And forcing that choice\u2014trigger matching funds,\nchange your message, or do not speak\u2014certainly contra\nvenes \u201cthe fundamental rule of protection under the First\nAmendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose\nthe content of his own message.\u201d Hurley v.

It is because that was\nthe particular burden on candidate speech we faced in\nDavis. And whatever the significance of the distinction in\ngeneral, there can be no doubt that the burden on speech\nis significantly greater in this case than in Davis: That\nmeans that the law here\u2014like the one in Davis\u2014must be\n\njustified by a compelling state interest. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  6 The dissent sees \u201cchutzpah\u201d in candidates exercising their right not\n\nto participate in the public financing scheme, while objecting that the\nsystem violates their First Amendment rights.

The\ndissent barely mentions such groups in its analysis, and fails to address\nnot only the distinctive burdens imposed on these groups\u2014as set forth\nabove\u2014but also the way in which privately financed candidates are\nparticularly burdened when matching funds are triggered by independ\nent group speech.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

In the State\u2019s view, this promotion of First\nAmendment ideals offsets any burden the law might\nimpose on some speakers.\n   Not so. Any increase in speech resulting from the Ari\nzona law is of one kind and one kind only\u2014that of publicly\nfinanced candidates. The burden imposed on privately\nfinanced candidates and independent expenditure groups\nreduces their speech; \u201crestriction[s] on the amount of\nmoney a person or group can spend on political communi\ncation during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity\nof expression.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 19. Thus, even if the\nmatching funds provision did result in more speech by\npublicly financed candidates and more speech in general,\nit would do so at the expense of impermissibly burdening\n(and thus reducing) the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups. This\nsort of \u201cbeggar thy neighbor\u201d approach to free speech\u2014\n\u201crestrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in\norder to enhance the relative voice of others\u201d\u2014is \u201cwholly\nforeign to the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 48\u201349.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  dissent also repeatedly argues that the Arizona matching funds\nregime results in \u201cmore political speech,\u201d post, at 9 (emphasis in origi\nnal); see post, at 2, 10, 13, 16, 32, but\u2014given the logic of the dissent\u2019s\nposition\u2014that is only as a step to less speech. If the matching funds\nprovision achieves its professed goal and causes candidates to switch to\npublic financing, post, at 25, 30, there will be less speech: no spending\nabove the initial state-set amount by formerly privately financed\ncandidates, and no associated matching funds for anyone. Not only\nthat, the level of speech will depend on the State\u2019s judgment of the\ndesirable amount, an amount tethered to available (and often scarce)\nstate resources.\n16       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n    We have rejected government efforts to increase the\nspeech of some at the expense of others outside the cam\npaign finance context. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.\nTornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258 (1974), we held unconsti\ntutional a Florida law that required any newspaper assail\ning a political candidate\u2019s character to allow that candi\ndate to print a reply. We have explained that while the\nstatute in that case \u201cpurported to advance free discussion,\n. . . its effect was to deter newspapers from speaking out in\nthe first instance\u201d because it \u201cpenalized the newspaper\u2019s\nown expression.\u201d Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 10 (1986) (plurality opinion).\nSuch a penalty, we concluded, could not survive First\nAmendment scrutiny. The Arizona law imposes a similar\npenalty: The State grants funds to publicly financed can\ndidates as a direct result of the speech of privately fi\nnanced candidates and independent expenditure groups.\nThe argument that this sort of burden promotes free and\nrobust discussion is no more persuasive here than it was\nin Tornillo.8\n    Arizona asserts that no \u201ccandidate or independent ex\npenditure group is \u2018obliged personally to express a mes\nsage he disagrees with\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018required by the government\nto subsidize a message he disagrees with.\u2019 \u201d Brief for State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Along the same lines, we have invalidated government mandates\n\nthat a speaker \u201chelp disseminate hostile views\u201d opposing that speaker\u2019s\nmessage. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n of Cal., 475\nU. S. 1, 14 (1986) (plurality opinion). In Pacific Gas, we found a public\nutility commission order forcing a utility company to disseminate in its\nbilling envelopes views that the company opposed ran afoul of the First\nAmendment. That case is of course distinguishable from the instant\ncase on its facts, but the central concern\u2014that an individual should not\nbe compelled to \u201chelp disseminate hostile views\u201d\u2014is implicated here as\nwell. Ibid. If a candidate uses his own money to engage in speech\nabove the initial public funding threshold, he is forced to \u201chelp dissemi\nnate hostile views\u201d in a most direct way\u2014his own speech triggers the\nrelease of state money to his opponent.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

But that\ndoes not mean that the matching funds provision does\nnot burden speech. The direct result of the speech of pri\nvately financed candidates and independent expenditure\ngroups is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political\nrival. That cash subsidy, conferred in response to political\nspeech, penalizes speech to a greater extent and more\ndirectly than the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment in Davis. The\nfact that this may result in more speech by the other\ncandidates is no more adequate a justification here than it\nwas in Davis. See 554 U. S., at 741\u2013742.\n  In disagreeing with our conclusion, the dissent relies\non cases in which we have upheld government subsidies\nagainst First Amendment challenge, and asserts that\n\u201c[w]e have never, not once, understood a viewpoint-neutral\nsubsidy given to one speaker to constitute a First Amend\nment burden on another.\u201d Post, at 16. But none of those\ncases\u2014not one\u2014involved a subsidy given in direct re\nsponse to the political speech of another, to allow the\nrecipient to counter that speech. And nothing in the\nanalysis we employed in those cases suggests that the\nchallenged subsidies would have survived First Amend\nment scrutiny if they were triggered by someone else\u2019s\npolitical speech.9\n  The State also argues, and the Court of Appeals con\ncluded, that any burden on privately financed candidates\nand independent expenditure groups is more analogous to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The dissent cites Buckley in response, see post, at 12, n. 3, but the\nfunding in Buckley was of course not triggered by the speech of a\npublicly funded candidate\u2019s political opponent, or the speech of anyone\nelse for that matter. See 424 U. S., at 91\u201395. Whether Arizona\u2019s\nmatching funds provision comports with the First Amendment is not\nsimply a question of whether the State can give a subsidy to a candi\ndate to fund that candidate\u2019s election, but whether that subsidy can be\ntriggered by the speech of another candidate or independent group.\n18     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

The record also\nincludes examples of independent expenditure groups\ndeciding not to speak in opposition to a candidate, App.\n569 (Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee), or in support\nof a candidate, id., at 290 (Club for Growth), to avoid\ntriggering matching funds. In addition, Dr. David Primo,\nan expert involved in the case, \u201cfound that privately fi\nnanced candidates facing the prospect of triggering match\ning funds changed the timing of their fundraising activi\nties, the timing of their expenditures, and, thus, their\noverall campaign strategy.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Brief for State Respondents 39; Brief for Re\nspondent Clean Elections Institute 18\u201319. That should\ncome as no surprise. The hypothesis presupposes a pri\nvately funded candidate who would spend his own money\njust up to the matching funds threshold, when he could\nhave simply taken matching funds in the first place.\n   Furthermore, the Arizona law takes into account all\nmanner of uncoordinated political activity in awarding\nmatching funds. If a privately funded candidate wanted\nto hover just below the triggering level, he would have to\nmake guesses about how much he will receive in the form\nof contributions and supportive independent expenditures.\nHe might well guess wrong.\n   In addition, some candidates may be willing to bear the\nburden of spending above the cap. That a candidate is\nwilling to do so does not make the law any less burden\nsome. See Davis, 554 U. S., at 739 (that candidates may\nchoose to make \u201cpersonal expenditures to support their\ncampaigns\u201d despite the burdens imposed by the Million\naire\u2019s Amendment does not change the fact that \u201cthey\nmust shoulder a special and potentially significant burden\nif they make that choice\u201d). If the State made privately\nfunded candidates pay a $500 fine to run as such, the fact\nthat candidates might choose to pay it does not make the\nfine any less burdensome.\n20     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 218\n(1960). In any event, the burden imposed by the matching\nfunds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that\nconfronts privately financed candidates and independent\nexpenditure groups. Cf. Davis, 554 U. S., at 738\u2013740.\nIndeed even candidates who sign up for public funding\nrecognize the burden matching funds impose on private\nspeech, stating that they participate in the program be\ncause \u201cmatching funds . . . discourage[ ] opponents, special\ninterest groups, and lobbyists from campaigning against\u201d\nthem. GAO, Campaign Finance Reform: Experiences of\nTwo States that Offered Full Public Funding for Political\nCandidates 27 (GAO\u201310\u2013390, 2010). As in Davis, we do\nnot need empirical evidence to determine that the law at\nissue is burdensome. See 554 U. S., at 738\u2013740 (requiring\nno evidence of a burden whatsoever).\n  It is clear not only to us but to every other court to have\nconsidered the question after Davis that a candidate or\nindependent group might not spend money if the direct\nresult of that spending is additional funding to political\nadversaries.

The dissent\u2019s disagree\nment is little more than disagreement with Davis.\n   The State correctly asserts that the candidates and\nindependent expenditure groups \u201cdo not . . . claim that a\nsingle lump sum payment to publicly funded candidates,\u201d\nequivalent to the maximum amount of state financing that\na candidate can obtain through matching funds, would\nimpermissibly burden their speech. Brief for State Re\nspondents 56; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. The State reasons\nthat if providing all the money up front would not burden\nspeech, providing it piecemeal does not do so either. And\nthe State further argues that such incremental admini\nstration is necessary to ensure that public funding is not\nunder- or over-distributed. See Brief for State Respon\ndents 56\u201357.\n   These arguments miss the point. It is not the amount of\nfunding that the State provides to publicly financed candi\ndates that is constitutionally problematic in this case. It\nis the manner in which that funding is provided\u2014in direct\nresponse to the political speech of privately financed can\ndidates and independent expenditure groups.

All\nelse being equal, an advertisement supporting the election\nof a candidate that goes without a response is often more\neffective than an advertisement that is directly contro\nverted. And even if the publicly funded candidate decides\nto use his new money to address a different issue alto\ngether, the end goal of that spending is to claim electoral\nvictory over the opponent that triggered the additional\nstate funding.

The clearest evidence is\nof course the very operation of the provision: It ensures\nthat campaign funding is equal, up to three times the\ninitial public funding allotment. The text of the Citizens\nClean Elections Act itself confirms this purpose. The sta\ntutory provision setting up the matching funds regime\nis titled \u201cEqual funding of candidates.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013952 (West Supp. 2010). The Act refers to the\nfunds doled out after the Act\u2019s matching mechanism is\ntriggered as \u201cequalizing funds.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a716\u2013952(C)(4), (5).\nAnd the regulations implementing the matching funds\nprovision refer to those funds as \u201cequalizing funds\u201d as\nwell. See Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Ariz.\nAdmin. Rule R2\u201320\u2013113.\n   Other features of the Arizona law reinforce this under\nstanding of the matching funds provision. If the Citizens\nClean Election Commission cannot provide publicly fi\nnanced candidates with the moneys that the matching\nfunds provision envisions because of a shortage of funds,\nthe statute allows a publicly financed candidate to \u201caccept\nprivate contributions to bring the total monies received by\nthe candidate\u201d up to the matching funds amount. Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013954(F) (West 2006). Limiting contri\nbutions, of course, is the primary means we have upheld to\ncombat corruption. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23\u201335, 46\u201347.\nIndeed the State argues that one of the principal ways\nthat the matching funds provision combats corruption is\nby eliminating the possibility of any quid pro quo between\nprivate interests and publicly funded candidates by elimi\nnating contributions to those candidates altogether. See\nBrief for State Respondents 45\u201346. But when confronted\nwith a choice between fighting corruption and equalizing\nspeech, the drafters of the matching funds provision chose\nthe latter. That significantly undermines any notion that\nthe \u201cEqual funding of candidates\u201d provision is meant to\nserve some interest other than an interest in equalizing\n24           ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                       CLUB PAC v.

See Randall v. Sorrell, 548\nU. S. 230, 250\u2013251 (2006) (plurality opinion). Contribu\ntions to statewide candidates are limited to $840 per\ncontributor per election cycle and contributions to legisla\ntive candidates are limited to $410 per contributor per\nelection cycle.

We have said that a voluntary system of\n\u201cpublic financing as a means of eliminating the improper\ninfluence of large private contributions furthers a signifi\ncant governmental interest.\u201d Buckley, supra, at 96. But\nthe fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech\nmight indirectly serve the State\u2019s anticorruption interest,\nby encouraging candidates to take public financing, does\nnot establish the constitutionality of the matching funds\nprovision.\n  We have explained that the matching funds provision\nsubstantially burdens the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent groups. It does so to an even\ngreater extent than the law we invalidated in Davis. We\nhave explained that those burdens cannot be justified by a\ndesire to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d We have also explained\nthat much of the speech burdened by the matching funds\nprovision does not, under our precedents, pose a danger of\ncorruption.

By the State\u2019s logic it could grant\na publicly funded candidate five dollars in matching funds\nfor every dollar his privately financed opponent spent, or\nforce candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a\n$10,000 fine in order to encourage participation in the\npublic funding regime. Such measures might well pro\nmote participation in public financing, but would clearly\nsuppress or unacceptably alter political speech. How the\nState chooses to encourage participation in its public\nfunding system matters, and we have never held that\na State may burden political speech\u2014to the extent the\nmatching funds provision does\u2014to ensure adequate par\nticipation in a public funding system. Here the State\u2019s\nchosen method is unduly burdensome and not sufficiently\njustified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.\n                            III\n   We do not today call into question the wisdom of public\nfinancing as a means of funding political candidacy. That\nis not our business. But determining whether laws gov\nerning campaign finance violate the First Amendment is\nvery much our business. In carrying out that responsibil\nity over the past 35 years, we have upheld some restric\ntions on speech and struck down others.

But the\nwhole point of the First Amendment is to protect speakers\nagainst unjustified government restrictions on speech,\neven when those restrictions reflect the will of the major\nity. When it comes to protected speech, the speaker is\nsovereign.\n   Arizona\u2019s program gives money to a candidate in direct\nresponse to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate\nor an independent group. It does this when the opposing\ncandidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and\nhas engaged in political speech above a level set by the\nState. The professed purpose of the state law is to cause a\nsufficient number of candidates to sign up for public fi\nnancing, see post, at 5, which subjects them to the various\nrestrictions on speech that go along with that program.\nThis goes too far; Arizona\u2019s matching funds provision\nsubstantially burdens the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups without\nserving a compelling state interest.\n   \u201c[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major\npurpose of\u201d the First Amendment \u201cwas to protect the free\ndiscussion of governmental affairs,\u201d \u201cinclud[ing] discus\nsions of candidates.\u201d Buckley, 424 U.

As a result of these bargains,\npoliticians ignore the public interest, sound public pol-\nicy languishes, and the citizens lose confidence in their\ngovernment.\n  Recognizing the cancerous effect of this corruption,\nvoters of the first State, acting through referendum, enact\nseveral campaign finance measures previously approved\nby this Court. They cap campaign contributions; require\ndisclosure of substantial donations; and create an optional\n2      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

Individuals who \u201cbun\ndle\u201d campaign contributions become indispensable to\ncandidates in need of money. Simple disclosure fails to\nprevent shady dealing. And candidates choose not to\nparticipate in the public financing system because the\nsums provided do not make them competitive with their\nprivately financed opponents. So the State remains af\nflicted with corruption.\n   Voters of the second State, having witnessed this fail\nure, take an ever-so-slightly different tack to cleaning up\ntheir political system. They too enact contribution limits\nand disclosure requirements. But they believe that the\ngreatest hope of eliminating corruption lies in creating an\neffective public financing program, which will break can\ndidates\u2019 dependence on large donors and bundlers. These\nvoters realize, based on the first State\u2019s experience, that\nsuch a program will not work unless candidates agree to\nparticipate in it. And candidates will participate only if\nthey know that they will receive sufficient funding to run\ncompetitive races. So the voters enact a program that\ncarefully adjusts the money given to would-be officehold\ners, through the use of a matching funds mechanism, in\norder to provide this assurance. The program does not\ndiscriminate against any candidate or point of view, and\nit does not restrict any person\u2019s ability to speak. In fact,\nby providing resources to many candidates, the program\ncreates more speech and thereby broadens public debate.\nAnd just as the voters had hoped, the program accom\nplishes its mission of restoring integrity to the political\nsystem.

The First Amendment, the\nmajority insists, requires us all to rely on the measures\nemployed in the first State, even when they have failed to\nbreak the stranglehold of special interests on elected\nofficials.\n  I disagree. The First Amendment\u2019s core purpose is\nto foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of ro-\nbust discussion and debate. Nothing in Arizona\u2019s anti\ncorruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections\nAct, violates this constitutional protection. To the con\ntrary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the\nFirst Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhanc\ning the \u201copportunity for free political discussion to the end\nthat government may be responsive to the will of the\npeople.\u201d Id., at 269 (internal quotation marks omitted).

If\nan officeholder owes his election to wealthy contributors,\nhe may act for their benefit alone, rather than on behalf of\nall the people. As we recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 424\nU. S. 1, 26 (1976) (per curiam), our seminal campaign\nfinance case, large private contributions may result in\n\u201cpolitical quid pro quo[s],\u201d which undermine the integrity\nof our democracy. And even if these contributions are not\nconverted into corrupt bargains, they still may weaken\nconfidence in our political system because the public per\nceives \u201cthe opportunities for abuse[s].\u201d Id., at 27.

President Theodore Roo\nsevelt proposed the reform as early as 1907 in his State\nof the Union address. \u201cThe need for collecting large cam\npaign funds would vanish,\u201d he said, if the government \u201cpro\nvided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate ex\npenses\u201d of running a campaign, on the condition that a\n\u201cparty receiving campaign funds from the Treasury\u201d would\nforgo private fundraising. 42 Cong. Rec. 78 (1907). The\nidea was\u2014and remains\u2014straightforward.           Candidates\nwho rely on public, rather than private, moneys are \u201cbe\nholden [to] no person and, if elected, should feel no post\nelection obligation toward any contributor.\u201d Republican\nNat. Comm. v. FEC, 487 F. Supp. 280, 284 (SDNY), aff\u2019d\n445 U. S. 955 (1980). By supplanting private cash in\nelections, public financing eliminates the source of politi\ncal corruption.\n   For this reason, public financing systems today dot the\nnational landscape. Almost one-third of the States have\nadopted some form of public financing, and so too has\nthe Federal Government for presidential elections. See\nR. Garrett, Congressional Research Service Report for\nCongress, Public Financing of Congressional Campaigns:\nOverview and Analysis 2, 32 (2009). The federal pro\ngram\u2014which offers presidential candidates a fixed public\nsubsidy if they abstain from private fundraising\u2014\noriginated in the campaign finance law that Congress\nenacted in 1974 on the heels of the Watergate scandal.\nCongress explained at the time that the \u201cpotentia[l] for\nabuse\u201d inherent in privately funded elections was \u201call too\nclear.\u201d S.

Congress, we stated, had\ncreated the program \u201cfor the \u2018general welfare\u2019\u2014to re-\nduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on\nour political process,\u201d as well as to \u201cfacilitate communica\ntion by candidates with the electorate, and to free candi\ndates from the rigors of fundraising.\u201d 424 U. S., at 91. We\nreiterated \u201cthat public financing as a means of eliminat\ning the improper influence of large private contributions\nfurthers a significant governmental interest.\u201d Id., at 96.\nAnd finally, in rejecting a challenge based on the First\nAmendment, we held that the program did not \u201crestrict[]\nor censor speech, but rather . . . use[d] public money to\nfacilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation\nin the electoral process.\u201d Id., at 92\u201393. We declared this\nresult \u201cvital to a self-governing people,\u201d and so concluded\nthat the program \u201cfurther[ed], not abridge[d], pertinent\nFirst Amendment values.\u201d Id., at 93. We thus gave state\nand municipal governments the green light to adopt public\nfinancing systems along the presidential model.\n   But this model, which distributes a lump-sum grant at\nthe beginning of an election cycle, has a significant weak\nness: It lacks a mechanism for setting the subsidy at a\nlevel that will give candidates sufficient incentive to par\nticipate, while also conserving public resources. Public\nfinancing can achieve its goals only if a meaningful num\nber of candidates receive the state subsidy, rather than\nraise private funds. See 611 F. 3d 510, 527 (CA9 2010) (\u201cA\npublic financing system with no participants does nothing\nto reduce the existence or appearance of quid pro quo\ncorruption\u201d).

S., at 57, n. 65, 95. And candidates will choose to\nsign up only if the subsidy provided enables them to run\ncompetitive races. If the grant is pegged too low, it puts\nthe participating candidate at a disadvantage: Because he\nhas agreed to spend no more than the amount of the sub\nsidy, he will lack the means to respond if his privately\nfunded opponent spends over that threshold. So when\nlump-sum grants do not keep up with campaign expendi\ntures, more and more candidates will choose not to par\nticipate.1 But if the subsidy is set too high, it may impose\nan unsustainable burden on the public fisc. See 611 F. 3d,\nat 527 (noting that large subsidies would make public\nfunding \u201cprohibitively expensive and spell its doom\u201d). At\nthe least, hefty grants will waste public resources in the\nmany state races where lack of competition makes such\nfunding unnecessary.\n   The difficulty, then, is in finding the Goldilocks solu\ntion\u2014not too large, not too small, but just right. And\nthis in a world of countless variables\u2014where the amount\nof money needed to run a viable campaign against a pri\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The problem is apparent in the federal system. In recent years, the\n\nnumber of presidential candidates opting to receive public financing\nhas declined because the subsidy has not kept pace with spending\nby privately financed candidates. See Corrado, Public Funding of\nPresidential Campaigns, in The New Campaign Finance Sourcebook\n180, 200 (A. Corrado, T. Mann, D. Ortiz, & T. Potter eds. 2005). The\nlast election cycle offers a stark example: Then-candidate Barack\nObama raised $745.7 million in private funds in 2008, Federal Election\nCommission, 2008 Presidential Campaign Financial Activity Summa\nrized, June 8, 2009, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/\n20090608PresStat.shtml, in contrast with the $105.4 million he could\nhave received in public funds, see Federal Election Commission, Presi\ndential Election Campaign Fund, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/\nbkgnd/fund.shtml (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

A state may\nset lump-sum grants district-by-district, based on spend\ning in past elections; but even that approach leaves out\nmany factors\u2014including the resources of the privately\nfunded candidate\u2014that alter the competitiveness of a seat\nfrom one election to the next. See App. 714\u2013716 (record\nevidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign\nspending levels in Arizona\u2019s legislative districts). In short,\nthe dynamic nature of our electoral system makes ex ante\npredictions about campaign expenditures almost impossi\nble. And that creates a chronic problem for lump-sum\npublic financing programs, because inaccurate estimates\nproduce subsidies that either dissuade candidates from\nparticipating or waste taxpayer money.

Before turning to pub\nlic financing, Arizonans voted by referendum to estab\nlish campaign contribution limits. See Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013905 (West Supp. 2010).

For each\nelectoral contest, the system calibrates the size of the\ngrant automatically to provide sufficient\u2014but no more\nthan sufficient\u2014funds to induce voluntary participation.\nIn effect, the program\u2019s designers found the Goldilocks\nsolution, which produces the \u201cjust right\u201d grant to ensure\nthat a participant in the system has the funds needed to\nrun a competitive race.\n   As the Court explains, Arizona\u2019s matching funds ar\nrangement responds to the shortcoming of the lump-sum\nmodel by adjusting the public subsidy in each race to re\nflect the expenditures of a privately financed candidate\nand the independent groups that support him. See Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013940 et seq. (West 2006 and West\nSupp. 2010). A publicly financed candidate in Arizona\nreceives an initial lump-sum to get his campaign off the\nground. See \u00a716\u2013951 (West 2006). But for every dollar his\nprivately funded opponent (or the opponent\u2019s supporters)\nspends over the initial subsidy, the publicly funded candi\ndate will\u2014to a point\u2014get an additional 94 cents. See\n\u00a716\u2013952 (West Supp. 2010). Once the publicly financed\ncandidate has received three times the amount of the\ninitial disbursement, he gets no further public funding, see\nibid., and remains barred from receiving private contribu\ntions, no matter how much more his privately funded\nopponent spends, see \u00a716\u2013941(A).\n   This arrangement, like the lump-sum model, makes use\nof a pre-set amount to provide financial support to partici\npants. For example, all publicly funded legislative candi\ndates collect an initial grant of $21,479 for a general elec\ntion race. And they can in no circumstances receive more\nthan three times that amount ($64,437); after that, their\nprivately funded competitors hold a marked advantage.\nBut the Arizona system improves on the lump-sum model\nin a crucial respect. By tying public funding to private\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nspending, the State can afford to set a more generous\nupper limit\u2014because it knows that in each campaign it\nwill only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a par\nticipating candidate reasonably competitive. Arizona can\ntherefore assure candidates that, if they accept public\nfunds, they will have the resources to run a viable race\nagainst those who rely on private money. And at the same\ntime, Arizona avoids wasting taxpayers\u2019 dollars. In this\nway, the Clean Elections Act creates an effective and\nsustainable public financing system.\n   The question here is whether this modest adjustment to\nthe public financing program that we approved in Buckley\nmakes the Arizona law unconstitutional. The majority\ncontends that the matching funds provision \u201csubstantially\nburdens protected political speech\u201d and does not \u201cserv[e] a\ncompelling state interest.\u201d Ante, at 2. But the Court is\nwrong on both counts.\n                             II\n  Arizona\u2019s statute does not impose a \u201crestriction,\u201d ante, at\n15, or \u201csubstantia[l] burde[n],\u201d ante, at 2, on expression.\nThe law has quite the opposite effect: It subsidizes and so\nproduces more political speech.

The\nstatute does not tell candidates or their supporters how\nmuch money they can spend to convey their message,\nwhen they can spend it, or what they can spend it on.\nRather, the Arizona law, like the public financing statute\nin Buckley, provides funding for political speech, thus\n\u201cfacilitat[ing] communication by candidates with the elec\ntorate.\u201d Id., at 91.

That is because subsidies,\nby definition and contra the majority, do not restrict any\nspeech.\n    No one can claim that Arizona\u2019s law discriminates\nagainst particular ideas, and so violates the First Amend\nment\u2019s sole limitation on speech subsidies. The State\nthrows open the doors of its public financing program to\nall candidates who meet minimal eligibility requirements\nand agree not to raise private funds. Republicans and\nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals may participate; so\ntoo, the law applies equally to independent expenditure\ngroups across the political spectrum. Arizona disburses\nfunds based not on a candidate\u2019s (or supporter\u2019s) ideas, but\non the candidate\u2019s decision to sign up for public funding.\nSo under our precedent, Arizona\u2019s subsidy statute should\n12        ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                    CLUB PAC v.

In\nthe usual First Amendment subsidy case, a person com\nplains that the government declined to finance his speech,\nwhile bankrolling someone else\u2019s; we must then decide\nwhether the government differentiated between these\nspeakers on a prohibited basis\u2014because it preferred one\nspeaker\u2019s ideas to another\u2019s. See, e.g., id., at 577\u2013578;\nRegan, 461 U. S., at 543\u2013545. But the candidates bringing\nthis challenge do not make that claim\u2014because they were\nnever denied a subsidy. Arizona, remember, offers to\nsupport any person running for state office. Petitioners\nhere refused that assistance. So they are making a novel\nargument: that Arizona violated their First Amendment\nrights by disbursing funds to other speakers even\nthough they could have received (but chose to spurn) the\nsame financial assistance. Some people might call that\nchutzpah.\n  Indeed, what petitioners demand is essentially a right to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  majority claims that none of our subsidy cases involved the\nfunding of \u201crespons[ive]\u201d expression. See ante, at 17. But the majority\ndoes not explain why this distinction, created to fit the facts of this\ncase, should matter so long as the government is not discriminating on\nthe basis of viewpoint. Indeed, the difference the majority highlights\nshould cut in the opposite direction, because facilitating responsive\nspeech fosters \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d public debate. New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). In any event, the\nmajority is wrong to say that we have never approved funding to \u201callow\nthe recipient to counter\u201d someone else\u2019s political speech. Ante, at 17.\nThat is exactly what we approved in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)\n(per curiam). See supra, at 5. The majority notes that the public\nfinancing scheme in Buckley lacked the trigger mechanism used in the\nArizona law. See ante, at 17, n. 9. But again, that is just to describe a\ndifference, not to say why it matters. As I will show, the trigger is\nconstitutionally irrelevant\u2014as we made clear in the very case (Davis v.\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724 (2008)) on which the majority\nprincipally relies. See infra, at 17\u201319, 21\u201322.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Petitioners are able to\nconvey their ideas without public financing\u2014and they\nwould prefer the field to themselves, so that they can\nspeak free from response. To attain that goal, they ask\nthis Court to prevent Arizona from funding electoral\nspeech\u2014even though that assistance is offered to every\nstate candidate, on the same (entirely unobjectionable)\nbasis. And this Court gladly obliges.\n   If an ordinary citizen, without the hindrance of a law\ndegree, thought this result an upending of First Amend\nment values, he would be correct. That Amendment\nprotects no person\u2019s, nor any candidate\u2019s, \u201cright to be free\nfrom vigorous debate.\u201d Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public\nUtil. Comm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U.

And this is no\nplace more true than in elections, where voters\u2019 ability to\nchoose the best representatives depends on debate\u2014on\ncharge and countercharge, call and response. So to invali\ndate a statute that restricts no one\u2019s speech and dis\ncriminates against no idea\u2014that only provides more\nvoices, wider discussion, and greater competition in elec\ntions\u2014is to undermine, rather than to enforce, the First\nAmendment.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority argues that more speech will quickly become \u201cless\n\nspeech,\u201d as candidates switch to public funding.

The principal challenge to that\nsystem came from minor-party candidates not eligible for\nbenefits\u2014surely more compelling plaintiffs than petition\ners, who could have received funding but refused it. Yet\nwe rejected that attack in part because we understood the\nfederal program as supporting, rather than interfering\nwith, expression. See 424 U. S., at 90\u2013108; see also\nRegan, 461 U. S., at 549 (relying on Buckley to hold that\nselective subsidies of expression comport with the First\nAmendment if they are viewpoint neutral). Buckley re\njected any idea, along the lines the majority proposes, that\na subsidy of electoral speech was in truth a restraint. And\nmore: Buckley recognized that public financing of elections\nfosters First Amendment principles. \u201c[T]he central pur\npose of the Speech and Press Clauses,\u201d we explained, \u201cwas\nto assure a society in which \u2018uninhibited, robust, and wide\nopen\u2019 public debate concerning matters of public interest\nwould thrive, for only in such a society can a healthy\nrepresentative democracy flourish.\u201d 424 U.

According to the Court, the\nspecial problem here lies in Arizona\u2019s matching funds\nmechanism, which the majority claims imposes a \u201csub\nstantia[l] burde[n]\u201d on a privately funded candidate\u2019s\nspeech. Ante, at 2. Sometimes, the majority suggests that\nthis \u201cburden\u201d lies in the way the mechanism \u201c \u2018diminish[es]\nthe effectiveness\u2019 \u201d of the privately funded candidate\u2019s\nexpression by enabling his opponent to respond. Ante, at\n10 (quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S.\n724, 736 (2008)); see ante, at 21\u201322. At other times, the\nmajority indicates that the \u201cburden\u201d resides in the deter\nrent effect of the mechanism: The privately funded candi\ndate \u201cmight not spend money\u201d because doing so will trig\nger matching funds. Ante, at 20. Either way, the majority\nis wrong to see a substantial burden on expression.5\n   Most important, and as just suggested, the very notion\nthat additional speech constitutes a \u201cburden\u201d is odd and\nunsettling. Here is a simple fact: Arizona imposes nothing\nremotely resembling a coercive penalty on privately\nfunded candidates. The State does not jail them, fine\nthem, or subject them to any kind of lesser disability. (So\nthe majority\u2019s analogies to a fine on speech, ante, at 19, 28,\nare inapposite.) The only \u201cburden\u201d in this case comes from\nthe grant of a subsidy to another person, and the opportu\nnity that subsidy allows for responsive speech. But that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The majority\u2019s error on this score extends both to candidates and to\n\nindependent expenditure groups. Contrary to the majority\u2019s sugges\ntion, see ante, at 14, n. 6, nearly all of my arguments showing that the\nClean Elections Act does not impose a substantial burden apply to both\nsets of speakers (and apply regardless of whether independent or\ncandidate expenditures trigger the matching funds). That is also true\nof every one of my arguments demonstrating the State\u2019s compelling\ninterest in this legislation. See infra, at 22\u201326. But perhaps the best\nresponse to the majority\u2019s view that the Act inhibits independent\nexpenditure groups lies in an empirical fact already noted: Expendi\ntures by these groups have risen by 253% since Arizona\u2019s law was\nenacted. See n. 2, supra.\n16       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeans the majority cannot get out from under our subsidy\nprecedents. Once again: We have never, not once, under\nstood a viewpoint-neutral subsidy given to one speaker to\nconstitute a First Amendment burden on another. (And\nthat is so even when the subsidy is not open to all, as it is\nhere.) Yet in this case, the majority says that the prospect\nof more speech\u2014responsive speech, competitive speech,\nthe kind of speech that drives public debate\u2014counts as a\nconstitutional injury. That concept, for all the reasons\npreviously given, is \u201cwholly foreign to the First Amend\nment.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49.\n   But put to one side this most fundamental objection\nto the majority\u2019s argument; even then, has the majority\nshown that the burden resulting from the Arizona statute\nis \u201csubstantial\u201d? See Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581,\n592 (2005) (holding that stringent judicial review is \u201cap\npropriate only if the burden is severe\u201d). I will not quarrel\nwith the majority\u2019s assertion that responsive speech by\none candidate may make another candidate\u2019s speech less\neffective, see ante, at 21\u201322; that, after all, is the whole\nidea of the First Amendment, and a benefit of having more\nresponsive speech. See Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S.\n616, 630 (1919) (Holmes., J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he best test\nof truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in\nthe competition of the market\u201d). And I will assume that\nthe operation of this statute may on occasion deter a pri\nvately funded candidate from spending money, and con\nveying ideas by that means.6 My guess is that this does\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6I will note, however, that the record evidence of this effect is spotty\nat best. The majority finds anecdotal evidence supporting its argument\non just 6 pages of a 4500-page summary judgment record. See ante, at\n18\u201319. (The majority also cites sections of petitioners\u2019 briefs, which cite\nthe same 6 pages in the record. See ante, at 19.) That is consistent\nwith the assessment of the District Court Judge who presided over the\nproceedings in this case: He stated that petitioners had presented only\n\u201cvague\u201d and \u201cscattered\u201d evidence of the law\u2019s deterrent impact.

But\nI will take on faith that the matching funds provision may\nlead one or another privately funded candidate to stop\nspending at one or another moment in an election. Still,\ndoes that effect count as a severe burden on expression?\nBy the measure of our prior decisions\u2014which have upheld\ncampaign reforms with an equal or greater impact on\nspeech\u2014the answer is no.\n  Number one: Any system of public financing, including\nthe lump-sum model upheld in Buckley, imposes a similar\nburden on privately funded candidates. Suppose Arizona\nwere to do what all parties agree it could under Buckley\u2014\nprovide a single upfront payment (say, $150,000) to a\nparticipating candidate, rather than an initial payment\n(of $50,000) plus 94% of whatever his privately funded\nopponent spent, up to a ceiling (the same $150,000). That\nsystem would \u201cdiminis[h] the effectiveness\u201d of a privately\nfunded candidate\u2019s speech at least as much, and in the\nsame way: It would give his opponent, who presumably\nwould not be able to raise that sum on his own, more\nmoney to spend. And so too, a lump-sum system may\ndeter speech. A person relying on private resources might\nwell choose not to enter a race at all, because he knows he\nwill face an adequately funded opponent.

I understand the majority\nto essentially concede this point (\u201c \u2018it is never easy to prove a negative,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 20) and to say it does not matter (\u201cwe do not need empirical\nevidence,\u201d ibid.). So I will not belabor the issue by detailing the sub\nstantial testimony (much more than 6 pages worth) that the matching\nfunds provision has not put a dent in privately funded candidates\u2019\nspending.\n18      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ndecides to run, he likely will choose to speak in different\nways\u2014for example, by eschewing dubious, easy-to-answer\ncharges\u2014because his opponent has the ability to respond.\nIndeed, privately funded candidates may well find the\nlump-sum system more burdensome than Arizona\u2019s (as\nsuming the lump is big enough). Pretend you are financ\ning your campaign through private donations. Would you\nprefer that your opponent receive a guaranteed, upfront\npayment of $150,000, or that he receive only $50,000, with\nthe possibility\u2014a possibility that you mostly get to con\ntrol\u2014of collecting another $100,000 somewhere down the\nroad? Me too. That\u2019s the first reason the burden on\nspeech cannot command a different result in this case\nthan in Buckley.\n   Number two: Our decisions about disclosure and dis\nclaimer requirements show the Court is wrong. Starting\nin Buckley and continuing through last Term, the Court\nhas repeatedly declined to view these requirements as a sub\nstantial First Amendment burden, even though they dis\ncourage some campaign speech. \u201cIt is undoubtedly true,\u201d\nwe stated in Buckley, that public disclosure obliga-\ntions \u201cwill deter some individuals\u201d from engaging in ex\npressive activity. 424 U. S., at 68; see Davis, 554 U. S., at\n744. Yet we had no difficulty upholding these require\nments there. And much more recently, in Citizens United\nand Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), we followed that\nprecedent. \u201c \u2018Disclosure requirements may burden the\nability to speak,\u201d we reasoned, but they \u201cdo not prevent\nanyone from speaking.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting\nCitizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51)). So too\nhere. Like a disclosure rule, the matching funds provision\nmay occasionally deter, but \u201cimpose[s] no ceiling\u201d on elec\ntoral expression. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 51).\n   The majority breezily dismisses this comparison, label\ning the analogy \u201cnot even close\u201d because disclosure re\nquirements result in no payment of money to a speaker\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

That is indeed the factual distinc\ntion: A matching fund provision, we can all agree, is not a\ndisclosure rule. But the majority does not tell us why this\ndifference matters. Nor could it. The majority strikes\ndown the matching funds provision because of its ostensi\nble effect\u2014most notably, that it may deter a person from\nspending money in an election. But this Court has ac\nknowledged time and again that disclosure obligations\nhave the selfsame effect. If that consequence does not\ntrigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case,\nit should not do so in the other.\n   Number three: Any burden that the Arizona law im\nposes does not exceed the burden associated with contri\nbution limits, which we have also repeatedly upheld. Con\ntribution limits, we have stated, \u201cimpose direct quantity\nrestrictions on political communication and association,\u201d\nBuckley, 424 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added), thus \u201c \u2018signifi\ncant[ly] interfer[ing]\u2019 \u201d with First Amendment interests,\nNixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n387 (2000) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25). Rather\nthan potentially deterring or \u201c \u2018diminish[ing] the effective\nness\u2019 \u201d of expressive activity, ante, at 10 (quoting Davis,\n554 U. S., at 736), these limits stop it cold. Yet we have\nnever subjected these restrictions to the most stringent\nreview. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 29\u201338. I doubt I have\nto reiterate that the Arizona statute imposes no restraints\non any expressive activity. So the majority once again has\nno reason here to reach a different result.\n   In this way, our campaign finance cases join our speech\nsubsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of Ari\nzona\u2019s law. Both sets of precedents are in accord that a\nstatute funding electoral speech in the way Arizona\u2019s does\nimposes no First Amendment injury.\n                            C\n  The majority thinks it has one case on its side\u2014Davis v.\n20     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                  KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724\u2014and it pegs\neverything on that decision. See ante, at 9\u201312. But\nDavis relies on principles that fit securely within our\nFirst Amendment law and tradition\u2014most unlike today\u2019s\nopinion.\n   As the majority recounts, Davis addressed the constitu\ntionality of federal legislation known as the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment. Under that provision (which applied in elec\ntions not involving public financing), a candidate\u2019s expen\nditure of more than $350,000 of his own money activated a\nchange in applicable contribution limits. Before, each\ncandidate in the race could accept $2,300 from any donor;\nbut now, the opponent of the self-financing candidate\ncould accept three times that much, or up to $6,900 per\ncontributor. So one candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal\nfunds on campaign speech triggered discriminatory con\ntribution restrictions favoring that candidate\u2019s opponent.\n   Under the First Amendment, the similarity between\nDavis and this case matters far less than the differences.\nHere is the similarity: In both cases, one candidate\u2019s cam\npaign expenditure triggered . . . something. Now here are\nthe differences: In Davis, the candidate\u2019s expenditure\ntriggered a discriminatory speech restriction, which Con\ngress could not otherwise have imposed consistent with\nthe First Amendment; by contrast, in this case, the candi\ndate\u2019s expenditure triggers a non-discriminatory speech\nsubsidy, which all parties agree Arizona could have pro\nvided in the first instance. In First Amendment law, that\ndifference makes a difference\u2014indeed, it makes all the\ndifference. As I have indicated before, two great fault\nlines run through our First Amendment doctrine: one,\nbetween speech restrictions and speech subsidies, and the\nother, between discriminatory and neutral government\naction. See supra, at 10\u201311. The Millionaire\u2019s Amend\nment fell on the disfavored side of both divides: To reiter\nate, it imposed a discriminatory speech restriction. The\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

That decision began,\ncontinued, and ended by focusing on the Millionaire\nAmendment\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory contribution limits.\u201d 554\nU. S., at 740. We made that clear in the very first sen\ntence of the opinion, where we summarized the question\npresented. Id., at 728 (\u201cIn this appeal, we consider the\nconstitutionality of federal election law provisions that . . .\nimpose different campaign contribution limits on candi\ndates\u201d). And our focus on the law\u2019s discriminatory restric\ntions was evident again when we examined how the\nCourt\u2019s prior holdings informed the case. Id., at 738 (\u201cWe\nhave never upheld the constitutionality of a law that\nimposes different contribution limits for candidates\u201d). And\nthen again, when we concluded that the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment could not stand. Id., at 740 (explaining that\nthe \u201cthe activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribu\ntion limits\u201d burdens speech). Our decision left no doubt\n(because we repeated the point many times over, see also\nid., at 729, 730, 739, 740, n. 7, 741, 744): The constitu\ntional problem with the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment lay in\nits use of discriminatory speech restrictions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Of course, only publicly funded candidates receive the subsidy. But\n\nthat is because only those candidates have agreed to abide by stringent\nspending caps (which privately funded candidates can exceed by any\namount). And Buckley specifically approved that exchange as consis\ntent with the First Amendment. See 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95. By\ncontrast, Davis involved a scheme in which one candidate in a race\nreceived concrete fundraising advantages, in the form of asymmetrical\ncontribution limits, just because his opponent had spent a certain\namount of his own money.\n22       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\n   But what of the trigger mechanism\u2014in Davis, as here, a\ncandidate\u2019s campaign expenditures? That, after all, is the\nonly thing that this case and Davis share. If Davis had\nheld that the trigger mechanism itself violated the First\nAmendment, then the case would support today\u2019s holding.\nBut Davis said nothing of the kind. It made clear that\nthe trigger mechanism could not rescue the discriminatory\ncontribution limits from constitutional invalidity; that the\nlimits went into effect only after a candidate spent sub\nstantial personal resources rendered them no more per\nmissible under the First Amendment. See id., at 739. But\nDavis did not call into question the trigger mechanism\nitself. Indeed, Davis explained that Congress could have\nused that mechanism to activate a non-discriminatory\n(i.e., across-the-board) increase in contribution limits; in\nthat case, the Court stated, \u201cDavis\u2019 argument would\nplainly fail.\u201d Id., at 737.8 The constitutional infirmity in\nDavis was not the trigger mechanism, but rather what lay\non the other side of it\u2014a discriminatory speech restriction.\n   The Court\u2019s response to these points is difficult to\nfathom. The majority concedes that \u201cour decision in Davis\nfocused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed\nby the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment.\u201d Ante, at 14. That was\nbecause, the majority explains, Davis presented only that\nissue. See ante, at 14. And yet, the majority insists (with\nout explaining how this can be true), the reach of Davis is\nnot so limited. And in any event, the majority claims, the\nburden on speech is \u201cgreater in this case than in Davis.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Notably, the Court found this conclusion obvious even though an\nacross-the-board increase in contribution limits works to the compara\ntive advantage of the non-self-financing candidate\u2014that is, the candi\ndate who actually depends on contributions. Such a system puts the\nself-financing candidate to a choice: Do I stop spending, or do I allow\nthe higher contribution limits (which will help my opponent) to kick in?\nThat strategic choice parallels the one that the Arizona statute forces.\nSee supra, at 15.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 14. But for reasons already stated, that is not\nso. The burden on speech in Davis\u2014the penalty that cam\npaign spending triggered\u2014was the discriminatory contri\nbution restriction, which Congress could not otherwise\nhave imposed. By contrast, the thing triggered here is a\nnon-discriminatory subsidy, of a kind this Court has ap\nproved for almost four decades. Maybe the majority is\nsaying today that it had something like this case in mind\nall the time. But nothing in the logic of Davis controls this\ndecision.9\n                             III\n  For all these reasons, the Court errs in holding that the\ngovernment action in this case substantially burdens\nspeech and so requires the State to offer a compelling in\nterest. But in any event, Arizona has come forward with\njust such an interest, explaining that the Clean Elections\nAct attacks corruption and the appearance of corruption in\nthe State\u2019s political system. The majority\u2019s denigration of\nthis interest\u2014the suggestion that it either is not real or\ndoes not matter\u2014wrongly prevents Arizona from protect\ning the strength and integrity of its democracy.\n                           A\n  Our campaign finance precedents leave no doubt: Pre\nventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority also briefly relies on Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.\n\nTornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974), but that case is still wider of the mark.\nThere, we invalidated a law compelling newspapers (by threat of\ncriminal sanction) to print a candidate\u2019s rejoinder to critical commen\ntary. That law, we explained, overrode the newspaper\u2019s own editorial\njudgment and forced the paper both to pay for and to convey a message\nwith which it disagreed. See id., at 256\u2013258. An analogy might be if\nArizona forced privately funded candidates to purchase their opponents\u2019\nposters, and then to display those posters in their own campaign offices.\nBut that is very far from this case. The Arizona statute does not\nrequire petitioners to disseminate or fund any opposing speech; nor\ndoes it in any way associate petitioners with that speech.\n24      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM\n                  CLUB PAC v.

National Con\nservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 496\u2013497\n(1985) (NCPAC). And so too, these precedents are clear:\nPublic financing of elections serves this interest. See\nsupra, at 4\u20135. As Buckley recognized, and as I earlier\ndescribed, public financing \u201creduce[s] the deleterious\ninfluence of large contributions on our political process.\u201d\n424 U. S., at 91; see id., at 96. When private contributions\nfuel the political system, candidates may make corrupt\nbargains to gain the money needed to win election. See\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. And voters, seeing the depend\nence of candidates on large contributors (or on bundlers of\nsmaller contributions), may lose faith that their represen\ntatives will serve the public\u2019s interest. See Shrink Mis\nsouri, 528 U. S., at 390 (the \u201cassumption that large donors\ncall the tune [may] jeopardize the willingness of voters to\ntake part in democratic governance\u201d). Public financing\naddresses these dangers by minimizing the importance of\nprivate donors in elections. Even the majority appears to\nagree with this premise. See ante, at 27 (\u201cWe have said\nthat . . . \u2018public financing as a means of eliminating the\nimproper influence of large private contributions furthers\na significant governmental interest\u2019 \u201d).\n   This compelling interest appears on the very face of\nArizona\u2019s public financing statute. Start with the title:\nThe Citizens Clean Elections Act. Then proceed to the\nstatute\u2019s formal findings. The public financing program,\nthe findings state, was \u201cinten[ded] to create a clean elec\ntions system that will improve the integrity of Arizona\nstate government by diminishing the influence of special\ninterest money.\u201d \u00a716\u2013940(A) (West 2006).

The Clean Elections Act, the\nState avers, \u201cdeters quid pro quo corruption and the ap\npearance of corruption by providing Arizona candidates\nwith an option to run for office without depending on\noutside contributions.\u201d Brief for State Respondents 19.\nAnd so Arizona, like many state and local governments,\nhas implemented public financing on the theory (which\nthis Court has previously approved, see supra, at 5), that\nthe way to reduce political corruption is to diminish the\nrole of private donors in campaigns.11\n   And that interest justifies the matching funds provision\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The legislative findings also echo what the Buckley Court found\n\ntrue of public financing\u2014that it \u201cencourage[s] citizen participation in\nthe political process\u201d and \u201cpromote[s] freedom of speech\u201d by enhancing\nthe ability of candidates to \u201ccommunicat[e] to voters.\u201d \u00a7\u00a716\u2013940(A), (B).\n   11 The majority briefly suggests that the State\u2019s \u201caustere contribution\n\nlimits\u201d lessen the need for public financing, see ante, at 26, but provides\nno support for that dubious claim. As Arizona and other jurisdictions\nhave discovered, contribution limits may not eliminate the risk of\ncorrupt dealing between candidates and donors, especially given the\nwidespread practice of bundling small contributions into large pack\nages. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31. For much this\nreason, Buckley upheld both limits on contributions to federal candi\ndates and public financing of presidential campaigns. See 424 U. S., at\n23\u201338, 90\u2013108. Arizona, like Congress, was \u201csurely entitled to con\nclude\u201d that contribution limits were only a \u201cpartial measure,\u201d id., at 28,\nand that a functional public financing system was also necessary to\neliminate political corruption. In stating otherwise, the Court substi\ntutes its judgment for that of Arizona\u2019s voters, contrary to our practice\nof declining to \u201csecond-guess a . . . determination as to the need for\nprophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared.\u201d Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n v.

BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nat issue because it is a critical facet of Arizona\u2019s public\nfinancing program. The provision is no more than a dis\nbursement mechanism; but it is also the thing that makes\nthe whole Clean Elections Act work. As described earlier,\nsee supra, at 5\u20136, public financing has an Achilles heel\u2014\nthe difficulty of setting the subsidy at the right amount.\nToo small, and the grant will not attract candidates to the\nprogram; and with no participating candidates, the pro\ngram can hardly decrease corruption. Too large, and the\nsystem becomes unsustainable, or at the least an unneces\nsary drain on public resources. But finding the sweet-spot\nis near impossible because of variation, across districts\nand over time, in the political system. Enter the matching\nfunds provision, which takes an ordinary lump-sum\namount, divides it into thirds, and disburses the last two\nof these (to the extent necessary) via a self-calibrating\nmechanism. That provision is just a fine-tuning of the\nlump-sum program approved in Buckley\u2014a fine-tuning, it\nbears repeating, that prevents no one from speaking and\ndiscriminates against no message. But that fine-tuning\ncan make the difference between a wholly ineffectual\nprogram and one that removes corruption from the politi\ncal system.12 If public financing furthers a compelling\ninterest\u2014and according to this Court, it does\u2014then so too\ndoes the disbursement formula that Arizona uses to make\npublic financing effective. The one conclusion follows\ndirectly from the other.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 For this reason, the majority is quite wrong to say that the State\u2019s\n\ninterest in combating corruption does not support the matching fund\nprovision\u2019s application to a candidate\u2019s expenditure of his own money or\nto an independent expenditure. Ante, at 25\u201326. The point is not that\nthese expenditures themselves corrupt the political process. Rather,\nArizona includes these, as well as all other, expenditures in the pro\ngram to ensure that participating candidates receive the funds neces\nsary to run competitive races\u2014and so to attract those candidates in the\nfirst instance. That is in direct service of the State\u2019s anti-corruption\ninterest.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The Court, to be\nsure, repeatedly asserts that the State\u2019s interest in pre\nventing corruption does not \u201csufficiently justif[y]\u201d the\nmechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys. Ante,\nat 28; see ante, at 27. Only one thing is missing from the\nCourt\u2019s response: any reasoning to support this conclusion.\nNowhere does the majority dispute the State\u2019s view that\nthe success of its public financing system depends on the\nmatching funds mechanism; and nowhere does the major\nity contest that, if this mechanism indeed spells the differ\nence between success and failure, the State\u2019s interest in\npreventing corruption justifies its use. And so the major\nity dismisses, but does not actually answer the State\u2019s\ncontention\u2014even though that contention is the linchpin of\nthe entire case. Assuming (against reason and precedent)\nthat the matching funds provision substantially burdens\nspeech, the question becomes whether the State has of\nfered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.\nArizona has made a forceful argument on this score,\nbased on the need to establish an effective public fi\nnancing system. The majority does not even engage that\nreasoning.\n                               B\n  The majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying\nto show that \u201clevel[ing] the playing field,\u201d not fighting\ncorruption, was the State\u2019s real goal.

See supra,\nat 4, 23\u201324. As against all this, the majority claims to\nhave found three smoking guns that reveal the State\u2019s\ntrue (and nefarious) intention to level the playing field.\nBut the only smoke here is the majority\u2019s, and it is the\nkind that goes with mirrors.\n   The majority first observes that the matching funds\nprovision is titled \u201c \u2018Equal funding of candidates\u2019 \u201d and that\nit refers to matching grants as \u201c \u2018equalizing funds.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 23 (quoting \u00a716\u2013952). Well, yes. The statute provides\nfor matching funds (above and below certain thresholds); a\nsynonym for \u201cmatch\u201d is \u201cequal\u201d; and so the statute uses\nthat term. In sum, the statute describes what the statute\ndoes. But the relevant question here (according to the\nmajority\u2019s own analysis) is why the statute does that\nthing\u2014otherwise said, what interest the statute serves.\nThe State explains that its goal is to prevent corruption,\nand nothing in the Act\u2019s descriptive terms suggests any\nother objective.\n   Next, the majority notes that the Act allows participat\ning candidates to accept private contributions if (but only\nif) the State cannot provide the funds it has promised (for\nexample, because of a budget crisis). Ante, at 23 (citing\n\u00a716\u2013954(F)). That provision, the majority argues, shows\nthat when push comes to shove, the State cares more\nabout \u201cleveling\u201d than about fighting corruption. Ante, at\n23. But this is a plain misreading of the law. All the\nstatute does is assure participating candidates that they\nwill not be left in the lurch if public funds suddenly be\ncome unavailable. That guarantee helps persuade candi\ndates to enter the program by removing the risk of a state\ndefault. And so the provision directly advances the Act\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

I can understand why\nthe majority does not place much emphasis on this point.\nSome members of the majority have ridiculed the practice\nof relying on subsequent statements by legislators to\ndemonstrate an earlier Congress\u2019s intent in enacting a\nstatute. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617,\n631\u2013632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part); United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 434\u2013435 (2009) (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting). Yet here the majority makes a much\nstranger claim: that a statement appearing on a govern\nment website in 2011 (written by who-knows-whom?)\nreveals what hundreds of thousands of Arizona\u2019s voters\nsought to do in 1998 when they enacted the Clean Elec\ntions Act by referendum. Just to state that proposition is\nto know it is wrong.\n   So the majority has no evidence\u2014zero, none\u2014that the\nobjective of the Act is anything other than the interest\nthat the State asserts, the Act proclaims, and the history\nof public financing supports: fighting corruption.\n                              2\n   But suppose the majority had come up with some evi\ndence showing that Arizona had sought to \u201cequalize elec\ntoral opportunities.\u201d Ante, at 24. Would that discovery\nmatter? Our precedent says no, so long as Arizona had a\ncompelling interest in eliminating political corruption\n(which it clearly did). In these circumstances, any interest\nof the State in \u201cleveling\u201d should be irrelevant. That inter\nest could not support Arizona\u2019s law (assuming the law\nburdened speech), but neither would the interest invali\ndate the legislation.\n   To see the point, consider how the matter might arise.\n30       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nAssume a State has two reasons to pass a statute affecting\nspeech. It wants to reduce corruption. But in addition,\nit wishes to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d Under our First\nAmendment law, the interest in preventing corruption is\ncompelling and may justify restraints on speech. But the\ninterest in \u201cleveling the playing field,\u201d according to well\nestablished precedent, cannot support such legislation.13\nSo would this statute (assuming it met all other constitu\ntional standards) violate the First Amendment?\n   The answer must be no. This Court, after all, has never\nsaid that a law restricting speech (or any other constitu\ntional right) demands two compelling interests. One is\nenough. And this statute has one: preventing corruption.\nSo it does not matter that equalizing campaign speech is\nan insufficient interest. The statute could violate the First\nAmendment only if \u201cequalizing\u201d qualified as a forbidden\nmotive\u2014a motive that itself could annul an otherwise\nconstitutional law. But we have never held that to be so.\nAnd that should not be surprising: It is a \u201cfundamental\nprinciple of constitutional adjudication,\u201d from which we\nhave deviated only in exceptional cases, \u201cthat this Court\nwill not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on\nthe basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.\u201d United\nStates v.

As previously explained, speech subsidies stand on a different\nconstitutional footing, see supra, at 10\u201311; so long as the government\nremains neutral among viewpoints, it may choose to assist the speech\nof persons who might not otherwise be heard. But here I am assuming\nfor the sake of argument that the Clean Elections Act imposes the kind\nof restraint on expression requiring that the State show a compelling\ninterest.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

When a law is otherwise\nconstitutional\u2014when it either does not restrict speech or\nrests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restric\ntion\u2014that is the end of the story.\n   That proposition disposes of this case, even if Arizona\nhad an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral oppor\ntunities. No special rule of automatic invalidation applies\nto statutes having some connection to equality; like any\nother laws, they pass muster when supported by an im\nportant enough government interest. Here, Arizona has\ndemonstrated in detail how the matching funds provision\nis necessary to serve a compelling interest in combating\ncorruption. So the hunt for evidence of \u201cleveling\u201d is a\nwaste of time; Arizona\u2019s law survives constitutional scru\ntiny no matter what that search would uncover.\n                             IV\n  This case arose because Arizonans wanted their gov\nernment to work on behalf of all the State\u2019s people. On\nthe heels of a political scandal involving the near-routine\npurchase of legislators\u2019 votes, Arizonans passed a law de\nsigned to sever political candidates\u2019 dependence on large\ncontributors. They wished, as many of their fellow Ameri\ncans wish, to stop corrupt dealing\u2014to ensure that their\nrepresentatives serve the public, and not just the wealthy\ndonors who helped put them in office. The legislation that\nArizona\u2019s voters enacted was the product of deep thought\nand care. It put into effect a public financing system\nthat attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustain\nable cost to the State\u2019s taxpayers. The system discrimi\nnated against no ideas and prevented no speech. Indeed,\nby increasing electoral competition and enabling a wide\nrange of candidates to express their views, the system\n\u201cfurther[ed] . . . First Amendment values.\u201d Buckley, 424\nU.

Robust campaigns leading\nto the election of representatives not beholden to the few,\nbut accountable to the many. The people of Arizona might\nhave expected a decent respect for those objectives.\n    Today, they do not get it.

Argued March 28, 2011\u2014Decided June 27, 2011*\nThe Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act created a public financing\n  system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candi\n  dates for state office. Candidates who opt to participate, and who ac\n  cept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an\n  initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign. They are\n  also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candi\n  date\u2019s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent\n  groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in op\n  position to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed\n  candidate\u2019s initial state allotment. Once matching funds are trig\n  gered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for\n  every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate\u2014\n  including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate\n  spends on his campaign\u2014and for every dollar spent by independent\n  groups that support the privately financed candidate. When there\n  are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives\n  matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed can\n  didates and independent expenditure groups. Matching funds top\n  out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.\n    Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independ\n  ent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Ari\n  zona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 10\u2013239, McComish et al. v.

The District Court entered a permanent injunction\n    against the enforcement of the matching funds provision. The Ninth\n    Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a mini\n    mal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizona\u2019s interest in\n    reducing quid pro quo political corruption.\nHeld: Arizona\u2019s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political\n speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to\n survive First Amendment scrutiny. Pp. 8\u201330.\n    (a) The matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on\n the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expendi\n ture groups. Pp. 8\u201322.\n      (1) Petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially\n burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the so-called\n \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment\u201d of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\n of 2002, which was invalidated in Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n,\n 554 U. S. 724. That law\u2014which permitted the opponent of a candi\n date who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple\n the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the\n personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap\u2014\n unconstitutionally forced a candidate \u201cto choose between the First\n Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjec\n tion to discriminatory fundraising limitations.\u201d Id., at 739. This\n \u201cunprecedented penalty\u201d \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the ex\n ercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for cam\n paign speech\u201d that was not justified by a compelling government in\n terest. Id., at 739\u2013740. Pp. 8\u201310.\n      (2) The logic of Davis largely controls here. Once a privately fi\n nanced candidate has raised or spent more than the State\u2019s initial\n grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the pri\n vately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one\n additional dollar to his opponent. The privately financed candidate\n must \u201cshoulder a special and potentially significant burden\u201d when\n choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his\n own candidacy. 554 U. S., at 739. If the law at issue in Davis im\n posed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably\n does so as well.\n    The differences between the matching funds provision and the law\n struck down in Davis make the Arizona law more constitutionally\n problematic, not less. First, the penalty in Davis consisted of raising\n the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to\n raise the additional funds. Here, the direct and automatic release of\n public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                             Syllabus\n\nburden. Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly fi\nnanced candidates\u2014a frequent occurrence in Arizona\u2014the matching\nfunds provision can create a multiplier effect. Each dollar spent by\nthe privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of fund\ning to each of that candidate\u2019s publicly financed opponents. Third,\nunlike the law in Davis, all of this is to some extent out of the pri\nvately financed candidate\u2019s hands. Spending by independent expen\nditure groups to promote a privately financed candidate\u2019s election\ntriggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome\nor helpful. Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate\nto use as he sees fit. That disparity in control\u2014giving money directly\nto a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expendi\ntures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candi\ndate\u2014is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.\n   The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expendi\nture groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed can\ndidates themselves. The more money spent on behalf of a privately\nfinanced candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,\nthe more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the\nState. The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed\nfinancial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes,\nand spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple\ncandidates. In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent\ngroups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed\non privately financed candidates. Independent groups, of course, are\nnot eligible for public financing. As a result, those groups can only\navoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to\nspeak altogether. Presenting independent expenditure groups with\nsuch a choice\u2014trigger matching funds, change your message, or do\nnot speak\u2014makes the matching funds provision particularly burden\nsome to those groups and certainly contravenes \u201cthe fundamental\nrule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the\nautonomy to choose the content of his own message.\u201d Hurley v. Irish-\nAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.\n557, 573. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     (3) The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and\namicus United States attempting to explain away the existence or\nsignificance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersua\nsive.\n   Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law\ninvalidated in Davis, but there is no doubt that the burden on speech\nis significantly greater here than in Davis. Arizona argues that the\nprovision actually creates more speech. But even if that were the\ncase, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by\n4          ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                     CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    the state law. And burdening the speech of some\u2014here privately fi\n    nanced candidates and independent expenditure groups\u2014to increase\n    the speech of others is a concept \u201cwholly foreign to the First Amend\n    ment,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 48\u201349; cf. Miami Herald Pub\n    lishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258. That no candidate or\n    group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that\n    the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially\n    since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary\n    subsidy to a political rival. And precedents upholding government\n    subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for\n    matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were\n    granted in response to the speech of another.\n       The burden on privately financed candidates and independent ex\n    penditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on\n    speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in\n    Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___. A political\n    candidate\u2019s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a\n    cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure ob\n    ligations.\n       The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident\n    and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candi\n    dates and independent expenditure groups. Indeed every court to\n    have considered the question after Davis has concluded that a candi\n    date or independent group might not spend money if the direct result\n    of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries. Ari\n    zona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a\n    lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that\n    a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be imper\n    missible. But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides\n    that is constitutionally problematic. It is the manner in which that\n    funding is provided\u2014in direct response to the political speech of pri\n    vately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.\n    Pp. 14\u201322.\n       (b) Arizona\u2019s matching funds provision is not \u201c \u2018justified by a com\n    pelling state interest,\u2019 \u201d Davis, supra, at 740. Pp. 22\u201328.\n         (1) There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of\n    the matching funds provision is to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d in terms of\n    candidate resources. The clearest evidence is that the provision op\n    erates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times\n    the initial public funding allotment. The text of the Arizona Act con\n    firms this purpose. The provision setting up the matching funds re\n    gime is titled \u201cEqual funding of candidates,\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n    \u00a716\u2013952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as \u201cequaliz\n    ing funds,\u201d e.g., \u00a716\u2013952(C)(4).

Pp. 22\u201325.\n     (2) Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to\ncombat corruption\u2014and not \u201clevel the playing field\u201d\u2014the burdens\nthat the matching funds provision imposes on protected political\nspeech are not justified. Burdening a candidate\u2019s expenditure of his\nown funds on his own campaign does not further the State\u2019s anticor\nruption interest. Indeed, \u201creliance on personal funds reduces the\nthreat of corruption.\u201d Davis, supra, at 740\u2013741; see Buckley, supra,\nat 53. The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be sup\nported by the anticorruption interest. Such expenditures are \u201cpoliti\ncal speech . . . not coordinated with a candidate.\u201d Citizens United,\n558 U. S., at ___. That separation negates the possibility that the ex\npenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with\nwhich this Court\u2019s case law is concerned. See e.g., id., at ___\u2013___.\nMoreover, \u201c[t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of\nlarge contributions is served by . . . contribution limitations.\u201d Buck\nley, supra, at 55. Given Arizona\u2019s contribution limits, some of the\nmost austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and\nthe general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what\nmarginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching\nfunds provision.\n   The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if\nthe matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorrup\ntion interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates\nparticipate in the State\u2019s public funding system, which in turn helps\ncombat corruption. But the fact that burdening constitutionally pro\ntected speech might indirectly serve the State\u2019s anticorruption inter\nest, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not es\ntablish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision. The\nmatching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even\ngreater extent than the law invalidated in Davis. Those burdens\ncannot be justified by a desire to \u201clevel the playing field,\u201d and much of\nthe speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a\ndanger of corruption. The fact that the State may feel that the\nmatching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its pub\nlic funding system to achieve its desired level of participation\u2014\nwithout an undue drain on public resources\u2014is not a sufficient justi\nfication for the burden.\n   The flaw in the State\u2019s argument is apparent in what its reasoning\nwould allow. By the State\u2019s logic it could award publicly financed\n6          ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                     CLUB PAC v.

Such measures might well promote such participa\n    tion, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political\n    speech. How the State chooses to encourage participation in its pub\n    lic funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State\n    may burden political speech\u2014to the extent the matching funds provi\n    sion does\u2014to ensure adequate participation in a public funding sys\n    tem. Pp. 25\u201328.\n       (c) Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of fund\n    ing political candidacy is not the Court\u2019s business. But determining\n    whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amend\n    ment is. The government \u201cmay engage in public financing of election\n    campaigns,\u201d and doing so can further \u201csignificant governmental in\n    terest[s].\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92\u201393, 96. But the goal of\n    creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a\n    manner consistent with the First Amendment.

See Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013940 et seq. (West 2006 and Supp. 2010). All\neligible candidates for Governor, secretary of state, attor\nney general, treasurer, superintendent of public instruc\ntion, the corporation commission, mine inspector, and the\nstate legislature (both the House and Senate) may opt\nto receive public funding. \u00a716\u2013950(D) (West Supp. 2010).\nEligibility is contingent on the collection of a specified\nnumber of five-dollar contributions from Arizona voters,\n\u00a7\u00a716\u2013946(B) (West 2006), 16\u2013950 (West Supp. 2010),1 and\nthe acceptance of certain campaign restrictions and obliga\ntions. Publicly funded candidates must agree, among\nother things, to limit their expenditure of personal funds\nto $500, \u00a716\u2013941(A)(2) (West Supp. 2010); participate in at\nleast one public debate, \u00a716\u2013956(A)(2); adhere to an over\nall expenditure cap, \u00a716\u2013941(A); and return all unspent\npublic moneys to the State, \u00a716\u2013953.\n   In exchange for accepting these conditions, participating\ncandidates are granted public funds to conduct their cam\npaigns.2 In many cases, this initial allotment may be the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The number of qualifying contributions ranges from 200 for a candi\n\ndate for the state legislature to 4,000 for a candidate for Governor.\nAriz.

But when certain conditions are met, publicly\nfunded candidates are granted additional \u201cequalizing\u201d or\nmatching funds. \u00a7\u00a716\u2013952(A), (B), and (C)(4)\u2013(5) (provid\ning for \u201c[e]qual funding of candidates\u201d).\n   Matching funds are available in both primary and gen\neral elections. In a primary, matching funds are triggered\nwhen a privately financed candidate\u2019s expenditures, com\nbined with the expenditures of independent groups made\nin support of the privately financed candidate or in opposi\ntion to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the primary\nelection allotment of state funds to the publicly financed\ncandidate. \u00a7\u00a716\u2013952(A), (C). During the general election,\nmatching funds are triggered when the amount of money\na privately financed candidate receives in contributions,\ncombined with the expenditures of independent groups\nmade in support of the privately financed candidate or in\nopposition to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the\ngeneral election allotment of state funds to the publicly fi\nnanced candidate. \u00a716\u2013952(B). A privately financed can\ndidate\u2019s expenditures of his personal funds are counted\nas contributions for purposes of calculating matching\nfunds during a general election. See ibid.; Citizens Clean\nElections Commission, Ariz. Admin. Rule R2\u201320\u2013\n113(B)(1)(f) (Sept. 2009).\n   Once matching funds are triggered, each additional dol\nlar that a privately financed candidate spends during\nthe primary results in one dollar in additional state fund\ning to his publicly financed opponent (less a 6% reduction\nmeant to account for fundraising expenses). \u00a716\u2013952(A).\nDuring a general election, every dollar that a candidate\nreceives in contributions\u2014which includes any money of\nhis own that a candidate spends on his campaign\u2014results\nin roughly one dollar in additional state funding to his\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n951(A)(2)\u2013(3) and (D) (West 2006). \n\n4      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

In an election where a pri\nvately funded candidate faces multiple publicly financed\ncandidates, one dollar raised or spent by the privately fi\nnanced candidate results in an almost one dollar increase\nin public funding to each of the publicly financed candi\ndates.\n   Once the public financing cap is exceeded, additional\nexpenditures by independent groups can result in dollar\nfor-dollar matching funds as well. Spending by independ\nent groups on behalf of a privately funded candidate, or\nin opposition to a publicly funded candidate, results in\nmatching funds. \u00a716\u2013952(C). Independent expenditures\nmade in support of a publicly financed candidate can\nresult in matching funds for other publicly financed candi\ndates in a race. Ibid. The matching funds provision is not\nactivated, however, when independent expenditures are\nmade in opposition to a privately financed candidate.\nMatching funds top out at two times the initial authorized\ngrant of public funding to the publicly financed candidate.\n\u00a716\u2013952(E).\n   Under Arizona law, a privately financed candidate may\nraise and spend unlimited funds, subject to state-imposed\ncontribution limits and disclosure requirements. Contri\nbutions to candidates for statewide office are limited to\n$840 per contributor per election cycle and contributions\nto legislative candidates are limited to $410 per contribu\ntor per election cycle.

In the last general\nelection, the number of candidates competing for the two\navailable seats in each district ranged from two to seven.\nSee State of Arizona Official Canvass, 2010 General Elec\ntion Report (compiled and issued by the Arizona secretary\nof state). Arizona\u2019s Fourth District had three candidates\nfor its two available House seats. Two of those candidates\nopted to accept public funding; one candidate chose to\noperate his campaign with private funds.\n   In that election, if the total funds contributed to the\nprivately funded candidate, added to that candidate\u2019s\nexpenditure of personal funds and the expenditures of\nsupportive independent groups, exceeded $21,479\u2014the\nallocation of public funds for the general election in a\ncontested State House race\u2014the matching funds provision\nwould be triggered. See Citizens Clean Elections Commis\nsion, Participating Candidate Guide 2010 Election Cycle\n30 (Aug. 10, 2010). At that point, a number of differ\nent political activities could result in the distribution of\nmatching funds. For example:\n   \u2022\t If the privately funded candidate spent $1,000 of his\n      own money to conduct a direct mailing, each of\n      his publicly funded opponents would receive $940\n      ($1,000 less the 6% offset).\n   \u2022\t If the privately funded candidate held a fundraiser\n      that generated $1,000 in contributions, each of\n      his publicly funded opponents would receive $940.\n   \u2022\t If an independent expenditure group spent $1,000\n      on a brochure expressing its support for the pri\n      vately financed candidate, each of the publicly fi\n      nanced candidates would receive $940 directly.\n   \u2022\t If an independent expenditure group spent $1,000\n      on a brochure opposing one of the publicly financed\n      candidates, but saying nothing about the privately\n6        ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v.

Id., at 69, 71. The District Court entered a\npermanent injunction against the enforcement of the\nmatching funds provision, but stayed implementation of\nthat injunction to allow the State to file an appeal.

Id., at 84\u201385.4\nAfter hearing the case on the merits, the Court of Appeals\nreversed the District Court. The Court of Appeals con\ncluded that the matching funds provision \u201cimposes only a\nminimal burden on First Amendment rights\u201d because it\n\u201cdoes not actually prevent anyone from speaking in the\nfirst place or cap campaign expenditures.\u201d 611 F. 3d 510,\n513, 525 (2010). In that court\u2019s view, any burden imposed\nby the matching funds provision was justified because the\nprovision \u201cbears a substantial relation to the State\u2019s im\nportant interest in reducing quid pro quo political corrup\ntion.\u201d Id., at 513.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Judge Bea dissented from the stay of the District Court\u2019s injunction,\nstating that the Arizona public financing system unconstitutionally\nprefers publicly financed candidates and that under the matching funds\nscheme \u201cit makes no more sense for [a privately financed candidate or\nindependent expenditure group] to spend money now than for a poker\nplayer to make a bet if he knows the house is going to match his bet for\nhis opponent.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\u2013239, p. 87; see id., at 89.\n  5 One judge concurred, relying primarily on his view that \u201cthe Arizona\n8        ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v.

Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724 (2008).\nIn Davis, we considered a First Amendment challenge to\nthe so-called \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Amendment\u201d of the Biparti-\nsan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S. C. \u00a7441a\u20131(a).\nUnder that Amendment, if a candidate for the\nUnited States House of Representatives spent more than\n$350,000 of his personal funds, \u201ca new, asymmetrical\nregulatory scheme [came] into play.\u201d 554 U.

BENNETT\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe original contribution cap. Davis argued that this\nscheme \u201cburden[ed] his exercise of his First Amendment\nright to make unlimited expenditures of his personal\nfunds because\u201d doing so had \u201cthe effect of enabling his\nopponent to raise more money and to use that money to\nfinance speech that counteract[ed] and thus diminishe[d]\nthe effectiveness of Davis\u2019 own speech.\u201d Id., at 736.\n   In addressing the constitutionality of the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment, we acknowledged that the provision did not\nimpose an outright cap on a candidate\u2019s personal expendi\ntures. Id., at 738\u2013739. We nonetheless concluded that\nthe Amendment was unconstitutional because it forced a\ncandidate \u201cto choose between the First Amendment right\nto engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to\ndiscriminatory fundraising limitations.\u201d Id., at 739. Any\ncandidate who chose to spend more than $350,000 of his\nown money was forced to \u201cshoulder a special and poten\ntially significant burden\u201d because that choice gave fund\nraising advantages to the candidate\u2019s adversary. Ibid. We\ndetermined that this constituted an \u201cunprecedented pen\nalty\u201d and \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise\nof the First Amendment right to use personal funds for\ncampaign speech,\u201d and concluded that the Government\nhad failed to advance any compelling interest that would\njustify such a burden. Id., at 739\u2013740.\n                            A\n                             1\n  The logic of Davis largely controls our approach to this\ncase. Much like the burden placed on speech in Davis, the\nmatching funds provision \u201cimposes an unprecedented\npenalty on any candidate who robustly exercises [his]\nFirst Amendment right[s].\u201d Id., at 739. Under that provi\nsion, \u201cthe vigorous exercise of the right to use personal\nfunds to finance campaign speech\u201d leads to \u201cadvantages\nfor opponents in the competitive context of electoral poli\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

That plainly forces the\nprivately financed candidate to \u201cshoulder a special and\npotentially significant burden\u201d when choosing to exercise\nhis First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his\ncandidacy. Ibid. If the law at issue in Davis imposed a\nburden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unques\ntionably does so as well.\n   The penalty imposed by Arizona\u2019s matching funds provi\nsion is different in some respects from the penalty imposed\nby the law we struck down in Davis. But those differences\nmake the Arizona law more constitutionally problematic,\nnot less. See Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F. 3d\n213, 244\u2013245 (CA2 2010). First, the penalty in Davis\nconsisted of raising the contribution limits for one of the\ncandidates. The candidate who benefited from the in\ncreased limits still had to go out and raise the funds. He\nmay or may not have been able to do so. The other candi\ndate, therefore, faced merely the possibility that his oppo\nnent would be able to raise additional funds, through\ncontribution limits that remained subject to a cap. And\nstill the Court held that this was an \u201cunprecedented pen\nalty,\u201d a \u201cspecial and potentially significant burden\u201d that\nhad to be justified by a compelling state interest\u2014a rigor\nous First Amendment hurdle. 554 U. S., at 739\u2013740.\nHere the benefit to the publicly financed candidate is the\ndirect and automatic release of public money. That is a\nfar heavier burden than in Davis.\n   Second, depending on the specifics of the election at\nissue, the matching funds provision can create a multiplier\neffect. In the Arizona Fourth District House election pre\nviously discussed, see supra, at 4\u20136, if the spending cap\n12      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwere exceeded, each dollar spent by the privately funded\ncandidate would result in an additional dollar of campaign\nfunding to each of that candidate\u2019s publicly financed oppo\nnents. In such a situation, the matching funds provi\nsion forces privately funded candidates to fight a political\nhydra of sorts. Each dollar they spend generates two\nadversarial dollars in response. Again, a markedly more\nsignificant burden than in Davis.\n   Third, unlike the law at issue in Davis, all of this is\nto some extent out of the privately financed candidate\u2019s\nhands. Even if that candidate opted to spend less than the\ninitial public financing cap, any spending by independent\nexpenditure groups to promote the privately financed\ncandidate\u2019s election\u2014regardless whether such support\nwas welcome or helpful\u2014could trigger matching funds.\nWhat is more, that state money would go directly to the\npublicly funded candidate to use as he saw fit. That\ndisparity in control\u2014giving money directly to a publicly\nfinanced candidate, in response to independent expendi\ntures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded\ncandidate\u2014is a substantial advantage for the publicly\nfunded candidate. That candidate can allocate the money\naccording to his own campaign strategy, which the pri\nvately financed candidate could not do with the independ\nent group expenditures that triggered the matching funds.\nCf. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 41) (\u201c \u2018The\nabsence of prearrangement and coordination of an expen\nditure with the candidate or his agent . . . undermines the\nvalue of the expenditure to the candidate\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buck\nley, 424 U. S., at 47)).\n   The burdens that this regime places on independent\nexpenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the\nprivately financed candidates themselves. Just as with\nthe candidate the independent group supports, the more\nmoney spent on that candidate\u2019s behalf or in opposition to\na publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

And just as\nwith the privately financed candidate, the effect of a dollar\nspent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout\nto the publicly funded candidate the group opposes. More\nover, spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars\nto multiple candidates the group disapproves of, dollars\ndirectly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or\ncandidates.\n   In some ways, the burden the Arizona law imposes on\nindependent expenditure groups is worse than the burden\nit imposes on privately financed candidates, and thus\nsubstantially worse than the burden we found constitu\ntionally impermissible in Davis. If a candidate contem\nplating an electoral run in Arizona surveys the campaign\nlandscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the\nmatching funds regime make a privately funded campaign\nunattractive, he at least has the option of taking public\nfinancing. Independent expenditure groups, of course, do\nnot.\n   Once the spending cap is reached, an independent ex\npenditure group that wants to support a particular candi\ndate\u2014because of that candidate\u2019s stand on an issue of con\ncern to the group\u2014can only avoid triggering matching\nfunds in one of two ways. The group can either opt to\nchange its message from one addressing the merits of the\ncandidates to one addressing the merits of an issue, or\nrefrain from speaking altogether. Presenting independent\nexpenditure groups with such a choice makes the match\ning funds provision particularly burdensome to those\ngroups. And forcing that choice\u2014trigger matching funds,\nchange your message, or do not speak\u2014certainly contra\nvenes \u201cthe fundamental rule of protection under the First\nAmendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose\nthe content of his own message.\u201d Hurley v.

None is persuasive.\n  Arizona contends that the matching funds provision is\ndistinguishable from the law we invalidated in Davis. The\nState correctly points out that our decision in Davis fo\ncused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by\nthe Millionaire\u2019s Amendment. See 554 U. S., at 729. But\nthat is not because\u2014as the State asserts\u2014the reach of\nthat opinion is limited to asymmetrical contribution limits.\nBrief for State Respondents 26\u201332. It is because that was\nthe particular burden on candidate speech we faced in\nDavis. And whatever the significance of the distinction in\ngeneral, there can be no doubt that the burden on speech\nis significantly greater in this case than in Davis: That\nmeans that the law here\u2014like the one in Davis\u2014must be\n\njustified by a compelling state interest. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n  6 The dissent sees \u201cchutzpah\u201d in candidates exercising their right not\n\nto participate in the public financing scheme, while objecting that the\nsystem violates their First Amendment rights. See post, at 12 (opinion\nof KAGAN, J.). The charge is unjustified, but, in any event, it certainly\ncannot be leveled against the independent expenditure groups. The\ndissent barely mentions such groups in its analysis, and fails to address\nnot only the distinctive burdens imposed on these groups\u2014as set forth\nabove\u2014but also the way in which privately financed candidates are\nparticularly burdened when matching funds are triggered by independ\nent group speech.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

In the State\u2019s view, this promotion of First\nAmendment ideals offsets any burden the law might\nimpose on some speakers.\n   Not so. Any increase in speech resulting from the Ari\nzona law is of one kind and one kind only\u2014that of publicly\nfinanced candidates. The burden imposed on privately\nfinanced candidates and independent expenditure groups\nreduces their speech; \u201crestriction[s] on the amount of\nmoney a person or group can spend on political communi\ncation during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity\nof expression.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 19. Thus, even if the\nmatching funds provision did result in more speech by\npublicly financed candidates and more speech in general,\nit would do so at the expense of impermissibly burdening\n(and thus reducing) the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups. This\nsort of \u201cbeggar thy neighbor\u201d approach to free speech\u2014\n\u201crestrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in\norder to enhance the relative voice of others\u201d\u2014is \u201cwholly\nforeign to the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 48\u201349.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  dissent also repeatedly argues that the Arizona matching funds\nregime results in \u201cmore political speech,\u201d post, at 9 (emphasis in origi\nnal); see post, at 2, 10, 13, 16, 32, but\u2014given the logic of the dissent\u2019s\nposition\u2014that is only as a step to less speech. If the matching funds\nprovision achieves its professed goal and causes candidates to switch to\npublic financing, post, at 25, 30, there will be less speech: no spending\nabove the initial state-set amount by formerly privately financed\ncandidates, and no associated matching funds for anyone. Not only\nthat, the level of speech will depend on the State\u2019s judgment of the\ndesirable amount, an amount tethered to available (and often scarce)\nstate resources.\n16       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n    We have rejected government efforts to increase the\nspeech of some at the expense of others outside the cam\npaign finance context. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.\nTornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258 (1974), we held unconsti\ntutional a Florida law that required any newspaper assail\ning a political candidate\u2019s character to allow that candi\ndate to print a reply. We have explained that while the\nstatute in that case \u201cpurported to advance free discussion,\n. . . its effect was to deter newspapers from speaking out in\nthe first instance\u201d because it \u201cpenalized the newspaper\u2019s\nown expression.\u201d Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 10 (1986) (plurality opinion).\nSuch a penalty, we concluded, could not survive First\nAmendment scrutiny. The Arizona law imposes a similar\npenalty: The State grants funds to publicly financed can\ndidates as a direct result of the speech of privately fi\nnanced candidates and independent expenditure groups.\nThe argument that this sort of burden promotes free and\nrobust discussion is no more persuasive here than it was\nin Tornillo.8\n    Arizona asserts that no \u201ccandidate or independent ex\npenditure group is \u2018obliged personally to express a mes\nsage he disagrees with\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018required by the government\nto subsidize a message he disagrees with.\u2019 \u201d Brief for State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Along the same lines, we have invalidated government mandates\n\nthat a speaker \u201chelp disseminate hostile views\u201d opposing that speaker\u2019s\nmessage. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n of Cal., 475\nU. S. 1, 14 (1986) (plurality opinion). In Pacific Gas, we found a public\nutility commission order forcing a utility company to disseminate in its\nbilling envelopes views that the company opposed ran afoul of the First\nAmendment. That case is of course distinguishable from the instant\ncase on its facts, but the central concern\u2014that an individual should not\nbe compelled to \u201chelp disseminate hostile views\u201d\u2014is implicated here as\nwell. Ibid. If a candidate uses his own money to engage in speech\nabove the initial public funding threshold, he is forced to \u201chelp dissemi\nnate hostile views\u201d in a most direct way\u2014his own speech triggers the\nrelease of state money to his opponent.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

But that\ndoes not mean that the matching funds provision does\nnot burden speech. The direct result of the speech of pri\nvately financed candidates and independent expenditure\ngroups is a state-provided monetary subsidy to a political\nrival. That cash subsidy, conferred in response to political\nspeech, penalizes speech to a greater extent and more\ndirectly than the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment in Davis. The\nfact that this may result in more speech by the other\ncandidates is no more adequate a justification here than it\nwas in Davis. See 554 U. S., at 741\u2013742.\n  In disagreeing with our conclusion, the dissent relies\non cases in which we have upheld government subsidies\nagainst First Amendment challenge, and asserts that\n\u201c[w]e have never, not once, understood a viewpoint-neutral\nsubsidy given to one speaker to constitute a First Amend\nment burden on another.\u201d Post, at 16. But none of those\ncases\u2014not one\u2014involved a subsidy given in direct re\nsponse to the political speech of another, to allow the\nrecipient to counter that speech. And nothing in the\nanalysis we employed in those cases suggests that the\nchallenged subsidies would have survived First Amend\nment scrutiny if they were triggered by someone else\u2019s\npolitical speech.9\n  The State also argues, and the Court of Appeals con\ncluded, that any burden on privately financed candidates\nand independent expenditure groups is more analogous to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The dissent cites Buckley in response, see post, at 12, n. 3, but the\nfunding in Buckley was of course not triggered by the speech of a\npublicly funded candidate\u2019s political opponent, or the speech of anyone\nelse for that matter. See 424 U. S., at 91\u201395. Whether Arizona\u2019s\nmatching funds provision comports with the First Amendment is not\nsimply a question of whether the State can give a subsidy to a candi\ndate to fund that candidate\u2019s election, but whether that subsidy can be\ntriggered by the speech of another candidate or independent group.\n18     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

This analogy is not even close.\nA political candidate\u2019s disclosure of his funding resources\ndoes not result in a cash windfall to his opponent, or affect\ntheir respective disclosure obligations.\n   The State and the Clean Elections Institute assert that\nthe candidates and independent expenditure groups have\nfailed to \u201ccite specific instances in which they decided not\nto raise or spend funds,\u201d Brief for State Respondents 11;\nsee id., at 11\u201312, and have \u201cfailed to present any reliable\nevidence that Arizona\u2019s triggered matching funds deter\ntheir speech,\u201d Brief for Respondent Clean Elections Insti\ntute 6; see id., at 6\u20138. The record in this case, which we\nmust review in its entirety, does not support those asser\ntions. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United\nStates, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499 (1984).\n   That record contains examples of specific candidates\ncurtailing fundraising efforts, and actively discouraging\nsupportive independent expenditures, to avoid triggering\nmatching funds. See, e.g., App. 567 (Rick Murphy), 578\n(Dean Martin); App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10\u2013239, at 329\n(John McComish), 300 (Tony Bouie). The record also\nincludes examples of independent expenditure groups\ndeciding not to speak in opposition to a candidate, App.\n569 (Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee), or in support\nof a candidate, id., at 290 (Club for Growth), to avoid\ntriggering matching funds. In addition, Dr. David Primo,\nan expert involved in the case, \u201cfound that privately fi\nnanced candidates facing the prospect of triggering match\ning funds changed the timing of their fundraising activi\nties, the timing of their expenditures, and, thus, their\noverall campaign strategy.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Brief for State Respondents 39; Brief for Re\nspondent Clean Elections Institute 18\u201319. That should\ncome as no surprise. The hypothesis presupposes a pri\nvately funded candidate who would spend his own money\njust up to the matching funds threshold, when he could\nhave simply taken matching funds in the first place.\n   Furthermore, the Arizona law takes into account all\nmanner of uncoordinated political activity in awarding\nmatching funds. If a privately funded candidate wanted\nto hover just below the triggering level, he would have to\nmake guesses about how much he will receive in the form\nof contributions and supportive independent expenditures.\nHe might well guess wrong.\n   In addition, some candidates may be willing to bear the\nburden of spending above the cap. That a candidate is\nwilling to do so does not make the law any less burden\nsome. See Davis, 554 U. S., at 739 (that candidates may\nchoose to make \u201cpersonal expenditures to support their\ncampaigns\u201d despite the burdens imposed by the Million\naire\u2019s Amendment does not change the fact that \u201cthey\nmust shoulder a special and potentially significant burden\nif they make that choice\u201d). If the State made privately\nfunded candidates pay a $500 fine to run as such, the fact\nthat candidates might choose to pay it does not make the\nfine any less burdensome.\n20     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 218\n(1960). In any event, the burden imposed by the matching\nfunds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that\nconfronts privately financed candidates and independent\nexpenditure groups. Cf. Davis, 554 U. S., at 738\u2013740.\nIndeed even candidates who sign up for public funding\nrecognize the burden matching funds impose on private\nspeech, stating that they participate in the program be\ncause \u201cmatching funds . . . discourage[ ] opponents, special\ninterest groups, and lobbyists from campaigning against\u201d\nthem. GAO, Campaign Finance Reform: Experiences of\nTwo States that Offered Full Public Funding for Political\nCandidates 27 (GAO\u201310\u2013390, 2010). As in Davis, we do\nnot need empirical evidence to determine that the law at\nissue is burdensome. See 554 U.

And\nthe State further argues that such incremental admini\nstration is necessary to ensure that public funding is not\nunder- or over-distributed. See Brief for State Respon\ndents 56\u201357.\n   These arguments miss the point. It is not the amount of\nfunding that the State provides to publicly financed candi\ndates that is constitutionally problematic in this case.

The clearest evidence is\nof course the very operation of the provision: It ensures\nthat campaign funding is equal, up to three times the\ninitial public funding allotment. The text of the Citizens\nClean Elections Act itself confirms this purpose. The sta\ntutory provision setting up the matching funds regime\nis titled \u201cEqual funding of candidates.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013952 (West Supp. 2010). The Act refers to the\nfunds doled out after the Act\u2019s matching mechanism is\ntriggered as \u201cequalizing funds.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a716\u2013952(C)(4), (5).\nAnd the regulations implementing the matching funds\nprovision refer to those funds as \u201cequalizing funds\u201d as\nwell. See Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Ariz.\nAdmin. Rule R2\u201320\u2013113.\n   Other features of the Arizona law reinforce this under\nstanding of the matching funds provision. If the Citizens\nClean Election Commission cannot provide publicly fi\nnanced candidates with the moneys that the matching\nfunds provision envisions because of a shortage of funds,\nthe statute allows a publicly financed candidate to \u201caccept\nprivate contributions to bring the total monies received by\nthe candidate\u201d up to the matching funds amount. Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013954(F) (West 2006). Limiting contri\nbutions, of course, is the primary means we have upheld to\ncombat corruption. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23\u201335, 46\u201347.\nIndeed the State argues that one of the principal ways\nthat the matching funds provision combats corruption is\nby eliminating the possibility of any quid pro quo between\nprivate interests and publicly funded candidates by elimi\nnating contributions to those candidates altogether. See\nBrief for State Respondents 45\u201346. But when confronted\nwith a choice between fighting corruption and equalizing\nspeech, the drafters of the matching funds provision chose\nthe latter. That significantly undermines any notion that\nthe \u201cEqual funding of candidates\u201d provision is meant to\nserve some interest other than an interest in equalizing\n24           ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                       CLUB PAC v.

After all,\nequalizing campaign resources \u201cmight serve not to equal\nize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a\ncandidate who lacked substantial name recognition or\nexposure of his views before the start of the campaign.\u201d\nId., at 57.\n   \u201cLeveling electoral opportunities means making and\nimplementing judgments about which strengths should be\npermitted to contribute to the outcome of an election,\u201d\nDavis, supra, at 742\u2014a dangerous enterprise and one that\ncannot justify burdening protected speech. The dissent\nessentially dismisses this concern, see post, at 27\u201329, but\nit needs to be taken seriously; we have, as noted, held that\nit is not legitimate for the government to attempt to equal\nize electoral opportunities in this manner.

Buckley, supra, at 14 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n                              2\n   As already noted, the State and the Clean Elections\nInstitute disavow any interest in \u201cleveling the playing\nfield.\u201d They instead assert that the \u201cEqual funding of\ncandidates\u201d provision, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013952 (West\nSupp. 2010), serves the State\u2019s compelling interest in\ncombating corruption and the appearance of corruption.\nSee, e.g., Davis, supra, at 740; Wisconsin Right to Life, 551\nU. S., at 478\u2013479 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). But even if\nthe ultimate objective of the matching funds provision is to\ncombat corruption\u2014and not \u201clevel the playing field\u201d\u2014the\nburdens that the matching funds provision imposes on\nprotected political speech are not justified.\n   Burdening a candidate\u2019s expenditure of his own funds\non his own campaign does not further the State\u2019s anticor\nruption interest. Indeed, we have said that \u201creliance on\npersonal funds reduces the threat of corruption\u201d and that\n\u201cdiscouraging [the] use of personal funds[ ] disserves the\nanticorruption interest.\u201d Davis, supra, at 740\u2013741. That\nis because \u201cthe use of personal funds reduces the candi\ndate\u2019s dependence on outside contributions and thereby\ncounteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of\nabuse\u201d of money in politics.

See Randall v. Sorrell, 548\nU. S. 230, 250\u2013251 (2006) (plurality opinion).

We have said that a voluntary system of\n\u201cpublic financing as a means of eliminating the improper\ninfluence of large private contributions furthers a signifi\ncant governmental interest.\u201d Buckley, supra, at 96. But\nthe fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech\nmight indirectly serve the State\u2019s anticorruption interest,\nby encouraging candidates to take public financing, does\nnot establish the constitutionality of the matching funds\nprovision.\n  We have explained that the matching funds provision\nsubstantially burdens the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent groups. It does so to an even\ngreater extent than the law we invalidated in Davis. We\nhave explained that those burdens cannot be justified by a\ndesire to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d We have also explained\nthat much of the speech burdened by the matching funds\nprovision does not, under our precedents, pose a danger of\ncorruption. In light of the foregoing analysis, the fact that\nthe State may feel that the matching funds provision is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  State claims that the Citizens Clean Elections Act was passed\nin response to rampant corruption in Arizona politics\u2014elected officials\n\u201cliterally taking duffle bags full of cash in exchange for sponsoring\nlegislation.\u201d Brief for State Respondents 45. That may be. But, as the\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups point out, the corrup\ntion that plagued Arizona politics is largely unaddressed by the match\ning funds regime.

By the State\u2019s logic it could grant\na publicly funded candidate five dollars in matching funds\nfor every dollar his privately financed opponent spent, or\nforce candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a\n$10,000 fine in order to encourage participation in the\npublic funding regime. Such measures might well pro\nmote participation in public financing, but would clearly\nsuppress or unacceptably alter political speech. How the\nState chooses to encourage participation in its public\nfunding system matters, and we have never held that\na State may burden political speech\u2014to the extent the\nmatching funds provision does\u2014to ensure adequate par\nticipation in a public funding system. Here the State\u2019s\nchosen method is unduly burdensome and not sufficiently\njustified to survive First Amendment scrutiny.\n                            III\n   We do not today call into question the wisdom of public\nfinancing as a means of funding political candidacy. That\nis not our business. But determining whether laws gov\nerning campaign finance violate the First Amendment is\nvery much our business. In carrying out that responsibil\nity over the past 35 years, we have upheld some restric\ntions on speech and struck down others.

The dis\nsent criticizes the Court for standing in the way of what\nthe people of Arizona want. Post, at 2\u20133, 31\u201332. But the\nwhole point of the First Amendment is to protect speakers\nagainst unjustified government restrictions on speech,\neven when those restrictions reflect the will of the major\nity. When it comes to protected speech, the speaker is\nsovereign.\n   Arizona\u2019s program gives money to a candidate in direct\nresponse to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate\nor an independent group. It does this when the opposing\ncandidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and\nhas engaged in political speech above a level set by the\nState. The professed purpose of the state law is to cause a\nsufficient number of candidates to sign up for public fi\nnancing, see post, at 5, which subjects them to the various\nrestrictions on speech that go along with that program.\nThis goes too far; Arizona\u2019s matching funds provision\nsubstantially burdens the speech of privately financed\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups without\nserving a compelling state interest.\n   \u201c[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major\npurpose of\u201d the First Amendment \u201cwas to protect the free\ndiscussion of governmental affairs,\u201d \u201cinclud[ing] discus\nsions of candidates.\u201d Buckley, 424 U.

As a result of these bargains,\npoliticians ignore the public interest, sound public pol-\nicy languishes, and the citizens lose confidence in their\ngovernment.\n  Recognizing the cancerous effect of this corruption,\nvoters of the first State, acting through referendum, enact\nseveral campaign finance measures previously approved\nby this Court. They cap campaign contributions; require\ndisclosure of substantial donations; and create an optional\n2      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v.

Individuals who \u201cbun\ndle\u201d campaign contributions become indispensable to\ncandidates in need of money. Simple disclosure fails to\nprevent shady dealing. And candidates choose not to\nparticipate in the public financing system because the\nsums provided do not make them competitive with their\nprivately financed opponents. So the State remains af\nflicted with corruption.\n   Voters of the second State, having witnessed this fail\nure, take an ever-so-slightly different tack to cleaning up\ntheir political system. They too enact contribution limits\nand disclosure requirements. But they believe that the\ngreatest hope of eliminating corruption lies in creating an\neffective public financing program, which will break can\ndidates\u2019 dependence on large donors and bundlers. These\nvoters realize, based on the first State\u2019s experience, that\nsuch a program will not work unless candidates agree to\nparticipate in it. And candidates will participate only if\nthey know that they will receive sufficient funding to run\ncompetitive races. So the voters enact a program that\ncarefully adjusts the money given to would-be officehold\ners, through the use of a matching funds mechanism, in\norder to provide this assurance. The program does not\ndiscriminate against any candidate or point of view, and\nit does not restrict any person\u2019s ability to speak. In fact,\nby providing resources to many candidates, the program\ncreates more speech and thereby broadens public debate.\nAnd just as the voters had hoped, the program accom\nplishes its mission of restoring integrity to the political\nsystem.

Rep. No. 93\u2013689, p. 4 (1974). In Congress\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

[to]\neliminate reliance on large private contributions\u201d and its\nattendant danger of corruption, while still ensuring that a\nwide range of candidates had access to the ballot. Id., at 5\n(emphasis deleted).\n   We declared the presidential public financing system con\nstitutional in Buckley v. Valeo. Congress, we stated, had\ncreated the program \u201cfor the \u2018general welfare\u2019\u2014to re-\nduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on\nour political process,\u201d as well as to \u201cfacilitate communica\ntion by candidates with the electorate, and to free candi\ndates from the rigors of fundraising.\u201d 424 U. S., at 91. We\nreiterated \u201cthat public financing as a means of eliminat\ning the improper influence of large private contributions\nfurthers a significant governmental interest.\u201d Id., at 96.\nAnd finally, in rejecting a challenge based on the First\nAmendment, we held that the program did not \u201crestrict[]\nor censor speech, but rather . . . use[d] public money to\nfacilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation\nin the electoral process.\u201d Id., at 92\u201393. We declared this\nresult \u201cvital to a self-governing people,\u201d and so concluded\nthat the program \u201cfurther[ed], not abridge[d], pertinent\nFirst Amendment values.\u201d Id., at 93. We thus gave state\nand municipal governments the green light to adopt public\nfinancing systems along the presidential model.\n   But this model, which distributes a lump-sum grant at\nthe beginning of an election cycle, has a significant weak\nness: It lacks a mechanism for setting the subsidy at a\nlevel that will give candidates sufficient incentive to par\nticipate, while also conserving public resources. Public\nfinancing can achieve its goals only if a meaningful num\nber of candidates receive the state subsidy, rather than\nraise private funds. See 611 F. 3d 510, 527 (CA9 2010) (\u201cA\npublic financing system with no participants does nothing\nto reduce the existence or appearance of quid pro quo\ncorruption\u201d). But a public funding program must be vol\n6        ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v.

S., at 57, n. 65, 95. And candidates will choose to\nsign up only if the subsidy provided enables them to run\ncompetitive races. If the grant is pegged too low, it puts\nthe participating candidate at a disadvantage: Because he\nhas agreed to spend no more than the amount of the sub\nsidy, he will lack the means to respond if his privately\nfunded opponent spends over that threshold. So when\nlump-sum grants do not keep up with campaign expendi\ntures, more and more candidates will choose not to par\nticipate.1 But if the subsidy is set too high, it may impose\nan unsustainable burden on the public fisc. See 611 F. 3d,\nat 527 (noting that large subsidies would make public\nfunding \u201cprohibitively expensive and spell its doom\u201d). At\nthe least, hefty grants will waste public resources in the\nmany state races where lack of competition makes such\nfunding unnecessary.\n   The difficulty, then, is in finding the Goldilocks solu\ntion\u2014not too large, not too small, but just right. And\nthis in a world of countless variables\u2014where the amount\nof money needed to run a viable campaign against a pri\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The problem is apparent in the federal system. In recent years, the\n\nnumber of presidential candidates opting to receive public financing\nhas declined because the subsidy has not kept pace with spending\nby privately financed candidates. See Corrado, Public Funding of\nPresidential Campaigns, in The New Campaign Finance Sourcebook\n180, 200 (A. Corrado, T. Mann, D. Ortiz, & T. Potter eds. 2005). The\nlast election cycle offers a stark example: Then-candidate Barack\nObama raised $745.7 million in private funds in 2008, Federal Election\nCommission, 2008 Presidential Campaign Financial Activity Summa\nrized, June 8, 2009, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/\n20090608PresStat.shtml, in contrast with the $105.4 million he could\nhave received in public funds, see Federal Election Commission, Presi\ndential Election Campaign Fund, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/\nbkgnd/fund.shtml (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

A state may\nset lump-sum grants district-by-district, based on spend\ning in past elections; but even that approach leaves out\nmany factors\u2014including the resources of the privately\nfunded candidate\u2014that alter the competitiveness of a seat\nfrom one election to the next. See App. 714\u2013716 (record\nevidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign\nspending levels in Arizona\u2019s legislative districts). In short,\nthe dynamic nature of our electoral system makes ex ante\npredictions about campaign expenditures almost impossi\nble. And that creates a chronic problem for lump-sum\npublic financing programs, because inaccurate estimates\nproduce subsidies that either dissuade candidates from\nparticipating or waste taxpayer money. And so States\nhave made adjustments to the lump-sum scheme that we\napproved in Buckley, in attempts to more effectively re\nduce corruption.\n                             B\n   The people of Arizona had every reason to try to develop\neffective anti-corruption measures. Before turning to pub\nlic financing, Arizonans voted by referendum to estab\nlish campaign contribution limits. See Ariz. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u2013905 (West Supp. 2010). But that effort to abate\ncorruption, standing alone, proved unsuccessful. Five\nyears after the enactment of these limits, the State suf\nfered \u201cthe worst public corruption scandal in its history.\u201d\nBrief for State Respondents 1. In that scandal, known\nas \u201cAzScam,\u201d nearly 10% of the State\u2019s legislators were\ncaught accepting campaign contributions or bribes in ex\nchange for supporting a piece of legislation. Following\nthat incident, the voters of Arizona decided that further\nreform was necessary. Acting once again by referendum,\nthey adopted the public funding system at issue here.\n   The hallmark of Arizona\u2019s program is its inventive\n8      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                  KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\napproach to the challenge that bedevils all public financ\ning schemes: fixing the amount of the subsidy. For each\nelectoral contest, the system calibrates the size of the\ngrant automatically to provide sufficient\u2014but no more\nthan sufficient\u2014funds to induce voluntary participation.\nIn effect, the program\u2019s designers found the Goldilocks\nsolution, which produces the \u201cjust right\u201d grant to ensure\nthat a participant in the system has the funds needed to\nrun a competitive race.\n   As the Court explains, Arizona\u2019s matching funds ar\nrangement responds to the shortcoming of the lump-sum\nmodel by adjusting the public subsidy in each race to re\nflect the expenditures of a privately financed candidate\nand the independent groups that support him. See Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013940 et seq. (West 2006 and West\nSupp. 2010). A publicly financed candidate in Arizona\nreceives an initial lump-sum to get his campaign off the\nground. See \u00a716\u2013951 (West 2006). But for every dollar his\nprivately funded opponent (or the opponent\u2019s supporters)\nspends over the initial subsidy, the publicly funded candi\ndate will\u2014to a point\u2014get an additional 94 cents. See\n\u00a716\u2013952 (West Supp. 2010). Once the publicly financed\ncandidate has received three times the amount of the\ninitial disbursement, he gets no further public funding, see\nibid., and remains barred from receiving private contribu\ntions, no matter how much more his privately funded\nopponent spends, see \u00a716\u2013941(A).\n   This arrangement, like the lump-sum model, makes use\nof a pre-set amount to provide financial support to partici\npants. For example, all publicly funded legislative candi\ndates collect an initial grant of $21,479 for a general elec\ntion race. And they can in no circumstances receive more\nthan three times that amount ($64,437); after that, their\nprivately funded competitors hold a marked advantage.\nBut the Arizona system improves on the lump-sum model\nin a crucial respect. By tying public funding to private\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nspending, the State can afford to set a more generous\nupper limit\u2014because it knows that in each campaign it\nwill only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a par\nticipating candidate reasonably competitive. Arizona can\ntherefore assure candidates that, if they accept public\nfunds, they will have the resources to run a viable race\nagainst those who rely on private money. And at the same\ntime, Arizona avoids wasting taxpayers\u2019 dollars. In this\nway, the Clean Elections Act creates an effective and\nsustainable public financing system.\n   The question here is whether this modest adjustment to\nthe public financing program that we approved in Buckley\nmakes the Arizona law unconstitutional. The majority\ncontends that the matching funds provision \u201csubstantially\nburdens protected political speech\u201d and does not \u201cserv[e] a\ncompelling state interest.\u201d Ante, at 2. But the Court is\nwrong on both counts.\n                             II\n  Arizona\u2019s statute does not impose a \u201crestriction,\u201d ante, at\n15, or \u201csubstantia[l] burde[n],\u201d ante, at 2, on expression.\nThe law has quite the opposite effect: It subsidizes and so\nproduces more political speech. We recognized in Buckley\nthat, for this reason, public financing of elections \u201cfacili\ntate[s] and enlarge[s] public discussion,\u201d in support of\nFirst Amendment values. 424 U. S., at 92\u201393. And what\nwe said then is just as true today. Except in a world gone\ntopsy-turvy, additional campaign speech and electoral\ncompetition is not a First Amendment injury.\n                             A\n  At every turn, the majority tries to convey the im\npression that Arizona\u2019s matching fund statute is of a\npiece with laws prohibiting electoral speech.

It insists that the statute \u201cre\nstrict[s] the speech of some elements of our society\u201d to\nenhance the speech of others. Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And it concludes by reminding us that\nthe point of the First Amendment is to protect \u201cagainst\nunjustified government restrictions on speech.\u201d Ante, at\n29.\n  There is just one problem. Arizona\u2019s matching funds\nprovision does not restrict, but instead subsidizes, speech.\nThe law \u201cimpose[s] no ceiling on [speech] and do[es] not\nprevent anyone from speaking.\u201d Citizens United v.

S., at 92 (holding that a public financing\nlaw does not \u201cabridge, restrict, or censor\u201d expression). The\nstatute does not tell candidates or their supporters how\nmuch money they can spend to convey their message,\nwhen they can spend it, or what they can spend it on.\nRather, the Arizona law, like the public financing statute\nin Buckley, provides funding for political speech, thus\n\u201cfacilitat[ing] communication by candidates with the elec\ntorate.\u201d Id., at 91. By enabling participating candidates\nto respond to their opponents\u2019 expression, the statute\nexpands public debate, in adherence to \u201cour tradition\nthat more speech, not less, is the governing rule.\u201d Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.

That is because subsidies,\nby definition and contra the majority, do not restrict any\nspeech.\n    No one can claim that Arizona\u2019s law discriminates\nagainst particular ideas, and so violates the First Amend\nment\u2019s sole limitation on speech subsidies. The State\nthrows open the doors of its public financing program to\nall candidates who meet minimal eligibility requirements\nand agree not to raise private funds. Republicans and\nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals may participate; so\ntoo, the law applies equally to independent expenditure\ngroups across the political spectrum. Arizona disburses\nfunds based not on a candidate\u2019s (or supporter\u2019s) ideas, but\non the candidate\u2019s decision to sign up for public funding.\nSo under our precedent, Arizona\u2019s subsidy statute should\n12        ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                    CLUB PAC v.

In\nthe usual First Amendment subsidy case, a person com\nplains that the government declined to finance his speech,\nwhile bankrolling someone else\u2019s; we must then decide\nwhether the government differentiated between these\nspeakers on a prohibited basis\u2014because it preferred one\nspeaker\u2019s ideas to another\u2019s. See, e.g., id., at 577\u2013578;\nRegan, 461 U. S., at 543\u2013545. But the candidates bringing\nthis challenge do not make that claim\u2014because they were\nnever denied a subsidy. Arizona, remember, offers to\nsupport any person running for state office. Petitioners\nhere refused that assistance. So they are making a novel\nargument: that Arizona violated their First Amendment\nrights by disbursing funds to other speakers even\nthough they could have received (but chose to spurn) the\nsame financial assistance. Some people might call that\nchutzpah.\n  Indeed, what petitioners demand is essentially a right to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  majority claims that none of our subsidy cases involved the\nfunding of \u201crespons[ive]\u201d expression. See ante, at 17. But the majority\ndoes not explain why this distinction, created to fit the facts of this\ncase, should matter so long as the government is not discriminating on\nthe basis of viewpoint. Indeed, the difference the majority highlights\nshould cut in the opposite direction, because facilitating responsive\nspeech fosters \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d public debate. New\nYork Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). In any event, the\nmajority is wrong to say that we have never approved funding to \u201callow\nthe recipient to counter\u201d someone else\u2019s political speech. Ante, at 17.\nThat is exactly what we approved in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)\n(per curiam). See supra, at 5. The majority notes that the public\nfinancing scheme in Buckley lacked the trigger mechanism used in the\nArizona law. See ante, at 17, n. 9. But again, that is just to describe a\ndifference, not to say why it matters. As I will show, the trigger is\nconstitutionally irrelevant\u2014as we made clear in the very case (Davis v.\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724 (2008)) on which the majority\nprincipally relies. See infra, at 17\u201319, 21\u201322.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Petitioners are able to\nconvey their ideas without public financing\u2014and they\nwould prefer the field to themselves, so that they can\nspeak free from response. To attain that goal, they ask\nthis Court to prevent Arizona from funding electoral\nspeech\u2014even though that assistance is offered to every\nstate candidate, on the same (entirely unobjectionable)\nbasis. And this Court gladly obliges.\n   If an ordinary citizen, without the hindrance of a law\ndegree, thought this result an upending of First Amend\nment values, he would be correct.

And this is no\nplace more true than in elections, where voters\u2019 ability to\nchoose the best representatives depends on debate\u2014on\ncharge and countercharge, call and response. So to invali\ndate a statute that restricts no one\u2019s speech and dis\ncriminates against no idea\u2014that only provides more\nvoices, wider discussion, and greater competition in elec\ntions\u2014is to undermine, rather than to enforce, the First\nAmendment.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority argues that more speech will quickly become \u201cless\n\nspeech,\u201d as candidates switch to public funding.

Ante, at\n10 (quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S.\n724, 736 (2008)); see ante, at 21\u201322. At other times, the\nmajority indicates that the \u201cburden\u201d resides in the deter\nrent effect of the mechanism: The privately funded candi\ndate \u201cmight not spend money\u201d because doing so will trig\nger matching funds. Ante, at 20. Either way, the majority\nis wrong to see a substantial burden on expression.5\n   Most important, and as just suggested, the very notion\nthat additional speech constitutes a \u201cburden\u201d is odd and\nunsettling. Here is a simple fact: Arizona imposes nothing\nremotely resembling a coercive penalty on privately\nfunded candidates. The State does not jail them, fine\nthem, or subject them to any kind of lesser disability. (So\nthe majority\u2019s analogies to a fine on speech, ante, at 19, 28,\nare inapposite.) The only \u201cburden\u201d in this case comes from\nthe grant of a subsidy to another person, and the opportu\nnity that subsidy allows for responsive speech. But that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The majority\u2019s error on this score extends both to candidates and to\n\nindependent expenditure groups. Contrary to the majority\u2019s sugges\ntion, see ante, at 14, n. 6, nearly all of my arguments showing that the\nClean Elections Act does not impose a substantial burden apply to both\nsets of speakers (and apply regardless of whether independent or\ncandidate expenditures trigger the matching funds). That is also true\nof every one of my arguments demonstrating the State\u2019s compelling\ninterest in this legislation. See infra, at 22\u201326. But perhaps the best\nresponse to the majority\u2019s view that the Act inhibits independent\nexpenditure groups lies in an empirical fact already noted: Expendi\ntures by these groups have risen by 253% since Arizona\u2019s law was\nenacted. See n. 2, supra.\n16       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeans the majority cannot get out from under our subsidy\nprecedents. Once again: We have never, not once, under\nstood a viewpoint-neutral subsidy given to one speaker to\nconstitute a First Amendment burden on another. (And\nthat is so even when the subsidy is not open to all, as it is\nhere.) Yet in this case, the majority says that the prospect\nof more speech\u2014responsive speech, competitive speech,\nthe kind of speech that drives public debate\u2014counts as a\nconstitutional injury. That concept, for all the reasons\npreviously given, is \u201cwholly foreign to the First Amend\nment.\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49.\n   But put to one side this most fundamental objection\nto the majority\u2019s argument; even then, has the majority\nshown that the burden resulting from the Arizona statute\nis \u201csubstantial\u201d? See Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581,\n592 (2005) (holding that stringent judicial review is \u201cap\npropriate only if the burden is severe\u201d). I will not quarrel\nwith the majority\u2019s assertion that responsive speech by\none candidate may make another candidate\u2019s speech less\neffective, see ante, at 21\u201322; that, after all, is the whole\nidea of the First Amendment, and a benefit of having more\nresponsive speech. See Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S.\n616, 630 (1919) (Holmes., J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he best test\nof truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in\nthe competition of the market\u201d). And I will assume that\nthe operation of this statute may on occasion deter a pri\nvately funded candidate from spending money, and con\nveying ideas by that means.6 My guess is that this does\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6I will note, however, that the record evidence of this effect is spotty\nat best. The majority finds anecdotal evidence supporting its argument\non just 6 pages of a 4500-page summary judgment record. See ante, at\n18\u201319. (The majority also cites sections of petitioners\u2019 briefs, which cite\nthe same 6 pages in the record. See ante, at 19.) That is consistent\nwith the assessment of the District Court Judge who presided over the\nproceedings in this case: He stated that petitioners had presented only\n\u201cvague\u201d and \u201cscattered\u201d evidence of the law\u2019s deterrent impact.

S. ____ (2011)                       17\n\n                           KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nnot happen often: Most political candidates, I suspect,\nhave enough faith in the power of their ideas to prefer\nspeech on both sides of an issue to speech on neither. But\nI will take on faith that the matching funds provision may\nlead one or another privately funded candidate to stop\nspending at one or another moment in an election. Still,\ndoes that effect count as a severe burden on expression?\nBy the measure of our prior decisions\u2014which have upheld\ncampaign reforms with an equal or greater impact on\nspeech\u2014the answer is no.\n  Number one: Any system of public financing, including\nthe lump-sum model upheld in Buckley, imposes a similar\nburden on privately funded candidates. Suppose Arizona\nwere to do what all parties agree it could under Buckley\u2014\nprovide a single upfront payment (say, $150,000) to a\nparticipating candidate, rather than an initial payment\n(of $50,000) plus 94% of whatever his privately funded\nopponent spent, up to a ceiling (the same $150,000). That\nsystem would \u201cdiminis[h] the effectiveness\u201d of a privately\nfunded candidate\u2019s speech at least as much, and in the\nsame way: It would give his opponent, who presumably\nwould not be able to raise that sum on his own, more\nmoney to spend. And so too, a lump-sum system may\ndeter speech. A person relying on private resources might\nwell choose not to enter a race at all, because he knows he\nwill face an adequately funded opponent. And even if he\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPet. for Cert. in No. 10\u2013239, p. 54. The appellate court discerned even\nless evidence of any deterrent effect. Id., at 30 (\u201cNo Plaintiff . . . has\npointed to any specific instance in which she or he has declined a\ncontribution or failed to make an expenditure for fear of triggering\nmatching funds\u201d); see also id., at 28, 31, 34. I understand the majority\nto essentially concede this point (\u201c \u2018it is never easy to prove a negative,\u2019 \u201d\nante, at 20) and to say it does not matter (\u201cwe do not need empirical\nevidence,\u201d ibid.). So I will not belabor the issue by detailing the sub\nstantial testimony (much more than 6 pages worth) that the matching\nfunds provision has not put a dent in privately funded candidates\u2019\nspending.\n18      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\ndecides to run, he likely will choose to speak in different\nways\u2014for example, by eschewing dubious, easy-to-answer\ncharges\u2014because his opponent has the ability to respond.\nIndeed, privately funded candidates may well find the\nlump-sum system more burdensome than Arizona\u2019s (as\nsuming the lump is big enough). Pretend you are financ\ning your campaign through private donations. Would you\nprefer that your opponent receive a guaranteed, upfront\npayment of $150,000, or that he receive only $50,000, with\nthe possibility\u2014a possibility that you mostly get to con\ntrol\u2014of collecting another $100,000 somewhere down the\nroad? Me too. That\u2019s the first reason the burden on\nspeech cannot command a different result in this case\nthan in Buckley.\n   Number two: Our decisions about disclosure and dis\nclaimer requirements show the Court is wrong. Starting\nin Buckley and continuing through last Term, the Court\nhas repeatedly declined to view these requirements as a sub\nstantial First Amendment burden, even though they dis\ncourage some campaign speech. \u201cIt is undoubtedly true,\u201d\nwe stated in Buckley, that public disclosure obliga-\ntions \u201cwill deter some individuals\u201d from engaging in ex\npressive activity. 424 U. S., at 68; see Davis, 554 U. S., at\n744. Yet we had no difficulty upholding these require\nments there. And much more recently, in Citizens United\nand Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), we followed that\nprecedent. \u201c \u2018Disclosure requirements may burden the\nability to speak,\u201d we reasoned, but they \u201cdo not prevent\nanyone from speaking.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting\nCitizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51)). So too\nhere. Like a disclosure rule, the matching funds provision\nmay occasionally deter, but \u201cimpose[s] no ceiling\u201d on elec\ntoral expression. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 51).\n   The majority breezily dismisses this comparison, label\ning the analogy \u201cnot even close\u201d because disclosure re\nquirements result in no payment of money to a speaker\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nopponent. Ante, at 18. That is indeed the factual distinc\ntion: A matching fund provision, we can all agree, is not a\ndisclosure rule. But the majority does not tell us why this\ndifference matters. Nor could it. The majority strikes\ndown the matching funds provision because of its ostensi\nble effect\u2014most notably, that it may deter a person from\nspending money in an election. But this Court has ac\nknowledged time and again that disclosure obligations\nhave the selfsame effect. If that consequence does not\ntrigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case,\nit should not do so in the other.\n   Number three: Any burden that the Arizona law im\nposes does not exceed the burden associated with contri\nbution limits, which we have also repeatedly upheld. Con\ntribution limits, we have stated, \u201cimpose direct quantity\nrestrictions on political communication and association,\u201d\nBuckley, 424 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added), thus \u201c \u2018signifi\ncant[ly] interfer[ing]\u2019 \u201d with First Amendment interests,\nNixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,\n387 (2000) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25). Rather\nthan potentially deterring or \u201c \u2018diminish[ing] the effective\nness\u2019 \u201d of expressive activity, ante, at 10 (quoting Davis,\n554 U. S., at 736), these limits stop it cold. Yet we have\nnever subjected these restrictions to the most stringent\nreview. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 29\u201338. I doubt I have\nto reiterate that the Arizona statute imposes no restraints\non any expressive activity. So the majority once again has\nno reason here to reach a different result.\n   In this way, our campaign finance cases join our speech\nsubsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of Ari\nzona\u2019s law. Both sets of precedents are in accord that a\nstatute funding electoral speech in the way Arizona\u2019s does\nimposes no First Amendment injury.\n                            C\n  The majority thinks it has one case on its side\u2014Davis v.\n20     ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                 CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                  KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nFederal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. 724\u2014and it pegs\neverything on that decision. See ante, at 9\u201312. But\nDavis relies on principles that fit securely within our\nFirst Amendment law and tradition\u2014most unlike today\u2019s\nopinion.\n   As the majority recounts, Davis addressed the constitu\ntionality of federal legislation known as the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment. Under that provision (which applied in elec\ntions not involving public financing), a candidate\u2019s expen\nditure of more than $350,000 of his own money activated a\nchange in applicable contribution limits. Before, each\ncandidate in the race could accept $2,300 from any donor;\nbut now, the opponent of the self-financing candidate\ncould accept three times that much, or up to $6,900 per\ncontributor. So one candidate\u2019s expenditure of personal\nfunds on campaign speech triggered discriminatory con\ntribution restrictions favoring that candidate\u2019s opponent.\n   Under the First Amendment, the similarity between\nDavis and this case matters far less than the differences.\nHere is the similarity: In both cases, one candidate\u2019s cam\npaign expenditure triggered . . . something. Now here are\nthe differences: In Davis, the candidate\u2019s expenditure\ntriggered a discriminatory speech restriction, which Con\ngress could not otherwise have imposed consistent with\nthe First Amendment; by contrast, in this case, the candi\ndate\u2019s expenditure triggers a non-discriminatory speech\nsubsidy, which all parties agree Arizona could have pro\nvided in the first instance. In First Amendment law, that\ndifference makes a difference\u2014indeed, it makes all the\ndifference. As I have indicated before, two great fault\nlines run through our First Amendment doctrine: one,\nbetween speech restrictions and speech subsidies, and the\nother, between discriminatory and neutral government\naction. See supra, at 10\u201311. The Millionaire\u2019s Amend\nment fell on the disfavored side of both divides: To reiter\nate, it imposed a discriminatory speech restriction. The\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

That decision began,\ncontinued, and ended by focusing on the Millionaire\nAmendment\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory contribution limits.\u201d 554\nU. S., at 740. We made that clear in the very first sen\ntence of the opinion, where we summarized the question\npresented. Id., at 728 (\u201cIn this appeal, we consider the\nconstitutionality of federal election law provisions that . . .\nimpose different campaign contribution limits on candi\ndates\u201d). And our focus on the law\u2019s discriminatory restric\ntions was evident again when we examined how the\nCourt\u2019s prior holdings informed the case. Id., at 738 (\u201cWe\nhave never upheld the constitutionality of a law that\nimposes different contribution limits for candidates\u201d). And\nthen again, when we concluded that the Millionaire\u2019s\nAmendment could not stand. Id., at 740 (explaining that\nthe \u201cthe activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribu\ntion limits\u201d burdens speech). Our decision left no doubt\n(because we repeated the point many times over, see also\nid., at 729, 730, 739, 740, n. 7, 741, 744): The constitu\ntional problem with the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment lay in\nits use of discriminatory speech restrictions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Of course, only publicly funded candidates receive the subsidy. But\n\nthat is because only those candidates have agreed to abide by stringent\nspending caps (which privately funded candidates can exceed by any\namount). And Buckley specifically approved that exchange as consis\ntent with the First Amendment. See 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95. By\ncontrast, Davis involved a scheme in which one candidate in a race\nreceived concrete fundraising advantages, in the form of asymmetrical\ncontribution limits, just because his opponent had spent a certain\namount of his own money.\n22       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\n   But what of the trigger mechanism\u2014in Davis, as here, a\ncandidate\u2019s campaign expenditures? That, after all, is the\nonly thing that this case and Davis share. If Davis had\nheld that the trigger mechanism itself violated the First\nAmendment, then the case would support today\u2019s holding.\nBut Davis said nothing of the kind. It made clear that\nthe trigger mechanism could not rescue the discriminatory\ncontribution limits from constitutional invalidity; that the\nlimits went into effect only after a candidate spent sub\nstantial personal resources rendered them no more per\nmissible under the First Amendment. See id., at 739. But\nDavis did not call into question the trigger mechanism\nitself. Indeed, Davis explained that Congress could have\nused that mechanism to activate a non-discriminatory\n(i.e., across-the-board) increase in contribution limits; in\nthat case, the Court stated, \u201cDavis\u2019 argument would\nplainly fail.\u201d Id., at 737.8 The constitutional infirmity in\nDavis was not the trigger mechanism, but rather what lay\non the other side of it\u2014a discriminatory speech restriction.\n   The Court\u2019s response to these points is difficult to\nfathom. The majority concedes that \u201cour decision in Davis\nfocused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed\nby the Millionaire\u2019s Amendment.\u201d Ante, at 14. That was\nbecause, the majority explains, Davis presented only that\nissue. See ante, at 14. And yet, the majority insists (with\nout explaining how this can be true), the reach of Davis is\nnot so limited. And in any event, the majority claims, the\nburden on speech is \u201cgreater in this case than in Davis.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Notably, the Court found this conclusion obvious even though an\nacross-the-board increase in contribution limits works to the compara\ntive advantage of the non-self-financing candidate\u2014that is, the candi\ndate who actually depends on contributions. Such a system puts the\nself-financing candidate to a choice: Do I stop spending, or do I allow\nthe higher contribution limits (which will help my opponent) to kick in?\nThat strategic choice parallels the one that the Arizona statute forces.\nSee supra, at 15.\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   23\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 14. But for reasons already stated, that is not\nso. The burden on speech in Davis\u2014the penalty that cam\npaign spending triggered\u2014was the discriminatory contri\nbution restriction, which Congress could not otherwise\nhave imposed. By contrast, the thing triggered here is a\nnon-discriminatory subsidy, of a kind this Court has ap\nproved for almost four decades. Maybe the majority is\nsaying today that it had something like this case in mind\nall the time. But nothing in the logic of Davis controls this\ndecision.9\n                             III\n  For all these reasons, the Court errs in holding that the\ngovernment action in this case substantially burdens\nspeech and so requires the State to offer a compelling in\nterest. But in any event, Arizona has come forward with\njust such an interest, explaining that the Clean Elections\nAct attacks corruption and the appearance of corruption in\nthe State\u2019s political system. The majority\u2019s denigration of\nthis interest\u2014the suggestion that it either is not real or\ndoes not matter\u2014wrongly prevents Arizona from protect\ning the strength and integrity of its democracy.\n                           A\n  Our campaign finance precedents leave no doubt: Pre\nventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority also briefly relies on Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.\n\nTornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974), but that case is still wider of the mark.\nThere, we invalidated a law compelling newspapers (by threat of\ncriminal sanction) to print a candidate\u2019s rejoinder to critical commen\ntary. That law, we explained, overrode the newspaper\u2019s own editorial\njudgment and forced the paper both to pay for and to convey a message\nwith which it disagreed. See id., at 256\u2013258. An analogy might be if\nArizona forced privately funded candidates to purchase their opponents\u2019\nposters, and then to display those posters in their own campaign offices.\nBut that is very far from this case. The Arizona statute does not\nrequire petitioners to disseminate or fund any opposing speech; nor\ndoes it in any way associate petitioners with that speech.\n24      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM\n                  CLUB PAC v.

S., at 91; see id., at 96. When private contributions\nfuel the political system, candidates may make corrupt\nbargains to gain the money needed to win election. See\nNCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. And voters, seeing the depend\nence of candidates on large contributors (or on bundlers of\nsmaller contributions), may lose faith that their represen\ntatives will serve the public\u2019s interest. See Shrink Mis\nsouri, 528 U. S., at 390 (the \u201cassumption that large donors\ncall the tune [may] jeopardize the willingness of voters to\ntake part in democratic governance\u201d). Public financing\naddresses these dangers by minimizing the importance of\nprivate donors in elections. Even the majority appears to\nagree with this premise. See ante, at 27 (\u201cWe have said\nthat . . . \u2018public financing as a means of eliminating the\nimproper influence of large private contributions furthers\na significant governmental interest\u2019 \u201d).\n   This compelling interest appears on the very face of\nArizona\u2019s public financing statute.

As Arizona and other jurisdictions\nhave discovered, contribution limits may not eliminate the risk of\ncorrupt dealing between candidates and donors, especially given the\nwidespread practice of bundling small contributions into large pack\nages. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31. For much this\nreason, Buckley upheld both limits on contributions to federal candi\ndates and public financing of presidential campaigns. See 424 U. S., at\n23\u201338, 90\u2013108. Arizona, like Congress, was \u201csurely entitled to con\nclude\u201d that contribution limits were only a \u201cpartial measure,\u201d id., at 28,\nand that a functional public financing system was also necessary to\neliminate political corruption. In stating otherwise, the Court substi\ntutes its judgment for that of Arizona\u2019s voters, contrary to our practice\nof declining to \u201csecond-guess a . . . determination as to the need for\nprophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared.\u201d Federal\nElection Comm\u2019n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 210\n(1982).\n26       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nat issue because it is a critical facet of Arizona\u2019s public\nfinancing program. The provision is no more than a dis\nbursement mechanism; but it is also the thing that makes\nthe whole Clean Elections Act work. As described earlier,\nsee supra, at 5\u20136, public financing has an Achilles heel\u2014\nthe difficulty of setting the subsidy at the right amount.\nToo small, and the grant will not attract candidates to the\nprogram; and with no participating candidates, the pro\ngram can hardly decrease corruption. Too large, and the\nsystem becomes unsustainable, or at the least an unneces\nsary drain on public resources. But finding the sweet-spot\nis near impossible because of variation, across districts\nand over time, in the political system. Enter the matching\nfunds provision, which takes an ordinary lump-sum\namount, divides it into thirds, and disburses the last two\nof these (to the extent necessary) via a self-calibrating\nmechanism. That provision is just a fine-tuning of the\nlump-sum program approved in Buckley\u2014a fine-tuning, it\nbears repeating, that prevents no one from speaking and\ndiscriminates against no message. But that fine-tuning\ncan make the difference between a wholly ineffectual\nprogram and one that removes corruption from the politi\ncal system.12 If public financing furthers a compelling\ninterest\u2014and according to this Court, it does\u2014then so too\ndoes the disbursement formula that Arizona uses to make\npublic financing effective. The one conclusion follows\ndirectly from the other.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 For this reason, the majority is quite wrong to say that the State\u2019s\n\ninterest in combating corruption does not support the matching fund\nprovision\u2019s application to a candidate\u2019s expenditure of his own money or\nto an independent expenditure. Ante, at 25\u201326. The point is not that\nthese expenditures themselves corrupt the political process. Rather,\nArizona includes these, as well as all other, expenditures in the pro\ngram to ensure that participating candidates receive the funds neces\nsary to run competitive races\u2014and so to attract those candidates in the\nfirst instance. That is in direct service of the State\u2019s anti-corruption\ninterest.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           27\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Except in this Court, where the inescapable logic of the\nState\u2019s position is . . . virtually ignored. The Court, to be\nsure, repeatedly asserts that the State\u2019s interest in pre\nventing corruption does not \u201csufficiently justif[y]\u201d the\nmechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys. Ante,\nat 28; see ante, at 27. Only one thing is missing from the\nCourt\u2019s response: any reasoning to support this conclusion.\nNowhere does the majority dispute the State\u2019s view that\nthe success of its public financing system depends on the\nmatching funds mechanism; and nowhere does the major\nity contest that, if this mechanism indeed spells the differ\nence between success and failure, the State\u2019s interest in\npreventing corruption justifies its use. And so the major\nity dismisses, but does not actually answer the State\u2019s\ncontention\u2014even though that contention is the linchpin of\nthe entire case. Assuming (against reason and precedent)\nthat the matching funds provision substantially burdens\nspeech, the question becomes whether the State has of\nfered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.\nArizona has made a forceful argument on this score,\nbased on the need to establish an effective public fi\nnancing system. The majority does not even engage that\nreasoning.\n                               B\n  The majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying\nto show that \u201clevel[ing] the playing field,\u201d not fighting\ncorruption, was the State\u2019s real goal. Ante, at 22\u201323 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 22\u201324. But\nthe majority\u2019s distaste for \u201cleveling\u201d provides no excuse for\nstriking down Arizona\u2019s law.\n                            1\n  For starters, the Court has no basis to question the\nsincerity of the State\u2019s interest in rooting out political\ncorruption. As I have just explained, that is the interest\n28      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nthe State has asserted in this Court; it is the interest\npredominantly expressed in the \u201cfindings and declara\ntions\u201d section of the statute; and it is the interest univer\nsally understood (stretching back to Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s\ntime) to support public financing of elections. See supra,\nat 4, 23\u201324. As against all this, the majority claims to\nhave found three smoking guns that reveal the State\u2019s\ntrue (and nefarious) intention to level the playing field.\nBut the only smoke here is the majority\u2019s, and it is the\nkind that goes with mirrors.\n   The majority first observes that the matching funds\nprovision is titled \u201c \u2018Equal funding of candidates\u2019 \u201d and that\nit refers to matching grants as \u201c \u2018equalizing funds.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 23 (quoting \u00a716\u2013952). Well, yes. The statute provides\nfor matching funds (above and below certain thresholds); a\nsynonym for \u201cmatch\u201d is \u201cequal\u201d; and so the statute uses\nthat term. In sum, the statute describes what the statute\ndoes. But the relevant question here (according to the\nmajority\u2019s own analysis) is why the statute does that\nthing\u2014otherwise said, what interest the statute serves.\nThe State explains that its goal is to prevent corruption,\nand nothing in the Act\u2019s descriptive terms suggests any\nother objective.\n   Next, the majority notes that the Act allows participat\ning candidates to accept private contributions if (but only\nif) the State cannot provide the funds it has promised (for\nexample, because of a budget crisis). Ante, at 23 (citing\n\u00a716\u2013954(F)). That provision, the majority argues, shows\nthat when push comes to shove, the State cares more\nabout \u201cleveling\u201d than about fighting corruption. Ante, at\n23. But this is a plain misreading of the law. All the\nstatute does is assure participating candidates that they\nwill not be left in the lurch if public funds suddenly be\ncome unavailable. That guarantee helps persuade candi\ndates to enter the program by removing the risk of a state\ndefault. And so the provision directly advances the Act\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           29\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ngoal of combating corruption.\n   Finally, the Court remarks in a footnote that the Clean\nElections Commission\u2019s website once stated that the \u201c \u2018Act\nwas passed by the people of Arizona . . . to level the play\ning field.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 24, n. 10. I can understand why\nthe majority does not place much emphasis on this point.\nSome members of the majority have ridiculed the practice\nof relying on subsequent statements by legislators to\ndemonstrate an earlier Congress\u2019s intent in enacting a\nstatute. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617,\n631\u2013632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part); United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 434\u2013435 (2009) (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting). Yet here the majority makes a much\nstranger claim: that a statement appearing on a govern\nment website in 2011 (written by who-knows-whom?)\nreveals what hundreds of thousands of Arizona\u2019s voters\nsought to do in 1998 when they enacted the Clean Elec\ntions Act by referendum. Just to state that proposition is\nto know it is wrong.\n   So the majority has no evidence\u2014zero, none\u2014that the\nobjective of the Act is anything other than the interest\nthat the State asserts, the Act proclaims, and the history\nof public financing supports: fighting corruption.\n                              2\n   But suppose the majority had come up with some evi\ndence showing that Arizona had sought to \u201cequalize elec\ntoral opportunities.\u201d Ante, at 24. Would that discovery\nmatter? Our precedent says no, so long as Arizona had a\ncompelling interest in eliminating political corruption\n(which it clearly did). In these circumstances, any interest\nof the State in \u201cleveling\u201d should be irrelevant. That inter\nest could not support Arizona\u2019s law (assuming the law\nburdened speech), but neither would the interest invali\ndate the legislation.\n   To see the point, consider how the matter might arise.\n30       ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                   CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nAssume a State has two reasons to pass a statute affecting\nspeech. It wants to reduce corruption. But in addition,\nit wishes to \u201clevel the playing field.\u201d Under our First\nAmendment law, the interest in preventing corruption is\ncompelling and may justify restraints on speech. But the\ninterest in \u201cleveling the playing field,\u201d according to well\nestablished precedent, cannot support such legislation.13\nSo would this statute (assuming it met all other constitu\ntional standards) violate the First Amendment?\n   The answer must be no. This Court, after all, has never\nsaid that a law restricting speech (or any other constitu\ntional right) demands two compelling interests. One is\nenough. And this statute has one: preventing corruption.\nSo it does not matter that equalizing campaign speech is\nan insufficient interest. The statute could violate the First\nAmendment only if \u201cequalizing\u201d qualified as a forbidden\nmotive\u2014a motive that itself could annul an otherwise\nconstitutional law. But we have never held that to be so.\nAnd that should not be surprising: It is a \u201cfundamental\nprinciple of constitutional adjudication,\u201d from which we\nhave deviated only in exceptional cases, \u201cthat this Court\nwill not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on\nthe basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.\u201d United\nStates v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 383 (1968); see id., at 384\n(declining to invalidate a statute when \u201cCongress had the\nundoubted power to enact\u201d it without the suspect motive);\naccord, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 I note that this principle relates only to actions restricting speech.\n\nSee Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48\u201349 (rejecting the notion \u201cthat government\nmay restrict the speech of some . . . to enhance the relative voice of\nothers\u201d). As previously explained, speech subsidies stand on a different\nconstitutional footing, see supra, at 10\u201311; so long as the government\nremains neutral among viewpoints, it may choose to assist the speech\nof persons who might not otherwise be heard. But here I am assuming\nfor the sake of argument that the Clean Elections Act imposes the kind\nof restraint on expression requiring that the State show a compelling\ninterest.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)          31\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 622, 652 (1994); Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,\n475 U. S. 41, 47\u201348 (1986). When a law is otherwise\nconstitutional\u2014when it either does not restrict speech or\nrests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restric\ntion\u2014that is the end of the story.\n   That proposition disposes of this case, even if Arizona\nhad an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral oppor\ntunities. No special rule of automatic invalidation applies\nto statutes having some connection to equality; like any\nother laws, they pass muster when supported by an im\nportant enough government interest. Here, Arizona has\ndemonstrated in detail how the matching funds provision\nis necessary to serve a compelling interest in combating\ncorruption. So the hunt for evidence of \u201cleveling\u201d is a\nwaste of time; Arizona\u2019s law survives constitutional scru\ntiny no matter what that search would uncover.\n                             IV\n  This case arose because Arizonans wanted their gov\nernment to work on behalf of all the State\u2019s people. On\nthe heels of a political scandal involving the near-routine\npurchase of legislators\u2019 votes, Arizonans passed a law de\nsigned to sever political candidates\u2019 dependence on large\ncontributors. They wished, as many of their fellow Ameri\ncans wish, to stop corrupt dealing\u2014to ensure that their\nrepresentatives serve the public, and not just the wealthy\ndonors who helped put them in office. The legislation that\nArizona\u2019s voters enacted was the product of deep thought\nand care. It put into effect a public financing system\nthat attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustain\nable cost to the State\u2019s taxpayers. The system discrimi\nnated against no ideas and prevented no speech. Indeed,\nby increasing electoral competition and enabling a wide\nrange of candidates to express their views, the system\n\u201cfurther[ed] . . . First Amendment values.\u201d Buckley, 424\nU. S., at 93 (citing New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270).\n32      ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB\u2019S FREEDOM \n\n                  CLUB PAC v. BENNETT\n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nLess corruption, more speech. Robust campaigns leading\nto the election of representatives not beholden to the few,\nbut accountable to the many. The people of Arizona might\nhave expected a decent respect for those objectives.\n    Today, they do not get it. The Court invalidates Arizo\nnans\u2019 efforts to ensure that in their State, \u201c \u2018[t]he people\n. . . possess the absolute sovereignty.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 274 (quoting\nJames Madison in 4 Elliot\u2019s Debates on the Federal Con\nstitution 569\u2013570 (1876)). No precedent compels the\nCourt to take this step; to the contrary, today\u2019s decision is\nin tension with broad swaths of our First Amendment\ndoctrine. No fundamental principle of our Constitution\nbacks the Court\u2019s ruling; to the contrary, it is the law\nstruck down today that fostered both the vigorous compe\ntition of ideas and its ultimate object\u2014a government\nresponsive to the will of the people. Arizonans deserve\nbetter. Like citizens across this country, Arizonans de\nserve a government that represents and serves them all.\nAnd no less, Arizonans deserve the chance to reform their\nelectoral system so as to attain that most American of\ngoals.\n    Truly, democracy is not a game.
