United States, ante, at 2\u20134, 7\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), are crimes of violence under the\nresidual provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA). See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). They are:\n    \u2022\t Derby v. United States, No. 10\u20138373. Relying on its\n       decision in United States v. Mayer, 560 F. 3d 948\n       (2009), the Ninth Circuit held that Oregon\u2019s first\n       degree burglary statute, Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7164.225\n       (2009), falls within ACCA\u2019s residual provision. In\n       Mayer, the Ninth Circuit conceded that Oregon\u2019s\n       statute does not qualify as the enumerated offense\n       of generic \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA because it ap\n       plies to unlawful entries into \u201cbooths, vehicles,\n       boats, and aircraft,\u201d 560 F. 3d, at 959, and not\n       just buildings and structures. See Taylor v. United\n       States, 495 U. S. 575, 598 (1990). Nevertheless, it\n       held that Oregon\u2019s statute falls within the residual\n       provision, because burglaries under that statute\n       lead to a \u201crisk of a physical confrontation.\u201d 560\n       F. 3d, at 962; but see id., at 952 (Kozinski, C.

In response to\n   the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute punishes\n   activities such as \u201c \u2018inciting or participating in a\n   hunger strike\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018refusal to work at a prison\n   job,\u2019 \u201d the court reasoned that even \u201chypothetical\n   acts of \u2018passive disobedience\u2019 . . . involve deliberate\n   and purposeful conduct.\u201d 616 F. 3d 85, 90 (2010).\n   It also held that such activities were risky because\n   \u201cprisons are like powder kegs, where even the slight\n   est disturbance can have explosive consequences.\u201d\n   Id., at 94.\n\u2022\t Schmidt v. United States, No. 10\u20138768. The Fifth\n   Circuit held that the federal offense of theft of a\n   firearm from a licensed dealer, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(u),\n   falls within ACCA\u2019s residual provision. It held that\n   this offense is \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d because it in\n   volves \u201cstealing from a person who probably either\n   possesses or has easy access to firearms,\u201d and be\n   cause \u201cstolen firearms are more likely to be used\n   in connection with illegal and inherently harmful\n   activities than are lawfully possessed guns.\u201d 623\n   F. 3d 257, 264 (CA5 2010).\n\u2022\t Turner v. United States, No. 10\u20138885. Relying on\n   its decision in United States v. Jarmon, 596 F. 3d\n   228 (2010), the Fourth Circuit held that ACCA\u2019s\n   residual provision covers the Virginia offense of\n   larceny from the person, Va. Code Ann. \u00a718.2\u201395(i)\n   (Lexis 2009), defined as theft of over $5 in money or\n   goods from another person\u2014in other words, pick\n   pocketing. In Jarmon, the court justified its appar\n   ent view that Oliver Twist was a violent felon by\n   noting that larceny \u201crequires the offender to make\n   purposeful, aggressive moves to part the victim\n   from his or her property, creating a . . . risk of vio\n4                 DERBY v.

Certainly our most recent decision\ninterpreting ACCA\u2019s residual clause, Sykes v. United\nStates, ante, p. 1, would be of no help. The \u201crule\u201d we an\nnounced there, as far as I can tell, is as follows: A court\nmust compare the degree of risk of the crime in question\nwith the degree of risk of ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses\n(burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives) as a \u201cbeginning point,\u201d ante, at 6\u20137; look at\nthe statistical record, which is not \u201cdispositive\u201d but some\ntimes confirms \u201ccommonsense conclusion[s],\u201d ante, at 8; and\ncheck whether the crime is \u201cpurposeful, violent, and ag\ngressive,\u201d unless of course the crime is among the unspeci\nfied \u201cmany cases\u201d in which that test is \u201credundant with\nthe inquiry into risk,\u201d ante, at 11. And of course given our\ntrack record of adding a new animal to our bestiary of\nACCA residual-clause standards in each of the four suc\ncessive cases we have thus far decided, see ante, at 2\u20134\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), who knows what new beasties our\nfifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth tries would produce?\nSurely a perfectly fair wager.\n   If it is uncertain how this Court will apply Sykes and the\nrest of our ACCA cases going forward, it is even more\nuncertain how our lower-court colleagues will deal with\nthem. Conceivably, they will simply throw the opinions\ninto the air in frustration, and give free rein to their own\nfeelings as to what offenses should be considered crimes\nof violence\u2014which, to tell the truth, seems to be what we\nhave done. (Before throwing the opinions into the air, how\never, they should check whether littering\u2014or littering\nin a purposeful, violent, and aggressive fashion\u2014is a fel\nony in their jurisdiction. If so, it may be a violent felony\nunder ACCA; or perhaps not.)\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
