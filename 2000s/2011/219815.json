United States, ante, at 2–4, 7\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), are crimes of violence under the\nresidual provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA). See 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). They are:\n    •\t Derby v. United States, No. 10–8373. Relying on its\n       decision in United States v. Mayer, 560 F. 3d 948\n       (2009), the Ninth Circuit held that Oregon’s first\n       degree burglary statute, Ore. Rev. Stat. §164.225\n       (2009), falls within ACCA’s residual provision. In\n       Mayer, the Ninth Circuit conceded that Oregon’s\n       statute does not qualify as the enumerated offense\n       of generic “burglary” under ACCA because it ap\n       plies to unlawful entries into “booths, vehicles,\n       boats, and aircraft,” 560 F. 3d, at 959, and not\n       just buildings and structures. See Taylor v. United\n       States, 495 U. S. 575, 598 (1990). Nevertheless, it\n       held that Oregon’s statute falls within the residual\n       provision, because burglaries under that statute\n       lead to a “risk of a physical confrontation.” 560\n       F. 3d, at 962; but see id., at 952 (Kozinski, C. J.,\n       dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (not\n       ing that “Oregon prosecutes as burglars people who\n       pose no risk of injury to anyone,” such as an indi\n       vidual who “enter[ed] public telephone booths to\n       steal change from coin boxes”).\n    •\t Johnson v. United States, No. 10–8607. The Sec\n       ond Circuit, over a dissent, held that the Connecti\n       cut offense of “rioting at a correctional institution,”\n       Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–179b(a) (2011), which pun\n       ishes a defendant who “incites, instigates, orga\n       nizes, connives at, causes, aids, abets, assists or\n       takes part in any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot\n              Cite as: 564 U.

In response to\n   the defendant’s argument that the statute punishes\n   activities such as “ ‘inciting or participating in a\n   hunger strike’ ” or “ ‘refusal to work at a prison\n   job,’ ” the court reasoned that even “hypothetical\n   acts of ‘passive disobedience’ . . . involve deliberate\n   and purposeful conduct.” 616 F. 3d 85, 90 (2010).\n   It also held that such activities were risky because\n   “prisons are like powder kegs, where even the slight\n   est disturbance can have explosive consequences.”\n   Id., at 94.\n•\t Schmidt v. United States, No. 10–8768. The Fifth\n   Circuit held that the federal offense of theft of a\n   firearm from a licensed dealer, 18 U. S. C. §922(u),\n   falls within ACCA’s residual provision. It held that\n   this offense is “inherently dangerous” because it in\n   volves “stealing from a person who probably either\n   possesses or has easy access to firearms,” and be\n   cause “stolen firearms are more likely to be used\n   in connection with illegal and inherently harmful\n   activities than are lawfully possessed guns.” 623\n   F. 3d 257, 264 (CA5 2010).\n•\t Turner v. United States, No. 10–8885. Relying on\n   its decision in United States v. Jarmon, 596 F. 3d\n   228 (2010), the Fourth Circuit held that ACCA’s\n   residual provision covers the Virginia offense of\n   larceny from the person, Va. Code Ann. §18.2–95(i)\n   (Lexis 2009), defined as theft of over $5 in money or\n   goods from another person—in other words, pick\n   pocketing. In Jarmon, the court justified its appar\n   ent view that Oliver Twist was a violent felon by\n   noting that larceny “requires the offender to make\n   purposeful, aggressive moves to part the victim\n   from his or her property, creating a . . . risk of vio\n4                 DERBY v.

Certainly our most recent decision\ninterpreting ACCA’s residual clause, Sykes v. United\nStates, ante, p. 1, would be of no help. The “rule” we an\nnounced there, as far as I can tell, is as follows: A court\nmust compare the degree of risk of the crime in question\nwith the degree of risk of ACCA’s enumerated offenses\n(burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of\nexplosives) as a “beginning point,” ante, at 6–7; look at\nthe statistical record, which is not “dispositive” but some\ntimes confirms “commonsense conclusion[s],” ante, at 8; and\ncheck whether the crime is “purposeful, violent, and ag\ngressive,” unless of course the crime is among the unspeci\nfied “many cases” in which that test is “redundant with\nthe inquiry into risk,” ante, at 11. And of course given our\ntrack record of adding a new animal to our bestiary of\nACCA residual-clause standards in each of the four suc\ncessive cases we have thus far decided, see ante, at 2–4\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), who knows what new beasties our\nfifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth tries would produce?\nSurely a perfectly fair wager.\n   If it is uncertain how this Court will apply Sykes and the\nrest of our ACCA cases going forward, it is even more\nuncertain how our lower-court colleagues will deal with\nthem. Conceivably, they will simply throw the opinions\ninto the air in frustration, and give free rein to their own\nfeelings as to what offenses should be considered crimes\nof violence—which, to tell the truth, seems to be what we\nhave done. (Before throwing the opinions into the air, how\never, they should check whether littering—or littering\nin a purposeful, violent, and aggressive fashion—is a fel\nony in their jurisdiction. If so, it may be a violent felony\nunder ACCA; or perhaps not.)\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
