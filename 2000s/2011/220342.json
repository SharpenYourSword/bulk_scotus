NICASTRO, \n\n                 INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATOR OF\n\n                      THE ESTATE OF NICASTRO\n\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\n\n    No. 09\u20131343. Argued January 11, 2011\u2014Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing\n  machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre),\n  manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and\n  operates. Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in\n  New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to\n  dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction. Nicastro\u2019s jurisdic\n  tional claim was based on three primary facts: A U. S. distributor\n  agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s machines in this country; J. McIntyre of\n  ficials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jer\n  sey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests\n  only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey. The\n  State Supreme Court held that New Jersey\u2019s courts can exercise ju\n  risdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the\n  Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause so long as the manu\n  facturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are\n  distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead\n  to sales in any of the States. Invoking this \u201cstream-of-commerce\u201d\n  doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Indus\n  try Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Apply\n  ing its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to juris\n  diction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in,\n  sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n201 N. J. 48, 987 A. 2d 575, reversed.\n    JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA,\n  and JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that because J. McIntyre never en\n2           J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    gaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to in\n    voke or benefit from the protection of the State\u2019s laws, New Jersey is\n    without power to adjudge the company\u2019s rights and liabilities, and its\n    exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (a) Due process protects the defendant\u2019s right not to be coerced ex\n    cept by lawful judicial power. A court may subject a defendant to\n    judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the\n    sovereign \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tra\n    ditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d International\n    Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316. Freeform fundamental\n    fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a\n    judgment rendered without authority into law. As a general rule, the\n    sovereign\u2019s exercise of power requires some act by which the defen\n    dant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activi\n    ties within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protec\n    tions of its laws.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253. In cases\n    like this one, it is the defendant\u2019s purposeful availment that makes\n    jurisdiction consistent with \u201cfair play and substantial justice\u201d no\n    tions. No \u201cstream-of-commerce\u201d doctrine can displace that general\n    rule for products-liability cases.\n       The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an\n    absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left\n    open in Asahi. The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,\n    results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and\n    the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d That concept, like other metaphors, has\n    its deficiencies as well as its utilities. It refers to the movement of\n    goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet be\n    yond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact. A defen\n    dant\u2019s placement of goods into commerce \u201cwith the expectation that\n    they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State\u201d may\n    indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.\n    Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298. But that does not amend the general\n    rule of personal jurisdiction. The principal inquiry in cases of this\n    sort is whether the defendant\u2019s activities manifest an intention to\n    submit to the power of a sovereign. See, e.g., Hanson, supra, at 253.\n    In Asahi, Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence (joined by three other Jus\n    tices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of\n    fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the de\n    fendant\u2019s ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.\n    480 U. S., at 117. However, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s lead opinion (also for\n    four Justices) stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between the\n    defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum\n    contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully\n    directed toward the forum State.\u201d Id., at 112. Since Asahi, the courts\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhave sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Bren\nnan\u2019s rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is\ninconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this\nCourt\u2019s precedents. Today\u2019s conclusion that the authority to subject a\ndefendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent\nwith Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s Asahi opinion. Pp. 4\u201310.\n   (b) Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in con\nduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. The company had no office\nin New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it\nneither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. Indeed,\nthe trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with\nthe State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up\nthere. Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered\nhis jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed\nitself of the New Jersey market. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE ALITO, agreed that the New Jer\nsey Supreme Court\u2019s judgment must be reversed, but concluded that\nbecause this case does not present issues arising from recent changes\nin commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of\nbroad applicability without fully considering modern-day conse\nquences. Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the\nCourt\u2019s precedents. Pp. 2\u20137.\n   (a) Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his\nburden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise\njurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British\nManufacturer). The three primary facts the state high court relied\non do not satisfy due process. None of the Court\u2019s precedents finds\nthat a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales\neffort indicated here, is sufficient. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\nv. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286; Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior\nCourt of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Here, the relevant facts\nshow no \u201cregular . . . flow\u201d or \u201cregular course\u201d of sales in New Jersey,\nid., at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment); id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment); and there is no \u201csomething more,\u201d such as special state\nrelated design, advertising, advice, or marketing, id., at 111, 112\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of juris\ndiction. Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manu\nfacturer to sell in New Jersey. And he has not otherwise shown that\nthe British Manufacturer \u201c \u2018purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privi\nlege of conducting activities\u2019 \u201d within New Jersey, or that it delivered\nits goods in the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that they\nwill be purchased\u201d by New Jersey users.

NICASTRO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n      (b) JUSTICE BREYER would not go further. Because the incident at\n    issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual re\n    cord leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for\n    making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional\n    rules. At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in\n    the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court sug\n    gests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary\n    commercial circumstances. Insofar as such considerations are rele\n    vant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case\n    (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.\n    Pp. 4\u20137.\n\n   KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an\nopinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

The rules and stan\ndards for determining when a State does or does not have\njurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear be\ncause of decades-old questions left open in Asahi Metal\nIndustry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480\nU. S. 102 (1987).\n    Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part\non Asahi, held that New Jersey\u2019s courts can exercise juris\ndiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as\nthe manufacturer \u201cknows or reasonably should know that\nits products are distributed through a nationwide distribu\n2        J.

McIntyre Machinery\nAmerica, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A. 2d 575, 591, 592\n(2010). Applying that test, the court concluded that a\nBritish manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject\nto jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had\nit advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense\ntargeted the State.\n   That decision cannot be sustained. Although the New\nJersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with care\nful attention to this Court\u2019s cases and to its own pre\ncedent, the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d metaphor carried the\ndecision far afield. Due process protects the defendant\u2019s\nright not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power. As\na general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful\nunless the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the\nprivilege of conducting activities within the forum State,\nthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253 (1958). There may\nbe exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an\nintentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this\nproducts-liability case, and the so-called \u201cstream-of\ncommerce\u201d doctrine cannot displace it.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a products-liability suit filed in\nNew Jersey state court. Robert Nicastro seriously injured\nhis hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufac\ntured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The\naccident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was\nmanufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorpo\nrated and operates. The question here is whether the New\nJersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwith\nstanding the fact that the company at no time either\nmarketed goods in the State or shipped them there. Ni\ncastro was a plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court and is\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthe respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is\nnow the petitioner.\n   At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro\u2019s counsel\nstressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey\u2019s as\nsertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29\u201330.\n   First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIn\ntyre\u2019s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself\ndid not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond\nthe U. S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the\ndistributor was under J. McIntyre\u2019s control.\n   Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conven\ntions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. Mc-\nIntyre\u2019s machines alongside the distributor. The conven\ntions took place in various States, but never in New\nJersey.\n   Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests\nonly one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the\nmachine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this\nsuit, ended up in New Jersey.\n   In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held\nboth United States and European patents on its recycling\ntechnology. 201 N. J., at 55, 987 A. 2d, at 579. It also\nnoted that the U. S. distributor \u201cstructured [its] adver\ntising and sales efforts in accordance with\u201d J. McIntyre\u2019s\n\u201cdirection and guidance whenever possible,\u201d and that \u201cat\nleast some of the machines were sold on consignment to\u201d\nthe distributor. Id., at 55, 56, 987 A. 2d, at 579 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nconcluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdic\ntion over petitioner without contravention of the Due\nProcess Clause. Jurisdiction was proper, in that court\u2019s\nview, because the injury occurred in New Jersey; because\npetitioner knew or reasonably should have known \u201cthat its\n4        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nproducts are distributed through a nationwide distribution\nsystem that might lead to those products being sold in any\nof the fifty states\u201d; and because petitioner failed to \u201ctake\nsome reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its prod\nucts in this State.\u201d Id., at 77, 987 A. 2d, at 592.\n   Both the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s holding and its\naccount of what it called \u201c[t]he stream-of-commerce doc\ntrine of jurisdiction,\u201d id., at 80, 987 A. 2d, at 594, were\nincorrect, however. This Court\u2019s Asahi decision may be\nresponsible in part for that court\u2019s error regarding the\nstream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity\nto provide greater clarity.\n                               II\n  The Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s right to\nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise\nof lawful power. Cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S.\n399, 403 (1966) (The Clause \u201cprotect[s] a person against\nhaving the Government impose burdens upon him except\nin accordance with the valid laws of the land\u201d). This is no\nless true with respect to the power of a sovereign to re\nsolve disputes through judicial process than with respect\nto the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for\nthose within its sphere. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Bet\nter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (\u201cJurisdiction is\npower to declare the law\u201d). As a general rule, neither\nstatute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the\nState. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of\nMarin, 495 U. S. 604, 608\u2013609 (1990) (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.) (invoking \u201cthe phrase coram non judice, \u2018before a per\nson not a judge\u2019\u2014meaning, in effect, that the proceeding\nin question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful\njudicial authority was not present, and could therefore not\nyield a judgment\u201d)\n  A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when\nthe defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n\u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend\n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d\nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316\n(1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463\n(1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness di\nvorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judg\nment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a\ngeneral rule, the sovereign\u2019s exercise of power requires\nsome act by which the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself\nof the privilege of conducting activities within the forum\nState, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its\nlaws,\u201d Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253, though in some cases, as\nwith an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall\nwithin the State\u2019s authority by reason of his attempt to\nobstruct its laws. In products-liability cases like this one,\nit is the defendant\u2019s purposeful availment that makes\njurisdiction consistent with \u201ctraditional notions of fair play\nand substantial justice.\u201d\n   A person may submit to a State\u2019s authority in a number\nof ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. E.g., In\nsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\nGuinee, 456 U. S. 694, 703 (1982). Presence within a State\nat the time suit commences through service of process is\nanother example. See Burnham, supra. Citizenship or\ndomicile\u2014or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place\nof business for corporations\u2014also indicates general sub\nmission to a State\u2019s powers. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Op\nerations, S. A. v. Brown, post, p. __. Each of these exam\nples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from\nwhich it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and\nthus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State.\nCf. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476\n(1985). These examples support exercise of the general\njurisdiction of the State\u2019s courts and allow the State to\nresolve both matters that originate within the State and\nthose based on activities and events elsewhere. Helicop\n6        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,\n414, and n. 9 (1984). By contrast, those who live or oper\nate primarily outside a State have a due process right not\nto be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general\nmatter.\n   There is also a more limited form of submission to a\nState\u2019s authority for disputes that \u201carise out of or are con\nnected with the activities within the state.\u201d International\nShoe Co., supra, at 319. Where a defendant \u201cpurposefully\navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within\nthe forum State, thus invoking the benefits and\nprotections of its laws,\u201d Hanson, supra, at 253, it submits\nto the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to\nthe extent that power is exercised in connection with the\ndefendant\u2019s activities touching on the State. In other\nwords, submission through contact with and activity\ndirected at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction \u201cin\na suit arising out of or related to the defendant\u2019s contacts\nwith the forum.\u201d Helicopteros, supra, at 414, n. 8; see also\nGoodyear, post, at 2.\n   The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,\nresults from its statement of the relation between jurisdic\ntion and the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d The stream of com\nmerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as\nits utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manu\nfacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond\nthat descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.\nThis Court has stated that a defendant\u2019s placing goods\ninto the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that\nthey will be purchased by consumers within the forum\nState\u201d may indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide\nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298 (1980)\n(finding that expectation lacking). But that statement\ndoes not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.\nIt merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate\ncase be subject to jurisdiction without entering the\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Id., at 295. The principal inquiry in cases of\nthis sort is whether the defendant\u2019s activities manifest\nan intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In\nother words, the defendant must \u201cpurposefully avai[l] it\nself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\nforum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of\nits laws.\u201d Hanson, supra, at 253; Insurance Corp., supra,\nat 704\u2013705 (\u201c[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a\nlegal submission to the jurisdiction of the court\u201d). Some\ntimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than\nits agents. The defendant\u2019s transmission of goods permits\nthe exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can\nbe said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is\nnot enough that the defendant might have predicted that\nits goods will reach the forum State.\n   In Asahi, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Jus\ntices outlined a different approach. It discarded the cen\ntral concept of sovereign authority in favor of considera\ntions of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence\ncontended, \u201cjurisdiction premised on the placement of a\nproduct into the stream of commerce [without more] is\nconsistent with the Due Process Clause,\u201d for \u201c[a]s long as a\nparticipant in this process is aware that the final product\nis being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a\nlawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.\u201d 480 U. S., at\n117 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). It was the premise of the concurring opinion that\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to anticipate suit renders the asser\ntion of jurisdiction fair. In this way, the opinion made\nforeseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.\n   The standard set forth in Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence\nwas rejected in an opinion written by Justice O\u2019Connor;\nbut the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the\nassent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court.\n8        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThat opinion stated: \u201cThe \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between\nthe defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding\nof minimum contacts must come about by an action of the\ndefendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\nThe placement of a product into the stream of commerce,\nwithout more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully\ndirected toward the forum State.\u201d Id., at 112 (emphasis\ndeleted; citations omitted).\n   Since Asahi was decided, the courts have sought to rec\noncile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan\u2019s con\ncurrence, advocating a rule based on general notions of\nfairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the prem\nises of lawful judicial power. This Court\u2019s precedents\nmake clear that it is the defendant\u2019s actions, not his expec\ntations, that empower a State\u2019s courts to subject him to\njudgment.\n   The conclusion that jurisdiction is in the first instance\na question of authority rather than fairness explains, for\nexample, why the principal opinion in Burnham \u201ccon\nducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or\nfairness\u201d of the rule that service of process within a State\nsuffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign\ndefendant. 495 U. S., at 621. As that opinion explained,\n\u201c[t]he view developed early that each State had the power\nto hale before its courts any individual who could be found\nwithin its borders.\u201d Id., at 610. Furthermore, were gen\neral fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction,\na lack of purposeful availment might be excused where\ncarefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise pro\ntect the defendant\u2019s interests, or where the plaintiff would\nsuffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign\nforum. That such considerations have not been deemed\ncontrolling is instructive. See, e.g., World-Wide Volks\nwagen, supra, at 294.\n   Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First, per\nsonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nby-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a de\nfendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the\nsociety or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a\ngiven sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to\nsubject the defendant to judgment concerning that con\nduct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts \u201cjudicial\npower not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of\nindividual liberty,\u201d for due process protects the individ\nual\u2019s right to be subject only to lawful power. Insurance\nCorp., 456 U. S., at 702. But whether a judicial judgment\nis lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority\nto render it.\n   The second principle is a corollary of the first. Because\nthe United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may\nin principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of\nthe United States but not of any particular State. This is\nconsistent with the premises and unique genius of our\nConstitution. Ours is \u201ca legal system unprecedented in\nform and design, establishing two orders of government,\neach with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its\nown set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who\nsustain it and are governed by it.\u201d U. S. Term Limits,\nInc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the\nrequisite relationship with the United States Government\nbut not with the government of any individual State. That\nwould be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is\na domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are\navailable and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if\nanother State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropri\nate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits\nthat each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to\nunlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore, foreign\ncorporations will often target or concentrate on particular\nStates, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those\nforums.\n10       J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n  It must be remembered, however, that although this\ncase and Asahi both involve foreign manufacturers, the\nundesirable consequences of Justice Brennan\u2019s approach\nare no less significant for domestic producers. The owner\nof a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby\ndistributor, for example, who might then distribute them\nto grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the\ncontrolling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or\nany number of other States\u2019 courts without ever leaving\ntown. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be con\ntested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the\npreliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules\nshould avoid these costs whenever possible.\n  The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant\nto judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent\nwith Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in Asahi, does not by itself\nresolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will\narise in particular cases. The defendant\u2019s conduct and\nthe economic realities of the market the defendant seeks\nto serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition\nwill, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that\nprinciple.\n                              III\n  In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales\nefforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it\nwere otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the\nCongress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in\nappropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in\nthis case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appro\npriate to address here any constitutional concerns that\nmight be attendant to that exercise of power. See Asahi,\n480 U. S., at 113, n. Nor is it necessary to determine what\nsubstantive law might apply were Congress to authorize\njurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey. See Hanson,\n357 U. S., at 254 (\u201cThe issue is personal jurisdiction, not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchoice of law\u201d). A sovereign\u2019s legislative authority to\nregulate conduct may present considerations different\nfrom those presented by its authority to subject a defen\ndant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns\nthe authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise ju\nrisdiction, so it is petitioner\u2019s purposeful contacts with\nNew Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are\nrelevant.\n   Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre en\ngaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.\nRecall that respondent\u2019s claim of jurisdiction centers on\nthree facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s\nmachines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials at\ntended trade shows in several States but not in New Jer\nsey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey. The\nBritish manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it nei\nther paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither\nadvertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. In\ndeed, after discovery the trial court found that the \u201cdefen\ndant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short\nof the machine in question ending up in this state.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 130a. These facts may reveal an intent to\nserve the U. S. market, but they do not show that J. McIn\ntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.\n   It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court ap\npears to agree, for it could \u201cnot find that J. McIntyre had a\npresence or minimum contacts in this State\u2014in any juris\nprudential sense\u2014that would justify a New Jersey court\nto exercise jurisdiction in this case.\u201d 201 N. J., at 61, 987\nA. 2d, at 582. The court nonetheless held that petitioner\ncould be sued in New Jersey based on a \u201cstream-of\ncommerce theory of jurisdiction.\u201d Ibid. As discussed,\nhowever, the stream-of-commerce metaphor cannot super\nsede either the mandate of the Due Process Clause or the\nlimits on judicial authority that Clause ensures. The New\nJersey Supreme Court also cited \u201csignificant policy rea\n12       J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nsons\u201d to justify its holding, including the State\u2019s \u201cstrong\ninterest in protecting its citizens from defective products.\u201d\nId., at 75, 987 A. 2d, at 590. That interest is doubtless\nstrong, but the Constitution commands restraint before\ndiscarding liberty in the name of expediency.\n                        *     *    *\n   Due process protects petitioner\u2019s right to be subject only\nto lawful authority. At no time did petitioner engage in\nany activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to in\nvoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. New Jersey\nis without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J.\nMcIntyre, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due\nprocess.

McIntyre Machinery Amer\nica, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 52, 987 A. 2d 575, 577 (2010). I do\nnot doubt that there have been many recent changes in\ncommerce and communication, many of which are not\nanticipated by our precedents. But this case does not\npresent any of those issues. So I think it unwise to an\nnounce a rule of broad applicability without full considera\ntion of the modern-day consequences.\n   In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by\nour precedents. Based on the facts found by the New\nJersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet\nhis burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally\nproper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre\nMachinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm\nthat manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain\nand sells them through an independent distributor in the\nUnited States (American Distributor). On that basis, I\n2        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nagree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the\nSupreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.\n                                I\n   In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer,\nthe Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on\nthree primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient\n\u201ccontacts\u201d with New Jersey, thereby making it funda-\nmentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its\ncourts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold\nand shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer,\nnamely, Mr. Nicastro\u2019s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the Brit\nish Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independ\nent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in\nAmerica willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of\nthe British Manufacturer attended trade shows in \u201csuch\ncities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San\nDiego, and San Francisco.\u201d Id., at 54\u201355, 987 A. 2d, at\n578\u2013579. In my view, these facts do not provide contacts\nbetween the British firm and the State of New Jersey\nconstitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey\u2019s asser\ntion of jurisdiction in this case.\n   None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale,\neven if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated\nhere, is sufficient. Rather, this Court\u2019s previous holdings\nsuggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single\nsale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product\nto a different State (where the accident takes place) is not\na sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See World-\nWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286 (1980).\nAnd the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly sug\ngested that a single sale of a product in a State does not\nconstitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over\nan out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places\nhis goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and\nhoping) that such a sale will take place.

Mr. Nicastro, who here bears\nthe burden of proving jurisdiction, has shown no specific\neffort by the British Manufacturer to sell in New Jersey.\nHe has introduced no list of potential New Jersey custom\ners who might, for example, have regularly attended trade\nshows. And he has not otherwise shown that the British\nManufacturer \u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege\nof conducting activities\u201d within New Jersey, or that it de\nlivered its goods in the stream of commerce \u201cwith the\nexpectation that they will be purchased\u201d by New Jersey\nusers.

Because the incident at issue in\nthis case does not implicate modern concerns, and because\nthe factual record leaves many open questions, this is an\nunsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that\nrefashion basic jurisdictional rules.\n                             A\n  The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit juris\ndiction where a defendant does not \u201cinten[d] to submit to\nthe power of a sovereign\u201d and cannot \u201cbe said to have\ntargeted the forum.\u201d Ante, at 7. But what do those stan\ndards mean when a company targets the world by selling\nproducts from its Web site?

And what if the\ncompany markets its products through popup advertise\nments that it knows will be viewed in a forum? Those\nissues have serious commercial consequences but are\ntotally absent in this case.\n                             B\n  But though I do not agree with the plurality\u2019s seemingly\nstrict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the\nabsolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt and urged by respondent and his amici. Under that\nview, a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products\nliability action so long as it \u201cknows or reasonably should\nknow that its products are distributed through a nation\nwide distribution system that might lead to those products\nbeing sold in any of the fifty states.\u201d 201 N. J., at 76\u201377,\n987 A. 2d, at 592 (emphasis added). In the context of this\ncase, I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the\nheretofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the\nrelationship between \u201cthe defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation,\u201d it is fair, in light of the defendant\u2019s contacts\nwith that forum, to subject the defendant to suit there.\nShaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977) (emphasis\nadded). It would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon\nno more than the occurrence of a product-based accident in\nthe forum State. But this Court has rejected the notion\nthat a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit \u201ctravel[s] with the\nchattel.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296.\n   For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule\nwith the constitutional demand for \u201cminimum contacts\u201d\nand \u201cpurposefu[l] avail[ment],\u201d each of which rest upon a\nparticular notion of defendant-focused fairness. Id., at\n291, 297 (internal quotation marks omitted). A rule like\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s would permit every State\nto assert jurisdiction in a products-liability suit against\nany domestic manufacturer who sells its products (made\nanywhere in the United States) to a national distributor,\nno matter how large or small the manufacturer, no matter\nhow distant the forum, and no matter how few the number\nof items that end up in the particular forum at issue.\nWhat might appear fair in the case of a large manufac\nturer which specifically seeks, or expects, an equal-sized\ndistributor to sell its product in a distant State might\nseem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer (say, an\nAppalachian potter) who sells his product (cups and sau\n6        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncers) exclusively to a large distributor, who resells a single\nitem (a coffee mug) to a buyer from a distant State (Ha\nwaii). I know too little about the range of these or in\nbetween possibilities to abandon in favor of the more\nabsolute rule what has previously been this Court\u2019s less\nabsolute approach.\n   Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather\nthan a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness\nof an absolute rule yet more uncertain. I am again less\ncertain than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the\nnature of international commerce has changed so sig-\nnificantly as to require a new approach to personal\njurisdiction.\n   It may be that a larger firm can readily \u201calleviate the\nrisk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,\npassing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks\nare too great, severing its connection with the State.\u201d\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 297. But manufactur\ners come in many shapes and sizes. It may be fundamen\ntally unfair to require a small Egyptian shirt maker, a\nBrazilian manufacturing cooperative, or a Kenyan coffee\nfarmer, selling its products through international distribu\ntors, to respond to products-liability tort suits in virtually\nevery State in the United States, even those in respect to\nwhich the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale\nof a single (allegedly defective) good. And a rule like the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court suggests would require every\nproduct manufacturer, large or small, selling to American\ndistributors to understand not only the tort law of every\nState, but also the wide variance in the way courts within\ndifferent States apply that law.

Its goal is\nsimply to sell as much as it can, wherever it can. It ex\ncludes no region or State from the market it wishes to\nreach. But, all things considered, it prefers to avoid prod\nucts liability litigation in the United States. To that end,\nit engages a U. S. distributor to ship its machines state\nside.

Notably, McIntyre\nAmerica was concerned about U. S. litigation involving\nMcIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been\nnamed as a defendant. McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre\nAmerica to respond personally to the litigation, but reas\nsured its distributor that \u201cthe product was built and de\nsigned by McIntyre Machinery in the UK and the buck\nstops here\u2014if there\u2019s something wrong with the machine.\u201d\nId., at 129a\u2013130a.

And in corre\nspondence with McIntyre America, McIntyre UK noted\nthat the manufacturer had products liability insurance\ncoverage.

Super., at 548,\n945 A. 2d, at 97, \u201cthe two companies [were acting] closely\nin concert with each other,\u201d ibid. McIntyre UK never\ninstructed its distributor to avoid certain States or regions\nof the country; rather, as just noted, the manufacturer\nengaged McIntyre America to attract customers \u201cfrom\nanywhere in the United States.\u201d App. 161a.\n   In sum, McIntyre UK\u2019s regular attendance and exhibi\ntions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to\nreach customers for its products \u201canywhere in the United\nStates.\u201d At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK\u2019s en\ngagement of McIntyre America as the conduit for sales of\nMcIntyre UK\u2019s machines to buyers \u201cthroughout the United\nStates.\u201d Given McIntyre UK\u2019s endeavors to reach and\nprofit from the United States market as a whole, Nicas\ntro\u2019s suit, I would hold, has been brought in a forum en\ntirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim. He\nalleges that McIntyre UK\u2019s shear machine was defectively\ndesigned or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury\nto him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicas\ntro\u2019s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously,\nbut as a result of the U. S. connections and distribution\nsystem that McIntyre UK deliberately arranged.3 On\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 McIntyre UK resisted Nicastro\u2019s efforts to determine whether other\n\nMcIntyre machines had been sold to New Jersey customers. See id., at\n100a\u2013101a. McIntyre did allow that McIntyre America \u201cmay have\nresold products it purchased from [McIntyre UK] to a buyer in New\nJersey,\u201d id., at 117a, but said it kept no record of the ultimate destina\ntion of machines it shipped to its distributor, ibid. A private investiga\ntor engaged by Nicastro found at least one McIntyre UK machine, of\nunspecified type, in use in New Jersey. Id., at 140a\u2013144a. But McIn\ntyre UK objected that the investigator\u2019s report was \u201cunsworn and based\nupon hearsay.\u201d Reply Brief 10. Moreover, McIntyre UK maintained, no\nevidence showed that the machine the investigator found in New Jersey\nhad been \u201csold into [that State].\u201d Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

First, all agree, Mc-\nIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose)\njurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country\ncorporation is hardly \u201cat home\u201d in New Jersey. See Good\nyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, post, at 2\u20133,\n9\u201313. The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction,\nwhich turns on an \u201caffiliatio[n] between the forum and the\nunderlying controversy.\u201d Goodyear Dunlop, post, at 2\n(quoting von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudi\ncate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136\n(1966) (hereinafter von Mehren & Trautman); internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Goodyear Dunlop, post,\nat 7\u20138.\n   Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of\nadjudicatory authority among States of the United States\nis present in this case. New Jersey\u2019s exercise of personal\njurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous\nproduct caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not\ntread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any\nsister State. Indeed, among States of the United States,\nthe State in which the injury occurred would seem most\nsuitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim. See\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286,\n297 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to\ndevelop a market for a product in several States, it is\nreasonable \u201cto subject it to suit in one of those States if its\nallegedly defective [product] has there been the source of\n8        J.

As the Court clarified in Insurance\nCorp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456\nU. S. 694 (1982):\n    \u201cThe restriction on state sovereign power described in\n    World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. . . . must be seen as ul\n    timately a function of the individual liberty interest\n    preserved by the Due Process Clause. That Clause is\n    the only source of the personal jurisdiction require\n    ment and the Clause itself makes no mention of fed\n    eralism concerns. Furthermore, if the federalism con\n    cept operated as an independent restriction on the\n    sovereign power of the court, it would not be possible\n    to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement: Indi\n    vidual actions cannot change the powers of sover\n    eignty, although the individual can subject himself to\n    powers from which he may otherwise be protected.\u201d\n    Id., at 703, n. 10.\nSee also Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.

But see ante, at 7\n(plurality opinion) (asserting that \u201csovereign authority,\u201d\nnot \u201cfairness,\u201d is the \u201ccentral concept\u201d in determining\npersonal jurisdiction).\n  Finally, in International Shoe itself, and decisions there\nafter, the Court has made plain that legal fictions, notably\n\u201cpresence\u201d and \u201cimplied consent,\u201d should be discarded, for\nthey conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Superior Court of\nCal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987).\n  World-Wide Volkswagen concerned a New York car\ndealership that sold solely in the New York market, and\na New York distributor who supplied retailers in three\nStates only: New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. 444\nU. S., at 289. New York residents had purchased an Audi\nfrom the New York dealer and were driving the new vehi\ncle through Oklahoma en route to Arizona. On the road in\nOklahoma, another car struck the Audi in the rear, caus\ning a fire which severely burned the Audi\u2019s occupants. Id.,\nat 288. Rejecting the Oklahoma courts\u2019 assertion of juris\ndiction over the New York dealer and distributor, this\nCourt observed that the defendants had done nothing to\nserve the market for cars in Oklahoma. Id., at 295\u2013298.\nJurisdiction, the Court held, could not be based on the\ncustomer\u2019s unilateral act of driving the vehicle to Okla\nhoma. Id., at 298; see Asahi, 480 U. S., at 109 (opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.) (World-Wide Volkswagen \u201crejected the as-\nsertion that a consumer\u2019s unilateral act of bringing the\ndefendant\u2019s product into the forum State was a sufficient\nconstitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the\ndefendant\u201d).\n  Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in World-\nWide Volkswagen did not object to the jurisdiction of the\nOklahoma courts and the U.

And\nmost relevant here, the Court\u2019s opinion indicates that an\nobjection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national\ndistributor would have been unavailing. To reiterate, the\nCourt said in World-Wide Volkswagen that, when a manu\n16       J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v.

The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against\nAsahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and\nAsahi contested the California courts\u2019 jurisdiction. By the\ntime the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff\nhad settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the\nTaiwanese company against the Japanese valve-assembly\nmanufacturer remained.\n   The decision was not a close call. The Court had before\nit a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and\na foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker,\nand the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction\nbetween those parties that occurred abroad. All agreed on\nthe bottom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufac\nturer was not reasonably brought into the California\ncourts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over\na transaction that took place outside the United States.\n   Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling opin\nions of Justice Brennan and Justice O\u2019Connor were hardly\nnecessary. How the Court would have \u201cestimate[d] . . . the\ninconveniences,\u201d see International Shoe, 326 U.

Cf. Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.\n783, 788 (1984) (a plaintiff\u2019s contacts with the forum \u201cmay\nbe so manifold as to permit jurisdiction when it would not\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

Moreover,\nAsahi was a component-part manufacturer with \u201clittle\ncontrol over the final destination of its products once they\nwere delivered into the stream of commerce.\u201d A. Uberti,\n181 Ariz., at 572, 892 P. 2d, at 1361. It was important to\nthe Court in Asahi that \u201cthose who use Asahi components\nin their final products, and sell those products in Califor\nnia, [would be] subject to the application of California tort\nlaw.\u201d 480 U. S., at 115 (majority opinion). To hold that\nAsahi controls this case would, to put it bluntly, be dead\nwrong.15\n                              B\n   The Court\u2019s judgment also puts United States plaintiffs\nat a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated\ncomplainants elsewhere in the world. Of particular note,\nwithin the European Union, in which the United Kingdom\nis a participant, the jurisdiction New Jersey would have\nexercised is not at all exceptional.

A $24,900 shearing machine, however, is unlikely to sell in bulk\nworldwide, much less in any given State. By dollar value, the price of a\nsingle machine represents a significant sale.

Argued January 11, 2011\u2014Decided June 27, 2011\nRespondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing\n  machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre),\n  manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and\n  operates. Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in\n  New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to\n  dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction. Nicastro\u2019s jurisdic\n  tional claim was based on three primary facts: A U. S. distributor\n  agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s machines in this country; J. McIntyre of\n  ficials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jer\n  sey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests\n  only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey. The\n  State Supreme Court held that New Jersey\u2019s courts can exercise ju\n  risdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the\n  Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause so long as the manu\n  facturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are\n  distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead\n  to sales in any of the States. Invoking this \u201cstream-of-commerce\u201d\n  doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Indus\n  try Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Apply\n  ing its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to juris\n  diction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in,\n  sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed.\n201 N. J. 48, 987 A. 2d 575, reversed.\n    JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA,\n  and JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that because J. McIntyre never en\n2           J.

NICASTRO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    gaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to in\n    voke or benefit from the protection of the State\u2019s laws, New Jersey is\n    without power to adjudge the company\u2019s rights and liabilities, and its\n    exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (a) Due process protects the defendant\u2019s right not to be coerced ex\n    cept by lawful judicial power. A court may subject a defendant to\n    judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the\n    sovereign \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tra\n    ditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d International\n    Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316. Freeform fundamental\n    fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a\n    judgment rendered without authority into law. As a general rule, the\n    sovereign\u2019s exercise of power requires some act by which the defen\n    dant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activi\n    ties within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protec\n    tions of its laws.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253. In cases\n    like this one, it is the defendant\u2019s purposeful availment that makes\n    jurisdiction consistent with \u201cfair play and substantial justice\u201d no\n    tions. No \u201cstream-of-commerce\u201d doctrine can displace that general\n    rule for products-liability cases.\n       The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an\n    absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left\n    open in Asahi. The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,\n    results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and\n    the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d That concept, like other metaphors, has\n    its deficiencies as well as its utilities. It refers to the movement of\n    goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet be\n    yond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact. A defen\n    dant\u2019s placement of goods into commerce \u201cwith the expectation that\n    they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State\u201d may\n    indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.\n    Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298. But that does not amend the general\n    rule of personal jurisdiction. The principal inquiry in cases of this\n    sort is whether the defendant\u2019s activities manifest an intention to\n    submit to the power of a sovereign. See, e.g., Hanson, supra, at 253.\n    In Asahi, Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence (joined by three other Jus\n    tices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of\n    fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the de\n    fendant\u2019s ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.\n    480 U. S., at 117. However, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s lead opinion (also for\n    four Justices) stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between the\n    defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum\n    contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully\n    directed toward the forum State.\u201d Id., at 112. Since Asahi, the courts\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nhave sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Bren\nnan\u2019s rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is\ninconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this\nCourt\u2019s precedents. Today\u2019s conclusion that the authority to subject a\ndefendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent\nwith Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s Asahi opinion. Pp. 4\u201310.\n   (b) Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in con\nduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. The company had no office\nin New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it\nneither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. Indeed,\nthe trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with\nthe State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up\nthere. Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered\nhis jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed\nitself of the New Jersey market. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE ALITO, agreed that the New Jer\nsey Supreme Court\u2019s judgment must be reversed, but concluded that\nbecause this case does not present issues arising from recent changes\nin commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of\nbroad applicability without fully considering modern-day conse\nquences. Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the\nCourt\u2019s precedents. Pp. 2\u20137.\n   (a) Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his\nburden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise\njurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British\nManufacturer). The three primary facts the state high court relied\non do not satisfy due process. None of the Court\u2019s precedents finds\nthat a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales\neffort indicated here, is sufficient. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.\nv. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286; Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior\nCourt of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Here, the relevant facts\nshow no \u201cregular . . . flow\u201d or \u201cregular course\u201d of sales in New Jersey,\nid., at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment); id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment); and there is no \u201csomething more,\u201d such as special state\nrelated design, advertising, advice, or marketing, id., at 111, 112\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of juris\ndiction. Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manu\nfacturer to sell in New Jersey. And he has not otherwise shown that\nthe British Manufacturer \u201c \u2018purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privi\nlege of conducting activities\u2019 \u201d within New Jersey, or that it delivered\nits goods in the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that they\nwill be purchased\u201d by New Jersey users.

Because the incident at\n    issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual re\n    cord leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for\n    making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional\n    rules. At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in\n    the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court sug\n    gests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary\n    commercial circumstances. Insofar as such considerations are rele\n    vant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case\n    (unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.\n    Pp. 4\u20137.\n\n   KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an\nopinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

The rules and stan\ndards for determining when a State does or does not have\njurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear be\ncause of decades-old questions left open in Asahi Metal\nIndustry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480\nU. S. 102 (1987).\n    Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part\non Asahi, held that New Jersey\u2019s courts can exercise juris\ndiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as\nthe manufacturer \u201cknows or reasonably should know that\nits products are distributed through a nationwide distribu\n2        J.

McIntyre Machinery\nAmerica, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A. 2d 575, 591, 592\n(2010). Applying that test, the court concluded that a\nBritish manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject\nto jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had\nit advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense\ntargeted the State.\n   That decision cannot be sustained. Although the New\nJersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with care\nful attention to this Court\u2019s cases and to its own pre\ncedent, the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d metaphor carried the\ndecision far afield. Due process protects the defendant\u2019s\nright not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power. As\na general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful\nunless the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself of the\nprivilege of conducting activities within the forum State,\nthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253 (1958). There may\nbe exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an\nintentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this\nproducts-liability case, and the so-called \u201cstream-of\ncommerce\u201d doctrine cannot displace it.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a products-liability suit filed in\nNew Jersey state court. Robert Nicastro seriously injured\nhis hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufac\ntured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The\naccident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was\nmanufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorpo\nrated and operates. The question here is whether the New\nJersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwith\nstanding the fact that the company at no time either\nmarketed goods in the State or shipped them there. Ni\ncastro was a plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court and is\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthe respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is\nnow the petitioner.\n   At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro\u2019s counsel\nstressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey\u2019s as\nsertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29\u201330.\n   First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIn\ntyre\u2019s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself\ndid not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond\nthe U. S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the\ndistributor was under J. McIntyre\u2019s control.\n   Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conven\ntions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. Mc-\nIntyre\u2019s machines alongside the distributor. The conven\ntions took place in various States, but never in New\nJersey.\n   Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests\nonly one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the\nmachine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this\nsuit, ended up in New Jersey.\n   In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held\nboth United States and European patents on its recycling\ntechnology. 201 N. J., at 55, 987 A. 2d, at 579. It also\nnoted that the U. S. distributor \u201cstructured [its] adver\ntising and sales efforts in accordance with\u201d J. McIntyre\u2019s\n\u201cdirection and guidance whenever possible,\u201d and that \u201cat\nleast some of the machines were sold on consignment to\u201d\nthe distributor. Id., at 55, 56, 987 A. 2d, at 579 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nconcluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdic\ntion over petitioner without contravention of the Due\nProcess Clause. Jurisdiction was proper, in that court\u2019s\nview, because the injury occurred in New Jersey; because\npetitioner knew or reasonably should have known \u201cthat its\n4        J.

This Court\u2019s Asahi decision may be\nresponsible in part for that court\u2019s error regarding the\nstream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity\nto provide greater clarity.\n                               II\n  The Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s right to\nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise\nof lawful power. Cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S.\n399, 403 (1966) (The Clause \u201cprotect[s] a person against\nhaving the Government impose burdens upon him except\nin accordance with the valid laws of the land\u201d). This is no\nless true with respect to the power of a sovereign to re\nsolve disputes through judicial process than with respect\nto the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for\nthose within its sphere. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Bet\nter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (\u201cJurisdiction is\npower to declare the law\u201d). As a general rule, neither\nstatute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the\nState. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of\nMarin, 495 U. S. 604, 608\u2013609 (1990) (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.) (invoking \u201cthe phrase coram non judice, \u2018before a per\nson not a judge\u2019\u2014meaning, in effect, that the proceeding\nin question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful\njudicial authority was not present, and could therefore not\nyield a judgment\u201d)\n  A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when\nthe defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316\n(1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463\n(1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness di\nvorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judg\nment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a\ngeneral rule, the sovereign\u2019s exercise of power requires\nsome act by which the defendant \u201cpurposefully avails itself\nof the privilege of conducting activities within the forum\nState, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its\nlaws,\u201d Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253, though in some cases, as\nwith an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall\nwithin the State\u2019s authority by reason of his attempt to\nobstruct its laws. In products-liability cases like this one,\nit is the defendant\u2019s purposeful availment that makes\njurisdiction consistent with \u201ctraditional notions of fair play\nand substantial justice.\u201d\n   A person may submit to a State\u2019s authority in a number\nof ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. E.g., In\nsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\nGuinee, 456 U. S. 694, 703 (1982). Presence within a State\nat the time suit commences through service of process is\nanother example. See Burnham, supra. Citizenship or\ndomicile\u2014or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place\nof business for corporations\u2014also indicates general sub\nmission to a State\u2019s powers. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Op\nerations, S. A. v. Brown, post, p. __. Each of these exam\nples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from\nwhich it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and\nthus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State.\nCf. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476\n(1985). These examples support exercise of the general\njurisdiction of the State\u2019s courts and allow the State to\nresolve both matters that originate within the State and\nthose based on activities and events elsewhere. Helicop\n6        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,\n414, and n. 9 (1984). By contrast, those who live or oper\nate primarily outside a State have a due process right not\nto be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general\nmatter.\n   There is also a more limited form of submission to a\nState\u2019s authority for disputes that \u201carise out of or are con\nnected with the activities within the state.\u201d International\nShoe Co., supra, at 319. Where a defendant \u201cpurposefully\navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within\nthe forum State, thus invoking the benefits and\nprotections of its laws,\u201d Hanson, supra, at 253, it submits\nto the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to\nthe extent that power is exercised in connection with the\ndefendant\u2019s activities touching on the State. In other\nwords, submission through contact with and activity\ndirected at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction \u201cin\na suit arising out of or related to the defendant\u2019s contacts\nwith the forum.\u201d Helicopteros, supra, at 414, n. 8; see also\nGoodyear, post, at 2.\n   The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,\nresults from its statement of the relation between jurisdic\ntion and the \u201cstream of commerce.\u201d The stream of com\nmerce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as\nits utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manu\nfacturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond\nthat descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.\nThis Court has stated that a defendant\u2019s placing goods\ninto the stream of commerce \u201cwith the expectation that\nthey will be purchased by consumers within the forum\nState\u201d may indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide\nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298 (1980)\n(finding that expectation lacking). But that statement\ndoes not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.\nIt merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate\ncase be subject to jurisdiction without entering the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nforum\u2014itself an unexceptional proposition\u2014as where man\nufacturers or distributors \u201cseek to serve\u201d a given State\u2019s\nmarket. Id., at 295. The principal inquiry in cases of\nthis sort is whether the defendant\u2019s activities manifest\nan intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In\nother words, the defendant must \u201cpurposefully avai[l] it\nself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\nforum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of\nits laws.\u201d Hanson, supra, at 253; Insurance Corp., supra,\nat 704\u2013705 (\u201c[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a\nlegal submission to the jurisdiction of the court\u201d). Some\ntimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than\nits agents. The defendant\u2019s transmission of goods permits\nthe exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can\nbe said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is\nnot enough that the defendant might have predicted that\nits goods will reach the forum State.\n   In Asahi, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Jus\ntices outlined a different approach. It discarded the cen\ntral concept of sovereign authority in favor of considera\ntions of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence\ncontended, \u201cjurisdiction premised on the placement of a\nproduct into the stream of commerce [without more] is\nconsistent with the Due Process Clause,\u201d for \u201c[a]s long as a\nparticipant in this process is aware that the final product\nis being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a\nlawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.\u201d 480 U. S., at\n117 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). It was the premise of the concurring opinion that\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to anticipate suit renders the asser\ntion of jurisdiction fair. In this way, the opinion made\nforeseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.\n   The standard set forth in Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence\nwas rejected in an opinion written by Justice O\u2019Connor;\nbut the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the\nassent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court.\n8        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThat opinion stated: \u201cThe \u2018substantial connection\u2019 between\nthe defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding\nof minimum contacts must come about by an action of the\ndefendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\nThe placement of a product into the stream of commerce,\nwithout more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully\ndirected toward the forum State.\u201d Id., at 112 (emphasis\ndeleted; citations omitted).\n   Since Asahi was decided, the courts have sought to rec\noncile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan\u2019s con\ncurrence, advocating a rule based on general notions of\nfairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the prem\nises of lawful judicial power. This Court\u2019s precedents\nmake clear that it is the defendant\u2019s actions, not his expec\ntations, that empower a State\u2019s courts to subject him to\njudgment.\n   The conclusion that jurisdiction is in the first instance\na question of authority rather than fairness explains, for\nexample, why the principal opinion in Burnham \u201ccon\nducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or\nfairness\u201d of the rule that service of process within a State\nsuffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign\ndefendant. 495 U. S., at 621. As that opinion explained,\n\u201c[t]he view developed early that each State had the power\nto hale before its courts any individual who could be found\nwithin its borders.\u201d Id., at 610. Furthermore, were gen\neral fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction,\na lack of purposeful availment might be excused where\ncarefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise pro\ntect the defendant\u2019s interests, or where the plaintiff would\nsuffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign\nforum. That such considerations have not been deemed\ncontrolling is instructive. See, e.g., World-Wide Volks\nwagen, supra, at 294.\n   Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First, per\nsonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nby-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a de\nfendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the\nsociety or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a\ngiven sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to\nsubject the defendant to judgment concerning that con\nduct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts \u201cjudicial\npower not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of\nindividual liberty,\u201d for due process protects the individ\nual\u2019s right to be subject only to lawful power. Insurance\nCorp., 456 U. S., at 702. But whether a judicial judgment\nis lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority\nto render it.\n   The second principle is a corollary of the first. Because\nthe United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may\nin principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of\nthe United States but not of any particular State. This is\nconsistent with the premises and unique genius of our\nConstitution. Ours is \u201ca legal system unprecedented in\nform and design, establishing two orders of government,\neach with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its\nown set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who\nsustain it and are governed by it.\u201d U. S. Term Limits,\nInc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the\nrequisite relationship with the United States Government\nbut not with the government of any individual State. That\nwould be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is\na domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are\navailable and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if\nanother State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropri\nate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits\nthat each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to\nunlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore, foreign\ncorporations will often target or concentrate on particular\nStates, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those\nforums.\n10       J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n  It must be remembered, however, that although this\ncase and Asahi both involve foreign manufacturers, the\nundesirable consequences of Justice Brennan\u2019s approach\nare no less significant for domestic producers. The owner\nof a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby\ndistributor, for example, who might then distribute them\nto grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the\ncontrolling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or\nany number of other States\u2019 courts without ever leaving\ntown. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be con\ntested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the\npreliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules\nshould avoid these costs whenever possible.\n  The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant\nto judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent\nwith Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in Asahi, does not by itself\nresolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will\narise in particular cases. The defendant\u2019s conduct and\nthe economic realities of the market the defendant seeks\nto serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition\nwill, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that\nprinciple.\n                              III\n  In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales\nefforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it\nwere otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the\nCongress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in\nappropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in\nthis case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appro\npriate to address here any constitutional concerns that\nmight be attendant to that exercise of power. See Asahi,\n480 U. S., at 113, n. Nor is it necessary to determine what\nsubstantive law might apply were Congress to authorize\njurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey. See Hanson,\n357 U. S., at 254 (\u201cThe issue is personal jurisdiction, not\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchoice of law\u201d). A sovereign\u2019s legislative authority to\nregulate conduct may present considerations different\nfrom those presented by its authority to subject a defen\ndant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns\nthe authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise ju\nrisdiction, so it is petitioner\u2019s purposeful contacts with\nNew Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are\nrelevant.\n   Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre en\ngaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.\nRecall that respondent\u2019s claim of jurisdiction centers on\nthree facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre\u2019s\nmachines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials at\ntended trade shows in several States but not in New Jer\nsey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey. The\nBritish manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it nei\nther paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither\nadvertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. In\ndeed, after discovery the trial court found that the \u201cdefen\ndant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short\nof the machine in question ending up in this state.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 130a. These facts may reveal an intent to\nserve the U. S. market, but they do not show that J. McIn\ntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.\n   It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court ap\npears to agree, for it could \u201cnot find that J. McIntyre had a\npresence or minimum contacts in this State\u2014in any juris\nprudential sense\u2014that would justify a New Jersey court\nto exercise jurisdiction in this case.\u201d 201 N. J., at 61, 987\nA. 2d, at 582. The court nonetheless held that petitioner\ncould be sued in New Jersey based on a \u201cstream-of\ncommerce theory of jurisdiction.\u201d Ibid. As discussed,\nhowever, the stream-of-commerce metaphor cannot super\nsede either the mandate of the Due Process Clause or the\nlimits on judicial authority that Clause ensures. The New\nJersey Supreme Court also cited \u201csignificant policy rea\n12       J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nsons\u201d to justify its holding, including the State\u2019s \u201cstrong\ninterest in protecting its citizens from defective products.\u201d\nId., at 75, 987 A. 2d, at 590. That interest is doubtless\nstrong, but the Constitution commands restraint before\ndiscarding liberty in the name of expediency.\n                        *     *    *\n   Due process protects petitioner\u2019s right to be subject only\nto lawful authority. At no time did petitioner engage in\nany activities in New Jersey that reveal an intent to in\nvoke or benefit from the protection of its laws. New Jersey\nis without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of J.\nMcIntyre, and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due\nprocess. The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Su\npreme Court is\n                                                   Reversed.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

McIntyre Machinery Amer\nica, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 52, 987 A. 2d 575, 577 (2010). I do\nnot doubt that there have been many recent changes in\ncommerce and communication, many of which are not\nanticipated by our precedents. But this case does not\npresent any of those issues. So I think it unwise to an\nnounce a rule of broad applicability without full considera\ntion of the modern-day consequences.\n   In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by\nour precedents. Based on the facts found by the New\nJersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet\nhis burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally\nproper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre\nMachinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm\nthat manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain\nand sells them through an independent distributor in the\nUnited States (American Distributor). On that basis, I\n2        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nagree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the\nSupreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.\n                                I\n   In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer,\nthe Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on\nthree primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient\n\u201ccontacts\u201d with New Jersey, thereby making it funda-\nmentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its\ncourts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold\nand shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer,\nnamely, Mr. Nicastro\u2019s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the Brit\nish Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independ\nent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in\nAmerica willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of\nthe British Manufacturer attended trade shows in \u201csuch\ncities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San\nDiego, and San Francisco.\u201d Id., at 54\u201355, 987 A. 2d, at\n578\u2013579. In my view, these facts do not provide contacts\nbetween the British firm and the State of New Jersey\nconstitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey\u2019s asser\ntion of jurisdiction in this case.\n   None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale,\neven if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated\nhere, is sufficient. Rather, this Court\u2019s previous holdings\nsuggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single\nsale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product\nto a different State (where the accident takes place) is not\na sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See World-\nWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286 (1980).\nAnd the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly sug\ngested that a single sale of a product in a State does not\nconstitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over\nan out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places\nhis goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and\nhoping) that such a sale will take place.

Because the incident at issue in\nthis case does not implicate modern concerns, and because\nthe factual record leaves many open questions, this is an\nunsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that\nrefashion basic jurisdictional rules.\n                             A\n  The plurality seems to state strict rules that limit juris\ndiction where a defendant does not \u201cinten[d] to submit to\nthe power of a sovereign\u201d and cannot \u201cbe said to have\ntargeted the forum.\u201d Ante, at 7. But what do those stan\ndards mean when a company targets the world by selling\nproducts from its Web site? And does it matter if, instead\nof shipping the products directly, a company consigns the\nproducts through an intermediary (say, Amazon.com) who\nthen receives and fulfills the orders? And what if the\ncompany markets its products through popup advertise\nments that it knows will be viewed in a forum? Those\nissues have serious commercial consequences but are\ntotally absent in this case.\n                             B\n  But though I do not agree with the plurality\u2019s seemingly\nstrict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the\nabsolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt and urged by respondent and his amici. Under that\nview, a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products\nliability action so long as it \u201cknows or reasonably should\nknow that its products are distributed through a nation\nwide distribution system that might lead to those products\nbeing sold in any of the fifty states.\u201d 201 N. J., at 76\u201377,\n987 A. 2d, at 592 (emphasis added). In the context of this\ncase, I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the\nheretofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the\nrelationship between \u201cthe defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation,\u201d it is fair, in light of the defendant\u2019s contacts\nwith that forum, to subject the defendant to suit there.\nShaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977) (emphasis\nadded). It would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon\nno more than the occurrence of a product-based accident in\nthe forum State. But this Court has rejected the notion\nthat a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit \u201ctravel[s] with the\nchattel.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296.\n   For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule\nwith the constitutional demand for \u201cminimum contacts\u201d\nand \u201cpurposefu[l] avail[ment],\u201d each of which rest upon a\nparticular notion of defendant-focused fairness. Id., at\n291, 297 (internal quotation marks omitted). A rule like\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s would permit every State\nto assert jurisdiction in a products-liability suit against\nany domestic manufacturer who sells its products (made\nanywhere in the United States) to a national distributor,\nno matter how large or small the manufacturer, no matter\nhow distant the forum, and no matter how few the number\nof items that end up in the particular forum at issue.\nWhat might appear fair in the case of a large manufac\nturer which specifically seeks, or expects, an equal-sized\ndistributor to sell its product in a distant State might\nseem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer (say, an\nAppalachian potter) who sells his product (cups and sau\n6        J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncers) exclusively to a large distributor, who resells a single\nitem (a coffee mug) to a buyer from a distant State (Ha\nwaii). I know too little about the range of these or in\nbetween possibilities to abandon in favor of the more\nabsolute rule what has previously been this Court\u2019s less\nabsolute approach.\n   Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather\nthan a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness\nof an absolute rule yet more uncertain. I am again less\ncertain than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the\nnature of international commerce has changed so sig-\nnificantly as to require a new approach to personal\njurisdiction.\n   It may be that a larger firm can readily \u201calleviate the\nrisk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,\npassing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks\nare too great, severing its connection with the State.\u201d\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 297. But manufactur\ners come in many shapes and sizes. It may be fundamen\ntally unfair to require a small Egyptian shirt maker, a\nBrazilian manufacturing cooperative, or a Kenyan coffee\nfarmer, selling its products through international distribu\ntors, to respond to products-liability tort suits in virtually\nevery State in the United States, even those in respect to\nwhich the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale\nof a single (allegedly defective) good. And a rule like the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court suggests would require every\nproduct manufacturer, large or small, selling to American\ndistributors to understand not only the tort law of every\nState, but also the wide variance in the way courts within\ndifferent States apply that law. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Tort Trials and\nVerdicts in Large Counties, 2001, p. 11 (reporting percent\nage of plaintiff winners in tort trials among 46 populous\ncounties, ranging from 17.9% (Worcester, Mass.) to 69.1%\n(Milwaukee, Wis.)).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

And on those grounds, I do not think we can find\njurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, though I agree with\nthe plurality as to the outcome of this case, I concur only\nin the judgment of that opinion and not its reasoning.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

But, all things considered, it prefers to avoid prod\nucts liability litigation in the United States. To that end,\nit engages a U. S. distributor to ship its machines state\nside.

Notably, McIntyre\nAmerica was concerned about U. S. litigation involving\nMcIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been\nnamed as a defendant.

He\nalleges that McIntyre UK\u2019s shear machine was defectively\ndesigned or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury\nto him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicas\ntro\u2019s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously,\nbut as a result of the U.

See id., at\n100a\u2013101a. McIntyre did allow that McIntyre America \u201cmay have\nresold products it purchased from [McIntyre UK] to a buyer in New\nJersey,\u201d id., at 117a, but said it kept no record of the ultimate destina\ntion of machines it shipped to its distributor, ibid.

But McIn\ntyre UK objected that the investigator\u2019s report was \u201cunsworn and based\nupon hearsay.\u201d Reply Brief 10.

First, all agree, Mc-\nIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose)\njurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country\ncorporation is hardly \u201cat home\u201d in New Jersey. See Good\nyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, post, at 2\u20133,\n9\u201313. The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction,\nwhich turns on an \u201caffiliatio[n] between the forum and the\nunderlying controversy.\u201d Goodyear Dunlop, post, at 2\n(quoting von Mehren & Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudi\ncate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv.

Rev. 1121, 1136\n(1966) (hereinafter von Mehren & Trautman); internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Goodyear Dunlop, post,\nat 7\u20138.\n   Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of\nadjudicatory authority among States of the United States\nis present in this case. New Jersey\u2019s exercise of personal\njurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous\nproduct caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not\ntread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any\nsister State. Indeed, among States of the United States,\nthe State in which the injury occurred would seem most\nsuitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim. See\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286,\n297 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to\ndevelop a market for a product in several States, it is\nreasonable \u201cto subject it to suit in one of those States if its\nallegedly defective [product] has there been the source of\n8        J.

As the Court clarified in Insurance\nCorp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456\nU.

Superior Court of\nCal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987).\n  World-Wide Volkswagen concerned a New York car\ndealership that sold solely in the New York market, and\na New York distributor who supplied retailers in three\nStates only: New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. 444\nU.

On the road in\nOklahoma, another car struck the Audi in the rear, caus\ning a fire which severely burned the Audi\u2019s occupants. Id.,\nat 288. Rejecting the Oklahoma courts\u2019 assertion of juris\ndiction over the New York dealer and distributor, this\nCourt observed that the defendants had done nothing to\nserve the market for cars in Oklahoma. Id., at 295\u2013298.\nJurisdiction, the Court held, could not be based on the\ncustomer\u2019s unilateral act of driving the vehicle to Okla\nhoma. Id., at 298; see Asahi, 480 U.

(World-Wide Volkswagen \u201crejected the as-\nsertion that a consumer\u2019s unilateral act of bringing the\ndefendant\u2019s product into the forum State was a sufficient\nconstitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the\ndefendant\u201d).\n  Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in World-\nWide Volkswagen did not object to the jurisdiction of the\nOklahoma courts and the U.

And\nmost relevant here, the Court\u2019s opinion indicates that an\nobjection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national\ndistributor would have been unavailing.

The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against\nAsahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and\nAsahi contested the California courts\u2019 jurisdiction. By the\ntime the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff\nhad settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the\nTaiwanese company against the Japanese valve-assembly\nmanufacturer remained.\n   The decision was not a close call. The Court had before\nit a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and\na foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker,\nand the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction\nbetween those parties that occurred abroad. All agreed on\nthe bottom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufac\nturer was not reasonably brought into the California\ncourts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over\na transaction that took place outside the United States.\n   Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling opin\nions of Justice Brennan and Justice O\u2019Connor were hardly\nnecessary.

Of particular note,\nwithin the European Union, in which the United Kingdom\nis a participant, the jurisdiction New Jersey would have\nexercised is not at all exceptional.

R.\n1735, 1748\u20131749.17\n                              V\n   The commentators who gave names to what we now\ncall \u201cgeneral jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d antici\npated that when the latter achieves its full growth, con\nsiderations of litigational convenience and the respective\nsituations of the parties would determine when it is ap\npropriate to subject a defendant to trial in the plaintiff\u2019s\ncommunity. See von Mehren & Trautman 1166\u20131179.\nLitigational considerations include \u201cthe convenience of\nwitnesses and the ease of ascertaining the governing law.\u201d\nId., at 1168\u20131169. As to the parties, courts would differ\nently appraise two situations: (1) cases involving a sub\nstantially local plaintiff, like Nicastro, injured by the\nactivity of a defendant engaged in interstate or interna\ntional trade; and (2) cases in which the defendant is a\nnatural or legal person whose economic activities and legal\ninvolvements are largely home-based, i.e., entities without\ndesigns to gain substantial revenue from sales in distant\nmarkets.
