He was sentenced to death on two of\nthe counts and life imprisonment on the remaining three.\nAfter his convictions and sentences were affirmed on di-\nrect appeal, Gray filed a petition for state postconviction\nrelief. The Virginia Supreme Court granted the petition in\npart, ordering vacatur of one of the convictions for which\nGray was sentenced to life imprisonment. Gray v. Warden\nof Sussex I State Prison, 281 Va. 303, 304, 707 S. E. 2d\n275, 280\u2013281 (2011). But the court denied relief in all\nother respects, ibid., and the Commonwealth of Virginia\nset a date of execution of June 16, 2011.\n   Meanwhile, Gray applied for appointment of counsel in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia, where he planned to file a petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. On June 14, 2011,\nthe District Court appointed counsel for Gray and stayed\nthe execution of his death sentence for 90 days pursuant to\n\u00a72251(a)(3). In a separate order issued the same day, the\nDistrict Court set a briefing schedule requiring Gray to\nfile his federal habeas petition within 45 days, no later\nthan July 29.

KELLY\n\n                          Opinion in Chambers\n\ntrict Court extended Gray\u2019s deadline for filing a habeas\npetition to August 29.\n   On July 25, Gray filed with this Court a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, seeking review of the decision of the\nVirginia Supreme Court. He claimed that the procedures\nfollowed by that court in adjudicating his postconviction\nclaims violated his federal constitutional rights to due\nprocess and equal protection of the laws. Gray then asked\nthe District Court to stay its June 29 scheduling order\npending this Court\u2019s disposition of his petition for certio-\nrari to the Virginia Supreme Court. After the District Court\ndenied the request, Gray did not seek a stay from the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, but rather filed an\napplication for a stay with me as Circuit Justice.\n   Gray\u2019s application accompanies his petition for certio-\nrari to the Virginia Supreme Court, but does not seek a stay\nof that court\u2019s judgment. Nor does his application seek a\nstay of his date of execution, which has not been reset.\nHis application instead requests only a stay of the District\nCourt\u2019s order requiring him to file a federal habeas peti-\ntion by August 29.*\n   Although Gray\u2019s application invokes the familiar stand-\nard for securing a stay of a judgment subject to this\nCourt\u2019s review, see Application for Stay 4 (citing Barefoot\nv. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 895 (1983)), that standard is\ninapplicable here because Gray does not seek a stay of\nsuch a judgment.

A stay of\nthat order would therefore serve only to restore the original deadline\nof July 29. The substance of Gray\u2019s application makes clear, however,\nthat the relief he actually seeks is a stay of the District Court\u2019s briefing\nschedule in its entirety until this Court acts on his petition for a writ of\ncertiorari to the Virginia Supreme Court.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.
