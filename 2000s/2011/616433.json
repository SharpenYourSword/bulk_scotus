Decided October 31, 2011\n\n\n   The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   Today the Court rejects an opportunity to provide clarity\nto an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles. A\nsharply divided Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has\ndeclared unconstitutional a private association\u2019s efforts\nto memorialize slain police officers with white roadside\ncrosses, holding that the crosses convey to a reasonable\nobserver that the State of Utah is endorsing Christianity.\nThe Tenth Circuit\u2019s opinion is one of the latest in a long\nline of \u201c \u2018religious display\u2019 \u201d decisions that, because of this\nCourt\u2019s nebulous Establishment Clause analyses, turn on\nlittle more than \u201cjudicial predilections.\u201d See Van Orden v.\nPerry, 545 U. S. 677, 696, 697 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concur\u00ad\nring). Because our jurisprudence has confounded the\nlower courts and rendered the constitutionality of displays\nof religious imagery on government property anyone\u2019s\nguess, I would grant certiorari.\n                            I\n  The Utah Highway Patrol Association (Association) is a\nprivate organization dedicated to supporting Utah High\u00ad\n2        UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN\n                    ATHEISTS, INC.                           \n\n                  THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\nway Patrol officers and their families.1 In 1998, the Asso\u00ad\nciation began commemorating officers who died in the line\nof duty by placing memorials, in the form of 12- by 6-foot\nwhite crosses, at or near locations where the officers were\nkilled. The fallen officer\u2019s name, rank, and badge number\nare emblazoned across the full length of the horizontal\nbeam of each memorial. The vertical beam bears the\nsymbol of the Utah Highway Patrol, the year of the of\u00ad\nficer\u2019s death, and a plaque displaying the officer\u2019s picture,\nhis biographical information, and details of his death. To\ndate, the Association has erected 13 cross memorials.\n   The Association chose the cross because it believed that\ncrosses are used both generally in cemeteries to commem\u00ad\norate the dead and specifically by uniformed services to\nmemorialize those who died in the line of duty. The Asso\u00ad\nciation also believed that only the cross effectively and\nsimultaneously conveyed the messages of death, honor,\nremembrance, gratitude, sacrifice, and safety that the Asso\u00ad\nciation wished to communicate to the public. Surviving\nfamily members of the fallen officers approved each\nmemorial, and no family ever requested that the Associa\u00ad\ntion use a symbol other than the cross.\n   The private Association designed, funded, owns, and\nmaintains the memorials. To ensure that the memorials\nwould be visible to the public, safe to view, and near the\nspot of the officers\u2019 deaths, the Association requested and\nreceived permission from the State of Utah to erect some\nof the memorials on roadside public rights-of-way, at rest\nareas, and on the lawn of the Utah Highway Patrol office.\nIn the permit, the State expressed that it \u201cneither ap\u00ad\nproves or disapproves the memorial marker.\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 3, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respondents, American Atheists, Inc., and some of its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 These cases were decided on a motion for summary judgment.\n\nThese facts are undisputed.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nmembers, sued several state officials, alleging that the\nState violated the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment, because most of the crosses were on state property\nand all of the crosses bore the Utah Highway Patrol\u2019s\nsymbol. The Association, a petitioner along with the state\nofficials in this Court, intervened to defend the memorials.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\npetitioners.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. As an initial\nmatter, the panel noted that this Court remains \u201csharply\ndivided on the standard governing Establishment Clause\ncases.\u201d American Atheists, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F. 3d 1145,\n1156 (2010). The panel therefore looked to Circuit prece\u00ad\ndent to determine the applicable standard and then ap\u00ad\nplied the so-called \u201cLemon/endorsement test,\u201d which asks\nwhether the challenged governmental practice has the\nactual purpose of endorsing religion or whether it has that\neffect from the perspective of a \u201creasonable observer.\u201d Id.,\nat 1157; see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Lib-\nerties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S.\n573, 592\u2013594 (1989) (modifying the three-pronged test of\nLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), which considered\nwhether a government action has a secular purpose, has\nthe primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or\nfosters an excessive entanglement between government\nand religion). The court concluded that, even though the\ncross memorials had a secular purpose, they would none\u00ad\ntheless \u201cconvey to a reasonable observer that the state of\nUtah is endorsing Christianity.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1160. This\nwas so, the court concluded, because a cross is \u201cthe\npreeminent symbol of Christianity,\u201d and the crosses stood\nalone, on public land, bearing the Utah Highway Patrol\u2019s\nemblem. Ibid. According to the panel, none of the other\n\u201ccontextualizing facts\u201d sufficiently reduced the memorials\u2019\nmessage of religious endorsement. Id., at 1161.\n4       UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN\n                   ATHEISTS, INC.                           \n\n                 THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n   The Tenth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four\njudges dissenting. The dissenters criticized the panel for\npresuming that the crosses were unconstitutional and\nthen asking whether contextual factors were sufficient to\nrebut that presumption. Instead, the dissenters argued,\nthe panel should have considered whether the crosses\namounted to an endorsement of religion in the first place\nin light of their physical characteristics, location near the\nsite of the officer\u2019s death, commemorative purpose, selec\u00ad\ntion by surviving family members, and disavowal by the\nState. 637 F. 3d 1095, 1103\u20131105 (2010) (opinion of Kelly,\nJ.). The dissenters also criticized the panel\u2019s \u201cunreasona\u00ad\nble \u2018reasonable observer,\u2019 \u201d id., at 1104, describing him as\n\u201cbiased, replete with foibles, and prone to mistake,\u201d id.,\nat 1108 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Noting that the court\n\u201ccontinue[d] to apply (or misapply) a reasonable observer/\nendorsement test that has come under much recent\nscrutiny,\u201d the dissenters emphasized that the panel\u2019s\ndecision was \u201cworthy of review.\u201d Id., at 1109\u20131110 (same).\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the Tenth Circuit relied on its own\nprecedent, rather than on any of this Court\u2019s cases, when\nit selected the Lemon/endorsement test as its governing\nanalysis. Our jurisprudence provides no principled ba-\nsis by which a lower court could discern whether\nLemon/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in\nEstablishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply\nignored the Lemon or Lemon/endorsement formulations.\nSee, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002);\nGood News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98\n(2001); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Other\ndecisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test\nis useful, but not binding. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.\n668, 679 (1984) (despite Lemon\u2019s usefulness, we are \u201cun\u00ad\nwillin[g] to be confined to any single test or criterion in\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

S. 734, 741\n(1973) (Lemon provides \u201cno more than helpful signposts\u201d).\nMost recently, in Van Orden, 545 U. S. 677, a majority of\nthe Court declined to apply the Lemon/endorsement test in\nupholding a Ten Commandments monument located on\nthe grounds of a state capitol.2 Yet in another case decid\u00ad\ned the same day, McCreary County v. American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 859\u2013866 (2005), the\nCourt selected the Lemon/endorsement test with nary a\nword of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten\nCommandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional.\nSee also Van Orden, supra, at 692 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(\u201cI join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think\nit accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause\njurisprudence\u2014or at least the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence we currently apply some of the time\u201d).\nThus, the Lemon/endorsement test continues to \u201cstal[k]\nour Establishment Clause jurisprudence\u201d like \u201csome ghoul\nin a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its\ngrave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed\nand buried.\u201d Lamb\u2019s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union\nFree School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398 (1993) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Since Van Orden and McCreary, lower courts have\nunderstandably expressed confusion. See American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky. v. Mercer Cty., 432 F. 3d 624, 636\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In  Van Orden, a plurality determined that the nature of a govern\u00ad\nment display and our Nation\u2019s historical traditions should control. 545\nU. S., at 686; see also ibid. (\u201cWhatever may be the fate of the Lemon\ntest in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we\nthink it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that\nTexas has erected\u201d). In a concurring opinion, JUSTICE BREYER consid\u00ad\nered the \u201cbasic purposes of the First Amendment\u2019s Religion Clauses\nthemselves\u201d rather than \u201ca literal application of any particular test.\u201d\nId., at 703\u2013704 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also id., at 700\n(\u201c[I]n [difficult borderline] cases, I see no test-related substitute for the\nexercise of legal judgment\u201d).\n6           UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v.

Some lower courts have continued to apply the\nLemon/endorsement test.4 Others have followed Van\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 See also Green v. Haskell Cty.

In Myers\nv. Loudoun Cty.

And, in Green v. Haskell Cty. Bd. of\nComm\u2019rs, 568 F. 3d 784, 796\u2013797 (2009), the Tenth Circuit\napplied the Lemon/endorsement test to hold unconstitu\u00ad\ntional a Ten Commandments monument located on the\ngrounds of a public building and surrounded by other\nsecular monuments, facts materially indistinguishable\nfrom those in Van Orden.\n   Respondents further suggest that any variation among\nthe Circuits concerning the Establishment Clause stand\u00ad\nard for displays of religious imagery is merely academic,\nfor much like the traditional Lemon/endorsement inquiry,\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Indeed, the Tenth Circuit stated\nbelow that its observer, although not \u201comniscient,\u201d would\n\u201cknow far more than most actual members of a given\ncommunity,\u201d and then unhelpfully concluded that \u201c[h]ow\nmuch information we will impute to a reasonable observer\nis unclear.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But even assuming that courts could employ\nobservers of similar insight and eyesight, it is \u201cunrealistic\nto expect different judges . . . to reach consistent answers\nas to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the\nultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would\nthink.\u201d Pinette, supra, at 769, n. 3.\n                               IV\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that despite other cases\nholding that the combination of a Latin cross and a public\ninsignia on public property does not convey a message of\nreligious endorsement, see Murray, supra; Weinbaum,\nsupra, the Tenth Circuit held otherwise. And, of course,\nthe Tenth Circuit divided over what, exactly, a reasonable\nobserver would think about the Association\u2019s memorial\ncross program.\n  First, the members of the court disagreed as to what a\nreasonable observer would see. According to the panel,\nbecause the observer would be \u201cdriving by one of the me\u00ad\nmorial crosses at 55-plus miles per hour,\u201d he would not see\nthe fallen officer\u2019s biographical information, but he would\nsee that the \u201ccross conspicuously bears the imprimatur of\na state entity . . . and is found primarily on public land.\u201d\n616 F. 3d, at 1160. According to the dissenters, on the\nother hand, if the traveling observer could see the police\ninsignia on the cross, he should also see the much larger\nname, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer embla\u00ad\nzoned above it. 637 F. 3d, at 1108\u20131109 (opinion of Gor\u00ad\nsuch, J.); id., at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.).

Id., at\n1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).\n   Next, the members of the court disagreed about what a\nreasonable observer would feel. The panel worried that\nthe use of a Christian symbol to memorialize fallen officers\nwould cause the observer to think the Utah Highway\nPatrol and Christianity had \u201csome connection,\u201d leading\nhim to \u201cfear that Christians are likely to receive preferen\u00ad\ntial treatment from the [patrol]\u2014both in their hiring\npractices and, more generally, in the treatment that peo\u00ad\nple may expect to receive on Utah\u2019s highways.\u201d 616 F. 3d,\nat 1160. The dissenters\u2019 reasonable observer, however,\nwould not take such a \u201cparanoid,\u201d \u201cconspiratorial view of\nlife,\u201d \u201cconjur[ing] up fears of religious discrimination\u201d by a\n\u201c \u2018Christian police,\u2019 \u201d especially in light of the more plausi\u00ad\nble explanation that the crosses were simply memorials.\n637 F. 3d, at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The panel also\nemphasized that the \u201cmassive size\u201d of these crosses would\nheighten the reasonable observer\u2019s fear of discrimination\nand proselytization, unlike the \u201cmore humble spirit of\nsmall roadside crosses.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1161\u20131162. The\ndissenters, by contrast, insisted that the size of the crosses\nwas necessary to ensure that the reasonable observer\nwould \u201ctake notice of the display and absorb its message\u201d\nof remembrance and to ensure that the crosses could\ncontain all of the secular facts necessary to assuage the\nreasonable observer\u2019s fears. 637 F. 3d, at 1105\u20131106\n(opinion of Kelly, J.).\n   Finally, the members of the court disputed what the\nreasonable observer would know. The panel acknowledged\nthat the reasonable observer would recognize that the\ncrosses commemorated death, but he would see only that\nthe symbol \u201cmemorializes the death of a Christian.\u201d 616\nF. 3d, at 1161.

But to be fair to the\nTenth Circuit, it is our Establishment Clause jurispru\u00ad\ndence that invites this type of erratic, selective analysis of\nthe constitutionality of religious imagery on government\nproperty.

The Court need not grant certiorari on that question, and\nthe state petitioners only ask this Court to resolve the viability and\napplication of the endorsement test.\n   11 Respondents argue that this suit would be a poor vehicle to explore\n\nthe contours of a coercion-based Establishment Clause test because the\nState has raised the specter of a preference for one religion over others.\nIn this regard, respondents point out that the State took the position\nbefore the lower courts that it would not be able to approve the Associa\u00ad\ntion\u2019s memorials \u201c \u2018in the same manner\u2019 \u201d if the Association, as it indi\u00ad\ncated it would, allowed an officer\u2019s family to request a symbol other\nthan a cross. Brief in Opposition 3\u20134, 31.\n   Because no such situation has ever arisen, and because the State has\nonly indicated it could not approve a different marker in the same\nmanner as the roadside crosses, respondents distort the record by\nclaiming that the State has put families to the choice of \u201ca Latin cross\nor no roadside memorial at all.\u201d Id., at 4. Moreover, it is undisputed\nthat the State\u2019s position stemmed from its belief that \u201cif [the Associa\u00ad\ntion] were to change the shape of the memorial to reflect the religious\nsymbol of the fallen trooper, rather than the shape of the cross, the\nmemorial would no longer be a secular shape recognized as a symbol of\ndeath.\u201d App. to Brief in Opposition 9a\u201315a (emphasis added). That\nposition is entirely consistent with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that\nthe purposes of the State and Association in permitting and implement\u00ad\ning the memorial program were secular. In any event, that the State\nand Association, both defending the memorial program\u2019s constitutional\u00ad\nity, took conflicting positions about whether it was impermissibly\nreligious to use only crosses, or impermissibly religious to use other\nsymbols reflective of the deceased\u2019s religious preference, only highlights\nthe confusion surrounding the Establishment Clause\u2019s requirements.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The fallen officer\u2019s name, rank, and badge number\nare emblazoned across the full length of the horizontal\nbeam of each memorial. The vertical beam bears the\nsymbol of the Utah Highway Patrol, the year of the of\u00ad\nficer\u2019s death, and a plaque displaying the officer\u2019s picture,\nhis biographical information, and details of his death. To\ndate, the Association has erected 13 cross memorials.\n   The Association chose the cross because it believed that\ncrosses are used both generally in cemeteries to commem\u00ad\norate the dead and specifically by uniformed services to\nmemorialize those who died in the line of duty. The Asso\u00ad\nciation also believed that only the cross effectively and\nsimultaneously conveyed the messages of death, honor,\nremembrance, gratitude, sacrifice, and safety that the Asso\u00ad\nciation wished to communicate to the public. Surviving\nfamily members of the fallen officers approved each\nmemorial, and no family ever requested that the Associa\u00ad\ntion use a symbol other than the cross.\n   The private Association designed, funded, owns, and\nmaintains the memorials. To ensure that the memorials\nwould be visible to the public, safe to view, and near the\nspot of the officers\u2019 deaths, the Association requested and\nreceived permission from the State of Utah to erect some\nof the memorials on roadside public rights-of-way, at rest\nareas, and on the lawn of the Utah Highway Patrol office.\nIn the permit, the State expressed that it \u201cneither ap\u00ad\nproves or disapproves the memorial marker.\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 3, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respondents, American Atheists, Inc., and some of its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 These cases were decided on a motion for summary judgment.\n\nThese facts are undisputed.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Association, a petitioner along with the state\nofficials in this Court, intervened to defend the memorials.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\npetitioners.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. As an initial\nmatter, the panel noted that this Court remains \u201csharply\ndivided on the standard governing Establishment Clause\ncases.\u201d American Atheists, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F. 3d 1145,\n1156 (2010). The panel therefore looked to Circuit prece\u00ad\ndent to determine the applicable standard and then ap\u00ad\nplied the so-called \u201cLemon/endorsement test,\u201d which asks\nwhether the challenged governmental practice has the\nactual purpose of endorsing religion or whether it has that\neffect from the perspective of a \u201creasonable observer.\u201d Id.,\nat 1157; see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Lib-\nerties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S.\n573, 592\u2013594 (1989) (modifying the three-pronged test of\nLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), which considered\nwhether a government action has a secular purpose, has\nthe primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or\nfosters an excessive entanglement between government\nand religion). The court concluded that, even though the\ncross memorials had a secular purpose, they would none\u00ad\ntheless \u201cconvey to a reasonable observer that the state of\nUtah is endorsing Christianity.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1160. This\nwas so, the court concluded, because a cross is \u201cthe\npreeminent symbol of Christianity,\u201d and the crosses stood\nalone, on public land, bearing the Utah Highway Patrol\u2019s\nemblem.

The dissenters criticized the panel for\npresuming that the crosses were unconstitutional and\nthen asking whether contextual factors were sufficient to\nrebut that presumption. Instead, the dissenters argued,\nthe panel should have considered whether the crosses\namounted to an endorsement of religion in the first place\nin light of their physical characteristics, location near the\nsite of the officer\u2019s death, commemorative purpose, selec\u00ad\ntion by surviving family members, and disavowal by the\nState. 637 F. 3d 1095, 1103\u20131105 (2010) (opinion of Kelly,\nJ.).

Noting that the court\n\u201ccontinue[d] to apply (or misapply) a reasonable observer/\nendorsement test that has come under much recent\nscrutiny,\u201d the dissenters emphasized that the panel\u2019s\ndecision was \u201cworthy of review.\u201d Id., at 1109\u20131110 (same).\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the Tenth Circuit relied on its own\nprecedent, rather than on any of this Court\u2019s cases, when\nit selected the Lemon/endorsement test as its governing\nanalysis. Our jurisprudence provides no principled ba-\nsis by which a lower court could discern whether\nLemon/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in\nEstablishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply\nignored the Lemon or Lemon/endorsement formulations.\nSee, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002);\nGood News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98\n(2001); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Other\ndecisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test\nis useful, but not binding. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.

S. 677, a majority of\nthe Court declined to apply the Lemon/endorsement test in\nupholding a Ten Commandments monument located on\nthe grounds of a state capitol.2 Yet in another case decid\u00ad\ned the same day, McCreary County v. American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 859\u2013866 (2005), the\nCourt selected the Lemon/endorsement test with nary a\nword of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten\nCommandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional.\nSee also Van Orden, supra, at 692 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(\u201cI join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think\nit accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause\njurisprudence\u2014or at least the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence we currently apply some of the time\u201d).\nThus, the Lemon/endorsement test continues to \u201cstal[k]\nour Establishment Clause jurisprudence\u201d like \u201csome ghoul\nin a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its\ngrave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed\nand buried.\u201d Lamb\u2019s Chapel v.

Indeed, the Tenth Circuit stated\nbelow that its observer, although not \u201comniscient,\u201d would\n\u201cknow far more than most actual members of a given\ncommunity,\u201d and then unhelpfully concluded that \u201c[h]ow\nmuch information we will impute to a reasonable observer\nis unclear.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But even assuming that courts could employ\nobservers of similar insight and eyesight, it is \u201cunrealistic\nto expect different judges . . . to reach consistent answers\nas to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the\nultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would\nthink.\u201d Pinette, supra, at 769, n. 3.\n                               IV\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that despite other cases\nholding that the combination of a Latin cross and a public\ninsignia on public property does not convey a message of\nreligious endorsement, see Murray, supra; Weinbaum,\nsupra, the Tenth Circuit held otherwise. And, of course,\nthe Tenth Circuit divided over what, exactly, a reasonable\nobserver would think about the Association\u2019s memorial\ncross program.\n  First, the members of the court disagreed as to what a\nreasonable observer would see. According to the panel,\nbecause the observer would be \u201cdriving by one of the me\u00ad\nmorial crosses at 55-plus miles per hour,\u201d he would not see\nthe fallen officer\u2019s biographical information, but he would\nsee that the \u201ccross conspicuously bears the imprimatur of\na state entity . . . and is found primarily on public land.\u201d\n616 F. 3d, at 1160. According to the dissenters, on the\nother hand, if the traveling observer could see the police\ninsignia on the cross, he should also see the much larger\nname, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer embla\u00ad\nzoned above it. 637 F. 3d, at 1108\u20131109 (opinion of Gor\u00ad\nsuch, J.); id., at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.).

Id., at\n1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).\n   Next, the members of the court disagreed about what a\nreasonable observer would feel. The panel worried that\nthe use of a Christian symbol to memorialize fallen officers\nwould cause the observer to think the Utah Highway\nPatrol and Christianity had \u201csome connection,\u201d leading\nhim to \u201cfear that Christians are likely to receive preferen\u00ad\ntial treatment from the [patrol]\u2014both in their hiring\npractices and, more generally, in the treatment that peo\u00ad\nple may expect to receive on Utah\u2019s highways.\u201d 616 F. 3d,\nat 1160. The dissenters\u2019 reasonable observer, however,\nwould not take such a \u201cparanoid,\u201d \u201cconspiratorial view of\nlife,\u201d \u201cconjur[ing] up fears of religious discrimination\u201d by a\n\u201c \u2018Christian police,\u2019 \u201d especially in light of the more plausi\u00ad\nble explanation that the crosses were simply memorials.\n637 F. 3d, at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The panel also\nemphasized that the \u201cmassive size\u201d of these crosses would\nheighten the reasonable observer\u2019s fear of discrimination\nand proselytization, unlike the \u201cmore humble spirit of\nsmall roadside crosses.\u201d 616 F. 3d, at 1161\u20131162. The\ndissenters, by contrast, insisted that the size of the crosses\nwas necessary to ensure that the reasonable observer\nwould \u201ctake notice of the display and absorb its message\u201d\nof remembrance and to ensure that the crosses could\ncontain all of the secular facts necessary to assuage the\nreasonable observer\u2019s fears. 637 F. 3d, at 1105\u20131106\n(opinion of Kelly, J.).\n   Finally, the members of the court disputed what the\nreasonable observer would know. The panel acknowledged\nthat the reasonable observer would recognize that the\ncrosses commemorated death, but he would see only that\nthe symbol \u201cmemorializes the death of a Christian.\u201d 616\nF. 3d, at 1161.

Conversely, the dissenters\u2019 reasonable\nobserver would have known that the crosses were chosen\nby the fallen officer\u2019s family and erected by a private group\nwithout design approval from the State, and that most\nUtahns do not revere the cross.8 637 F. 3d, at 1110 (opin\u00ad\nion of Gorsuch, J.); id., at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.).\n  To any truly \u201creasonable observer,\u201d these lines of disa\u00ad\ngreement may seem arbitrary at best. But to be fair to the\nTenth Circuit, it is our Establishment Clause jurispru\u00ad\ndence that invites this type of erratic, selective analysis of\nthe constitutionality of religious imagery on government\nproperty.

Moreover, it is undisputed\nthat the State\u2019s position stemmed from its belief that \u201cif [the Associa\u00ad\ntion] were to change the shape of the memorial to reflect the religious\nsymbol of the fallen trooper, rather than the shape of the cross, the\nmemorial would no longer be a secular shape recognized as a symbol of\ndeath.\u201d App. to Brief in Opposition 9a\u201315a (emphasis added). That\nposition is entirely consistent with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that\nthe purposes of the State and Association in permitting and implement\u00ad\ning the memorial program were secular. In any event, that the State\nand Association, both defending the memorial program\u2019s constitutional\u00ad\nity, took conflicting positions about whether it was impermissibly\nreligious to use only crosses, or impermissibly religious to use other\nsymbols reflective of the deceased\u2019s religious preference, only highlights\nthe confusion surrounding the Establishment Clause\u2019s requirements.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011) \n        19\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n                         *     *     * \n\n   Concurring in Allegheny, JUSTICE O\u2019CONNOR wrote that\n\u201cthe courts have made case-specific examinations\u201d of\ngovernment actions in order to avoid \u201csweep[ing] away all\ngovernment recognition and acknowledgment of the role of\nreligion in the lives of our citizens.\u201d 492 U. S., at 623\n(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nBut that is precisely the effect of this Court\u2019s repeated\nfailure to apply the correct standard\u2014or at least a clear,\nworkable standard\u2014for adjudicating challenges to gov\u00ad\nernment action under the Establishment Clause. Gov\u00ad\nernment officials, not to mention everyday people who\nwish to celebrate or commemorate an occasion with a\npublic display that contains religious elements, cannot\nafford to guess whether a federal court, applying our\n\u201cjurisprudence of minutiae,\u201d id., at 674 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part),\nwill conclude that a given display is sufficiently secular.\nThe safer course will be to \u201cpurge from the public sphere\nall that in any way partakes of the religious.\u201d Van Orden,\n545 U. S., at 699 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\nBecause \u201cthe Establishment Clause does not compel\u201d that\nresult, ibid., I would grant certiorari.\n</pre>",
