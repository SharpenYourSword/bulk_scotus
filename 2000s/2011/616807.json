ARCHIE DIXON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 10\u20131540. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from\na federal court \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on\nthe claim being presented in federal court was so lacking\nin justification that there was an error well understood\nand comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility\nfor fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such\ngrievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of\nrespondent Archie Dixon\u2019s murder conviction. Because it\nis not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all,\nmuch less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist\ncould agree with that court\u2019s decision, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudgment must be reversed.\n                         *    *    *\n   Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer\nin order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,\ntied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling\nHammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on\ntop of him. Dixon then used Hammer\u2019s birth certificate\nand social security card to obtain a state identification\ncard in Hammer\u2019s name. After using that identification\ncard to establish ownership of Hammer\u2019s car, Dixon sold\nthe vehicle for $2,800.\n   Hammer\u2019s mother reported her son missing the day\nafter his murder. While investigating Hammer\u2019s disap\u00ad\n2                     BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three\nof which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police\ndetective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is\nundisputed that this was a chance encounter\u2014Dixon was\napparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own\ncar, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The\ndetective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then\nasked to talk to him about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. See\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Dixon declined\nto answer questions without his lawyer present and left\nthe station.\n   As their investigation continued, police determined that\nDixon had sold Hammer\u2019s car and forged Hammer\u2019s signa\u00ad\nture when cashing the check he received in that sale.\nPolice arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of No\u00ad\nvember 9. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermit\u00ad\ntently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking\nwith him for about 45 minutes total. Prior to the interro\u00ad\ngation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon\nwith Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again\nrefuse to speak with them.\n   Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification\ncard in Hammer\u2019s name and signing Hammer\u2019s name on\nthe check, but said that Hammer had given him permis\u00ad\nsion to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where\nHammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might\nhave left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the\nplausibility of Dixon\u2019s tale and told Dixon that Tim\nHoffner was providing them more useful information. At\none point a detective told Dixon that \u201cnow is the time to\nsay\u201d whether he had any involvement in Hammer\u2019s disap\u00ad\npearance because \u201cif Tim starts cutting a deal over there,\nthis is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on\nit is the only one that\u2019s gonna get on.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew any\u00ad\nthing about Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Hoffner had not\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntold him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything\nhe knew and that he had \u201c[n]othing whatsoever\u201d to do\nwith Hammer\u2019s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approxi\u00ad\nmately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the\ndetectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where\nhe was booked on a forgery charge.\n  The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer\u2019s\ngrave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that\nHammer was buried there. After concluding their inter\u00ad\nview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon\ntransported back to the police station.\n  Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.\nPrior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had\nheard the police had found a body and asked whether\nHoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that\nHoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, \u201cI talked to\nmy attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.\u201d State\nv. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20131585, 805\nN. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda\nrights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke\nwith Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,\nnow using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his\nMiranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted\nto murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion\u2019s\nshare of the blame on Hoffner.\n  At Dixon\u2019s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both\nDixon\u2019s initial confession to forgery and his later confes\u00ad\nsion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.\nThe State did not dispute that Dixon\u2019s forgery confession\nwas properly suppressed, but argued that the murder\nconfession was admissible because Dixon had received\nMiranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio\nCourt of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon\u2019s murder\nconfession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict\u00ad\ned of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen\u00ad\ntenced to death.\n4                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon\u2019s convictions\nand sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon\u2019s\nmurder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that\nDixon\u2019s confession to murder after receiving Miranda\nwarnings was admissible because that confession and his\nprior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.\nState v. Dixon, supra, at 332\u2013334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050\u2013\n1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (\u201cWe hold today that a\nsuspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer\u00ad\ncive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his\nrights and confessing after he has been given the requisite\nMiranda warnings\u201d).\n   Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 in the U. S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that\nthe state court decisions allowing the admission of his\nmurder confession contravened clearly established federal\nlaw. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel\nof the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d\n553 (2010).\n   The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of\nhabeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law,\u201d as set forth in this\nCourt\u2019s holdings, or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable de\u00ad\ntermination of the facts\u201d in light of the state court record.\n\u00a72254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nThe Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision contained three such egregious errors.\n   First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci\u00ad\nsion itself clearly established that police could not speak to\nDixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had\nrefused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is\nplainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in\ncustody during his chance encounter with police on No\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nvember 4. And this Court has \u201cnever held that a person\ncan invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context\nother than \u2018custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin,\n501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisi-\nana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (\u201cIf the\ndefendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge\u00ad\nny] do not apply\u201d).\n  Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the\nFifth Amendment by urging Dixon to \u201ccut a deal\u201d before\nhis accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no\nprecedent of this Court\u2014or any court\u2014holding that this\ncommon police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,\nsupra, at 317 (\u201c[T]he Court has refused to find that a\ndefendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his\ncodefendant has turned State\u2019s evidence, does so involun\u00ad\ntarily\u201d). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much\nless clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect\nto confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit\nhad no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s contrary con\u00ad\n\nclusion that Dixon\u2019s confession was voluntary \u201cwas based on an unrea\u00ad\nsonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,\nhowever, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed\nwith the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of\nDixon\u2019s confession as voluntary, and this Court\u2019s cases make clear that\n\u201cthe ultimate issue of \u2018voluntariness\u2019 is a legal question.\u201d Miller v.\nFenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\nU. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the\nSixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica\u00ad\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the \u201cvirtually continu\u00ad\nous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge\nof consciousness\u201d who was in a hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and who\n6                          BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s precedent in\nElstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received\nMiranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took\nhim into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he\nhad received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con\u00ad\nfessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the\nlater, warned confession was admissible because \u201cthere is\nno warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus\u00ad\npect\u2019s initial inculpatory statement, though technically\nin violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant\ninquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement\nwas also voluntarily made.\u201d 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote\nomitted).\n   As the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion explained, the\ncircumstances surrounding Dixon\u2019s interrogations demon\u00ad\nstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon\u2019s\nfirst interrogation, he received several breaks, was given\nwater and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.\nHe freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer\u2019s\nname, even stating that the police were \u201cwelcome\u201d to that\ninformation, and he had no difficulty denying that he had\nanything to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. State v.\nDixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.\nPrior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic\u00ad\nited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and\nwanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.\nThen, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice\nreceived Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights\nform which stated that he was acting of his own free will.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cclearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated\u201d while in a \u201cdebilitat\u00ad\ned and helpless condition.\u201d Id., at 399\u2013401. There is simply nothing in\nthe facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon\u2019s state\u00ad\nments were involuntary.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon\u2019s first in-\nterrogation involved \u201can intentional Miranda violation.\u201d\nThe court concluded, however, that \u201cas in Elstad, the\nbreach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual\ncompulsion\u201d and thus there was no reason to suppress\nDixon\u2019s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,\n805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).\n  The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon\u2019s\nconfession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was\nthe product of a \u201cdeliberate question-first, warn-later\nstrategy.\u201d 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth\nCircuit relied heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in Missouri\nv. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em\u00ad\nployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda\nwarnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert\nuntil she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20\u00ad\nminute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her\nto repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604\u2013606, 616\n(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert\u2019s second\nconfession was inadmissible as evidence against her even\nthough it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali\u00ad\nty of the Court reasoned that \u201c[u]pon hearing warnings\nonly in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opin\u00ad\n\nion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon\u2019s peti\u00ad\ntion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nIt is thus an open question whether Seibert was \u201cclearly established\nFederal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a72254(d). See Smith v. Spisak\u00b8 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques\u00ad\ntion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable\napplication of\u201d Seibert. \u00a72254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab\u00ad\nlished law, Seibert\u2019s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Elstad.\n8                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ning a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a\ngenuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so\nbelieving once the police began to lead him over the same\nground again.\u201d 542 U. S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (de\u00ad\ntailing a \u201cseries of relevant facts that bear on whether\nMiranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective\nenough to accomplish their object\u201d). JUSTICE KENNEDY\nconcurred in the judgment, noting he \u201cwould apply a\nnarrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in\nwhich the two-step interrogation technique was used in a\ncalculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\u201d Id.,\nat 622.\n   In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the\ntype that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the\nMiranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the sus\u00ad\npect\u2019s first, unwarned interrogation left \u201clittle, if anything,\nof incriminating potential left unsaid,\u201d making it \u201cunnatu\u00ad\nral\u201d not to \u201crepeat at the second stage what had been said\nbefore.\u201d 542 U. S., at 616\u2013617 (plurality opinion). But in\nthis case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first,\nunwarned interrogation that he had \u201c[n]othing whatso\u00ad\never\u201d to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern\nhere that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then\nled him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because\nthere was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon\ncontradicted his prior unwarned statements when he\nconfessed to Hammer\u2019s murder. Nor is there any evidence\nthat police used Dixon\u2019s earlier admission to forgery to\ninduce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon de\u00ad\nclared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer\nbefore the second interrogation session even began. As the\nOhio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was\nsimply \u201cno nexus\u201d between Dixon\u2019s unwarned admission to\nforgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101\nOhio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1051.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the\nMiranda warnings did not \u201ceffectively advise the suspect\nthat he had a real choice about giving an admissible\nstatement\u201d because the unwarned and warned interroga\u00ad\ntions blended into one \u201ccontinuum.\u201d 542 U. S., at 612, 617.\nGiven all the circumstances of this case, that is not so\nhere. Four hours passed between Dixon\u2019s unwarned inter\u00ad\nrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which\ntime he traveled from the police station to a separate jail\nand back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and\nlearned that police were talking to his accomplice and\nhad found Hammer\u2019s body. Things had changed. Under\nSeibert, this significant break in time and dramatic\nchange in circumstances created \u201ca new and distinct expe\u00ad\nrience,\u201d ensuring that Dixon\u2019s prior, unwarned interroga\u00ad\ntion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda\nwarnings he received before confessing to Hammer\u2019s mur\u00ad\nder. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cFor example, a substantial\nbreak in time and circumstances between the prewarning\nstatement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most\ncircumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the\ntwo contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has\ntaken a new turn\u201d).4\n   The admission of Dixon\u2019s murder confession was con\u00ad\nsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents: Dixon received Mi-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Sixth Circuit also concluded that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court\n\nerroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his\nconfession was coerced.\u201d Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But\nthe Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that \u201cthe state carries the burden\nof proving voluntariness.\u201d State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 332,\n2004\u2013Ohio\u20131585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court\u2019s opinion\ndiscusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma\u00ad\ntive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted\nthe burden onto Dixon.\n10                    BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nranda warnings before confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder;\nthe effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by\nthe sort of \u201ctwo-step interrogation technique\u201d condemned\nin Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon\u2019s\nstatements was the product of actual coercion. That does\nnot excuse the detectives\u2019 decision not to give Dixon Mi-\nranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the\nOhio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap\u00ad\npropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon\u2019s forgery confession\nand the attendant statements given without the benefit of\nMiranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court\nrequired Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without\nauthority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State\u2019s\nhighest court.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n",

ARCHIE DIXON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 10\u20131540. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct, a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from\na federal court \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on\nthe claim being presented in federal court was so lacking\nin justification that there was an error well understood\nand comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility\nfor fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such\ngrievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of\nrespondent Archie Dixon\u2019s murder conviction. Because it\nis not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all,\nmuch less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist\ncould agree with that court\u2019s decision, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudgment must be reversed.\n                         *    *    *\n   Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer\nin order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,\ntied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling\nHammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on\ntop of him. Dixon then used Hammer\u2019s birth certificate\nand social security card to obtain a state identification\ncard in Hammer\u2019s name. After using that identification\ncard to establish ownership of Hammer\u2019s car, Dixon sold\nthe vehicle for $2,800.\n   Hammer\u2019s mother reported her son missing the day\nafter his murder. While investigating Hammer\u2019s disap\u00ad\n2                     BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three\nof which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police\ndetective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is\nundisputed that this was a chance encounter\u2014Dixon was\napparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own\ncar, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The\ndetective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then\nasked to talk to him about Hammer\u2019s disappearance. See\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Dixon declined\nto answer questions without his lawyer present and left\nthe station.\n   As their investigation continued, police determined that\nDixon had sold Hammer\u2019s car and forged Hammer\u2019s signa\u00ad\nture when cashing the check he received in that sale.\nPolice arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of No\u00ad\nvember 9. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermit\u00ad\ntently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking\nwith him for about 45 minutes total. Prior to the interro\u00ad\ngation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon\nwith Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again\nrefuse to speak with them.\n   Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification\ncard in Hammer\u2019s name and signing Hammer\u2019s name on\nthe check, but said that Hammer had given him permis\u00ad\nsion to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where\nHammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might\nhave left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the\nplausibility of Dixon\u2019s tale and told Dixon that Tim\nHoffner was providing them more useful information. At\none point a detective told Dixon that \u201cnow is the time to\nsay\u201d whether he had any involvement in Hammer\u2019s disap\u00ad\npearance because \u201cif Tim starts cutting a deal over there,\nthis is kinda like, a bus leaving. The first one that gets on\nit is the only one that\u2019s gonna get on.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 183a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew any\u00ad\nthing about Hammer\u2019s disappearance, Hoffner had not\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntold him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything\nhe knew and that he had \u201c[n]othing whatsoever\u201d to do\nwith Hammer\u2019s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approxi\u00ad\nmately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the\ndetectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where\nhe was booked on a forgery charge.\n  The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer\u2019s\ngrave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that\nHammer was buried there. After concluding their inter\u00ad\nview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon\ntransported back to the police station.\n  Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.\nPrior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had\nheard the police had found a body and asked whether\nHoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that\nHoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, \u201cI talked to\nmy attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.\u201d State\nv. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716417/state-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20131585, 805\nN. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda\nrights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke\nwith Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,\nnow using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his\nMiranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted\nto murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion\u2019s\nshare of the blame on Hoffner.\n  At Dixon\u2019s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both\nDixon\u2019s initial confession to forgery and his later confes\u00ad\nsion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.\nThe State did not dispute that Dixon\u2019s forgery confession\nwas properly suppressed, but argued that the murder\nconfession was admissible because Dixon had received\nMiranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio\nCourt of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon\u2019s murder\nconfession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict\u00ad\ned of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen\u00ad\ntenced to death.\n4                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon\u2019s convictions\nand sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon\u2019s\nmurder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that\nDixon\u2019s confession to murder after receiving Miranda\nwarnings was admissible because that confession and his\nprior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.\nState v. Dixon, supra, at 332\u2013334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050\u2013\n1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (\u201cWe hold today that a\nsuspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer\u00ad\ncive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his\nrights and confessing after he has been given the requisite\nMiranda warnings\u201d).\n   Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 in the U. S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that\nthe state court decisions allowing the admission of his\nmurder confession contravened clearly established federal\nlaw. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel\nof the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d\n553 (2010).\n   The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of\nhabeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law,\u201d as set forth in this\nCourt\u2019s holdings, or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable de\u00ad\ntermination of the facts\u201d in light of the state court record.\n\u00a72254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nThe Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision contained three such egregious errors.\n   First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci\u00ad\nsion itself clearly established that police could not speak to\nDixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had\nrefused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is\nplainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in\ncustody during his chance encounter with police on No\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nvember 4. And this Court has \u201cnever held that a person\ncan invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context\nother than \u2018custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin,\n501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisi-\nana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (\u201cIf the\ndefendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge\u00ad\nny] do not apply\u201d).\n  Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the\nFifth Amendment by urging Dixon to \u201ccut a deal\u201d before\nhis accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no\nprecedent of this Court\u2014or any court\u2014holding that this\ncommon police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,\nsupra, at 317 (\u201c[T]he Court has refused to find that a\ndefendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his\ncodefendant has turned State\u2019s evidence, does so involun\u00ad\ntarily\u201d). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much\nless clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect\nto confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit\nhad no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s contrary con\u00ad\n\nclusion that Dixon\u2019s confession was voluntary \u201cwas based on an unrea\u00ad\nsonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,\nhowever, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed\nwith the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of\nDixon\u2019s confession as voluntary, and this Court\u2019s cases make clear that\n\u201cthe ultimate issue of \u2018voluntariness\u2019 is a legal question.\u201d Miller v.\nFenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\nU. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the\nSixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica\u00ad\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the \u201cvirtually continu\u00ad\nous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge\nof consciousness\u201d who was in a hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and who\n6                          BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s precedent in\nElstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received\nMiranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took\nhim into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he\nhad received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con\u00ad\nfessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the\nlater, warned confession was admissible because \u201cthere is\nno warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus\u00ad\npect\u2019s initial inculpatory statement, though technically\nin violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant\ninquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement\nwas also voluntarily made.\u201d 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote\nomitted).\n   As the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion explained, the\ncircumstances surrounding Dixon\u2019s interrogations demon\u00ad\nstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon\u2019s\nfirst interrogation, he received several breaks, was given\nwater and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.\nHe freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer\u2019s\nname, even stating that the police were \u201cwelcome\u201d to that\ninformation, and he had no difficulty denying that he had\nanything to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. State v.\nDixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.\nPrior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic\u00ad\nited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and\nwanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.\nThen, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice\nreceived Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights\nform which stated that he was acting of his own free will.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cclearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated\u201d while in a \u201cdebilitat\u00ad\ned and helpless condition.\u201d Id., at 399\u2013401. There is simply nothing in\nthe facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon\u2019s state\u00ad\nments were involuntary.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon\u2019s first in-\nterrogation involved \u201can intentional Miranda violation.\u201d\nThe court concluded, however, that \u201cas in Elstad, the\nbreach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual\ncompulsion\u201d and thus there was no reason to suppress\nDixon\u2019s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,\n805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).\n  The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon\u2019s\nconfession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was\nthe product of a \u201cdeliberate question-first, warn-later\nstrategy.\u201d 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth\nCircuit relied heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in Missouri\nv. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em\u00ad\nployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda\nwarnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert\nuntil she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20\u00ad\nminute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her\nto repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604\u2013606, 616\n(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert\u2019s second\nconfession was inadmissible as evidence against her even\nthough it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali\u00ad\nty of the Court reasoned that \u201c[u]pon hearing warnings\nonly in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opin\u00ad\n\nion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon\u2019s peti\u00ad\ntion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nIt is thus an open question whether Seibert was \u201cclearly established\nFederal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a72254(d). See Smith v. Spisak\u00b8 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques\u00ad\ntion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable\napplication of\u201d Seibert. \u00a72254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab\u00ad\nlished law, Seibert\u2019s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the\nOhio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Elstad.\n8                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ning a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a\ngenuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so\nbelieving once the police began to lead him over the same\nground again.\u201d 542 U. S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (de\u00ad\ntailing a \u201cseries of relevant facts that bear on whether\nMiranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective\nenough to accomplish their object\u201d). JUSTICE KENNEDY\nconcurred in the judgment, noting he \u201cwould apply a\nnarrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in\nwhich the two-step interrogation technique was used in a\ncalculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\u201d Id.,\nat 622.\n   In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the\ntype that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the\nMiranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the sus\u00ad\npect\u2019s first, unwarned interrogation left \u201clittle, if anything,\nof incriminating potential left unsaid,\u201d making it \u201cunnatu\u00ad\nral\u201d not to \u201crepeat at the second stage what had been said\nbefore.\u201d 542 U. S., at 616\u2013617 (plurality opinion). But in\nthis case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first,\nunwarned interrogation that he had \u201c[n]othing whatso\u00ad\never\u201d to do with Hammer\u2019s disappearance. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern\nhere that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then\nled him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because\nthere was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon\ncontradicted his prior unwarned statements when he\nconfessed to Hammer\u2019s murder. Nor is there any evidence\nthat police used Dixon\u2019s earlier admission to forgery to\ninduce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon de\u00ad\nclared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer\nbefore the second interrogation session even began. As the\nOhio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was\nsimply \u201cno nexus\u201d between Dixon\u2019s unwarned admission to\nforgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101\nOhio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1051.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the\nMiranda warnings did not \u201ceffectively advise the suspect\nthat he had a real choice about giving an admissible\nstatement\u201d because the unwarned and warned interroga\u00ad\ntions blended into one \u201ccontinuum.\u201d 542 U. S., at 612, 617.\nGiven all the circumstances of this case, that is not so\nhere. Four hours passed between Dixon\u2019s unwarned inter\u00ad\nrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which\ntime he traveled from the police station to a separate jail\nand back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and\nlearned that police were talking to his accomplice and\nhad found Hammer\u2019s body. Things had changed. Under\nSeibert, this significant break in time and dramatic\nchange in circumstances created \u201ca new and distinct expe\u00ad\nrience,\u201d ensuring that Dixon\u2019s prior, unwarned interroga\u00ad\ntion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda\nwarnings he received before confessing to Hammer\u2019s mur\u00ad\nder. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (\u201cFor example, a substantial\nbreak in time and circumstances between the prewarning\nstatement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most\ncircumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the\ntwo contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has\ntaken a new turn\u201d).4\n   The admission of Dixon\u2019s murder confession was con\u00ad\nsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents: Dixon received Mi-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Sixth Circuit also concluded that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court\n\nerroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his\nconfession was coerced.\u201d Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But\nthe Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that \u201cthe state carries the burden\nof proving voluntariness.\u201d State v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716417/state-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332,\n2004\u2013Ohio\u20131585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court\u2019s opinion\ndiscusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma\u00ad\ntive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted\nthe burden onto Dixon.\n10                    BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nranda warnings before confessing to Hammer\u2019s murder;\nthe effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by\nthe sort of \u201ctwo-step interrogation technique\u201d condemned\nin Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon\u2019s\nstatements was the product of actual coercion. That does\nnot excuse the detectives\u2019 decision not to give Dixon Mi-\nranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the\nOhio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap\u00ad\npropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon\u2019s forgery confession\nand the attendant statements given without the benefit of\nMiranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court\nrequired Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without\nauthority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State\u2019s\nhighest court.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
