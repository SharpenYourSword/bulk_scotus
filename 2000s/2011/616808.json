ROBERT COCCHI ET AL.\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT \n\n     COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA, FOURTH DISTRICT\n\n            No. 10\u20131521. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Agreements to arbitrate that fall within the scope and\ncoverage of the Federal Arbitration Act (Act), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71\net seq., must be enforced in state and federal courts. State\ncourts, then, \u201chave a prominent role to play as enforcers\nof agreements to arbitrate.\u201d Vaden v. Discover Bank, 556\nU. S. 49, 59 (2009).\n   The Act has been interpreted to require that if a dispute\npresents multiple claims, some arbitrable and some not,\nthe former must be sent to arbitration even if this will\nlead to piecemeal litigation. See Dean Witter Reynolds\nInc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 217 (1985). From this it fol-\nlows that state and federal courts must examine with care\nthe complaints seeking to invoke their jurisdiction in order\nto separate arbitrable from nonarbitrable claims. A court\nmay not issue a blanket refusal to compel arbitration\nmerely on the grounds that some of the claims could be\nresolved by the court without arbitration. See ibid.\n   In this case the Fourth District Court of Appeal of the\nState of Florida upheld a trial court\u2019s refusal to compel\narbitration of respondents\u2019 claims after determining that\ntwo of the four claims in a complaint were nonarbitrable.\nThough the matter is not altogether free from doubt, a fair\nreading of the opinion indicates a likelihood that the Court\nof Appeal failed to determine whether the other two claims\nin the complaint were arbitrable. For this reason, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case\nremanded for further proceedings.\n2                   KPMG LLP v. COCCHI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n\n                          *    *   * \n\n   Respondents are 19 individuals and entities who bought\nlimited partnership interests in one of three limited part-\nnerships, all known as the Rye Funds. The Rye Funds\nwere managed by Tremont Group Holding, Inc., and\nTremont Partners, Inc., both of which were audited by\nKPMG. The Rye Funds were invested with financier\nBernard Madoff and allegedly lost millions of dollars as a\nresult of a scheme to defraud. Respondents sued the Rye\nFunds, the Tremont defendants, and Tremont\u2019s auditing\nfirm, KPMG.\n   Only the claims against KPMG are at issue in this case.\nAgainst KPMG, respondents alleged four causes of action:\nnegligent misrepresentation; violation of the Florida De-\nceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), Fla.\nStat. 501.201 et seq. (2010); professional malpractice; and\naiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty. Respond-\nents\u2019 basic theory was that KPMG failed to use proper\nauditing standards with respect to the financial state-\nments of the partnerships. These improper audits, re-\nspondents contend, led to \u201csubstantial misrepresentations\u201d\nabout the health of the funds and resulted in respondents\u2019\ninvestment losses. 51 So. 3d 1165, 1168 (Fla. App. 2010).\n   KPMG moved to compel arbitration based on the audit\nservices agreement that existed between it and the Trem-\nont defendants. That agreement provided that \u201c[a]ny\ndispute or claim arising out of or relating to . . . the ser-\nvices provided [by KPMG] . . . (including any dispute or\nclaim involving any person or entity for whose benefit the\nservices in question are or were provided) shall be re-\nsolved\u201d either by mediation or arbitration. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 63a. The Florida Circuit Court of the Fifteenth\nJudicial Circuit Palm Beach County denied the motion.\n   The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that \u201c[n]one of the\nplaintiffs . . . expressly assented in any fashion to [the\naudit services agreement] or the arbitration provision.\u201d 51\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nSo. 3d, at 1168. Thus, the court found, the arbitration\nclause could only be enforced if respondents\u2019 claims were\nderivative in that they arose from the services KPMG\nperformed for the Tremont defendants pursuant to the\naudit services agreement. Applying Delaware law, which\nboth parties agreed was applicable, the Court of Appeal\nconcluded that the negligent misrepresentation and the\nviolation of FDUTPA claims were direct rather than de-\nrivative. A fair reading of the opinion reveals nothing to\nsuggest that the court came to the same conclusion about\nthe professional malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty\nclaims. Indeed, the court said nothing about those claims\nat all. Finding \u201cthe arbitral agreement upon which KPMG\nrelied would not apply to the direct claims made by the\nindividual plaintiffs,\u201d id., at 1167, the Court of Appeal\naffirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to arbitrate.\n   Respondents have since amended their complaint to\nadd a fifth claim. Citing the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision,\nthe trial court again denied KPMG\u2019s motion to compel\narbitration.\n   The Federal Arbitration Act reflects an \u201cemphatic fed-\neral policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.\u201d\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 631 (1985); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospi-\ntal v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1983)\n(noting that \u201cquestions of arbitrability [must]. . . be ad-\ndressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favor-\ning arbitration\u201d). This policy, as contained within the Act,\n\u201crequires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\narbitrate,\u201d Dean Witter, supra, at 217, and \u201ccannot possi-\nbly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitra-\ntion by or against nonparties to the written arbitration\nagreement,\u201d Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U. S.\n624, 630, n. 5 (2009) (emphasis deleted). Both parties\nagree that whether the claims in the complaint are arbi-\ntrable turns on the question whether they must be deemed\n4                   KPMG LLP v. COCCHI\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndirect or derivative under Delaware law. That question of\nstate law is not at issue here. What is at issue is the\nCourt of Appeal\u2019s apparent refusal to compel arbitration\non any of the four claims based solely on a finding that two\nof them, the claim of negligent misrepresentation and the\nalleged violation of the FDUTPA, were nonarbitrable.\n   In Dean Witter, the Court noted that the Act \u201cprovides\nthat written agreements to arbitrate controversies arising\nout of an existing contract \u2018shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in\nequity for the revocation of any contract.\u2019 \u201d 470 U. S., at\n218 (quoting 9 U. S. C. \u00a72). The Court found that by its\nterms, \u201cthe Act leaves no place for the exercise of discre-\ntion by a district court, but instead mandates that district\ncourts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on\nissues as to which an arbitration agreement has been\nsigned.\u201d 470 U. S., at 218 (emphasis in original). Thus,\nwhen a complaint contains both arbitrable and nonarbi-\ntrable claims, the Act requires courts to \u201ccompel arbitra-\ntion of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties\nfiles a motion to compel, even where the result would be\nthe possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceed-\nings in different forums.\u201d Id., at 217. To implement this\nholding, courts must examine a complaint with care to\nassess whether any individual claim must be arbitrated.\nThe failure to do so is subject to immediate review. See\nSouthland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 6\u20137 (1984).\n   The Court of Appeal listed all four claims, found that\ntwo were direct, and then refused to compel arbitration on\nthe complaint as a whole because the arbitral agreement\n\u201cwould not apply to the direct claims.\u201d 51 So. 3d, at 1167.\nBy not addressing the other two claims in the complaint,\nthe Court of Appeal failed to give effect to the plain mean-\ning of the Act and to the holding of Dean Witter. The\npetition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded. On\n                Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)          5\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nremand, the Court of Appeal should examine the re-\nmaining two claims to determine whether either requires\narbitration.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n",
