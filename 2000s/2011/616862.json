RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, \n\n  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, \n\n    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 11\u20136391. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KAGAN joins,\ndissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Today the Court denies review of a death sentence\nmarred by racial overtones and a record compromised by\nmisleading remarks and omissions made by the State of\nTexas in the federal habeas proceedings below. Because\nour criminal justice system should not tolerate either\ncircumstance\u2014especially in a capital case\u2014I dissent and\nvote to grant the petition.\n   Duane E. Buck was convicted of capital murder in a\nTexas state court. During the penalty phase of Buck\u2019s\ntrial, the defense called psychologist Walter Quijano as a\nwitness. The defense sought Quijano\u2019s opinion as to\nwhether Buck would pose a continuing threat to society\u2014a\nfact that the jury was required to find in order to sentence\nBuck to death. Quijano testified that there were several\n\u201cstatistical factors we know to predict future dangerous-\nness,\u201d and listed a defendant\u2019s past crimes, age, sex, race,\nsocioeconomic status, employment stability, and substance\nabuse history. 28 Tr. 110\u2013111 (May 6, 1997). As to race,\nQuijano said: \u201cRace. It\u2019s a sad commentary that minori-\nties, Hispanics and black people, are over represented in\nthe Criminal Justice System.\u201d Id., at 111. The defense\nthen asked Quijano to \u201ctalk about environmental factors if\n[Buck were] incarcerated in prison.\u201d Id., at 111\u2013112.\nQuijano explained that, for example, Buck \u201chas no assaul-\n2                         BUCK v. THALER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive incidents either at TDC or in jail,\u201d and that \u201cthat\u2019s a\ngood sign that this person is controllable within a jail or\nprison setting.\u201d Id., at 115. He also explained that Buck\u2019s\n\u201cvictim [was] not random\u201d because \u201cthere [was] a pre-\nexisting relationship,\u201d and that this reduced the probabil-\nity that Buck would pose a future danger. Id., at 112.\nUltimately, when the defense asked Quijano whether\nBuck was likely to commit violent criminal acts if he were\nsentenced to life imprisonment, Quijano replied, \u201cThe\nprobability of that happening in prison would be low.\u201d Id.,\nat 115. The defense also offered into evidence, over the\nprosecutor\u2019s objection, a report containing Quijano\u2019s psy-\nchological evaluation of Buck, which substantially mir-\nrored Quijano\u2019s trial testimony.1\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor began by asking\nQuijano about the financial compensation he received in\nreturn for his time and the methods he used to examine\nBuck. The prosecutor then said that she would \u201clike to\nask [Quijano] some questions from [his] report.\u201d Id., at\n155. After inquiring about the statistical factors of past\ncrimes and age and how they might indicate future dan-\ngerousness in Buck\u2019s case, the prosecutor said: \u201cYou have\ndetermined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent\nthan a female because that\u2019s just the way it is, and that\nthe race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness\nfor various complicated reasons; is that correct?\u201d Id., at\n160. Quijano answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Ibid. After additional\ncross-examination and testimony from a subsequent wit-\nness, the prosecutor argued to the jury in summation that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The report listed the following statistical factors relevant to the\n\nquestion whether Buck would pose a continuing threat to society:\npast crimes, age, sex, race, socioeconomics, employment stability, and\nsubstance abuse. As to race, the report stated: \u201c4. Race. Black:\nIncreased probability. There is an over-representation of Blacks among\nthe violent offenders.\u201d Defense Exh. 1 in No. 699684 (208th Jud. Dist.,\nHarris Cty., Tex.), p. 7.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nQuijano \u201ctold you that there was a probability that [Buck]\nwould commit future acts of violence.\u201d Id., at 260. The\njury returned a verdict of death.\n  This was not the first time that Quijano had testified in\na Texas capital case, or in which the prosecution asked\nhim questions regarding the relationship between race\nand future dangerousness. State prosecutors had elicited\ncomparable testimony from Quijano in several other cases.\nIn four of them, the prosecution called Quijano as a wit-\nness. See Gonzales v. Cockrell, Civ. Action No. 99\u201372 (WD\nTex., Dec. 19, 2002); Broxton v. Johnson, Civ. Action No.\n00\u20131034 (SD Tex., Mar. 28, 2001); Garcia v. Johnson, Civ.\nAction No. 99\u2013134 (ED Tex., Sept. 7, 2000); Saldano v.\nTexas, 530 U. S. 1212 (2000). In two, the defense called\nQuijano, but the prosecution was the first to elicit race-\nrelated testimony from him. See Alba v. Johnson, 232\nF. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table); Blue v. Johnson, Civ. Action\nNo. 99\u20130350 (SD Tex., Sept. 29, 2000). In each case, as in\nBuck\u2019s, however, the salient fact was that the prosecution\ninvited the jury to consider race as a factor in sentencing.\nAnd in each case, the defendant was sentenced to death.\n  When one of those defendants, Victor Hugo Saldano,\npetitioned for this Court\u2019s review, the State of Texas con-\nfessed error. It acknowledged that \u201cthe use of race in\nSaldano\u2019s sentencing seriously undermined the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\u201d\nResponse to Pet. for Cert. in Saldano v. Texas, O. T. 1999,\nNo. 99\u20138119, p. 7. The State continued, \u201c[T]he infusion of\nrace as a factor for the jury to weigh in making its deter-\nmination violated [Saldano\u2019s] constitutional right to be\nsentenced without regard to the color of his skin.\u201d Id., at\n8. We granted Saldano\u2019s petition, vacated the judgment,\nand remanded. Saldano v. Texas, 530 U. S. 1212.\n  Shortly afterwards, the then-attorney general of Texas\nannounced publicly that he had identified six cases that\nwere \u201csimilar to that of Victor Hugo Saldano\u201d in that\n4                     BUCK v. THALER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\u201ctestimony was offered by Dr. Quijano that race should be\na factor for the jury to consider\u201d in making its sentencing\ndetermination. Record in No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.),\nDoc. 27\u20135, p. 30 (hereinafter Record) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). These were the five cases listed above\n(besides Saldano), as well as Buck\u2019s. The attorney general\ndeclared that \u201cit is inappropriate to allow race to be con-\nsidered as a factor in our criminal justice system.\u201d Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, in five of\nthe six cases the attorney general identified, the State\nconfessed error and did not raise procedural defenses to\nthe defendants\u2019 federal habeas petitions. Five of the six\ndefendants were thus resentenced, each to death.\n   Only in Buck\u2019s case, the last of the six cases to reach\nfederal habeas review, did the State assert a procedural\nbar. Why the State chose to treat Buck differently from\neach of the other defendants has not always been clear.\nAs the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recognized in\nthe decision that is the subject of this petition, \u201cWe are\nprovided with no explanation for why the State declined\nto act consistently with its Attorney General\u2019s public\nannouncement with respect to petitioner Buck.\u201d No. 11\u2013\n70025, 2011 WL 4067164, *8, n. 41 (Sept. 14, 2011).\n   What we do know is that the State justified its assertion\nof a procedural defense in the District Court based on\nstatements and omissions that were misleading. The\nState found itself \u201ccompelled\u201d to treat Buck\u2019s case differ-\nently from Saldano\u2019s because of a \u201ccritical distinction\u201d:\n\u201cBuck himself, not the State[,] offered Dr. Quijano\u2019s testi-\nmony into evidence.\u201d Record, Doc. 6, at 17. The State\ncreated the unmistakable impression that Buck\u2019s case\ndiffered from the others in that only Buck called Quijano\nas a witness. The State asserted, \u201c[T]he Director is obvi-\nously aware of the prior confessions of error in other fed-\neral habeas corpus cases involving similar testimony by\nDr. Quijano. However, this case is not Saldano. In Sal-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ndano\u2019s case Dr. Quijano testified for the State.\u201d Id., at 20\n(citation omitted; emphasis in original); see also ibid.\n(\u201cTherefore, because it was Buck who called Dr. Quijano to\ntestify and derived the benefit of Dr. Quijano\u2019s overall\nopinion that Buck was unlikely to be a future danger\ndespite the existence of some negative factors, this case\ndoes not represent the odious error contained in the Sal-\ndano cases\u201d). This was obviously not accurate. Like Buck,\nthe defendants in both Blue and Alba called Quijano to the\nstand. But on the ground that only Buck had called Qui-\njano as a witness, the State urged the District Court that\n\u201cthe former actions of the Director [in the other five cases]\nare not applicable and should not be considered in decid-\ning this case.\u201d Record, Doc. 6, at 20.2 The District Court\napplied the procedural bar raised by the State and dis-\nmissed Buck\u2019s petition.\n   Buck later brought the State\u2019s misstatements to light in\na motion to reopen the judgment under Rule 60 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. In response, the State\nerroneously identified Alba as a case in which the prosecu-\ntion had called Quijano to the stand, and omitted any\nmention of Blue. After the District Court denied Buck\u2019s\nRule 60 motion, Buck highlighted these errors in a motion\nunder Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment, which\nthe District Court also denied. The Fifth Circuit denied\nBuck\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (COA)\nto review these two judgments.\n   I believe the Fifth Circuit erred in doing so. To obtain a\nCOA, a petitioner need not \u201cprove, before the issuance of a\nCOA, that some jurists would grant the petition for habeas\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Perhaps, under a generous reading of the State\u2019s briefing, the State\n\nmeant to convey to the District Court that Buck\u2019s case was distinguish-\nable from the others not only because he called Quijano as a witness,\nbut also because he elicited race-related testimony. But that is not\nwhat the briefing says. The distinction that the State offered\u2014that\nBuck alone proffered Quijano as a witness\u2014is incorrect.\n6                     BUCK v. THALER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncorpus.\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 338 (2003).\nInstead, a petitioner must show that \u201cjurists of reason\ncould disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his\nconstitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the\nissues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement\nto proceed further.\u201d Id., at 327. See also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72253(c)(2).\n   Buck has met this standard. The Rule 60 relief that\nhe sought in the District Court was highly discretionary.\nLiljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S.\n847 (1988). Yet the District Court denied relief based on\na record compromised by the State\u2019s misleading remarks\nand omissions. I realize that, in denying Buck\u2019s Rule 59(e)\nmotion, the District Court was aware of Buck\u2019s arguments\nthat the State had mischaracterized Alba and Blue. But\nthe District Court lacked other information that might\nhave influenced its decision. Significantly, the District\nCourt could not know that the State would later concede\nin the Fifth Circuit that it had mischaracterized Alba.\n   Nor, for similar reasons, did the District Court have the\nopportunity to evaluate the State\u2019s subsequent efforts in\nthe Fifth Circuit and this Court to try to distinguish\nBuck\u2019s case from Alba and Blue. The State argues that\nalthough the defendants in those cases each proffered\nQuijano as a witness, they did not, like Buck, elicit race-\nrelated testimony on direct examination; instead, the\nprosecution first did so on cross-examination.\n   This distinction is accurate but not necessarily substan-\ntial. The context in which Buck\u2019s counsel addressed race\ndiffered markedly from how the prosecutor used it. On\ndirect examination, Quijano referred to race as part of his\noverall opinion that Buck would pose a low threat to socie-\nty were he imprisoned. This is exactly how the State has\ncharacterized Quijano\u2019s testimony. E.g., Thaler\u2019s Reply to\nBuck\u2019s Motion for Relief from Judgment and Motion for\nStay of Execution in No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.), pp. 15\u2013\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n16 (\u201cIn this case, first on direct examination by the de-\nfense, Dr. Quijano merely identified race as one statistical\nfactor and pointed out that African-Americans were\noverrepresented in the criminal justice system; he did not\nstate a causal relationship, nor did he link this statistic to\nBuck as an individual\u201d). Buck did not argue that his race\nmade him less dangerous, and the prosecutor had no need\nto revisit the issue. But she did, in a question specifically\ndesigned to persuade the jury that Buck\u2019s race made him\nmore dangerous and that, in part on this basis, he should\nbe sentenced to death.\n   The then-attorney general of Texas recognized that \u201cit is\ninappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in\nour criminal justice system.\u201d Record, Doc. 27\u20135, at 30\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the District\nCourt would accord any weight to the State\u2019s purported\ndistinctions between Buck\u2019s case and the others is a ques-\ntion which that court should decide in the first instance,\nbased on an unobscured record. Especially in light of the\ncapital nature of this case and the express recognition by\na Texas attorney general that the relevant testimony\nwas inappropriately race-charged, Buck has presented\nissues that \u201cdeserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d\nMiller-El, 537 U. S., at 327.\n",

Why the State chose to treat Buck differently from\neach of the other defendants has not always been clear.\nAs the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recognized in\nthe decision that is the subject of this petition, \u201cWe are\nprovided with no explanation for why the State declined\nto act consistently with its Attorney General\u2019s public\nannouncement with respect to petitioner Buck.\u201d No. 11\u2013\n70025, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4067164</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8, n. 41 (Sept. 14, 2011).\n   What we do know is that the State justified its assertion\nof a procedural defense in the District Court based on\nstatements and omissions that were misleading. The\nState found itself \u201ccompelled\u201d to treat Buck\u2019s case differ-\nently from Saldano\u2019s because of a \u201ccritical distinction\u201d:\n\u201cBuck himself, not the State[,] offered Dr. Quijano\u2019s testi-\nmony into evidence.\u201d Record, Doc. 6, at 17. The State\ncreated the unmistakable impression that Buck\u2019s case\ndiffered from the others in that only Buck called Quijano\nas a witness. The State asserted, \u201c[T]he Director is obvi-\nously aware of the prior confessions of error in other fed-\neral habeas corpus cases involving similar testimony by\nDr. Quijano. However, this case is not Saldano. In Sal-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ndano\u2019s case Dr. Quijano testified for the State.\u201d Id., at 20\n(citation omitted; emphasis in original); see also ibid.\n(\u201cTherefore, because it was Buck who called Dr. Quijano to\ntestify and derived the benefit of Dr. Quijano\u2019s overall\nopinion that Buck was unlikely to be a future danger\ndespite the existence of some negative factors, this case\ndoes not represent the odious error contained in the Sal-\ndano cases\u201d). This was obviously not accurate. Like Buck,\nthe defendants in both Blue and Alba called Quijano to the\nstand. But on the ground that only Buck had called Qui-\njano as a witness, the State urged the District Court that\n\u201cthe former actions of the Director [in the other five cases]\nare not applicable and should not be considered in decid-\ning this case.\u201d Record, Doc. 6, at 20.2 The District Court\napplied the procedural bar raised by the State and dis-\nmissed Buck\u2019s petition.\n   Buck later brought the State\u2019s misstatements to light in\na motion to reopen the judgment under Rule 60 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. In response, the State\nerroneously identified Alba as a case in which the prosecu-\ntion had called Quijano to the stand, and omitted any\nmention of Blue. After the District Court denied Buck\u2019s\nRule 60 motion, Buck highlighted these errors in a motion\nunder Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment, which\nthe District Court also denied. The Fifth Circuit denied\nBuck\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (COA)\nto review these two judgments.\n   I believe the Fifth Circuit erred in doing so. To obtain a\nCOA, a petitioner need not \u201cprove, before the issuance of a\nCOA, that some jurists would grant the petition for habeas\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Perhaps, under a generous reading of the State\u2019s briefing, the State\n\nmeant to convey to the District Court that Buck\u2019s case was distinguish-\nable from the others not only because he called Quijano as a witness,\nbut also because he elicited race-related testimony. But that is not\nwhat the briefing says. The distinction that the State offered\u2014that\nBuck alone proffered Quijano as a witness\u2014is incorrect.\n6                     BUCK v. THALER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncorpus.\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 338 (2003).\nInstead, a petitioner must show that \u201cjurists of reason\ncould disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his\nconstitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the\nissues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement\nto proceed further.\u201d Id., at 327. See also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72253(c)(2).\n   Buck has met this standard. The Rule 60 relief that\nhe sought in the District Court was highly discretionary.\nLiljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U. S.\n847 (1988). Yet the District Court denied relief based on\na record compromised by the State\u2019s misleading remarks\nand omissions. I realize that, in denying Buck\u2019s Rule 59(e)\nmotion, the District Court was aware of Buck\u2019s arguments\nthat the State had mischaracterized Alba and Blue. But\nthe District Court lacked other information that might\nhave influenced its decision. Significantly, the District\nCourt could not know that the State would later concede\nin the Fifth Circuit that it had mischaracterized Alba.\n   Nor, for similar reasons, did the District Court have the\nopportunity to evaluate the State\u2019s subsequent efforts in\nthe Fifth Circuit and this Court to try to distinguish\nBuck\u2019s case from Alba and Blue. The State argues that\nalthough the defendants in those cases each proffered\nQuijano as a witness, they did not, like Buck, elicit race-\nrelated testimony on direct examination; instead, the\nprosecution first did so on cross-examination.\n   This distinction is accurate but not necessarily substan-\ntial. The context in which Buck\u2019s counsel addressed race\ndiffered markedly from how the prosecutor used it. On\ndirect examination, Quijano referred to race as part of his\noverall opinion that Buck would pose a low threat to socie-\nty were he imprisoned. This is exactly how the State has\ncharacterized Quijano\u2019s testimony. E.g., Thaler\u2019s Reply to\nBuck\u2019s Motion for Relief from Judgment and Motion for\nStay of Execution in No. 4:04\u2013cv\u201303965 (SD Tex.), pp. 15\u2013\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n16 (\u201cIn this case, first on direct examination by the de-\nfense, Dr. Quijano merely identified race as one statistical\nfactor and pointed out that African-Americans were\noverrepresented in the criminal justice system; he did not\nstate a causal relationship, nor did he link this statistic to\nBuck as an individual\u201d). Buck did not argue that his race\nmade him less dangerous, and the prosecutor had no need\nto revisit the issue. But she did, in a question specifically\ndesigned to persuade the jury that Buck\u2019s race made him\nmore dangerous and that, in part on this basis, he should\nbe sentenced to death.\n   The then-attorney general of Texas recognized that \u201cit is\ninappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in\nour criminal justice system.\u201d Record, Doc. 27\u20135, at 30\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Whether the District\nCourt would accord any weight to the State\u2019s purported\ndistinctions between Buck\u2019s case and the others is a ques-\ntion which that court should decide in the first instance,\nbased on an unobscured record. Especially in light of the\ncapital nature of this case and the express recognition by\na Texas attorney general that the relevant testimony\nwas inappropriately race-charged, Buck has presented\nissues that \u201cdeserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d\nMiller-El, 537 U. S., at 327.\n</pre>",
