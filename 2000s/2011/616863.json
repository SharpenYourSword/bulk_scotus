RICK THALER, DIRECTOR, \n\n  TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, \n\n    CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 11–6391. Decided November 7, 2011\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE\nSCALIA and JUSTICE BREYER join, respecting the denial of\ncertiorari.\n  One morning in July 1995, petitioner Duane E. Buck\nwent to his ex-girlfriend’s house with a rifle and a shot-\ngun. After killing one person and wounding another, Buck\nchased his ex-girlfriend outside. Her children followed\nand witnessed Buck shoot and kill their mother as she\nattempted to flee. An arresting officer testified that Buck\nwas laughing when he was arrested and said “[t]he bitch\ndeserved what she got.” 28 Tr. 51 (May 6, 1997).\n  Buck was tried for capital murder, and a jury convicted.\nHe was sentenced to death based on the jury’s finding\nthat the State had proved Buck’s future dangerousness to\nsociety.\n  The petition in this case concerns bizarre and objection-\nable testimony given by a “defense expert” at the penalty\nphase of Buck’s capital trial. The witness, Dr. Walter\nQuijano, testified that petitioner, if given a noncapital\nsentence, would not present a danger to society. But Dr.\nQuijano added that members of petitioner’s race (he is\nAfrican-American) are statistically more likely than the\naverage person to engage in crime.\n  Dr. Quijano’s testimony would provide a basis for rever-\nsal of petitioner’s sentence if the prosecution were respon-\nsible for presenting that testimony to the jury. But Dr.\n2                       BUCK v. THALER\n\n                       Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nQuijano was a defense witness, and it was petitioner’s\nattorney, not the prosecutor, who first elicited Dr. Qui-\njano’s view regarding the correlation between race and\nfuture dangerousness. Retained by the defense, Dr. Qui-\njano prepared a report in which he opined on this subject.\nHis report stated:\n       “Future Dangerousness, Whether there is probabil-\n    ity that the defendant would commit criminal acts of\n    violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n    society? The following factors were considered in an-\n    swer to the question of future dangerousness: statisti-\n    cal, environmental, and clinical judgment.\n    “I. STATISTICAL FACTORS\n\n      “1. Past crimes. . . . \n\n      “2. Age. . . .\n      “3. Sex. . . .\n      “4. Race. Black: Increased probability.

No. 1 in\n    No. 699684 (208th Jud. Dist., Harris Cty., Tex.), p. 7.\n   The defense then called Dr. Quijano to the stand, and\nelicited his testimony on this point. Defense counsel asked\nDr. Quijano, “[i]f we have an inmate such as Mr. Buck who\nis sentenced to life in prison, what are some of the factors,\nstatistical factors or environmental factors that you’ve\nlooked at in regard to this case?” 28 Tr. 110 (May 6, 1997).\nAs he had done in his report, Dr. Quijano identified past\ncrimes, age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, and substance\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                     Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nabuse as statistical factors predictive of “whether a person\nwill or will not constitute a continuing danger.” Id., at\n111; see also id., at 110 (identifying the “statistical factors\nwe know to predict future dangerousness”). With respect\nto race, he elaborated further that “[i]t’s a sad commen-\ntary that minorities, Hispanics and black people, are over\nrepresented in the Criminal Justice System.” Id., at 111.\nNot only did the defense present this testimony to the jury\nbut Dr. Quijano’s report was also admitted into evidence—\nover the prosecution’s objection—and was thus available\nfor the jury to consider. See id., at 233–234.\n  It is true that the prosecutor briefly went over this\nsame ground on cross-examination. The prosecutor asked\na single question regarding whether race increased\nthe probability that Buck would pose a future danger to\nsociety:\n    “Q. You have determined that the sex factor, that a\n    male is more violent than a female because that’s just\n    the way it is, and that the race factor, black, increases\n    the future dangerousness for various complicated rea-\n    sons; is that correct?\n\n    “A. Yes.” Id., at 160.\n  But this colloquy did not go beyond what defense coun-\nsel had already elicited on direct examination, and by this\npoint, Dr. Quijano’s views on the correlation between race\nand future dangerousness had already been brought to the\njury’s attention. Moreover, the prosecutor did not revisit\nthe race-related testimony in closing or ask the jury to find\nfuture dangerousness based on Buck’s race.\n  The dissent makes much of the fact that the State at\nvarious points in federal habeas proceedings was inaccu-\nrate in its attempts to explain why the present case is\ndifferent from the others in which, as a result of similar\ntestimony by Dr. Quijano, the State did not assert proce-\n4                         BUCK v.

In four of the six other cases, see, e.g.,\nSaldano v. Texas, 530 U. S. 1212 (2000), the prosecution\ncalled Dr. Quijano and elicited the objectionable testimony\non direct examination. In the remaining two cases, see\nAlba v. Johnson, 232 F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table); Blue v.\nJohnson, Civ. Action No. 99–0350 (SD Tex., Sept. 29,\n2000), while the defense called Dr. Quijano, the objection-\nable testimony was not elicited until the prosecution ques-\ntioned Dr. Quijano on cross-examination. See Record,\nDoc. 511601677, at 44–49; id., Doc. 511601676, at 39–44.\nAnd, on redirect, defense counsel mentioned race only to\nmitigate the effect on the jury of Dr. Quijano’s prior identi-\nfication of race as an immutable factor increasing a de-\nfendant’s likelihood of future dangerousness.* Only in\n——————\n   * On redirect in Alba, defense counsel tried to downplay the signifi-\ncance of Dr. Quijano’s testimony with respect to the statistical factors:\n   “Q. [The prosecutor] asked you about statistical factors in predicting\nfuture dangerousness. When we’re talking about statistics, are we\ntalking about correlation or causation?\n   “A. Oh. These statistics are strictly correlation. There’s a big\ndistinction, and we must keep that in mind. Correlation simply says\nthat two events happened—coincidentally happened at the same time.\nIt does not mean that one causes the other.\n   “Q. So when we’re talking about these statistical factors—that more\nmen re-offend than women, Hispanics offend more than blacks or\nwhites, people from the low socioeconomic groups offend more than\npeople from the higher socioeconomic groups, people who have opiate\naddiction or alcohol abuse offend more often than those who don’t,\npeople who have less education offend more often than those who\nhave—do all those things cause people to offend?\n   “A. No. They are simply contributing factors. They are not causal\nfactors. One cannot control one’s gender or one’s color. And obviously\nthere are many, many Hispanics, many whites, many Orientals who\ndon’t commit crimes. But the frequence [sic] among those who commit\ncrimes, these are the characteristics. They don’t cause each other; they\njust happen to be coincidental to each other.” Record, Doc. 511601677,\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Thus, this is the only\ncase in which it can be said that the responsibility for\neliciting the offensive testimony lay squarely with the\ndefense.\n   Although the dissent suggests that the District Court\nmay have been misled by the State’s inaccurate state-\nments, the District Court, in denying petitioner’s motion\nunder Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was\nfully aware of what had occurred in all of these cases.
