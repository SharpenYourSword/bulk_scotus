Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided November 8, 2011\nDuring petitioner Greene\u2019s trial for murder, robbery, and conspiracy,\n the prosecution introduced the redacted confessions of two of\n Greene\u2019s nontestifying codefendants. A jury convicted Greene. The\n Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that\n the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, did not\n apply because the confessions were redacted to remove any specific\n reference to Greene. While Greene\u2019s petition to the Pennsylvania\n Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Mary-\n land, 523 U. S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confes-\n sions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greene\u2019s\n appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief. Under the Antiter-\n rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal\n court may not grant such relief to a state prisoner on any claim that\n has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d un-\n less that adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28\n U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). Here, the District Court concluded that, because\n the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Gray had not yet been\n issued when the Pennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene\u2019s\n claim, the condition for granting habeas relief had not been met. The\n Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Under \u00a72254(d)(1), \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter-\n mined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d includes only this\n2                          GREENE v.

S. ___, established that \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s \u201cbackward-\n    looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision\n    at the time it was made.\u201d Id., at ___. As the Court explained in Cul-\n    len, \u00a72254(d)(1) requires federal courts to measure state-court deci-\n    sions \u201cagainst this Court\u2019s precedents as of \u2018the time the state court\n    renders its decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___.

Because the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision\u2014the last\n    state-court adjudication on the merits of Greene\u2019s claim\u2014predated\n    Gray by nearly three months, the Third Circuit correctly held that\n    Gray was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d against which it could\n    measure the state-court decision. It therefore correctly concluded\n    that the state court\u2019s decision neither was \u201ccontrary to,\u201d nor \u201cinvolved\n    an unreasonable application of,\u201d any \u201cclearly established Federal\n    law.\u201d Pp. 6\u20137.\n606 F. 3d 85, affirmed.\n\n    SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 565 U.

JON FISHER, SUPERINTENDENT,\n\n     STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT\n\n               SMITHFIELD, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                              [November 8, 2011]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant habe-\nas relief to a state prisoner with respect to any claim that\nhas been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court pro-\nceedings\u201d unless the state-court adjudication \u201cresulted in a\ndecision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). We consider whether \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law\u201d includes decisions of this Court that\nare announced after the last adjudication of the merits in\nstate court but before the defendant\u2019s conviction becomes\nfinal.\n                             I\n  In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four\nco-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men\nshot and killed the store\u2019s owner. The five were appre-\n2                    GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the\nrobbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by\nthe others\u2019 statements.\n  When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the co-\nconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,\ninter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying code-\nfendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial\ncourt denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require\nredaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As\nredacted, the confessions replaced names with words like\n\u201cthis guy,\u201d \u201csomeone,\u201d and \u201cother guys,\u201d or with the word\n\u201cblank,\u201d or simply omitted the names without substitution.\n  A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, rob-\nbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania\nSuperior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was\ndemanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause\nforbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying co-\ndefendant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant in the\ncrime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the\nconviction, holding that the redaction had cured any prob-\nlem under Bruton.\n  Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton\nclaim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.\nMaryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that \u201cconsidered as a\nclass, redactions that replace a proper name with an\nobvious blank, the word \u2018delete,\u2019 a symbol, or similarly\nnotify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar\nenough to Bruton\u2019s unredacted confessions as to warrant\nthe same legal results.\u201d The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ngranted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the\nquestion whether admission of the redacted confessions\nviolated Greene\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. After the\nparties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngranted.\n   Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction\nof his nontestifying codefendants\u2019 statements violated the\nConfrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recom-\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court de-\nnied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in\nGray was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d when the\nPennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene\u2019s Con-\nfrontation Clause claim, that court\u2019s decision was not\n\u201ccontrary to,\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606\nF. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law\u201d referred to in \u00a72254(d)(1) is the law at\nthe time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,\nat 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at\nthe time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We\ngranted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                          II\n Section 2254(d) of Title 28, U. S. C., as amended by\nAEDPA, provides:\n       \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim\u2014\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n4                     GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nThe issue here pertains to the first exception. We have\nsaid that its standard of \u201ccontrary to, or involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw\u201d is \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d because the purpose of AEDPA\nis to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a\n\u201c \u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,\u2019 \u201d and not as a means of error correction.\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12\u201313) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,\nn. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).\n    In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of\nthe provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the prisoner\u2019s claim on the merits. We said\nthat the provision\u2019s \u201cbackward-looking language requires\nan examination of the state-court decision at the time it\nwas made.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of\nCullen determines the result here. As we explained,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) requires federal courts to \u201cfocu[s] on what a\nstate court knew and did,\u201d and to measure state-court\ndecisions \u201cagainst this Court\u2019s precedents as of \u2018the time\nthe state court renders its decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., at __ (slip op., at\n10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372\n(2003); emphasis added).\n    Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our deci-\nsion in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held\nthat, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner\nseeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitu-\ntional rules of criminal procedure announced before the\nprisoner\u2019s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality\nopinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\n(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and\na petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become\ntime barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,\n479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,\nbecause finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague\npurposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law\u201d under AEDPA.\n   The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have\nexplained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that\n\u201cthe AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.\u201d Horn v.\nBanks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retro-\nactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the\nmerits\u2014which include Teague\u2014are quite separate from\nthe relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates\nor qualifies the other. If \u00a72254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged\nto Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court\nmerits adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that became\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, before the conviction became\nfinal.\u201d The statute says no such thing, and we see no\nreason why Teague should alter AEDPA\u2019s plain meaning.*\n   Greene alternatively contends that the relevant \u201cdeci-\nsion\u201d to which the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d crite-\nrion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme\ncourt that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant\u2019s\nconviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision\ndoes not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This\nis an implausible reading of \u00a72254(d)(1). The text, we\nrepeat, provides that habeas relief\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Whether \u00a72254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from\nrelying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication\non the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in\nTeague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve\nthis case.\n6                   GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that\n    was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-\n    ings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted\n    in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an un-\n    reasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n    law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe words \u201cthe adjudication\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause obvi-\nously refer back to the \u201cadjudicat[ion] on the merits,\u201d and\nthe phrase \u201cresulted in a decision\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause\nobviously refers to the decision produced by that same\nadjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that\ndecision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,\nwould not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudica-\ntion. And much less would be (what is at issue here)\na decision by the state supreme court not to hear the\nappeal\u2014that is, not to decide at all.\n                             III\n   The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,\nthat the last state-court adjudication on the merits of\nGreene\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct\nappeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F. 3d, at\n92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision\npredated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.\nThe Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not\n\u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d against which it could\nmeasure the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision. 606\nF. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do\nnot dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s deci-\nsion neither was \u201ccontrary to,\u201d nor \u201cinvolved an unreason-\nable application of,\u201d any \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d\nthat existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene\u2019s\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   We must observe that Greene\u2019s predicament is an unu-\nsual one of his own creation.

Chater, 516\nU. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.\nNew York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light\nof Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a\npetition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two\nobvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to\nprovide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner\ncontrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to\ndo so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",

Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided November 8, 2011\nDuring petitioner Greene\u2019s trial for murder, robbery, and conspiracy,\n the prosecution introduced the redacted confessions of two of\n Greene\u2019s nontestifying codefendants. A jury convicted Greene. The\n Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld the conviction, reasoning that\n the rule announced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.

While Greene\u2019s petition to the Pennsylvania\n Supreme Court was pending, this Court announced in Gray v. Mary-\n land, 523 U. S. 185, that Bruton does apply to some redacted confes-\n sions. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear Greene\u2019s\n appeal, and he then sought federal habeas relief.

S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). We consider whether \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law\u201d includes decisions of this Court that\nare announced after the last adjudication of the merits in\nstate court but before the defendant\u2019s conviction becomes\nfinal.\n                             I\n  In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four\nco-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men\nshot and killed the store\u2019s owner. The five were appre-\n2                    GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the\nrobbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by\nthe others\u2019 statements.\n  When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the co-\nconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,\ninter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying code-\nfendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial\ncourt denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require\nredaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As\nredacted, the confessions replaced names with words like\n\u201cthis guy,\u201d \u201csomeone,\u201d and \u201cother guys,\u201d or with the word\n\u201cblank,\u201d or simply omitted the names without substitution.\n  A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, rob-\nbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania\nSuperior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was\ndemanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause\nforbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying co-\ndefendant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant in the\ncrime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the\nconviction, holding that the redaction had cured any prob-\nlem under Bruton.\n  Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton\nclaim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.\nMaryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that \u201cconsidered as a\nclass, redactions that replace a proper name with an\nobvious blank, the word \u2018delete,\u2019 a symbol, or similarly\nnotify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar\nenough to Bruton\u2019s unredacted confessions as to warrant\nthe same legal results.\u201d The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ngranted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the\nquestion whether admission of the redacted confessions\nviolated Greene\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. After the\nparties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngranted.\n   Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction\nof his nontestifying codefendants\u2019 statements violated the\nConfrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recom-\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court de-\nnied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in\nGray was not \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d when the\nPennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene\u2019s Con-\nfrontation Clause claim, that court\u2019s decision was not\n\u201ccontrary to,\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606\nF. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law\u201d referred to in \u00a72254(d)(1) is the law at\nthe time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,\nat 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at\nthe time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We\ngranted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                          II\n Section 2254(d) of Title 28, U. S. C., as amended by\nAEDPA, provides:\n       \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim\u2014\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n4                     GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\nThe issue here pertains to the first exception. We have\nsaid that its standard of \u201ccontrary to, or involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw\u201d is \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d because the purpose of AEDPA\nis to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a\n\u201c \u2018guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,\u2019 \u201d and not as a means of error correction.\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12\u201313) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,\nn. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).\n    In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of\nthe provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under \u00a72254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the prisoner\u2019s claim on the merits. We said\nthat the provision\u2019s \u201cbackward-looking language requires\nan examination of the state-court decision at the time it\nwas made.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of\nCullen determines the result here. As we explained,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) requires federal courts to \u201cfocu[s] on what a\nstate court knew and did,\u201d and to measure state-court\ndecisions \u201cagainst this Court\u2019s precedents as of \u2018the time\nthe state court renders its decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., at __ (slip op., at\n10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71\u201372\n(2003); emphasis added).\n    Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our deci-\nsion in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held\nthat, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner\nseeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitu-\ntional rules of criminal procedure announced before the\nprisoner\u2019s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality\nopinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\n(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and\na petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become\ntime barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,\n479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,\nbecause finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague\npurposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law\u201d under AEDPA.\n   The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have\nexplained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that\n\u201cthe AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.\u201d Horn v.\nBanks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retro-\nactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the\nmerits\u2014which include Teague\u2014are quite separate from\nthe relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates\nor qualifies the other. If \u00a72254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged\nto Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court\nmerits adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that became\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, before the conviction became\nfinal.\u201d The statute says no such thing, and we see no\nreason why Teague should alter AEDPA\u2019s plain meaning.*\n   Greene alternatively contends that the relevant \u201cdeci-\nsion\u201d to which the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d crite-\nrion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme\ncourt that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant\u2019s\nconviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision\ndoes not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This\nis an implausible reading of \u00a72254(d)(1). The text, we\nrepeat, provides that habeas relief\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Whether \u00a72254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from\nrelying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication\non the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in\nTeague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve\nthis case.\n6                   GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that\n    was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-\n    ings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted\n    in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an un-\n    reasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n    law . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe words \u201cthe adjudication\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause obvi-\nously refer back to the \u201cadjudicat[ion] on the merits,\u201d and\nthe phrase \u201cresulted in a decision\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause\nobviously refers to the decision produced by that same\nadjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that\ndecision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,\nwould not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudica-\ntion. And much less would be (what is at issue here)\na decision by the state supreme court not to hear the\nappeal\u2014that is, not to decide at all.\n                             III\n   The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,\nthat the last state-court adjudication on the merits of\nGreene\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct\nappeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F. 3d, at\n92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision\npredated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.\nThe Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not\n\u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d against which it could\nmeasure the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s decision. 606\nF. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do\nnot dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court\u2019s deci-\nsion neither was \u201ccontrary to,\u201d nor \u201cinvolved an unreason-\nable application of,\u201d any \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d\nthat existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,\n\u00a72254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene\u2019s\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   We must observe that Greene\u2019s predicament is an unu-\nsual one of his own creation.

S. ____ (2011)                  7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhabeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under\nGray: After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed\nhis appeal, he did not file a petition for writ of certiorari\nfrom this Court, which would almost certainly have pro-\nduced a remand in light of the intervening Gray decision.\n\u201cWhere intervening developments . . . reveal a reasonable\nprobability that the decision below rests upon a premise\nthat the lower court would reject if given the opportunity\nfor further consideration, and where it appears that such a\nredetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of\nthe litigation, [an order granting the petition, vacating the\njudgment below, and remanding the case (GVR)] is, we\nbelieve, potentially appropriate.\u201d Lawrence v. Chater, 516\nU. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.\nNew York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light\nof Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a\npetition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two\nobvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to\nprovide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner\ncontrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to\ndo so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
