SAM REED, WASHINGTON \n\n         SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. \n\n             ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION\n                      [November 21, 2011]\n\n   The application for an injunction presented to JUSTICE\nKENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is denied.\nJUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or deci-\nsion of this application.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting from denial of injunction.\n   In Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), the Court rejected\npetitioners’ facial challenge to the Washington law author-\nizing the disclosure of referendum petitions but assured\npetitioners that the disclosure could be blocked if a proper\nparty could show that compelled disclosure would result in\n“threats, harassment, or reprisals.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). Today’s order reveals that this assurance was empty.\n   On remand, the District Court rejected petitioners’ as-\napplied challenge, relying primarily on a highly question-\nable interpretation of our precedents. The District Court\nreasoned that only a select few organizations—what\nthe court termed “minor” political parties and “fringe”\ngroups—may challenge the disclosure of the names of\npersons who sign a referendum petition. Case No. C09–\n5456 (WD Wash., Oct. 17, 2011), pp. 13–15. If a referen-\ndum succeeds or nearly succeeds (or if the referendum\nsupports a position that has not been historically vilified),\nthen, according to the District Court, disclosure of the\nnames of the citizens who signed the petition cannot be\nshielded no matter how strong the evidence of threatened\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nretaliation or how severe the nature of the threats. Id., at\n15. Whether this is a correct interpretation of our cases\npresents an important question that merits serious appel-\nlate review.\n  The alternative basis for the District Court’s holding—\nthat petitioners did not present sufficient evidence of\nthreatened harm—also presents an important legal issue,\nnamely, the type and quantity of proof that persons object-\ning to disclosure must adduce. As Judge N. R. Smith\nobserved below, petitioners adduced evidence that some\nsupporters of the referendum “received death threats,”\n“had their children threatened,” and suffered various\nindignities, No. 11–35854 (CA9, Nov. 16, 2011), p. 8 (dis-\nsenting opinion), but according to the District Court, this\nwas not enough. Whether the standard of proof applied by\nthe District Court provides any real protection for persons\nwho are threatened with retaliation for asserting their\nFirst Amendment rights is an important issue that merits\nconsidered appellate review.\n  There has been no such review in this case. When\npetitioners took an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the panel\ndenied the stay application over Judge Smith’s protest\nthat the majority had “race[d] to decide the case at [a]\npreliminary stage based on incomplete information and\nwithout even reviewing the record.” Id., at 3.\n  This Court now takes a similar approach. Particularly\nsince the referendum at issue went down to defeat more\nthan two years ago, the Court’s haste is hard to under-\nstand. I would grant a stay at least until the Court has\nhad an opportunity to review the record and to consider\nthe parties’ arguments.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/617702/", "sha1": "9b666de78c5adea4ccf5dfd52052cd42cafb7b74", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-11-22T17:02:33"}
