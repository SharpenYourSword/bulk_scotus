S. at knifepoint. Cross claimed that A. S. had\nconsented to sex in exchange for money and drugs. De-\nspite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A. S. testified as\nthe State\u2019s primary witness at Cross\u2019 trial in November\n1999 and was cross-examined by Cross\u2019 attorney. Accord-\ning to the trial judge, A. S.\u2019s testimony was halting. The\njury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to\nreach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial\njudge declared a mistrial. The State decided to retry\nCross on those counts, and the retrial was scheduled for\nMarch 29, 2000.\n   On March 20, 2000, the prosecutor informed the trial\njudge that A. S. could not be located. A week later, on\nMarch 28, the State moved to have A. S. declared unavail-\nable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second\ntrial.\n   The State represented that A. S. had said after the first\ntrial that she was willing to testify at the retrial. The\n2                         HARDY v.

J,\np. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J). On March 3, however, A. S.\u2019s\nmother and brother told the State\u2019s investigator that they\ndid not know where she was, and A. S.\u2019s mother reported\nthat A. S. was \u201cvery fearful and very concerned\u201d about\ntestifying again. Record, Exh. K, p. E\u20139 (hereinafter Exh.\nK); id., at E\u201314. On March 9 or 10, the investigator inter-\nviewed A. S.\u2019s father, who also had \u201cno idea where [A. S.]\nwas.\u201d Id., at E\u201312. The father\u2019s only suggestion was to\nrefer the investigator back to the mother.\n  On March 10, the State learned from A. S.\u2019s mother that\nA. S. had run away from home the day before and had not\nreturned.* Exh. J, at 111. Thereafter, \u201cefforts began by\nmembers of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and\nby law enforcement personnel to locate\u201d A. S. Id., at 112.\nThe State averred that its efforts included the following:\n     \u201cConstant personal visits to the home of [A. S.] and\n     her mother, at all hours of the day and night. This\n     is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault\n     occurred.\n     \u201cPersonal visits to the home of [A. S.\u2019s] father. This\n     is where the victim lived when the sexual assault\n     occurred.\n     \u201cPersonal conversations, in English and in Spanish,\n     with the victim\u2019s mother, father, and other family\n     members.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The State\u2019s motion does not mention the investigator\u2019s March 3 visit\nwith A.

See Exh. K, at E\u201314 to E\u201317, E\u201321;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The State\u2019s investigator was\nassisted in the search by a police detective and a victim\u2019s\nadvocate. The detective visited A. S.\u2019s father\u2019s home once\nand went to A. S.\u2019s mother\u2019s home\u2014A. S.\u2019s last-known\nresidence\u2014on numerous occasions, approximately once\nevery three days, at different hours of the day and night.\nExh. K, at E\uf02d27 to E\uf02d29, E\uf02d35. On one visit, A. S.\u2019s moth-\ner told the victim\u2019s advocate that A. S. could be staying\nwith an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away.\nId., at E\uf02d42 to E\uf02d43. The police detective visited the\nWaukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend\u2019s\nmother that she had not seen A. S. in several months and\nthat A. S. was not staying with her or her son. Id., at\nE\uf02d33 to E\uf02d34. The efforts to find A. S. continued until\nMarch 28, the day of the hearing on the State\u2019s motion.\nId., at E\uf02d30.\n4                     HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   On a final visit to A. S.\u2019s mother on the morning of\nMarch 28, the mother informed the police detective that\nA. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had\nsaid that she did not want to testify and would not return\nto Chicago. See id., at E\u201330; 632 F. 3d 356, 359 (CA7\n2011). A. S.\u2019s mother told the detective that she still did\nnot know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K,\nat E\uf02d30.\n   The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion and admitted\nA. S.\u2019s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that\nthe State had \u201cexpended efforts that go way beyond due\ndiligence,\u201d id., at E\u201365, and that A. S. \u201cha[d] made it\nimpossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of\nwhat I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],\u201d id.,\nat E\u201367. At Cross\u2019 retrial, a legal intern from the State\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s office read A. S.\u2019s prior, cross-examined testi-\nmony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the\nclerk\u2019s reading of the prior testimony did not include the\nlong pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk\nread the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F. 3d,\nat 359. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual\nassault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal\nsexual assault.\n   On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that\nA. S. was unavailable because \u201c[i]t is clear from her tele-\nphone conversation with her mother that she was not in\nthe city\u201d and \u201calso evident that she was in hiding and did\nnot want to be located.\u201d Id., at 83a. The court found that\nthe State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to\nlocate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed\nthe introduction of A. S.\u2019s cross-examined testimony from\nthe first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross\u2019 convic-\ntions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied\nCross\u2019 petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross\u2019\npetition for a writ of certiorari.\n   Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued,\namong other things, that the state court had unreason-\nably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-\ndents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment precludes the admission of the prior testimo-\nny of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecu-\ntion made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant\u2019s\npresence at trial. The District Court denied Cross\u2019 peti-\ntion, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the\nSeventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unrea-\nsonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient\neffort to secure A. S.\u2019s presence at the retrial. The Sev-\nenth Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.\u2019s testimony\nand the manner of her testimony at the first trial.\n   In Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719 (1968), we held that \u201ca\nwitness is not \u2018unavailable\u2019 for purposes of the . . . confron-\ntation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities\nhave made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at\ntrial.\u201d Id., at 724\u2013725. In Barber, we held that a witness\nhad not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause pur-\nposes because the State, which could have brought the\nwitness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad\ntestificandum, had \u201cmade absolutely no effort to obtain\n[his] presence . . . at trial\u201d apart from determining that he\nwas serving a sentence in a federal prison. Id., at 723; see\nalso id., at 725.\n   We again addressed the question of witness unavailabil-\nity in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). In that case,\nwe held, the State had discharged its \u201cduty of good-faith\neffort.\u201d Id., at 75. We noted that the prosecutor had\nspoken to the witness\u2019 mother, who reported that she had\nno knowledge of her daughter\u2019s whereabouts and \u201cknew of\nno way to reach [her] even in an emergency.\u201d Ibid. We\nalso noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the\nwitness\u2019 name to her parents\u2019 residence over a 4-month\n6                      HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nperiod prior to the trial. \u201c \u2018The lengths to which the prose-\ncution must go to produce a witness,\u2019 \u201d the Court made\nclear, \u201c \u2018is a question of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 74 (quot-\ning California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 189, n. 22 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there\nwere some additional steps that the prosecutor might have\ntaken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that\n\u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.\u201d\n448 U. S., at 75. But \u201cthe great improbability that such\nefforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\nwould have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any\nintimation that a concept of reasonableness required their\nexecution.\u201d Id., at 76.\n   In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of\nAppeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith\nsearch for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether\nor not the state court went too far in characterizing the\nprosecution\u2019s efforts as \u201csuperhuman,\u201d the state court\nidentified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and\napplied it in a reasonable manner.\n   The Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s efforts were\ninadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh\nCircuit faulted the State for failing to contact \u201cA. S.\u2019s\ncurrent boyfriend\u2014whom she was with just moments\nbefore the alleged assault\u2014or any of her other friends in\nthe Chicago area.\u201d 632 F. 3d, at 362. But the record does\nnot show that any of A. S.\u2019s family members or any other\npersons interviewed by the State provided any reason to\nbelieve that any of these individuals had information\nabout A. S.\u2019s whereabouts.\n   Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because\nit did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where\nA. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court\u2019s own\nopinion observed that the information about A. S.\u2019s en-\nrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nnot \u201cnoteworthy\u201d or \u201cparticularly helpful.\u201d Ibid. Since\nA. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at\nE\u201342, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the\nschool had better information about A. S.\u2019s location than\ndid the members of her family.\n   Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s\nefforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve\nher with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testify-\ning at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear\nabout testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless\nappeared in court and had taken the stand. The State\nrepresented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to\ntestify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have\nnever held that the prosecution must have issued a sub-\npoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into\nhiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,\nand the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a\nsexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she\nis willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.\n   As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears\nbefore trial, it is always possible to think of additional\nsteps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the\nwitness\u2019 presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth\nAmendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust\nevery avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\nAnd, more to the point, the deferential standard of review\nset out in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) does not permit a federal\ncourt to overturn a state court\u2019s decision on the question of\nunavailability merely because the federal court identifies\nadditional steps that might have been taken. Under\nAEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it\ncannot be disturbed.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross\u2019 motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n\n                                                     Reversed.\n",

S. was not staying with her or her son. Id., at\nE\uf02d33 to E\uf02d34. The efforts to find A. S. continued until\nMarch 28, the day of the hearing on the State\u2019s motion.\nId., at E\uf02d30.\n4                     HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   On a final visit to A. S.\u2019s mother on the morning of\nMarch 28, the mother informed the police detective that\nA. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had\nsaid that she did not want to testify and would not return\nto Chicago. See id., at E\u201330; 632 F. 3d 356, 359 (CA7\n2011). A. S.\u2019s mother told the detective that she still did\nnot know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K,\nat E\uf02d30.\n   The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion and admitted\nA. S.\u2019s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that\nthe State had \u201cexpended efforts that go way beyond due\ndiligence,\u201d id., at E\u201365, and that A. S. \u201cha[d] made it\nimpossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of\nwhat I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],\u201d id.,\nat E\u201367. At Cross\u2019 retrial, a legal intern from the State\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s office read A. S.\u2019s prior, cross-examined testi-\nmony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the\nclerk\u2019s reading of the prior testimony did not include the\nlong pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk\nread the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F. 3d,\nat 359. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual\nassault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal\nsexual assault.\n   On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that\nA. S. was unavailable because \u201c[i]t is clear from her tele-\nphone conversation with her mother that she was not in\nthe city\u201d and \u201calso evident that she was in hiding and did\nnot want to be located.\u201d Id., at 83a. The court found that\nthe State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to\nlocate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed\nthe introduction of A. S.\u2019s cross-examined testimony from\nthe first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross\u2019 convic-\ntions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied\nCross\u2019 petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross\u2019\npetition for a writ of certiorari.\n   Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued,\namong other things, that the state court had unreason-\nably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-\ndents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment precludes the admission of the prior testimo-\nny of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecu-\ntion made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant\u2019s\npresence at trial. The District Court denied Cross\u2019 peti-\ntion, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the\nSeventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unrea-\nsonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient\neffort to secure A. S.\u2019s presence at the retrial. The Sev-\nenth Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.\u2019s testimony\nand the manner of her testimony at the first trial.\n   In Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719 (1968), we held that \u201ca\nwitness is not \u2018unavailable\u2019 for purposes of the . . . confron-\ntation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities\nhave made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at\ntrial.\u201d Id., at 724\u2013725. In Barber, we held that a witness\nhad not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause pur-\nposes because the State, which could have brought the\nwitness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad\ntestificandum, had \u201cmade absolutely no effort to obtain\n[his] presence . . . at trial\u201d apart from determining that he\nwas serving a sentence in a federal prison. Id., at 723; see\nalso id., at 725.\n   We again addressed the question of witness unavailabil-\nity in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). In that case,\nwe held, the State had discharged its \u201cduty of good-faith\neffort.\u201d Id., at 75. We noted that the prosecutor had\nspoken to the witness\u2019 mother, who reported that she had\nno knowledge of her daughter\u2019s whereabouts and \u201cknew of\nno way to reach [her] even in an emergency.\u201d Ibid. We\nalso noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the\nwitness\u2019 name to her parents\u2019 residence over a 4-month\n6                      HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nperiod prior to the trial. \u201c \u2018The lengths to which the prose-\ncution must go to produce a witness,\u2019 \u201d the Court made\nclear, \u201c \u2018is a question of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 74 (quot-\ning California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 189, n. 22 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there\nwere some additional steps that the prosecutor might have\ntaken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that\n\u201c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.\u201d\n448 U. S., at 75. But \u201cthe great improbability that such\nefforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\nwould have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any\nintimation that a concept of reasonableness required their\nexecution.\u201d Id., at 76.\n   In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of\nAppeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith\nsearch for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether\nor not the state court went too far in characterizing the\nprosecution\u2019s efforts as \u201csuperhuman,\u201d the state court\nidentified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and\napplied it in a reasonable manner.\n   The Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s efforts were\ninadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh\nCircuit faulted the State for failing to contact \u201cA. S.\u2019s\ncurrent boyfriend\u2014whom she was with just moments\nbefore the alleged assault\u2014or any of her other friends in\nthe Chicago area.\u201d 632 F. 3d, at 362. But the record does\nnot show that any of A. S.\u2019s family members or any other\npersons interviewed by the State provided any reason to\nbelieve that any of these individuals had information\nabout A. S.\u2019s whereabouts.\n   Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because\nit did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where\nA. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court\u2019s own\nopinion observed that the information about A. S.\u2019s en-\nrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nnot \u201cnoteworthy\u201d or \u201cparticularly helpful.\u201d Ibid. Since\nA. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at\nE\u201342, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the\nschool had better information about A. S.\u2019s location than\ndid the members of her family.\n   Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State\u2019s\nefforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve\nher with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testify-\ning at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear\nabout testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless\nappeared in court and had taken the stand. The State\nrepresented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to\ntestify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have\nnever held that the prosecution must have issued a sub-\npoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into\nhiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,\nand the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a\nsexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she\nis willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.\n   As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears\nbefore trial, it is always possible to think of additional\nsteps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the\nwitness\u2019 presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth\nAmendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust\nevery avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\nAnd, more to the point, the deferential standard of review\nset out in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) does not permit a federal\ncourt to overturn a state court\u2019s decision on the question of\nunavailability merely because the federal court identifies\nadditional steps that might have been taken. Under\nAEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it\ncannot be disturbed.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross\u2019 motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n\n                                                     Reversed.\n</pre>",
