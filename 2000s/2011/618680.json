HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 10–694.      Argued October 12, 2011—Decided December 12, 2011\nFederal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from ad-\n  mission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously ad-\n  mitted. Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different\n  procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a uni-\n  fied “removal proceeding” for exclusions and deportations alike. But\n  the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substan-\n  tive grounds for the two actions. One list specifies what crimes ren-\n  der an alien excludable, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a), while another—\n  sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list specifies what\n  crimes render an alien deportable, see §1227(a).\n     Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\n  Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an\n  excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United\n  States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country\n  and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.\n  By its terms, §212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the\n  Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to de-\n  portation proceedings as well. Although Congress substituted a nar-\n  rower discretionary remedy for §212(c) in 1996, see §1229b, §212(c)’s\n  broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based\n  on a guilty plea entered before §212(c)’s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 533\n  U. S. 289, 326.\n     In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks\n  the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Se-\n  curity (DHS) as the basis for exclusion. Unless that ground is one of\n  the two falling outside §212(c)’s scope, the alien is eligible for discre-\n  tionary relief. The BIA then determines whether to grant relief\n  based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.\n2                        JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      This case concerns the BIA’s method for applying §212(c) in the\n    deportation context. The BIA’s approach, known as the “comparable-\n    grounds” rule, evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has\n    a close analogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. If the de-\n    portation ground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equivalent”\n    to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek §212(c)\n    relief. But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer\n    offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief,\n    even if the alien’s particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.\n      Petitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United\n    States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to\n    voluntary manslaughter in 1988. After he pleaded guilty to another\n    crime in 2005, DHS commenced a deportation action, charging him\n    with having committed an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of\n    violence” based on his manslaughter conviction. The Immigration\n    Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding\n    Judulang ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of violence”\n    deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground. The\n    Ninth Circuit, having previously upheld the BIA’s comparable-\n    grounds rule, denied Judulang’s petition for review.\nHeld: The BIA’s policy for applying §212(c) in deportation cases is “arbi-\n trary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\n U. S. C. §706(2)(A). Pp. 9–21.\n    (a) While agencies have expertise and experience in administering\n their statutes that no court may properly ignore, courts retain a nar-\n row but important role in ensuring that agencies have engaged in\n reasoned decisionmaking. Thus, in reviewing the BIA’s action, this\n Court must assess, among other matters, “whether the decision was\n based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there\n has been a clear error of judgment.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of\n United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.\n 29, 43. That task involves examining the reasons for agency deci-\n sions, or the absence of such reasons.\n    The comparable-grounds approach cannot survive scrutiny under\n this standard. By hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discre-\n tionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory cate-\n gories—a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this\n country—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned\n manner. Pp. 9–10.\n    (b) Even if the BIA has legitimate reasons for limiting §212(c)’s\n scope in deportation cases, it must do so in some rational way. In\n other words, the BIA must use an approach that is tied to the pur-\n poses of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the\n immigration system. The comparable-grounds rule has no connection\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nto these factors. Instead, it makes §212(c) eligibility turn on an irrel-\nevant comparison between statutory provisions. Whether the set of\noffenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an\nexclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien\nwhose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to\nstay in this country. Here, Judulang was found ineligible for §212(c)\nrelief because the “crime of violence” deportation ground includes a\nfew offenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use\nof a vehicle—not found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion\nground. But the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in\nthe deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of Judulang’s case.\n   The BIA’s approach has other odd features. In applying the com-\nparable-grounds rule, the BIA has denied relief to aliens whose de-\nportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion\nground. Yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of al-\niens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of\nthat group. In addition, the outcome of the comparable-grounds\nanalysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision. An alien’s prior\nconviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds, only\none of which corresponds to an exclusion ground. In such cases, an\nalien’s eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual official’s deci-\nsion as to which deportation ground to charge. An alien appearing\nbefore one official may suffer deportation, while an identically situat-\ned alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this\ncountry.\n   In short, the comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any\nfactors relevant to whether an alien should be deported. Instead, it\nturns deportation decisions into a “sport of chance.” Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 455. That is what the APA’s “arbitrary and ca-\npricious” standard is designed to prevent. Pp. 10–15.\n   (c) The Government’s arguments in defense of the comparable-\ngrounds rule are not persuasive. First, §212(c)’s text does not sup-\nport the rule. That section cannot provide a textual anchor for any\nmethod of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because\nit addresses only exclusion. Second, the history of the comparable-\ngrounds rule does not work in the Government’s favor. The BIA re-\npeatedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to deportable\naliens, settling on the current rule only in 2005. Third, the Govern-\nment’s claim that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money\nfalls short. Cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider\nin many contexts, but cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary\nagency policy. In any event, it is unclear that the comparable-\ngrounds rule saves money when compared with alternative ap-\nproaches. Pp. 16–21.\n4                       JUDULANG v.

ERIC H. HOLDER,\n          JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                             [December 12, 2011]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the Board of Immigration Appeals’\n(BIA or Board) policy for deciding when resident aliens\nmay apply to the Attorney General for relief from deporta-\ntion under a now-repealed provision of the immigration\nlaws. We hold that the BIA’s approach is arbitrary and\ncapricious.\n   The legal background of this case is complex, but the\nprinciple guiding our decision is anything but. When an\nadministrative agency sets policy, it must provide a rea-\nsoned explanation for its action. That is not a high bar,\nbut it is an unwavering one. Here, the BIA has failed to\nmeet it.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of\naliens from admission to this country and the deportation\nof aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two\nkinds of action occurred in different procedural settings,\nwith an alien seeking entry (whether for the first time or\nupon return from a trip abroad) placed in an “exclusion\n2                      JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproceeding” and an alien already here channeled to a\n“deportation proceeding.” See Landon v. Plasencia, 459\nU. S. 21, 25–26 (1982) (comparing the two). Since that\ntime, the Government has used a unified procedure,\nknown as a “removal proceeding,” for exclusions and de-\nportations alike. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. But the\nstatutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have\nalways varied. Now, as before, the immigration laws\nprovide two separate lists of substantive grounds, princi-\npally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions.\nOne list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien\nexcludable (or in the term the statute now uses, “inadmis-\nsible”), see §1182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another—\nsometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list\nspecifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable\nfrom the country, see §1227(a).\n  An additional, historic difference between exclusion\nand deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney\nGeneral to grant an alien discretionary relief. Until re-\npealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized\nthe Attorney General to admit certain excludable aliens.\nSee also §136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to\n§212(c)). The Attorney General could order this relief\nwhen the alien had lawfully resided in the United States\nfor at least seven years before temporarily leaving the\ncountry, unless the alien was excludable on one of two\nspecified grounds. See §1182(c) (1994 ed.).1 But by its\n——————\n    1 Therelevant part of §212(c), in the version of the exclusion statute\nall parties use, read as follows:\n  “Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily\nproceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,\nand who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\nconsecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section\n(other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nterms, §212(c) did not apply when an alien was being\ndeported.\n   This discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in\na case called Matter of L-, 1 I. & N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading\nto the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deporta-\ntion case. L- was a permanent resident of the United\nStates who had been convicted of larceny. Although L-’s\ncrime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and\nthen returned to the United States without any immigra-\ntion official’s preventing his entry. A few months later,\nthe Government caught up with L- and initiated a depor-\ntation action based on his larceny conviction. Had the\nGovernment apprehended L- at the border a short while\nearlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion pro-\nceeding where he could have applied for discretionary\nrelief. But because L- was instead in a deportation pro-\nceeding, no such relief was available. Responding to this\napparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on\nreferral of the case from the BIA) determined that L- could\nreceive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, “should be permitted to\nmake the same appeal to discretion that he could have\nmade if denied admission” when returning from his recent\ntrip. Id., at 6. In accord with this decision, the BIA\nadopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceed-\nings to apply for discretionary relief under §212(c) when-\never they had left and reentered the country after be-\ncoming deportable. See Matter of S-, 6 I. & N. Dec. 392,\n394–396 (1954).\n   But this approach created another peculiar asymmetry:\nDeportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned\ncould receive §212(c) relief, while those who had never left\n\n——————\n  The parenthetical clause of this section prevented the Attorney Gen-\neral from waiving exclusion for aliens who posed a threat to national\nsecurity, §1182(a)(3), and aliens who engaged in international child\nabduction, §1182(a)(9)(C).\n4                   JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncould not. In Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d 268 (1976), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that\nthis disparity violated equal protection. Id., at 273 (“[A]n\nalien whose ties with this country are so strong that he\nhas never departed after his initial entry should receive at\nleast as much consideration as an individual who may\nleave and return from time to time”). The BIA acquiesced\nin the Second Circuit’s decision, see Matter of Silva, 16\nI. & N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying §212(c) in deporta-\ntion proceedings regardless of an alien’s travel history.\n   All this might have become academic when Congress\nrepealed §212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretion-\nary remedy, known as “cancellation of removal,” which is\navailable in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable\nand deportable aliens alike. See 8 U. S. C. §1229b. But in\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 326 (2001), this Court con-\ncluded that the broader relief afforded by §212(c) must\nremain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien\nwhose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before\n§212(c)’s repeal. We reasoned that aliens had agreed to\nthose pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in\nmind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport\nwith “ ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable\nreliance, and settled expectations.’ ” Id., at 323 (quoting\nLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994)).\nAccordingly, §212(c) has had an afterlife for resident\naliens with old criminal convictions.\n   When the BIA is deciding whether to exclude such an\nalien, applying §212(c) is an easy matter. The Board\nfirst checks the statutory ground that the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis\nfor exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that\nDHS has charged the alien with previously committing\na “crime involving moral turpitude,” see 8 U. S. C.\n§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Unless the charged ground is one of\nthe pair falling outside §212(c)’s scope, see n. 1, supra, the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nalien is eligible for discretionary relief. The Board then\ndetermines whether to grant that relief based on such\nfactors as “the seriousness of the offense, evidence of\neither rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the\nalien’s residence, the impact of deportation on the family,\nthe number of citizens in the family, and the character of\nany service in the Armed Forces.” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n296, n. 5.\n  By contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to deport\nan alien, applying §212(c) becomes a tricky business.\nRecall that §212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion\ndecisions. So the question arises: How is the BIA to de-\ntermine when an alien should receive §212(c) relief in the\ndeportation context?\n  One approach that the BIA formerly used considered\nhow the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding. To\nperform this analysis, the Board would first determine\nwhether the criminal conviction making the alien deporta-\nble fell within a statutory ground for exclusion. Almost all\nconvictions did so, largely because the “crime involving\nmoral turpitude” ground encompasses so many offenses.2\nAssuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board\nwould mimic its approach in exclusion cases—first making\nsure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from\n§212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis. See\nMatter of Tanori, 15 I. & N. Dec. 566, 567–568 (1976);\nIn re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">23269892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).\n  A second approach is the one challenged here; definitive-\nly adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it\noften is called the “comparable-grounds” rule. See, e.g., De\nla Rosa v. U. S. Attorney General, 579 F. 3d 1327, 1332\n——————\n   2 Firearms offenses are the most significant crimes falling outside the\n\nstatutory grounds for exclusion. See Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, 20\nI. & N. Dec. 262, 282, n. 4 (1990).\n6                      JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(CA11 2009).       That approach evaluates whether the\nground for deportation charged in a case has a close ana-\nlogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. See In re\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); In re Brieva-Perez,\n23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 772–773 (2005).3 If the deportation\nground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equiva-\nlent” to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground,\nthen the alien can seek §212(c) relief. Blake, 23 I. & N.\nDec., at 728. But if the deportation ground charged covers\nsignificantly different or more or fewer offenses than any\nexclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver.\nSuch a divergence makes §212(c) inapplicable even if the\nparticular offense committed by the alien falls within an\nexclusion ground.\n  Two contrasting examples from the BIA’s cases\nmay help to illustrate this approach. Take first an\nalien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom\nDHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has commit-\nted an “aggravated felony” involving “illicit trafficking\nin a controlled substance.” 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(B),\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under the comparable-grounds rule, the\nimmigration judge would look to see if that deportation\nground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclu-\nsion ground. And according to the BIA in Matter of Meza,\n20 I. & N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an ade-\nquate match—the exclusion ground applicable to aliens\nwho have committed offenses “relating to a controlled\nsubstance,” 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).\n  Now consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual\nabuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the\nground that he has committed an “aggravated felony”\n\n——————\n    3 Blake\n          and Brieva-Perez clarified a 2004 regulation issued by the BIA\nstating that an alien is ineligible for §212(c) relief when deportable “on\na ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212.”\n8 CFR §1212.3(f)(5) (2010).\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving “sexual abuse of a minor.” §§1101(a)(43)(A),\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). May this alien seek §212(c) relief ?\nAccording to the BIA, he may not do so—not because his\ncrime is too serious (that is irrelevant to the analysis), but\ninstead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers\nsubstantially the same offenses. To be sure, the alien’s\nown offense is a “crime involving moral turpitude,” 8\nU. S. C. §1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and so fits within an exclusion\nground. Indeed, that will be true of most or all offenses\nincluded in this deportation category. See supra, at 5.\nBut on the BIA’s view, the “moral turpitude” exclusion\nground “addresses a distinctly different and much broader\ncategory of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual\nabuse of a minor charge.” Blake, 23 I. & N. Dec., at 728.\nAnd the much greater sweep of the exclusion ground\nprevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from\ndeportation.4\n   Those mathematically inclined might think of the\ncomparable-grounds approach as employing Venn dia-\ngrams. Within one circle are all the criminal offenses com-\nposing the particular ground of deportation charged. Within\nother circles are the offenses composing the various exclu-\nsion grounds. When, but only when, the “deportation\ncircle” sufficiently corresponds to one of the “exclusion\ncircles” may an alien apply for §212(c) relief.\n\n\n——————\n  4 Careful readers may note that the example involving controlled\n\nsubstances offered in the last paragraph also involves an exclusion\nground that sweeps more broadly than the deportation ground charged.\nThe deportation ground requires “trafficking” in a controlled substance,\nwhereas the exclusion ground includes all possession offenses as well.\nThe BIA nonetheless held in Meza that the degree of overlap between\nthe two grounds was sufficient to make the alien eligible for §212(c)\nrelief. That holding reveals the broad discretion that the BIA currently\nexercises in deciding when two statutory grounds are comparable\nenough.\n8                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Petitioner Joel Judulang is a native of the Philippines\nwho entered the United States in 1974 at the age of eight.\nSince that time, he has lived continuously in this country\nas a lawful permanent resident. In 1988, Judulang took\npart in a fight in which another person shot and killed\nsomeone. Judulang was charged as an accessory and\neventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He\nreceived a 6-year suspended sentence and was released on\nprobation immediately after his plea.\n   In 2005, after Judulang pleaded guilty to another crimi-\nnal offense (this one involving theft), DHS commenced an\naction to deport him. DHS charged Judulang with having\ncommitted an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of\nviolence,” based on his old manslaughter conviction. 8\nU. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).5 The Immi-\ngration Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the\nBIA affirmed. As part of its decision, the BIA considered\nwhether Judulang could apply for §212(c) relief. It held\nthat he could not do so because the “crime of violence”\ndeportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion\nground, including the one for crimes involving moral\nturpitude. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit denied Judulang’s petition for review\nin reliance on circuit precedent upholding the BIA’s\ncomparable-grounds approach. Judulang v. Gonzales,\n249 Fed. Appx. 499, 502 (2007) (citing Abebe v. Gonzales,\n493 F. 3d 1092 (2007)).\n   We granted certiorari, 563 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve a\ncircuit split on the approach’s validity.6 We now reverse.\n——————\n  5 DHS also charged two other grounds for deportation, but the BIA\n\ndid not rule on those grounds and they are not before us.\n  6 Compare Blake v. Carbone, 489 F. 3d 88, 103 (CA2 2007) (rejecting\n\nthe BIA’s approach and holding instead that “[i]f the offense that\nrenders [an alien] deportable would render a similarly situated [alien]\nexcludable, the deportable [alien] is eligible for a waiver of deporta-\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

S. C. §706(2)(A).7 The scope of our review\nunder this standard is “narrow”; as we have often recog-\nnized, “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of\nthe agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,\n43 (1983); see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.\nVolpe, 401 U. S. 402, 416 (1971). Agencies, the BIA among\nthem, have expertise and experience in administering\ntheir statutes that no court can properly ignore. But\ncourts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring\nthat agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.\nWhen reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among\nother matters, “ ‘whether the decision was based on a\nconsideration of the relevant factors and whether there\n—————— \n\ntion”), with Koussan v. Holder, 556 F. 3d 403, 412–414 (CA6 2009)\n\n(upholding the comparable-grounds policy); Caroleo v. Gonzales, 476 \n\nF. 3d 158, 162–163, 168 (CA3 2007) (same); Kim v. Gonzales, 468 F. 3d\n58, 62–63 (CA1 2006) (same).\n   7 The Government urges us instead to analyze this case under the\n\nsecond step of the test we announced in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), to govern\njudicial review of an agency’s statutory interpretations. See Brief for\nRespondent 19. Were we to do so, our analysis would be the same,\nbecause under Chevron step two, we ask whether an agency interpreta-\ntion is “ ‘arbitrary or capricious in substance.’ ” Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 7) (quoting Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541\nU. S. 232, 242 (2004)). But we think the more apt analytic framework\nin this case is standard “arbitrary [or] capricious” review under the\nAPA. The BIA’s comparable-grounds policy, as articulated in In re\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722 (2005) and In re Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n766 (2005), is not an interpretation of any statutory language—nor\ncould it be, given that §212(c) does not mention deportation cases, see\ninfra, at 16–17, and n. 11.\n10                    JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhas been a clear error of judgment.’ ” State Farm, 463\nU. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-\nBest Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 285 (1974)). That\ntask involves examining the reasons for agency deci-\nsions—or, as the case may be, the absence of such reasons.\nSee FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,\n515 (2009) (noting “the requirement that an agency pro-\nvide reasoned explanation for its action”).\n  The BIA has flunked that test here. By hinging a de-\nportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief on the\nchance correspondence between statutory categories—a\nmatter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this\ncountry—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a\nreasoned manner.\n                              A\n   The parties here spend much time disputing whether\nthe BIA must make discretionary relief available to de-\nportable and excludable aliens on identical terms. As this\ncase illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does\nnot do so. If Judulang were seeking entry to this country,\nhe would be eligible for §212(c) relief; voluntary man-\nslaughter is “a crime involving moral turpitude,” and so\nhis conviction falls within an exclusion ground. But Judu-\nlang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the\n“crime of violence” ground charged in his case does not\nmatch any exclusion ground (including the one for “turpi-\ntudinous” crimes). See infra, at 13. Judulang argues that\nthis disparity is impermissible because any disparity\nbetween excludable and deportable aliens is impermissi-\nble: If an alien may seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion\ncase, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deporta-\ntion case. See Brief for Petitioner 47–51.8 But the Gov-\n——————\n  8 Judulang also argues that the BIA is making an impermissible dis-\n\ntinction between two groups of deportable aliens—those who have\nrecently left and returned to the country and those who have not.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nernment notes that the immigration laws have always\ndrawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation.\nSee Brief for Respondent 51. And the Government presses\na policy reason for making §212(c) relief more readily\navailable in exclusion cases. Doing so, it argues, will\nprovide an incentive for some resident aliens (i.e., those\neligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to\nreport themselves to immigration officials, by applying for\nadvance permission to exit and reenter the country. In\ncontrast, applying §212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens\nto “try to evade immigration officials for as long as possi-\nble,” because they could in any event “seek [discretionary]\nrelief if caught.” Id., at 52.\n   In the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and\nwe do not resolve it. The BIA may well have legitimate\nreasons for limiting §212(c)’s scope in deportation cases.\nBut still, it must do so in some rational way. If the BIA\nproposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible\nto seek §212(c) relief by flipping a coin—heads an alien\nmay apply for relief, tails he may not—we would reverse\nthe policy in an instant. That is because agency action\nmust be based on non-arbitrary, “ ‘relevant factors,’ ” State\n\n——————\nAccording to Judulang, the BIA is treating the former as if they were\nseeking admission, while applying the “comparable grounds” approach\nonly to the latter. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–18. That is the\nkind of distinction the Second Circuit held in Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d\n268 (1976), violated equal protection. See supra, at 3–4. But the\nGovernment contends that it is drawing no such line—that it is apply-\ning the comparable-grounds policy to all deportable aliens. Brief for\nRespondent 29. We think the available evidence tends to support the\nGovernment’s representation.

But in light of our holding that the\ncomparable-grounds approach is arbitrary and capricious, we need not\nresolve this dispute about the BIA’s practice.\n12                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., 419\nU. S., at 285), which here means that the BIA’s approach\nmust be tied, even if loosely, to the purposes of the immi-\ngration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigra-\ntion system. A method for disfavoring deportable aliens\nthat bears no relation to these matters—that neither\nfocuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the\ncountry—is arbitrary and capricious. And that is true\nregardless whether the BIA might have acted to limit the\nclass of deportable aliens eligible for §212(c) relief on\nother, more rational bases.\n   The problem with the comparable-grounds policy is that\nit does not impose such a reasonable limitation. Rather\nthan considering factors that might be thought germane to\nthe deportation decision, that policy hinges §212(c) eligi-\nbility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory\nprovisions. Recall that the BIA asks whether the set of\noffenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with\nthe set in an exclusion ground. But so what if it does?\nDoes an alien charged with a particular deportation\nground become more worthy of relief because that ground\nhappens to match up with another? Or less worthy of\nrelief because the ground does not? The comparison in no\nway changes the alien’s prior offense or his other attrib-\nutes and circumstances. So it is difficult to see why that\ncomparison should matter.         Each of these statutory\ngrounds contains a slew of offenses. Whether each con-\ntains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a\ndeportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both\ngrounds merits the ability to seek a waiver.9\n——————\n  9 The case would be different if Congress had intended for §212(c)\n\nrelief to depend on the interaction of exclusion grounds and deportation\ngrounds. But the Government has presented us with no evidence to\nthis effect, nor have we found any. See Blake, 489 F. 3d, at 102 (Con-\ngress never contemplated, in drafting the immigration laws, “that its\ngrounds of deportation would have any connection with the grounds of\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   This case well illustrates the point. In commencing\nJudulang’s deportation proceeding, the Government\ncharged him with an “aggravated felony” involving a\n“crime of violence” based on his prior manslaughter con-\nviction. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a–12a. That made\nhim ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of vio-\nlence” deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap\nwith the most similar exclusion ground, for “crime[s]\ninvolving moral turpitude.” The problem, according to the\nBIA, is that the “crime of violence” ground includes a few\noffenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthor-\nized use of a vehicle—that the “moral turpitude” ground\ndoes not. See Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec., at 772–773;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 28–29, 40–41. But this statutory differ-\nence in no way relates to Judulang—or to most other\naliens charged with committing a “crime of violence.”\nPerhaps aliens like Judulang should be eligible for §212(c)\nrelief, or perhaps they should not. But that determination\nis not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults\nand minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion.\nThat fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a\ncoin flip would be. It makes Judulang no less deserving of\nthe opportunity to seek discretionary relief—just as its\nconverse (the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries\nin the “moral turpitude” exclusion ground) would make\nhim no more so.\n   Or consider a different headscratching oddity of the\ncomparable-grounds approach—that it may deny §212(c)\neligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely\ninside an exclusion ground. The BIA’s Blake decision,\nnoted earlier, provides an example. See supra, at 6–7.\nThe deportation ground charged was “aggravated felony”\ninvolving “sexual abuse of a minor”; the closest exclusion\nground was, once again, a “crime [of] moral turpitude.” 23\n—————— \n\nexclusion” in the application of §212(c)); see also infra, at 16–17.\n\n14                    JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nI. & N. Dec., at 727. Here, the BIA’s problem was not that\nthe deportation ground covered too many offenses; all or\nvirtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes\nof moral turpitude. Rather, the BIA objected that the\ndeportation ground covered too few crimes—or put oppo-\nsitely, that “the moral turpitude ground of exclusion ad-\ndresses a . . . much broader category of offenses.” Id., at\n728. But providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad\nclass of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation\ncases to a subset of that group.10 (The better argument\nwould surely be the reverse—that giving relief in the one\ncontext supports doing so in the other.) Again, we do not\nsay today that the BIA must give all deportable aliens\nmeeting §212(c)’s requirements the chance to apply for a\nwaiver. See supra, at 11–12. The point is instead that the\nBIA cannot make that opportunity turn on the meaning-\nless matching of statutory grounds.\n   And underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet\nanother, because the outcome of the Board’s comparable-\ngrounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an\nimmigration official’s charging decision. This problem\narises because an alien’s prior conviction may fall within a\nnumber of deportation grounds, only one of which corre-\nsponds to an exclusion ground. Consider, for example, an\nalien who entered the country in 1984 and commit-\nted voluntary manslaughter in 1988. That person could\nbe charged (as Judulang was) with an “aggravated fel-\nony” involving a “crime of violence,” see 8 U. S. C.\n§§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). If so, the alien could\nnot seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable\nexclusion ground. But the alien also could be charged\n\n——————\n  10 Perhaps that is why the BIA declined to apply similar reasoning in\nMeza—a case also involving an exclusion ground that sweeps more\nbroadly than a deportation ground (although not to the same extent as\nin Blake). See supra, at 6.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith “a crime involving moral turpitude committed within\nfive years . . . after the date of admission,” see\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). And if that were the deportation\ncharge, the alien could apply for relief, because the ground\ncorresponds to the “moral turpitude” ground used in ex-\nclusion cases. See In re Salmon, 16 I. & N. Dec. 734\n(1978). So everything hangs on the charge. And the\nGovernment has provided no reason to think that immi-\ngration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding\nwhat charges to bring, or that those officials are exercising\ntheir charging discretion with §212(c) in mind. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 34–36. So at base everything hangs on the\nfortuity of an individual official’s decision. An alien ap-\npearing before one official may suffer deportation; an\nidentically situated alien appearing before another may\ngain the right to stay in this country.\n   In a foundational deportation case, this Court recog-\nnized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in\nthis country, and reversed an agency decision that would\n“make his right to remain here dependent on circumstan-\nces so fortuitous and capricious.” Delgadillo v. Carmichael,\n332 U. S. 388, 391 (1947). We think the policy before us\nsimilarly flawed. The comparable-grounds approach does\nnot rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or\nany group of aliens) should be deported. It instead distin-\nguishes among aliens—decides who should be eligible for\ndiscretionary relief and who should not—solely by compar-\ning the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories\ninto which an alien falls. The resulting Venn diagrams\nhave no connection to the goals of the deportation process\nor the rational operation of the immigration laws. Judge\nLearned Hand wrote in another early immigration case\nthat deportation decisions cannot be made a “sport of\nchance.” See Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F. 2d 878, 879\n(CA2 1947) (quoted in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449,\n455 (1963)). That is what the comparable-grounds rule\n16                  JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrings about, and that is what the APA’s “arbitrary and\ncapricious” standard is designed to thwart.\n                              B\n  The Government makes three arguments in defense of\nthe comparable-grounds rule—the first based on statutory\ntext, the next on history, the last on cost. We find none of\nthem persuasive.\n                               1\n   The Government initially contends that the comparable-\ngrounds approach is more faithful to “the statute’s lan-\nguage,” Brief for Respondent 21—or otherwise said, that\n“lifting that limit ‘would take immigration practice even\nfurther from the statutory text,’ ” id., at 22 (quoting Matter\nof Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I. & N. Dec. 262, 287 (1990)). In\nthe Government’s view, §212(c) is “phrased in terms of\nwaiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion”; that\nphrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative\nanalysis of grounds when applying §212(c) in the deporta-\ntion context. Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 34 (“[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach]\nmakes sense is because the statute only provides for relief\nfrom grounds of . . . exclusion”).\n   The first difficulty with this argument is that it is based\non an inaccurate description of the statute. Section 212(c)\ninstructs that certain resident aliens “may be admitted in\nthe discretion of the Attorney General” notwithstanding\nany of “the provisions of subsection (a) . . . (other than\nparagraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).\nSubsection (a) contains the full list of exclusion grounds;\nparagraphs (3) and (9)(C) (which deal with national secu-\nrity and international child abduction) are two among\nthese. What §212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attor-\nney General may admit any excludable alien, except if\nthe alien is charged with two specified grounds. And that\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmeans that once the Attorney General determines that\nthe alien is not being excluded for those two reasons, the\nground of exclusion no longer matters. At that point, the\nalien is eligible for relief, and the thing the Attorney Gen-\neral waives is not a particular exclusion ground, but the\nsimple denial of entry. So the premise of the Govern-\nment’s argument is wrong. And if the premise, so too the\nconclusion—that is, because §212(c)’s text is not “phrased\nin terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclu-\nsion,” Brief for Respondent 21, it cannot counsel a search\nfor corresponding grounds of deportation.\n  More fundamentally, the comparable-grounds approach\nwould not follow from §212(c) even were the Government\nright about the section’s phrasing. That is because §212(c)\nsimply has nothing to do with deportation: The provision\nwas not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for\ndeportation, any more than those grounds were designed\nto interact with the provision. Rather, §212(c) refers\nsolely to exclusion decisions; its extension to deportation\ncases arose from the agency’s extra-textual view that some\nsimilar relief should be available in that context to avoid\nunreasonable distinctions. Cf., e.g., Matter of L-, 1 I. & N.\nDec., at 5; see also supra, at 3–4.11 Accordingly, the text of\n§212(c), whether or not phrased in terms of “waiving\ngrounds of exclusion,” cannot support the BIA’s use of the\n——————\n  11 Congress amended §212(c), just five months before repealing it, to\n\ninclude a first-time reference to deportation cases. That amendment\nprohibited the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief to\naliens deportable on several specified grounds. See Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1277 (effective Apr. 24,\n1996). The change does not affect our analysis, nor does the Govern-\nment argue it should. As the Government notes, the amendment “did\nnot speak to the viability of the Board’s” comparable-grounds rule, but\ninstead made categorically ineligible for §212(c) relief “those deportable\nby reason of certain crimes.” Brief for Respondent 20. Presumably,\nCongress thought those crimes particularly incompatible with an\nalien’s continued residence in this country.\n18                 JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncomparable-grounds rule—or, for that matter, any other\nmethod for extending discretionary relief to deportation\ncases. We well understand the difficulties of operating in\nsuch a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Govern-\nment’s yearning for a textual anchor. But §212(c), no\nmatter how many times read or parsed, does not provide\none.\n                              2\n   In disputing Judulang’s contentions, the Government\nalso emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule’s vintage.\nSee Brief for Respondent 22–23, 30–43. As an initial\nmatter, we think this a slender reed to support a signifi-\ncant government policy. Arbitrary agency action becomes\nno less so by simple dint of repetition. (To use a prior\nanalogy, flipping coins to determine §212(c) eligibility\nwould remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the\nfirst.) And longstanding capriciousness receives no special\nexemption from the APA. In any event, we cannot detect\nthe consistency that the BIA claims has marked its ap-\nproach to this issue. To the contrary, the BIA has repeat-\nedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to de-\nportable aliens.\n   Prior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches.\nIn Matter of T-, 5 I. & N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example,\nthe BIA held that an alien was not eligible for §212(c)\nrelief because her “ground of deportation” did not appear\nin the exclusion statute. That decision anticipated the\ncomparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses.\nBut in Tanori, the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien\ncould apply for a waiver because “the same facts”—in that\ncase, a marijuana conviction—would have allowed him to\nseek §212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding. 15 I. & N.\nDec., at 568. That approach is more nearly similar to the\none Judulang urges here. And then, in Matter of Grana-\ndos, 16 I. & N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit both ways: It denied §212(c) eligibility both because the\ndeportation ground charged did not correspond to, and\nbecause the alien’s prior conviction did not fall within, a\nwaivable ground of exclusion. In short, the BIA’s cases\nwere all over the map.\n   The Government insists that the BIA imposed order in\nMatter of Wadud, 19 I. & N. Dec. 182, 185–186 (1984),\nwhen it held that a deportable alien could not seek §212(c)\nrelief unless the deportation ground charged had an “anal-\nogous ground of inadmissibility.” See Brief for Respondent\n40–41. But the BIA’s settlement, if any, was fleeting.\nJust seven years later, the BIA adopted a new policy\nentirely, extending §212(c) eligibility to “aliens deportable\nunder any ground of deportability except those where\nthere is a comparable ground of exclusion which has been\nspecifically excepted from section 212(c).” Hernandez-\nCasillas, 20 I. & N. Dec., at 266. That new rule turned the\ncomparable-grounds approach inside-out, allowing aliens\nto seek §212(c) relief in deportation cases except when the\nground charged corresponded to an exclusion ground that\ncould not be waived. To be sure, the Attorney General (on\nreferral of the case from the BIA), disavowed this position\nin favor of the more standard version of the comparable-\ngrounds rule. Id., at 287. But even while doing so, the\nAttorney General stated that “an alien subject to deporta-\ntion must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary\nrelief as an alien . . . subject to exclusion.” Ibid. That\nassertion is exactly the one Judulang makes in this case;\nit is consonant not with the comparable-grounds rule the\nBIA here defends, but instead with an inquiry into wheth-\ner an alien’s prior conviction falls within an exclusion\nground.\n   Given these mixed signals, it is perhaps not surprising\nthat the BIA continued to alternate between approaches in\nthe years that followed. Immediately after the Attorney\nGeneral’s opinion in Hernandez-Casillas, the BIA en-\n20                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occa-\nsions. See Meza, 20 I. & N. Dec., at 259; Matter of Monte-\nnegro, 20 I. & N. Dec. 603, 604–605 (1992); Matter of\nGabryelsky, 20 I. & N. Dec. 750, 753–754 (1993); In re\nEsposito, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1, 6–7 (1995); In re Jimenez-\nSantillano, 21 I. & N. Dec. 567, 571–572 (1996). But just\na few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished\nopinions that asked only whether a deportable alien’s\nprior conviction fell within an exclusion ground. See, e.g.,\nIn re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">23269892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Dec. 1, 2003). Not until the BIA’s decisions in Blake and\nBrieva-Perez did the pendulum stop swinging. That histo-\nry hardly supports the Government’s view of a consistent\nagency practice.12\n                             3\n  The Government finally argues that the comparable-\ngrounds rule saves time and money. The Government\nclaims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion\ngrounds can be accomplished in just a few “precedential\ndecision[s],” which then can govern broad swaths of cases.\nSee Brief for Respondent 46. By contrast, the Government\nargues, Judulang’s approach would force it to determine\nwhether each and every crime of conviction falls within an\nexclusion ground. Further, the Government contends that\nJudulang’s approach would grant eligibility to a greater\n——————\n  12 Because  we find the BIA’s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise\nreject Judulang’s argument that Blake and Brieva-Perez were imper-\nmissibly retroactive. To succeed on that theory, Judulang would have\nto show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reason-\nably relied on a legal rule from which Blake and Brieva-Perez departed.\nSee Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994) (stating\nthat retroactivity analysis focuses on “considerations of fair notice,\nreasonable reliance, and settled expectations”). The instability of the\nBIA’s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing:\nThe BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang’s position as eligible\nfor §212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnumber of deportable aliens, which in turn would force the\nGovernment to make additional individualized assess-\nments of whether to actually grant relief. Id., at 47.\n  Once again, the Government’s rationale comes up short.\nCost is an important factor for agencies to consider in\nmany contexts. But cheapness alone cannot save an arbi-\ntrary agency policy. (If it could, flipping coins would be a\nvalid way to determine an alien’s eligibility for a waiver.)\nAnd in any event, we suspect the Government exaggerates\nthe cost savings associated with the comparable-grounds\nrule. Judulang’s proposed approach asks immigration\nofficials only to do what they have done for years in exclu-\nsion cases; that means, for one thing, that officials can\nmake use of substantial existing precedent governing\nwhether a crime falls within a ground of exclusion. And\nJudulang’s proposal may not be the only alternative to the\ncomparable-grounds rule. See supra, at 11–12. In reject-\ning that rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to\ndevise another, equally economical policy respecting eligi-\nbility for §212(c) relief, so long as it comports with every-\nthing held in both this decision and St. Cyr.\n                             III\n  We must reverse an agency policy when we cannot\ndiscern a reason for it. That is the trouble in this case.\nThe BIA’s comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the\npurposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allows\nan irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to\ngovern a matter of the utmost importance—whether law-\nful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country\nmay stay here. And contrary to the Government’s protes-\ntations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost con-\nsiderations. The BIA’s approach therefore cannot pass\nmuster under ordinary principles of administrative law.\n  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is hereby reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 618680, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/12/12/Judulang_v._Holder.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 10–694.      Argued October 12, 2011—Decided December 12, 2011\nFederal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from ad-\n  mission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously ad-\n  mitted. Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different\n  procedural settings; since then, the Government has employed a uni-\n  fied “removal proceeding” for exclusions and deportations alike. But\n  the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substan-\n  tive grounds for the two actions. One list specifies what crimes ren-\n  der an alien excludable, see 8 U. S. C. §1182(a), while another—\n  sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list specifies what\n  crimes render an alien deportable, see §1227(a).\n     Until repealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\n  Act permitted the Attorney General to grant discretionary relief to an\n  excludable alien, if the alien had lawfully resided in the United\n  States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country\n  and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.\n  By its terms, §212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the\n  Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to de-\n  portation proceedings as well. Although Congress substituted a nar-\n  rower discretionary remedy for §212(c) in 1996, see §1229b, §212(c)’s\n  broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based\n  on a guilty plea entered before §212(c)’s repeal, INS v. St. Cyr, 533\n  U. S. 289, 326.\n     In deciding whether to exclude such an alien, the BIA first checks\n  the statutory ground identified by the Department of Homeland Se-\n  curity (DHS) as the basis for exclusion. Unless that ground is one of\n  the two falling outside §212(c)’s scope, the alien is eligible for discre-\n  tionary relief. The BIA then determines whether to grant relief\n  based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.\n2                        JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n      This case concerns the BIA’s method for applying §212(c) in the\n    deportation context. The BIA’s approach, known as the “comparable-\n    grounds” rule, evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has\n    a close analogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. If the de-\n    portation ground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equivalent”\n    to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek §212(c)\n    relief. But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer\n    offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief,\n    even if the alien’s particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.\n      Petitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United\n    States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to\n    voluntary manslaughter in 1988. After he pleaded guilty to another\n    crime in 2005, DHS commenced a deportation action, charging him\n    with having committed an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of\n    violence” based on his manslaughter conviction. The Immigration\n    Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding\n    Judulang ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of violence”\n    deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground. The\n    Ninth Circuit, having previously upheld the BIA’s comparable-\n    grounds rule, denied Judulang’s petition for review.\nHeld: The BIA’s policy for applying §212(c) in deportation cases is “arbi-\n trary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5\n U. S. C. §706(2)(A). Pp. 9–21.\n    (a) While agencies have expertise and experience in administering\n their statutes that no court may properly ignore, courts retain a nar-\n row but important role in ensuring that agencies have engaged in\n reasoned decisionmaking. Thus, in reviewing the BIA’s action, this\n Court must assess, among other matters, “whether the decision was\n based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there\n has been a clear error of judgment.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of\n United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S.\n 29, 43. That task involves examining the reasons for agency deci-\n sions, or the absence of such reasons.\n    The comparable-grounds approach cannot survive scrutiny under\n this standard. By hinging a deportable alien’s eligibility for discre-\n tionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory cate-\n gories—a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this\n country—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned\n manner. Pp. 9–10.\n    (b) Even if the BIA has legitimate reasons for limiting §212(c)’s\n scope in deportation cases, it must do so in some rational way. In\n other words, the BIA must use an approach that is tied to the pur-\n poses of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the\n immigration system. The comparable-grounds rule has no connection\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nto these factors. Instead, it makes §212(c) eligibility turn on an irrel-\nevant comparison between statutory provisions. Whether the set of\noffenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an\nexclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien\nwhose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to\nstay in this country. Here, Judulang was found ineligible for §212(c)\nrelief because the “crime of violence” deportation ground includes a\nfew offenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use\nof a vehicle—not found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion\nground. But the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in\nthe deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of Judulang’s case.\n   The BIA’s approach has other odd features. In applying the com-\nparable-grounds rule, the BIA has denied relief to aliens whose de-\nportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion\nground. Yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of al-\niens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of\nthat group. In addition, the outcome of the comparable-grounds\nanalysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision. An alien’s prior\nconviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds, only\none of which corresponds to an exclusion ground. In such cases, an\nalien’s eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual official’s deci-\nsion as to which deportation ground to charge. An alien appearing\nbefore one official may suffer deportation, while an identically situat-\ned alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this\ncountry.\n   In short, the comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any\nfactors relevant to whether an alien should be deported. Instead, it\nturns deportation decisions into a “sport of chance.” Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 455. That is what the APA’s “arbitrary and ca-\npricious” standard is designed to prevent. Pp. 10–15.\n   (c) The Government’s arguments in defense of the comparable-\ngrounds rule are not persuasive. First, §212(c)’s text does not sup-\nport the rule. That section cannot provide a textual anchor for any\nmethod of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because\nit addresses only exclusion. Second, the history of the comparable-\ngrounds rule does not work in the Government’s favor. The BIA re-\npeatedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to deportable\naliens, settling on the current rule only in 2005. Third, the Govern-\nment’s claim that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money\nfalls short. Cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider\nin many contexts, but cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary\nagency policy. In any event, it is unclear that the comparable-\ngrounds rule saves money when compared with alternative ap-\nproaches. Pp. 16–21.\n4                       JUDULANG v.

We hold that the BIA’s approach is arbitrary and\ncapricious.\n   The legal background of this case is complex, but the\nprinciple guiding our decision is anything but. When an\nadministrative agency sets policy, it must provide a rea-\nsoned explanation for its action. That is not a high bar,\nbut it is an unwavering one. Here, the BIA has failed to\nmeet it.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of\naliens from admission to this country and the deportation\nof aliens previously admitted. Before 1996, these two\nkinds of action occurred in different procedural settings,\nwith an alien seeking entry (whether for the first time or\nupon return from a trip abroad) placed in an “exclusion\n2                      JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproceeding” and an alien already here channeled to a\n“deportation proceeding.” See Landon v. Plasencia, 459\nU. S. 21, 25–26 (1982) (comparing the two). Since that\ntime, the Government has used a unified procedure,\nknown as a “removal proceeding,” for exclusions and de-\nportations alike. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. But the\nstatutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have\nalways varied. Now, as before, the immigration laws\nprovide two separate lists of substantive grounds, princi-\npally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions.\nOne list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien\nexcludable (or in the term the statute now uses, “inadmis-\nsible”), see §1182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another—\nsometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent—list\nspecifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable\nfrom the country, see §1227(a).\n  An additional, historic difference between exclusion\nand deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney\nGeneral to grant an alien discretionary relief. Until re-\npealed in 1996, §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized\nthe Attorney General to admit certain excludable aliens.\nSee also §136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to\n§212(c)). The Attorney General could order this relief\nwhen the alien had lawfully resided in the United States\nfor at least seven years before temporarily leaving the\ncountry, unless the alien was excludable on one of two\nspecified grounds. See §1182(c) (1994 ed.).1 But by its\n——————\n    1 Therelevant part of §212(c), in the version of the exclusion statute\nall parties use, read as follows:\n  “Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily\nproceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,\nand who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\nconsecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section\n(other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nterms, §212(c) did not apply when an alien was being\ndeported.\n   This discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in\na case called Matter of L-, 1 I. & N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading\nto the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deporta-\ntion case. L- was a permanent resident of the United\nStates who had been convicted of larceny. Although L-’s\ncrime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and\nthen returned to the United States without any immigra-\ntion official’s preventing his entry. A few months later,\nthe Government caught up with L- and initiated a depor-\ntation action based on his larceny conviction. Had the\nGovernment apprehended L- at the border a short while\nearlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion pro-\nceeding where he could have applied for discretionary\nrelief. But because L- was instead in a deportation pro-\nceeding, no such relief was available. Responding to this\napparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on\nreferral of the case from the BIA) determined that L- could\nreceive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, “should be permitted to\nmake the same appeal to discretion that he could have\nmade if denied admission” when returning from his recent\ntrip. Id., at 6. In accord with this decision, the BIA\nadopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceed-\nings to apply for discretionary relief under §212(c) when-\never they had left and reentered the country after be-\ncoming deportable. See Matter of S-, 6 I. & N. Dec. 392,\n394–396 (1954).\n   But this approach created another peculiar asymmetry:\nDeportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned\ncould receive §212(c) relief, while those who had never left\n\n——————\n  The parenthetical clause of this section prevented the Attorney Gen-\neral from waiving exclusion for aliens who posed a threat to national\nsecurity, §1182(a)(3), and aliens who engaged in international child\nabduction, §1182(a)(9)(C).\n4                   JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncould not. In Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d 268 (1976), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that\nthis disparity violated equal protection. Id., at 273 (“[A]n\nalien whose ties with this country are so strong that he\nhas never departed after his initial entry should receive at\nleast as much consideration as an individual who may\nleave and return from time to time”). The BIA acquiesced\nin the Second Circuit’s decision, see Matter of Silva, 16\nI. & N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying §212(c) in deporta-\ntion proceedings regardless of an alien’s travel history.\n   All this might have become academic when Congress\nrepealed §212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretion-\nary remedy, known as “cancellation of removal,” which is\navailable in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable\nand deportable aliens alike. See 8 U. S. C. §1229b. But in\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 326 (2001), this Court con-\ncluded that the broader relief afforded by §212(c) must\nremain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien\nwhose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before\n§212(c)’s repeal. We reasoned that aliens had agreed to\nthose pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in\nmind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport\nwith “ ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable\nreliance, and settled expectations.’ ” Id., at 323 (quoting\nLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994)).\nAccordingly, §212(c) has had an afterlife for resident\naliens with old criminal convictions.\n   When the BIA is deciding whether to exclude such an\nalien, applying §212(c) is an easy matter. The Board\nfirst checks the statutory ground that the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis\nfor exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that\nDHS has charged the alien with previously committing\na “crime involving moral turpitude,” see 8 U. S. C.\n§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Unless the charged ground is one of\nthe pair falling outside §212(c)’s scope, see n. 1, supra, the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nalien is eligible for discretionary relief. The Board then\ndetermines whether to grant that relief based on such\nfactors as “the seriousness of the offense, evidence of\neither rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the\nalien’s residence, the impact of deportation on the family,\nthe number of citizens in the family, and the character of\nany service in the Armed Forces.” St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n296, n. 5.\n  By contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to deport\nan alien, applying §212(c) becomes a tricky business.\nRecall that §212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion\ndecisions. So the question arises: How is the BIA to de-\ntermine when an alien should receive §212(c) relief in the\ndeportation context?\n  One approach that the BIA formerly used considered\nhow the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding. To\nperform this analysis, the Board would first determine\nwhether the criminal conviction making the alien deporta-\nble fell within a statutory ground for exclusion. Almost all\nconvictions did so, largely because the “crime involving\nmoral turpitude” ground encompasses so many offenses.2\nAssuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board\nwould mimic its approach in exclusion cases—first making\nsure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from\n§212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis. See\nMatter of Tanori, 15 I. & N. Dec. 566, 567–568 (1976);\nIn re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892\n(BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).\n  A second approach is the one challenged here; definitive-\nly adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it\noften is called the “comparable-grounds” rule. See, e.g., De\nla Rosa v. U. S. Attorney General, 579 F. 3d 1327, 1332\n——————\n   2 Firearms offenses are the most significant crimes falling outside the\n\nstatutory grounds for exclusion. See Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, 20\nI. & N. Dec. 262, 282, n. 4 (1990).\n6                      JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(CA11 2009).       That approach evaluates whether the\nground for deportation charged in a case has a close ana-\nlogue in the statute’s list of exclusion grounds. See In re\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); In re Brieva-Perez,\n23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 772–773 (2005).3 If the deportation\nground consists of a set of crimes “substantially equiva-\nlent” to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground,\nthen the alien can seek §212(c) relief. Blake, 23 I. & N.\nDec., at 728. But if the deportation ground charged covers\nsignificantly different or more or fewer offenses than any\nexclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver.\nSuch a divergence makes §212(c) inapplicable even if the\nparticular offense committed by the alien falls within an\nexclusion ground.\n  Two contrasting examples from the BIA’s cases\nmay help to illustrate this approach. Take first an\nalien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom\nDHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has commit-\nted an “aggravated felony” involving “illicit trafficking\nin a controlled substance.” 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(B),\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under the comparable-grounds rule, the\nimmigration judge would look to see if that deportation\nground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclu-\nsion ground. And according to the BIA in Matter of Meza,\n20 I. & N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an ade-\nquate match—the exclusion ground applicable to aliens\nwho have committed offenses “relating to a controlled\nsubstance,” 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).\n  Now consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual\nabuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the\nground that he has committed an “aggravated felony”\n\n——————\n    3 Blake\n          and Brieva-Perez clarified a 2004 regulation issued by the BIA\nstating that an alien is ineligible for §212(c) relief when deportable “on\na ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212.”\n8 CFR §1212.3(f)(5) (2010).\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving “sexual abuse of a minor.” §§1101(a)(43)(A),\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). May this alien seek §212(c) relief ?\nAccording to the BIA, he may not do so—not because his\ncrime is too serious (that is irrelevant to the analysis), but\ninstead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers\nsubstantially the same offenses. To be sure, the alien’s\nown offense is a “crime involving moral turpitude,” 8\nU. S. C. §1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and so fits within an exclusion\nground. Indeed, that will be true of most or all offenses\nincluded in this deportation category. See supra, at 5.\nBut on the BIA’s view, the “moral turpitude” exclusion\nground “addresses a distinctly different and much broader\ncategory of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual\nabuse of a minor charge.” Blake, 23 I. & N. Dec., at 728.\nAnd the much greater sweep of the exclusion ground\nprevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from\ndeportation.4\n   Those mathematically inclined might think of the\ncomparable-grounds approach as employing Venn dia-\ngrams. Within one circle are all the criminal offenses com-\nposing the particular ground of deportation charged. Within\nother circles are the offenses composing the various exclu-\nsion grounds. When, but only when, the “deportation\ncircle” sufficiently corresponds to one of the “exclusion\ncircles” may an alien apply for §212(c) relief.\n\n\n——————\n  4 Careful readers may note that the example involving controlled\n\nsubstances offered in the last paragraph also involves an exclusion\nground that sweeps more broadly than the deportation ground charged.\nThe deportation ground requires “trafficking” in a controlled substance,\nwhereas the exclusion ground includes all possession offenses as well.\nThe BIA nonetheless held in Meza that the degree of overlap between\nthe two grounds was sufficient to make the alien eligible for §212(c)\nrelief. That holding reveals the broad discretion that the BIA currently\nexercises in deciding when two statutory grounds are comparable\nenough.\n8                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Petitioner Joel Judulang is a native of the Philippines\nwho entered the United States in 1974 at the age of eight.\nSince that time, he has lived continuously in this country\nas a lawful permanent resident. In 1988, Judulang took\npart in a fight in which another person shot and killed\nsomeone. Judulang was charged as an accessory and\neventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. He\nreceived a 6-year suspended sentence and was released on\nprobation immediately after his plea.\n   In 2005, after Judulang pleaded guilty to another crimi-\nnal offense (this one involving theft), DHS commenced an\naction to deport him. DHS charged Judulang with having\ncommitted an “aggravated felony” involving “a crime of\nviolence,” based on his old manslaughter conviction. 8\nU. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).5 The Immi-\ngration Judge ordered Judulang’s deportation, and the\nBIA affirmed. As part of its decision, the BIA considered\nwhether Judulang could apply for §212(c) relief. It held\nthat he could not do so because the “crime of violence”\ndeportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion\nground, including the one for crimes involving moral\nturpitude. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit denied Judulang’s petition for review\nin reliance on circuit precedent upholding the BIA’s\ncomparable-grounds approach.

S. C. §706(2)(A).7 The scope of our review\nunder this standard is “narrow”; as we have often recog-\nnized, “a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of\nthe agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29,\n43 (1983); see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v.\nVolpe, 401 U. S. 402, 416 (1971). Agencies, the BIA among\nthem, have expertise and experience in administering\ntheir statutes that no court can properly ignore. But\ncourts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring\nthat agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.\nWhen reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among\nother matters, “ ‘whether the decision was based on a\nconsideration of the relevant factors and whether there\n—————— \n\ntion”), with Koussan v. Holder, 556 F. 3d 403, 412–414 (CA6 2009)\n\n(upholding the comparable-grounds policy); Caroleo v. Gonzales, 476 \n\nF. 3d 158, 162–163, 168 (CA3 2007) (same); Kim v. Gonzales, 468 F. 3d\n58, 62–63 (CA1 2006) (same).\n   7 The Government urges us instead to analyze this case under the\n\nsecond step of the test we announced in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), to govern\njudicial review of an agency’s statutory interpretations. See Brief for\nRespondent 19. Were we to do so, our analysis would be the same,\nbecause under Chevron step two, we ask whether an agency interpreta-\ntion is “ ‘arbitrary or capricious in substance.’ ” Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Ed. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. ___ , ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 7) (quoting Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541\nU. S. 232, 242 (2004)). But we think the more apt analytic framework\nin this case is standard “arbitrary [or] capricious” review under the\nAPA. The BIA’s comparable-grounds policy, as articulated in In re\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722 (2005) and In re Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n766 (2005), is not an interpretation of any statutory language—nor\ncould it be, given that §212(c) does not mention deportation cases, see\ninfra, at 16–17, and n. 11.\n10                    JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhas been a clear error of judgment.’ ” State Farm, 463\nU. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-\nBest Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 285 (1974)). That\ntask involves examining the reasons for agency deci-\nsions—or, as the case may be, the absence of such reasons.\nSee FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,\n515 (2009) (noting “the requirement that an agency pro-\nvide reasoned explanation for its action”).\n  The BIA has flunked that test here. By hinging a de-\nportable alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief on the\nchance correspondence between statutory categories—a\nmatter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this\ncountry—the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a\nreasoned manner.\n                              A\n   The parties here spend much time disputing whether\nthe BIA must make discretionary relief available to de-\nportable and excludable aliens on identical terms. As this\ncase illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does\nnot do so. If Judulang were seeking entry to this country,\nhe would be eligible for §212(c) relief; voluntary man-\nslaughter is “a crime involving moral turpitude,” and so\nhis conviction falls within an exclusion ground. But Judu-\nlang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the\n“crime of violence” ground charged in his case does not\nmatch any exclusion ground (including the one for “turpi-\ntudinous” crimes). See infra, at 13. Judulang argues that\nthis disparity is impermissible because any disparity\nbetween excludable and deportable aliens is impermissi-\nble: If an alien may seek §212(c) relief in an exclusion\ncase, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deporta-\ntion case. See Brief for Petitioner 47–51.8 But the Gov-\n——————\n  8 Judulang also argues that the BIA is making an impermissible dis-\n\ntinction between two groups of deportable aliens—those who have\nrecently left and returned to the country and those who have not.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nernment notes that the immigration laws have always\ndrawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation.\nSee Brief for Respondent 51. And the Government presses\na policy reason for making §212(c) relief more readily\navailable in exclusion cases. Doing so, it argues, will\nprovide an incentive for some resident aliens (i.e., those\neligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to\nreport themselves to immigration officials, by applying for\nadvance permission to exit and reenter the country. In\ncontrast, applying §212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens\nto “try to evade immigration officials for as long as possi-\nble,” because they could in any event “seek [discretionary]\nrelief if caught.” Id., at 52.\n   In the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and\nwe do not resolve it. The BIA may well have legitimate\nreasons for limiting §212(c)’s scope in deportation cases.\nBut still, it must do so in some rational way. If the BIA\nproposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible\nto seek §212(c) relief by flipping a coin—heads an alien\nmay apply for relief, tails he may not—we would reverse\nthe policy in an instant. That is because agency action\nmust be based on non-arbitrary, “ ‘relevant factors,’ ” State\n\n——————\nAccording to Judulang, the BIA is treating the former as if they were\nseeking admission, while applying the “comparable grounds” approach\nonly to the latter. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 16–18. That is the\nkind of distinction the Second Circuit held in Francis v. INS, 532 F. 2d\n268 (1976), violated equal protection. See supra, at 3–4. But the\nGovernment contends that it is drawing no such line—that it is apply-\ning the comparable-grounds policy to all deportable aliens. Brief for\nRespondent 29. We think the available evidence tends to support the\nGovernment’s representation. See In re Meza-Castillo, No. A091 366\n529, 2009 WL 455596 (BIA, Feb. 9, 2009) (applying comparable-grounds\nanalysis to a deportable alien who had left and returned to the coun-\ntry); In re Valenzuela-Morales, No. A40 443 512, 2008 WL 2079382\n(BIA, Apr. 23, 2008) (same). But in light of our holding that the\ncomparable-grounds approach is arbitrary and capricious, we need not\nresolve this dispute about the BIA’s practice.\n12                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., 419\nU. S., at 285), which here means that the BIA’s approach\nmust be tied, even if loosely, to the purposes of the immi-\ngration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigra-\ntion system. A method for disfavoring deportable aliens\nthat bears no relation to these matters—that neither\nfocuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the\ncountry—is arbitrary and capricious. And that is true\nregardless whether the BIA might have acted to limit the\nclass of deportable aliens eligible for §212(c) relief on\nother, more rational bases.\n   The problem with the comparable-grounds policy is that\nit does not impose such a reasonable limitation. Rather\nthan considering factors that might be thought germane to\nthe deportation decision, that policy hinges §212(c) eligi-\nbility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory\nprovisions. Recall that the BIA asks whether the set of\noffenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with\nthe set in an exclusion ground. But so what if it does?\nDoes an alien charged with a particular deportation\nground become more worthy of relief because that ground\nhappens to match up with another? Or less worthy of\nrelief because the ground does not? The comparison in no\nway changes the alien’s prior offense or his other attrib-\nutes and circumstances. So it is difficult to see why that\ncomparison should matter.         Each of these statutory\ngrounds contains a slew of offenses. Whether each con-\ntains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a\ndeportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both\ngrounds merits the ability to seek a waiver.9\n——————\n  9 The case would be different if Congress had intended for §212(c)\n\nrelief to depend on the interaction of exclusion grounds and deportation\ngrounds. But the Government has presented us with no evidence to\nthis effect, nor have we found any. See Blake, 489 F. 3d, at 102 (Con-\ngress never contemplated, in drafting the immigration laws, “that its\ngrounds of deportation would have any connection with the grounds of\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   This case well illustrates the point. In commencing\nJudulang’s deportation proceeding, the Government\ncharged him with an “aggravated felony” involving a\n“crime of violence” based on his prior manslaughter con-\nviction. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a–12a. That made\nhim ineligible for §212(c) relief because the “crime of vio-\nlence” deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap\nwith the most similar exclusion ground, for “crime[s]\ninvolving moral turpitude.” The problem, according to the\nBIA, is that the “crime of violence” ground includes a few\noffenses—simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthor-\nized use of a vehicle—that the “moral turpitude” ground\ndoes not. See Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec., at 772–773;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 28–29, 40–41. But this statutory differ-\nence in no way relates to Judulang—or to most other\naliens charged with committing a “crime of violence.”\nPerhaps aliens like Judulang should be eligible for §212(c)\nrelief, or perhaps they should not. But that determination\nis not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults\nand minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion.\nThat fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a\ncoin flip would be. It makes Judulang no less deserving of\nthe opportunity to seek discretionary relief—just as its\nconverse (the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries\nin the “moral turpitude” exclusion ground) would make\nhim no more so.\n   Or consider a different headscratching oddity of the\ncomparable-grounds approach—that it may deny §212(c)\neligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely\ninside an exclusion ground. The BIA’s Blake decision,\nnoted earlier, provides an example. See supra, at 6–7.\nThe deportation ground charged was “aggravated felony”\ninvolving “sexual abuse of a minor”; the closest exclusion\nground was, once again, a “crime [of] moral turpitude.” 23\n—————— \n\nexclusion” in the application of §212(c)); see also infra, at 16–17.\n\n14                    JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nI. & N. Dec., at 727. Here, the BIA’s problem was not that\nthe deportation ground covered too many offenses; all or\nvirtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes\nof moral turpitude. Rather, the BIA objected that the\ndeportation ground covered too few crimes—or put oppo-\nsitely, that “the moral turpitude ground of exclusion ad-\ndresses a . . . much broader category of offenses.” Id., at\n728. But providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad\nclass of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation\ncases to a subset of that group.10 (The better argument\nwould surely be the reverse—that giving relief in the one\ncontext supports doing so in the other.) Again, we do not\nsay today that the BIA must give all deportable aliens\nmeeting §212(c)’s requirements the chance to apply for a\nwaiver. See supra, at 11–12. The point is instead that the\nBIA cannot make that opportunity turn on the meaning-\nless matching of statutory grounds.\n   And underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet\nanother, because the outcome of the Board’s comparable-\ngrounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an\nimmigration official’s charging decision. This problem\narises because an alien’s prior conviction may fall within a\nnumber of deportation grounds, only one of which corre-\nsponds to an exclusion ground. Consider, for example, an\nalien who entered the country in 1984 and commit-\nted voluntary manslaughter in 1988. That person could\nbe charged (as Judulang was) with an “aggravated fel-\nony” involving a “crime of violence,” see 8 U. S. C.\n§§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). If so, the alien could\nnot seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable\nexclusion ground. But the alien also could be charged\n\n——————\n  10 Perhaps that is why the BIA declined to apply similar reasoning in\nMeza—a case also involving an exclusion ground that sweeps more\nbroadly than a deportation ground (although not to the same extent as\nin Blake). See supra, at 6.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith “a crime involving moral turpitude committed within\nfive years . . . after the date of admission,” see\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). And if that were the deportation\ncharge, the alien could apply for relief, because the ground\ncorresponds to the “moral turpitude” ground used in ex-\nclusion cases. See In re Salmon, 16 I. & N. Dec. 734\n(1978). So everything hangs on the charge. And the\nGovernment has provided no reason to think that immi-\ngration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding\nwhat charges to bring, or that those officials are exercising\ntheir charging discretion with §212(c) in mind. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 34–36. So at base everything hangs on the\nfortuity of an individual official’s decision. An alien ap-\npearing before one official may suffer deportation; an\nidentically situated alien appearing before another may\ngain the right to stay in this country.\n   In a foundational deportation case, this Court recog-\nnized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in\nthis country, and reversed an agency decision that would\n“make his right to remain here dependent on circumstan-\nces so fortuitous and capricious.” Delgadillo v. Carmichael,\n332 U. S. 388, 391 (1947). We think the policy before us\nsimilarly flawed. The comparable-grounds approach does\nnot rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or\nany group of aliens) should be deported. It instead distin-\nguishes among aliens—decides who should be eligible for\ndiscretionary relief and who should not—solely by compar-\ning the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories\ninto which an alien falls. The resulting Venn diagrams\nhave no connection to the goals of the deportation process\nor the rational operation of the immigration laws. Judge\nLearned Hand wrote in another early immigration case\nthat deportation decisions cannot be made a “sport of\nchance.” See Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F. 2d 878, 879\n(CA2 1947) (quoted in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449,\n455 (1963)). That is what the comparable-grounds rule\n16                  JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrings about, and that is what the APA’s “arbitrary and\ncapricious” standard is designed to thwart.\n                              B\n  The Government makes three arguments in defense of\nthe comparable-grounds rule—the first based on statutory\ntext, the next on history, the last on cost. We find none of\nthem persuasive.\n                               1\n   The Government initially contends that the comparable-\ngrounds approach is more faithful to “the statute’s lan-\nguage,” Brief for Respondent 21—or otherwise said, that\n“lifting that limit ‘would take immigration practice even\nfurther from the statutory text,’ ” id., at 22 (quoting Matter\nof Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I. & N. Dec. 262, 287 (1990)). In\nthe Government’s view, §212(c) is “phrased in terms of\nwaiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion”; that\nphrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative\nanalysis of grounds when applying §212(c) in the deporta-\ntion context. Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 34 (“[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach]\nmakes sense is because the statute only provides for relief\nfrom grounds of . . . exclusion”).\n   The first difficulty with this argument is that it is based\non an inaccurate description of the statute. Section 212(c)\ninstructs that certain resident aliens “may be admitted in\nthe discretion of the Attorney General” notwithstanding\nany of “the provisions of subsection (a) . . . (other than\nparagraphs (3) and (9)(C)).” 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.).\nSubsection (a) contains the full list of exclusion grounds;\nparagraphs (3) and (9)(C) (which deal with national secu-\nrity and international child abduction) are two among\nthese. What §212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attor-\nney General may admit any excludable alien, except if\nthe alien is charged with two specified grounds. And that\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmeans that once the Attorney General determines that\nthe alien is not being excluded for those two reasons, the\nground of exclusion no longer matters. At that point, the\nalien is eligible for relief, and the thing the Attorney Gen-\neral waives is not a particular exclusion ground, but the\nsimple denial of entry. So the premise of the Govern-\nment’s argument is wrong. And if the premise, so too the\nconclusion—that is, because §212(c)’s text is not “phrased\nin terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclu-\nsion,” Brief for Respondent 21, it cannot counsel a search\nfor corresponding grounds of deportation.\n  More fundamentally, the comparable-grounds approach\nwould not follow from §212(c) even were the Government\nright about the section’s phrasing. That is because §212(c)\nsimply has nothing to do with deportation: The provision\nwas not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for\ndeportation, any more than those grounds were designed\nto interact with the provision. Rather, §212(c) refers\nsolely to exclusion decisions; its extension to deportation\ncases arose from the agency’s extra-textual view that some\nsimilar relief should be available in that context to avoid\nunreasonable distinctions. Cf., e.g., Matter of L-, 1 I. & N.\nDec., at 5; see also supra, at 3–4.11 Accordingly, the text of\n§212(c), whether or not phrased in terms of “waiving\ngrounds of exclusion,” cannot support the BIA’s use of the\n——————\n  11 Congress amended §212(c), just five months before repealing it, to\n\ninclude a first-time reference to deportation cases. That amendment\nprohibited the Attorney General from granting discretionary relief to\naliens deportable on several specified grounds. See Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1277 (effective Apr. 24,\n1996). The change does not affect our analysis, nor does the Govern-\nment argue it should. As the Government notes, the amendment “did\nnot speak to the viability of the Board’s” comparable-grounds rule, but\ninstead made categorically ineligible for §212(c) relief “those deportable\nby reason of certain crimes.” Brief for Respondent 20. Presumably,\nCongress thought those crimes particularly incompatible with an\nalien’s continued residence in this country.\n18                 JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncomparable-grounds rule—or, for that matter, any other\nmethod for extending discretionary relief to deportation\ncases. We well understand the difficulties of operating in\nsuch a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Govern-\nment’s yearning for a textual anchor. But §212(c), no\nmatter how many times read or parsed, does not provide\none.\n                              2\n   In disputing Judulang’s contentions, the Government\nalso emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule’s vintage.\nSee Brief for Respondent 22–23, 30–43. As an initial\nmatter, we think this a slender reed to support a signifi-\ncant government policy. Arbitrary agency action becomes\nno less so by simple dint of repetition. (To use a prior\nanalogy, flipping coins to determine §212(c) eligibility\nwould remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the\nfirst.) And longstanding capriciousness receives no special\nexemption from the APA. In any event, we cannot detect\nthe consistency that the BIA claims has marked its ap-\nproach to this issue. To the contrary, the BIA has repeat-\nedly vacillated in its method for applying §212(c) to de-\nportable aliens.\n   Prior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches.\nIn Matter of T-, 5 I. & N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example,\nthe BIA held that an alien was not eligible for §212(c)\nrelief because her “ground of deportation” did not appear\nin the exclusion statute. That decision anticipated the\ncomparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses.\nBut in Tanori, the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien\ncould apply for a waiver because “the same facts”—in that\ncase, a marijuana conviction—would have allowed him to\nseek §212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding. 15 I. & N.\nDec., at 568. That approach is more nearly similar to the\none Judulang urges here. And then, in Matter of Grana-\ndos, 16 I. & N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit both ways: It denied §212(c) eligibility both because the\ndeportation ground charged did not correspond to, and\nbecause the alien’s prior conviction did not fall within, a\nwaivable ground of exclusion. In short, the BIA’s cases\nwere all over the map.\n   The Government insists that the BIA imposed order in\nMatter of Wadud, 19 I. & N. Dec. 182, 185–186 (1984),\nwhen it held that a deportable alien could not seek §212(c)\nrelief unless the deportation ground charged had an “anal-\nogous ground of inadmissibility.” See Brief for Respondent\n40–41. But the BIA’s settlement, if any, was fleeting.\nJust seven years later, the BIA adopted a new policy\nentirely, extending §212(c) eligibility to “aliens deportable\nunder any ground of deportability except those where\nthere is a comparable ground of exclusion which has been\nspecifically excepted from section 212(c).” Hernandez-\nCasillas, 20 I. & N. Dec., at 266. That new rule turned the\ncomparable-grounds approach inside-out, allowing aliens\nto seek §212(c) relief in deportation cases except when the\nground charged corresponded to an exclusion ground that\ncould not be waived. To be sure, the Attorney General (on\nreferral of the case from the BIA), disavowed this position\nin favor of the more standard version of the comparable-\ngrounds rule. Id., at 287. But even while doing so, the\nAttorney General stated that “an alien subject to deporta-\ntion must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary\nrelief as an alien . . . subject to exclusion.” Ibid. That\nassertion is exactly the one Judulang makes in this case;\nit is consonant not with the comparable-grounds rule the\nBIA here defends, but instead with an inquiry into wheth-\ner an alien’s prior conviction falls within an exclusion\nground.\n   Given these mixed signals, it is perhaps not surprising\nthat the BIA continued to alternate between approaches in\nthe years that followed. Immediately after the Attorney\nGeneral’s opinion in Hernandez-Casillas, the BIA en-\n20                     JUDULANG v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occa-\nsions. See Meza, 20 I. & N. Dec., at 259; Matter of Monte-\nnegro, 20 I. & N. Dec. 603, 604–605 (1992); Matter of\nGabryelsky, 20 I. & N. Dec. 750, 753–754 (1993); In re\nEsposito, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1, 6–7 (1995); In re Jimenez-\nSantillano, 21 I. & N. Dec. 567, 571–572 (1996). But just\na few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished\nopinions that asked only whether a deportable alien’s\nprior conviction fell within an exclusion ground. See, e.g.,\nIn re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892\n(Dec. 1, 2003). Not until the BIA’s decisions in Blake and\nBrieva-Perez did the pendulum stop swinging. That histo-\nry hardly supports the Government’s view of a consistent\nagency practice.12\n                             3\n  The Government finally argues that the comparable-\ngrounds rule saves time and money. The Government\nclaims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion\ngrounds can be accomplished in just a few “precedential\ndecision[s],” which then can govern broad swaths of cases.\nSee Brief for Respondent 46. By contrast, the Government\nargues, Judulang’s approach would force it to determine\nwhether each and every crime of conviction falls within an\nexclusion ground. Further, the Government contends that\nJudulang’s approach would grant eligibility to a greater\n——————\n  12 Because  we find the BIA’s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise\nreject Judulang’s argument that Blake and Brieva-Perez were imper-\nmissibly retroactive. To succeed on that theory, Judulang would have\nto show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reason-\nably relied on a legal rule from which Blake and Brieva-Perez departed.\nSee Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 270 (1994) (stating\nthat retroactivity analysis focuses on “considerations of fair notice,\nreasonable reliance, and settled expectations”). The instability of the\nBIA’s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing:\nThe BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang’s position as eligible\nfor §212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnumber of deportable aliens, which in turn would force the\nGovernment to make additional individualized assess-\nments of whether to actually grant relief. Id., at 47.\n  Once again, the Government’s rationale comes up short.\nCost is an important factor for agencies to consider in\nmany contexts. But cheapness alone cannot save an arbi-\ntrary agency policy. (If it could, flipping coins would be a\nvalid way to determine an alien’s eligibility for a waiver.)\nAnd in any event, we suspect the Government exaggerates\nthe cost savings associated with the comparable-grounds\nrule. Judulang’s proposed approach asks immigration\nofficials only to do what they have done for years in exclu-\nsion cases; that means, for one thing, that officials can\nmake use of substantial existing precedent governing\nwhether a crime falls within a ground of exclusion. And\nJudulang’s proposal may not be the only alternative to the\ncomparable-grounds rule. See supra, at 11–12. In reject-\ning that rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to\ndevise another, equally economical policy respecting eligi-\nbility for §212(c) relief, so long as it comports with every-\nthing held in both this decision and St. Cyr.\n                             III\n  We must reverse an agency policy when we cannot\ndiscern a reason for it. That is the trouble in this case.\nThe BIA’s comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the\npurposes and concerns of the immigration laws. It allows\nan irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to\ngovern a matter of the utmost importance—whether law-\nful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country\nmay stay here. And contrary to the Government’s protes-\ntations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost con-\nsiderations. The BIA’s approach therefore cannot pass\nmuster under ordinary principles of administrative law.\n  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is hereby reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/618680/", "sha1": "c21a0abdd68a989352be775965bd598d3faa2cb1", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-12-12T07:42:18"}
