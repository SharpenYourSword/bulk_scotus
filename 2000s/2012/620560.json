I dis-\nsent from the Court\u2019s decision not to grant certiorari and\nsummarily reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                              I\n   In the late 1970\u2019s, 10 homeless men were murdered in\ndowntown Los Angeles\u2014a series of murders that came to\nbe known as the \u201cSkid Row Stabber\u201d killings. Respondent\nBobby Joe Maxwell was charged with all 10 murders, and\nin 1984 a California jury convicted him of two counts of\nfirst-degree murder and one related count of robbery.\nMaxwell was sentenced to life imprisonment without the\npossibility of parole, and his convictions were affirmed on\ndirect appeal.\n   In 1995, Maxwell filed a habeas corpus petition in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, alleging that a prosecution\nwitness, Sydney Storch, had given false testimony at trial.\nStorch, a former cellmate of Maxwell\u2019s, had testified that,\nafter reading the newspaper account of a palm print\u2019s be-\ning found at the scene of one of the murders, Maxwell\nstated he was not prone to that type of mistake because he\n\u201cwore gloves with the fingers cut off so as to keep his\nhands warm and leave his fingers free.\u201d 3 Record 537.\nThe California Supreme Court issued an order to show\ncause whether Maxwell was entitled to relief based on his\nallegation of false testimony, returnable to the Superior\nCourt. After conducting an evidentiary hearing that\nextended over the course of two years and included the\ntestimony of more than 30 witnesses and the introduction\nof over 50 exhibits, the Superior Court issued a 34-page\nopinion concluding that Storch had not lied and denying\nthe habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. In 2001,\nMaxwell again filed a habeas petition in the California\nSupreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that the State had\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nviolated his right to due process by failing to disclose cer-\ntain evidence relating to Storch. See Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963). The court summarily denied the\npetition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 105.\n   Maxwell then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\nunder \u00a72254 in the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California, renewing his claims that his\nconviction violated his right to due process because (1) it\nwas based on the false testimony of Storch; and (2) the\nState failed to disclose favorable and material evidence\nregarding Storch. The District Court dismissed the peti-\ntion, id., at 47, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Maxwell v.\nRoe, 628 F. 3d 486 (2010).\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   First, the Ninth Circuit set aside the state habeas\ncourt\u2019s determination that Storch had not fabricated his\ntestimony. It based that action on nothing more than\ncircumstantial evidence indicating that Storch was gener-\nally an untruthful person. For example, the court pointed\nto various mistruths Storch purportedly told at trial (re-\ngarding, for example, his criminal history and his motiva-\ntion for coming forward). But as the Ninth Circuit itself\nrecognized, those lies \u201cd[o] not alone establish that Storch\nlied about the confession.\u201d Id., at 501. The Ninth Circuit\nalso concluded that Storch \u201cmisrepresented his sophistica-\ntion and experience as a jailhouse informant.\u201d Ibid. This\nfinds no support in the record. App. to Pet. for Cert. 119\u2013\n120. Storch\u2019s only testimony as to his informant history\nwas that he had never before testified for the district\nattorney, 3 Record 551; no evidence in the habeas record\ncontradicts that. The Ninth Circuit went on to conclude\nthat Storch had a history of falsely implicating individu-\nals. But any evidence of this, as the state court noted, was\nhighly speculative, see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 136\u2014\n4                         CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand two officers testified at the state evidentiary hearing\nthat in various cases Storch had provided them with accu-\nrate and reliable information. Id., at 125\u2013126. Finally,\nthe Ninth Circuit accorded significance to trials subse-\nquent to Maxwell\u2019s in which Storch allegedly testified\nfalsely. The state court had concluded that these post-\ntrial events did not establish the falsity of Storch\u2019s testi-\nmony, id., at 136\u2013137, and the Ninth Circuit apparently\nagreed, see 628 F. 3d, at 503 (\u201cThe evidence of Storch\u2019s\nlater lies under oath does not establish the nature of his\ntestimony at Maxwell\u2019s trial\u201d).*\n   In sum, the evidence relied on by the Ninth Circuit\nmight permit, but by no means compels, the conclusion\nthat Storch fabricated Maxwell\u2019s admission. And that\nleaves out of account (just as the Ninth Circuit inexplica-\nbly did) the other evidence suggesting that Storch was not\nlying\u2014including testimony that Maxwell confessed the\ncrime, indeed confessed the crime much more explicitly,\nto two cellmates other than Storch. The statement of\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR makes its task far too easy by setting\nout to show the unreasonableness of the California court\u2019s\nstatement that there was \u201cno credible or persuasive evi-\ndence Sidney Storch lied,\u201d ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It is not the court\u2019s statements that are\nat issue here. To establish even a wild exaggeration is not\nto establish what \u00a72254(d)(2) requires: that the state\ncourt\u2019s \u201cdecision . . . was based on an unreasonable deter-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The evidence identified by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR is similarly incon-\nclusive, and the state habeas court reasonably discounted it. For in-\nstance, the so-called \u201cmanual,\u201d ante, at 2, is all but illegible, 2 Record\n461; as the state court recognized, the portions that can be read do not\nreveal whether Storch was instructing another inmate to \u201cprovid[e]\nsubstance or style.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 133. And the opinion of the\nprosecutor who declined to use Storch in a trial that postdated Max-\nwell\u2019s by nearly three years, ante, at 2, was deemed \u201cunconvincing\u201d by\nthe state court, since it was based on jail records of questionable\naccuracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 134.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmination of the facts.\u201d The only factual determination\nnecessary to support the California court\u2019s decision was\nthat Maxwell had not established that Storch lied. And it\nis of course that point to which the California court di-\nrected its attention. (\u201c[Certain evidence] does little to\nestablish whether [Storch] lied about [Maxwell\u2019s] admis-\nsions in 1984.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 136.) What JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR calls \u201cthe overwhelming evidence supporting\nthe conclusion that Storch falsely testified at Maxwell\u2019s\ntrial,\u201d ante, at 3, consists of nothing more than evidence\nwhich establishes, at most, that Storch was an habitual\nliar. That may well provide reason to suspect that Storch\ntestified falsely at Maxwell\u2019s trial; or even to think it likely\nthat Storch testified falsely; but it does not remotely sup-\nport the conclusion that it was unreasonable to determine\nthat Maxwell had not established that Storch testified\nfalsely. In finding the state court\u2019s determination not\nmerely wrong but unreasonable, the Ninth Circuit plainly\ndid what we have said \u00a72254(d) forbids: It \u201cuse[d] a set of\ndebatable inferences to set aside the conclusion reached by\nthe state court.\u201d Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 342 (2006).\n   To make matters worse, having stretched the facts, the\nNinth Circuit also stretched the Constitution, holding that\nthe use of Storch\u2019s false testimony violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, whether or not the\nprosecution knew of its falsity. See 628 F. 3d, at 506\u2013507.\nWe have never held that, and are unlikely ever to do so.\nAll we have held is that \u201ca conviction obtained through use\nof false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the\nState, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\nNapue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (emphasis\nadded). This extension of due process by the Ninth Circuit\nshould not be left standing.\n                          B\n  The Ninth Circuit also concluded that the California\n6                    CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied Brady. In its view,\nthe prosecution committed a Brady violation by failing to\ndisclose two pieces of impeachment evidence: (1) the dif-\nference between Storch\u2019s original plea deal and the plea\ndeal Storch negotiated independently from his public\ndefender after he offered to testify; and (2) Storch\u2019s coop-\neration with law enforcement officials in the years preced-\ning Maxwell\u2019s trial. The Ninth Circuit said that this\nevidence was material to Maxwell\u2019s guilt, (which is what a\nviolation of Brady requires, see Strickler v. Greene, 527\nU. S. 263, 280 (1999)), because \u201cStorch\u2019s testimony was\ncrucial to the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d and the evidence \u201ccould\nhave been used to undermine\u201d Storch\u2019s credibility. 628\nF. 3d, at 512.\n  Neither of these contentions is remotely true. As for the\n\u201ccrucial\u201d nature of Storch\u2019s testimony: Storch was just one\nof four cellmates who recounted Maxwell\u2019s incriminating\nstatements, and there was ample other evidence of Max-\nwell\u2019s guilt, including an eyewitness identification and\nevidence of Maxwell\u2019s palm print near one of the murder\nscenes. And as for the potential utility of the undisclosed\nevidence in refuting Storch\u2019s less-than-crucial testimony:\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, evidence that Storch origi-\nnally had a plea deal of 36 months, which improved to 16\nmonths after he offered to testify, would have \u201cprovided\nMaxwell with impeaching evidence relevant to Storch\u2019s\nmotivation for testifying.\u201d Id., at 510. But the jury al-\nready knew that Storch would not have testified without a\ndeal. Storch said on the stand that he faced the possibility\nof six years\u2019 imprisonment on pending charges and re-\nceived a 16-month deal in exchange for his testimony; and\nresponded in the negative when asked whether he \u201cwould\nbe willing to bring forth this story and tell the D. A. to\nforget the kindness that he is showing towards\u201d him.\n3 Record 562\u2013563. The additional knowledge that he\nsecured a deal that improved his sentence from 36 months\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nto 16 months (rather than from six years to 16 months)\nwould have done nothing to reduce the jurors\u2019 belief in his\ntestimony.\n   The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that evidence\nof Storch\u2019s prior activity as a police informant would have\nhelped to contradict his testimony that he had never\nbefore testified for the district attorney. See 628 F. 3d,\nat 511. The recitation of this non sequitur is its own\nrefutation.\n   Finally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that both pieces\nof evidence could have been used to establish Storch\u2019s\nsophistication as an informant does not hold water. To\nbegin with, the court erred in its belief that Storch \u201cinde-\npendently negotiated\u201d the new deal, id., at 498. While it\nwas true enough that Storch \u201cworked a deal . . . without\nhis public defender,\u201d id., at 510, that does not establish\nthat he negotiated a deal on his own. As Maxwell ac-\nknowledges, Storch \u201cobtained a private lawyer to work\nout\u201d the deal. Brief in Opposition 14. Moreover, the jury\nwas aware of this fact because Storch himself testified to\nit. 3 Record 596. And it is incomprehensible how the\nsubstitution of a 16-month-instead-of-36-month deal for a\nprevious 16-month-instead-of-6-year deal demonstrates\nStorch\u2019s sophistication. Of similarly questionable value is\nevidence of Storch\u2019s prior activity as a police informant.\nContrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s intimations, this would not\nhave portrayed Storch as a wheeler-dealer who trumped\nup stories to receive decreased sentences. Indeed, there\nwas no evidence that Storch received anything in ex-\nchange from the police, App. to Pet. for Cert. 125\u2013126, and\nas I have described, supra, at 3\u20134, two officers testified at\nthe evidentiary hearing that information he provided them\nwas reliable.\n   In view of the evidence, it is not possible to say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the claim \u201cwas so\nlacking in justification that there was an error well under-\n8                     CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstood and comprehended in existing law beyond any pos-\nsibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d        Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). In fact,\nit seems clear that Maxwell was not entitled to relief.\n                          *     *     *\n   It is a regrettable reality that some federal judges like to\nsecond-guess state courts. The only way this Court can\nensure observance of Congress\u2019s abridgement of their\nhabeas power is to perform the unaccustomed task of\nreviewing utterly fact-bound decisions that present no\ndisputed issues of law. We have often not shrunk from\nthat task, which we have found particularly needful with\nregard to decisions of the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Cavazos\nv. Smith, 565 U. S. 1 (2011) (per curiam) (reinstating\nCalifornia conviction for assault on a child resulting in\ndeath); Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (per curi-\nam) (reinstating California conviction for sexual attack on\na 72-year-old woman); Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___\n(2011) (reinstating Oregon conviction for murder of a\nkidnaped victim); Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111\n(2009) (reinstating California first-degree murder convic-\ntion); Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333 (2006) (reinstating\nCalifornia conviction for cocaine possession); Kane v.\nGarcia Espitia, 546 U. S. 9 (2005) (per curiam) (reinstat-\ning California conviction for carjacking and other offens-\nes); Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1 (2003) (per curiam)\n(reinstating California conviction for assault with a deadly\nweapon); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per\ncuriam) (reinstating capital sentence for California pris-\noner convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder,\nand armed robbery). Today we have shrunk, letting stand\na judgment that once again deprives California courts of\nthat control over the State\u2019s administration of criminal\njustice which federal law assures. We should grant the\npetition for certiorari and summarily reverse the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s latest unsupportable \u00a72254 judgment.\n",

For example, the court pointed\nto various mistruths Storch purportedly told at trial (re-\ngarding, for example, his criminal history and his motiva-\ntion for coming forward). But as the Ninth Circuit itself\nrecognized, those lies \u201cd[o] not alone establish that Storch\nlied about the confession.\u201d Id., at 501. The Ninth Circuit\nalso concluded that Storch \u201cmisrepresented his sophistica-\ntion and experience as a jailhouse informant.\u201d Ibid. This\nfinds no support in the record. App. to Pet. for Cert. 119\u2013\n120. Storch\u2019s only testimony as to his informant history\nwas that he had never before testified for the district\nattorney, 3 Record 551; no evidence in the habeas record\ncontradicts that. The Ninth Circuit went on to conclude\nthat Storch had a history of falsely implicating individu-\nals. But any evidence of this, as the state court noted, was\nhighly speculative, see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 136\u2014\n4                         CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand two officers testified at the state evidentiary hearing\nthat in various cases Storch had provided them with accu-\nrate and reliable information. Id., at 125\u2013126. Finally,\nthe Ninth Circuit accorded significance to trials subse-\nquent to Maxwell\u2019s in which Storch allegedly testified\nfalsely. The state court had concluded that these post-\ntrial events did not establish the falsity of Storch\u2019s testi-\nmony, id., at 136\u2013137, and the Ninth Circuit apparently\nagreed, see 628 F. 3d, at 503 (\u201cThe evidence of Storch\u2019s\nlater lies under oath does not establish the nature of his\ntestimony at Maxwell\u2019s trial\u201d).*\n   In sum, the evidence relied on by the Ninth Circuit\nmight permit, but by no means compels, the conclusion\nthat Storch fabricated Maxwell\u2019s admission. And that\nleaves out of account (just as the Ninth Circuit inexplica-\nbly did) the other evidence suggesting that Storch was not\nlying\u2014including testimony that Maxwell confessed the\ncrime, indeed confessed the crime much more explicitly,\nto two cellmates other than Storch. The statement of\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR makes its task far too easy by setting\nout to show the unreasonableness of the California court\u2019s\nstatement that there was \u201cno credible or persuasive evi-\ndence Sidney Storch lied,\u201d ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It is not the court\u2019s statements that are\nat issue here. To establish even a wild exaggeration is not\nto establish what \u00a72254(d)(2) requires: that the state\ncourt\u2019s \u201cdecision . . . was based on an unreasonable deter-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The evidence identified by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR is similarly incon-\nclusive, and the state habeas court reasonably discounted it. For in-\nstance, the so-called \u201cmanual,\u201d ante, at 2, is all but illegible, 2 Record\n461; as the state court recognized, the portions that can be read do not\nreveal whether Storch was instructing another inmate to \u201cprovid[e]\nsubstance or style.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 133. And the opinion of the\nprosecutor who declined to use Storch in a trial that postdated Max-\nwell\u2019s by nearly three years, ante, at 2, was deemed \u201cunconvincing\u201d by\nthe state court, since it was based on jail records of questionable\naccuracy. App. to Pet. for Cert. 134.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmination of the facts.\u201d The only factual determination\nnecessary to support the California court\u2019s decision was\nthat Maxwell had not established that Storch lied. And it\nis of course that point to which the California court di-\nrected its attention. (\u201c[Certain evidence] does little to\nestablish whether [Storch] lied about [Maxwell\u2019s] admis-\nsions in 1984.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 136.) What JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR calls \u201cthe overwhelming evidence supporting\nthe conclusion that Storch falsely testified at Maxwell\u2019s\ntrial,\u201d ante, at 3, consists of nothing more than evidence\nwhich establishes, at most, that Storch was an habitual\nliar. That may well provide reason to suspect that Storch\ntestified falsely at Maxwell\u2019s trial; or even to think it likely\nthat Storch testified falsely; but it does not remotely sup-\nport the conclusion that it was unreasonable to determine\nthat Maxwell had not established that Storch testified\nfalsely. In finding the state court\u2019s determination not\nmerely wrong but unreasonable, the Ninth Circuit plainly\ndid what we have said \u00a72254(d) forbids: It \u201cuse[d] a set of\ndebatable inferences to set aside the conclusion reached by\nthe state court.\u201d Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 342 (2006).\n   To make matters worse, having stretched the facts, the\nNinth Circuit also stretched the Constitution, holding that\nthe use of Storch\u2019s false testimony violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, whether or not the\nprosecution knew of its falsity. See 628 F. 3d, at 506\u2013507.\nWe have never held that, and are unlikely ever to do so.\nAll we have held is that \u201ca conviction obtained through use\nof false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the\nState, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\nNapue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (emphasis\nadded). This extension of due process by the Ninth Circuit\nshould not be left standing.\n                          B\n  The Ninth Circuit also concluded that the California\n6                    CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied Brady. In its view,\nthe prosecution committed a Brady violation by failing to\ndisclose two pieces of impeachment evidence: (1) the dif-\nference between Storch\u2019s original plea deal and the plea\ndeal Storch negotiated independently from his public\ndefender after he offered to testify; and (2) Storch\u2019s coop-\neration with law enforcement officials in the years preced-\ning Maxwell\u2019s trial. The Ninth Circuit said that this\nevidence was material to Maxwell\u2019s guilt, (which is what a\nviolation of Brady requires, see Strickler v. Greene, 527\nU. S. 263, 280 (1999)), because \u201cStorch\u2019s testimony was\ncrucial to the prosecution\u2019s case\u201d and the evidence \u201ccould\nhave been used to undermine\u201d Storch\u2019s credibility. 628\nF. 3d, at 512.\n  Neither of these contentions is remotely true. As for the\n\u201ccrucial\u201d nature of Storch\u2019s testimony: Storch was just one\nof four cellmates who recounted Maxwell\u2019s incriminating\nstatements, and there was ample other evidence of Max-\nwell\u2019s guilt, including an eyewitness identification and\nevidence of Maxwell\u2019s palm print near one of the murder\nscenes. And as for the potential utility of the undisclosed\nevidence in refuting Storch\u2019s less-than-crucial testimony:\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, evidence that Storch origi-\nnally had a plea deal of 36 months, which improved to 16\nmonths after he offered to testify, would have \u201cprovided\nMaxwell with impeaching evidence relevant to Storch\u2019s\nmotivation for testifying.\u201d Id., at 510. But the jury al-\nready knew that Storch would not have testified without a\ndeal. Storch said on the stand that he faced the possibility\nof six years\u2019 imprisonment on pending charges and re-\nceived a 16-month deal in exchange for his testimony; and\nresponded in the negative when asked whether he \u201cwould\nbe willing to bring forth this story and tell the D. A. to\nforget the kindness that he is showing towards\u201d him.\n3 Record 562\u2013563. The additional knowledge that he\nsecured a deal that improved his sentence from 36 months\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nto 16 months (rather than from six years to 16 months)\nwould have done nothing to reduce the jurors\u2019 belief in his\ntestimony.\n   The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that evidence\nof Storch\u2019s prior activity as a police informant would have\nhelped to contradict his testimony that he had never\nbefore testified for the district attorney. See 628 F. 3d,\nat 511. The recitation of this non sequitur is its own\nrefutation.\n   Finally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that both pieces\nof evidence could have been used to establish Storch\u2019s\nsophistication as an informant does not hold water. To\nbegin with, the court erred in its belief that Storch \u201cinde-\npendently negotiated\u201d the new deal, id., at 498. While it\nwas true enough that Storch \u201cworked a deal . . . without\nhis public defender,\u201d id., at 510, that does not establish\nthat he negotiated a deal on his own. As Maxwell ac-\nknowledges, Storch \u201cobtained a private lawyer to work\nout\u201d the deal. Brief in Opposition 14. Moreover, the jury\nwas aware of this fact because Storch himself testified to\nit. 3 Record 596. And it is incomprehensible how the\nsubstitution of a 16-month-instead-of-36-month deal for a\nprevious 16-month-instead-of-6-year deal demonstrates\nStorch\u2019s sophistication. Of similarly questionable value is\nevidence of Storch\u2019s prior activity as a police informant.\nContrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s intimations, this would not\nhave portrayed Storch as a wheeler-dealer who trumped\nup stories to receive decreased sentences. Indeed, there\nwas no evidence that Storch received anything in ex-\nchange from the police, App. to Pet. for Cert. 125\u2013126, and\nas I have described, supra, at 3\u20134, two officers testified at\nthe evidentiary hearing that information he provided them\nwas reliable.\n   In view of the evidence, it is not possible to say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the claim \u201cwas so\nlacking in justification that there was an error well under-\n8                     CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstood and comprehended in existing law beyond any pos-\nsibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d        Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13). In fact,\nit seems clear that Maxwell was not entitled to relief.\n                          *     *     *\n   It is a regrettable reality that some federal judges like to\nsecond-guess state courts. The only way this Court can\nensure observance of Congress\u2019s abridgement of their\nhabeas power is to perform the unaccustomed task of\nreviewing utterly fact-bound decisions that present no\ndisputed issues of law. We have often not shrunk from\nthat task, which we have found particularly needful with\nregard to decisions of the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Cavazos\nv. Smith, 565 U. S. 1 (2011) (per curiam) (reinstating\nCalifornia conviction for assault on a child resulting in\ndeath); Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (per curi-\nam) (reinstating California conviction for sexual attack on\na 72-year-old woman); Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___\n(2011) (reinstating Oregon conviction for murder of a\nkidnaped victim); Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. 111\n(2009) (reinstating California first-degree murder convic-\ntion); Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333 (2006) (reinstating\nCalifornia conviction for cocaine possession); Kane v.\nGarcia Espitia, 546 U. S. 9 (2005) (per curiam) (reinstat-\ning California conviction for carjacking and other offens-\nes); Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1 (2003) (per curiam)\n(reinstating California conviction for assault with a deadly\nweapon); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per\ncuriam) (reinstating capital sentence for California pris-\noner convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder,\nand armed robbery). Today we have shrunk, letting stand\na judgment that once again deprives California courts of\nthat control over the State\u2019s administration of criminal\njustice which federal law assures. We should grant the\npetition for certiorari and summarily reverse the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s latest unsupportable \u00a72254 judgment.\n</pre>",
