Decided January 9, 2012 \n\n\n   The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR respecting the denial\nof certiorari.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 requires that federal habeas courts extend deference\nto the factual findings of state courts. But \u201cdeference does\nnot imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review.\u201d\nMiller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003). Congress\nstated in no uncertain terms that federal habeas relief\nremains available when a state court\u2019s holding is \u201cbased\non an unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2). In this case, the state court\u2019s denial\nof relief to respondent Bobby Joe Maxwell was premised\non its factual finding that there was \u201cno credible or per-\nsuasive evidence Sidney Storch lied at [Maxwell\u2019s] trial in\n1984.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. Because the Ninth\nCircuit meticulously set forth an avalanche of evidence\ndemonstrating that the state court\u2019s factual finding was\nunreasonable, see Maxwell v. Roe, 628 F. 3d 486, 498\u2013506\n(2010), I agree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny certiorari.\n   Sidney Storch was one of the most notorious jailhouse\ninformants in the history of Los Angeles County. During a\n4 year period in the mid-1980\u2019s, he testified in at least a\nhalf-dozen trials, each time claiming that the defendant\nhad confessed to him in prison. See Rohrlich & Stewart,\nJailhouse Snitches: Trading Lies for Freedom, L. A. Times,\n2                    CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nApr. 16, 1989, p. 30 (\u201cSaid inmate Daniel Roach: \u2018It seems\nthat half the world just confesses to Sidney Storch\u2019 \u201d).\n   Throughout this period, however, evidence mounted\nthat Storch repeatedly was fabricating inmates\u2019 confes-\nsions for personal gain. As even the State acknowledges,\nStorch\u2019s signature method was to fashion inmates\u2019 sup-\nposed confessions from publicly available information in\nnewspaper articles. 2 Record 262. At Maxwell\u2019s postcon-\nviction hearing, one former county prosecutor explained\nthat he declined to use Storch in a high-profile 1986 mur-\nder case after determining \u201cStorch was not telling the\ntruth about [the defendant\u2019s] alleged statements,\u201d and had\nlied about having heard a confession at a time when he\nwas not in the defendant\u2019s cell. 9 id., at 1824. Another\nprosecutor later refused to use Storch in a different case\nafter discovering that his \u201ctestimony was similar to the\nnewspaper accounts of the case.\u201d 9 id., at 1825. In 1987,\nsheriff\u2019s deputies even confiscated a manual written by\nStorch instructing other jailhouse snitches how to fabri-\ncate confessions. None of this was out of character for\nStorch, who was discharged from the Army in 1964 be-\ncause he was a \u201c \u2018habitual liar,\u2019 \u201d and was arrested repeat-\nedly for crimes of dishonesty, including forgery, fraud, and\nfalse impersonation\u2014including falsely impersonating a\nCentral Intelligence Agency officer. 628 F. 3d, at 498.\n   As the Ninth Circuit explained at length, both before\nand after Maxwell\u2019s trial, various police officers and prose-\ncutors believed Storch to be unreliable, dishonest, and\nwilling to set up defendants for his own ends. At Max-\nwell\u2019s postconviction hearing, one police officer described\nhow Storch sought to \u201cset . . . up\u201d someone during a for-\ngery investigation, 6 Record 1118; another detective testi-\nfied that he would have put Storch on a Los Angeles Police\nDepartment list of unreliable informants prior to Max-\nwell\u2019s trial. Not long after Maxwell\u2019s trial, prosecutors\nrefused to put Storch on the stand, believing him to have\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

And even the State\nconceded that Storch lied about a variety of material facts\nat Maxwell\u2019s own trial, including his own criminal record\nand his motivation for testifying. This powerful evidence\nsupported Maxwell\u2019s claim that Storch falsely testified\nabout Maxwell\u2019s supposed confession\u2014using precisely the\nsame modus operandi that Storch used time and again to\nfalsely implicate other defendants. See 628 F. 3d, at 504\u2013\n505.\n   The dissent labels all of this evidence \u201ccircumstantial.\u201d\nPost, at 3 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). It insists that it is possi-\nble that Storch repeatedly falsely implicated other defend-\nants, and fabricated other material facts at Maxwell\u2019s\ntrial, but uncharacteristically told the truth about Max-\nwell\u2019s supposed confession. Of course, that is possible.\nBut it is not reasonable, given the voluminous evidence\nthat Storch was a habitual liar who even the State con-\ncedes told other material lies at Maxwell\u2019s trial.1\n   Here, the Ninth Circuit recognized that 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(2) imposes a \u201cdaunting standard\u2014one that will\nbe satisfied in relatively few cases.\u201d 628 F. 3d, at 500\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court below\nfound that standard met only after describing, in scrupu-\nlous detail, the overwhelming evidence supporting the\nconclusion that Storch falsely testified at Maxwell\u2019s trial2\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent suggests two police officers testified that Storch provid-\n\ned them \u201caccurate and reliable information\u201d when working with Storch\nseveral years before Maxwell\u2019s trial. See post, at 4. In fact, when asked\nif Storch provided \u201caccurate information,\u201d one officer stated: \u201cAs far as I\nknow, yes. I don\u2019t remember any of this being either good or bad . . . .\u201d\n6 Record 1091. The second officer, when asked if Storch was a \u201creliable\nindividual,\u201d responded that \u201cit would depend on what time,\u201d id., at\n1117, and noted that he had ceased all contact with Storch well before\nMaxwell\u2019s trial, after Storch\u2019s attempt to \u201cset . . . up\u201d a prospective\ndefendant, id., at 1118.\n   2 The dissent implies that there was strong evidence suggesting that\n\nStorch was truthful.

Mere disa-\ngreement with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s highly factbound con-\nclusion is, in my opinion, an insufficient basis for granting\ncertiorari.

The other informant claimed that\nMaxwell confessed to 10 murders while raping him during the middle\nof the day in his cell. That story was refuted by another inmate, and\nwhen the informant attempted to obtain bail on the basis of his testi-\nmony regarding Maxwell, another court denied relief. See, e.g., id., at\n6744\u20136754.\n  The dissent also ignores that the physical evidence against Maxwell\nwas largely circumstantial, and that the State\u2019s prosecutor acknowl-\nedged that he had regarded the case against Maxwell as \u201cweak from an\nevidential standpoint.\u201d 9 Record 1844. Three men who briefly saw the\nkiller provided a description of a man taller and heavier than Maxwell.\nAnd when Maxwell was placed in a lineup, and made to say a remark\nall three men had heard the killer say, none of the three identified\nMaxwell.
