But “deference does\nnot imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review.”\nMiller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 340 (2003). Congress\nstated in no uncertain terms that federal habeas relief\nremains available when a state court’s holding is “based\non an unreasonable determination of the facts.” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(2). In this case, the state court’s denial\nof relief to respondent Bobby Joe Maxwell was premised\non its factual finding that there was “no credible or per-\nsuasive evidence Sidney Storch lied at [Maxwell’s] trial in\n1984.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 137. Because the Ninth\nCircuit meticulously set forth an avalanche of evidence\ndemonstrating that the state court’s factual finding was\nunreasonable, see Maxwell v. Roe, 628 F. 3d 486, 498–506\n(2010), I agree with the Court’s decision to deny certiorari.\n   Sidney Storch was one of the most notorious jailhouse\ninformants in the history of Los Angeles County. During a\n4 year period in the mid-1980’s, he testified in at least a\nhalf-dozen trials, each time claiming that the defendant\nhad confessed to him in prison. See Rohrlich & Stewart,\nJailhouse Snitches: Trading Lies for Freedom, L. A. Times,\n2                    CASH v. MAXWELL\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nApr. 16, 1989, p. 30 (“Said inmate Daniel Roach: ‘It seems\nthat half the world just confesses to Sidney Storch’ ”).\n   Throughout this period, however, evidence mounted\nthat Storch repeatedly was fabricating inmates’ confes-\nsions for personal gain. As even the State acknowledges,\nStorch’s signature method was to fashion inmates’ sup-\nposed confessions from publicly available information in\nnewspaper articles. 2 Record 262. At Maxwell’s postcon-\nviction hearing, one former county prosecutor explained\nthat he declined to use Storch in a high-profile 1986 mur-\nder case after determining “Storch was not telling the\ntruth about [the defendant’s] alleged statements,” and had\nlied about having heard a confession at a time when he\nwas not in the defendant’s cell. 9 id., at 1824. Another\nprosecutor later refused to use Storch in a different case\nafter discovering that his “testimony was similar to the\nnewspaper accounts of the case.” 9 id., at 1825. In 1987,\nsheriff’s deputies even confiscated a manual written by\nStorch instructing other jailhouse snitches how to fabri-\ncate confessions. None of this was out of character for\nStorch, who was discharged from the Army in 1964 be-\ncause he was a “ ‘habitual liar,’ ” and was arrested repeat-\nedly for crimes of dishonesty, including forgery, fraud, and\nfalse impersonation—including falsely impersonating a\nCentral Intelligence Agency officer. 628 F. 3d, at 498.\n   As the Ninth Circuit explained at length, both before\nand after Maxwell’s trial, various police officers and prose-\ncutors believed Storch to be unreliable, dishonest, and\nwilling to set up defendants for his own ends. At Max-\nwell’s postconviction hearing, one police officer described\nhow Storch sought to “set . . . up” someone during a for-\ngery investigation, 6 Record 1118; another detective testi-\nfied that he would have put Storch on a Los Angeles Police\nDepartment list of unreliable informants prior to Max-\nwell’s trial. Not long after Maxwell’s trial, prosecutors\nrefused to put Storch on the stand, believing him to have\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

And even the State\nconceded that Storch lied about a variety of material facts\nat Maxwell’s own trial, including his own criminal record\nand his motivation for testifying. This powerful evidence\nsupported Maxwell’s claim that Storch falsely testified\nabout Maxwell’s supposed confession—using precisely the\nsame modus operandi that Storch used time and again to\nfalsely implicate other defendants. See 628 F. 3d, at 504–\n505.\n   The dissent labels all of this evidence “circumstantial.”\nPost, at 3 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). It insists that it is possi-\nble that Storch repeatedly falsely implicated other defend-\nants, and fabricated other material facts at Maxwell’s\ntrial, but uncharacteristically told the truth about Max-\nwell’s supposed confession. Of course, that is possible.\nBut it is not reasonable, given the voluminous evidence\nthat Storch was a habitual liar who even the State con-\ncedes told other material lies at Maxwell’s trial.1\n   Here, the Ninth Circuit recognized that 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(2) imposes a “daunting standard—one that will\nbe satisfied in relatively few cases.” 628 F. 3d, at 500\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court below\nfound that standard met only after describing, in scrupu-\nlous detail, the overwhelming evidence supporting the\nconclusion that Storch falsely testified at Maxwell’s trial2—\n——————\n   1 The dissent suggests two police officers testified that Storch provid-\n\ned them “accurate and reliable information” when working with Storch\nseveral years before Maxwell’s trial. See post, at 4. In fact, when asked\nif Storch provided “accurate information,” one officer stated: “As far as I\nknow, yes. I don’t remember any of this being either good or bad . . . .”\n6 Record 1091. The second officer, when asked if Storch was a “reliable\nindividual,” responded that “it would depend on what time,” id., at\n1117, and noted that he had ceased all contact with Storch well before\nMaxwell’s trial, after Storch’s attempt to “set . . . up” a prospective\ndefendant, id., at 1118.\n   2 The dissent implies that there was strong evidence suggesting that\n\nStorch was truthful.

I agree with\nthe Ninth Circuit’s determination. But even to the extent\nthat the dissent sees error in that determination, the\nNinth Circuit conducted precisely the inquiry required by\n§2254(d)(2) and our precedents. “The principal purpose of\nthis Court’s exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction is to\nclarify the law.” Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556\nU. S. 868, 902 (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).

App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 174. One informant was committed to a mental hospital, and\ninformed the district attorney before trial that his story implicating\nMaxwell had been “nothing more than a story of untruths founded by\nan ‘imaginary delusion.’ ” Tr. 6532. The other informant claimed that\nMaxwell confessed to 10 murders while raping him during the middle\nof the day in his cell. That story was refuted by another inmate, and\nwhen the informant attempted to obtain bail on the basis of his testi-\nmony regarding Maxwell, another court denied relief. See, e.g., id., at\n6744–6754.\n  The dissent also ignores that the physical evidence against Maxwell\nwas largely circumstantial, and that the State’s prosecutor acknowl-\nedged that he had regarded the case against Maxwell as “weak from an\nevidential standpoint.” 9 Record 1844. Three men who briefly saw the\nkiller provided a description of a man taller and heavier than Maxwell.\nAnd when Maxwell was placed in a lineup, and made to say a remark\nall three men had heard the killer say, none of the three identified\nMaxwell.
