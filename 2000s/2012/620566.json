THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS \n\n          DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, \n\n         CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 10\u2013895.      Argued November 2, 2011\u2014Decided January 10, 2012\nAfter the intermediate state appellate court affirmed his state-court\n  conviction, petitioner Gonzalez allowed his time for seeking discre-\n  tionary review with the State\u2019s highest court for criminal appeals to\n  expire. Roughly six weeks later, the intermediate state appellate\n  court issued its mandate. When Gonzalez subsequently sought fed-\n  eral habeas relief, the District Court dismissed Gonzalez\u2019s petition as\n  time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Under 28 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), state prisoners have one year to file federal habeas\n  petitions running from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final\n  by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\n  seeking such review.\u201d The District Court held that Gonzalez\u2019s judg-\n  ment had become \u201cfinal\u201d when his time for seeking discretionary re-\n  view in the State\u2019s highest court expired, and that running the limi-\n  tations period from that date, his petition was untimely.\n     Under AEDPA, a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of ap-\n  pealability (COA) to appeal a district court\u2019s final order in a habeas\n  proceeding. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1). The COA may issue only if the\n  petitioner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a consti-\n  tutional right,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2), and \u201cshall indicate which specific issue\u201d\n  satisfies that showing, \u00a72253(c)(3). A Fifth Circuit judge granted\n  Gonzalez a COA on the question whether his petition was timely.\n  The issued COA, however, failed to \u201cindicate\u201d a constitutional issue.\n     The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Gonzalez\u2019s petition was\n  untimely because the limitations period begins to run for petitioners\n  who fail to appeal to a State\u2019s highest court when the time for seeking\n2                        GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    further direct review in the state court expires. The Fifth Circuit did\n    not mention, and the State did not raise, the \u00a72253(c)(3) defect.\n    When Gonzalez petitioned this Court for review, the State argued for\n    the first time that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate\n    Gonzalez\u2019s appeal based on the \u00a72253(c)(3) defect.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule. A\n COA\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d a constitutional issue does not deprive a\n Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal. Pp. 4\u221213.\n       (a) A rule is jurisdictional \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states that\n a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdiction-\n al,\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515. Here, the only clear\n jurisdictional language in \u00a72253(c) appears in \u00a72253(c)(1). The par-\n ties agree that \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s plain terms make the issuance of a COA\n a jurisdictional prerequisite. The parties also agree that \u00a72253(c)(2),\n which speaks only to when a COA may issue and does not contain\n \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s jurisdictional terms, is nonjurisdictional. It follows that\n \u00a72253(c)(3) is also nonjurisdictional. Like \u00a72253(c)(2), it reflects a\n threshold condition for issuing a COA, and \u201cdoes not speak in juris-\n dictional terms or refer . . . to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.\u201d\n Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515. Jurisdictional treatment also would\n thwart Congress\u2019s intent in AEDPA \u201cto eliminate delays in the feder-\n al habeas review process.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___.\n Once a judge has determined that a COA is warranted and resources\n are deployed in briefing and argument, the COA has fulfilled its\n gatekeeping function. Pp. 4\u22129.\n       (b) The State\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Section\n 2253(c)(3)\u2019s cross-reference to \u00a72253(c)(1) does not mean \u00a72253(c)(3)\n can be read as part of \u00a72253(c)(1), as Congress set off the require-\n ments in distinct paragraphs with distinct terms. The word \u201cshall\u201d in\n \u00a72253(c)(3), meanwhile, underscores the rule\u2019s mandatory nature, but\n not all mandatory rules are jurisdictional. Nor does \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\n mere proximity to other jurisdictional provisions turn a rule that\n speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle. Final-\n ly, the Court rejects the State\u2019s attempt to analogize a COA to a no-\n tice of appeal. Pp. 10\u221213.\n    2. For a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\u2019s high-\n est court, the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\n on the date that the time for seeking such review expires. Pp. 13\u221219.\n       (a) In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, the Court held that a\n federal conviction becomes final \u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction\n on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certio-\n rari,\u201d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, \u201cwhen the time for fil-\n ing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d Id., at 527. In Jimenez v. Quarter-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  man, 555 U. S. 113, the Court adopted Clay\u2019s \u201cmost natural reading\n  of the statutory text\u201d in construing \u201cthe similar language of\n  \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\u201d Id., at 119. The Court made no mention of when\n  Jimenez\u2019s appeal concluded and held that his judgment became final\n  when his time for seeking certiorari expired. Section 2244(d)(1)(A)\n  thus consists of two prongs corresponding to two categories of peti-\n  tioners. For petitioners pursuing direct review all the way to this\n  Court, the judgment becomes final at the \u201cconclusion of direct re-\n  view,\u201d when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies\n  certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at\n  the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d when the time\n  for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.\n  Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the State\u2019s highest court, his\n  judgment became final when his time for seeking review with that\n  court expired. Pp. 13\u201315.\n       (b) Gonzalez argues that courts should determine both prongs for\n  every petitioner who does not seek certiorari, then start the 1-year\n  clock from the latest of the two dates. Gonzalez further contends that\n  when a petitioner does not seek certiorari, state law should define the\n  \u201cconclusion of direct review.\u201d The words \u201clatest of,\u201d however, appear\n  in \u00a72244(d)(1), not \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Nothing in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) contem-\n  plates any conflict between the two prongs or instructs that the later\n  of the two shall prevail. Gonzalez\u2019s approach of scouring each State\u2019s\n  laws and cases to determine how the State defines finality, moreover,\n  would contradict the uniform meaning of \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d\n  that Clay and Jimenez accepted. It will be a rare situation in which a\n  delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance is so severe as to prevent a petitioner\n  from filing a federal habeas petition within a year or requesting a\n  stay and abeyance. Finally, the Court rejects Gonzalez\u2019s alternative\n  argument that his petition is timely because it was filed within a\n  year of when his time for seeking certiorari review expired.

RICK\n\n   THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF\n\n      CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL\n\n            INSTITUTIONS DIVISION \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 10, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case interprets two provisions of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The\nfirst, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c), provides that a habeas peti-\ntioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to\nappeal a federal district court\u2019s final order in a habeas\nproceeding. \u00a72253(c)(1). The COA may issue only if the\npetitioner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of\na constitutional right,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2), and \u201cshall indicate\nwhich specific issue\u201d satisfies that showing. \u00a72253(c)(3).\nWe hold that \u00a72253(c)(3) is not a jurisdictional require-\nment. Accordingly, a judge\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d the\nrequisite constitutional issue in a COA does not deprive a\ncourt of appeals of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudi-\ncate the habeas petitioner\u2019s appeal.\n   The second provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), estab-\nlishes a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file\nfederal habeas petitions, running from \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\n2                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re-\nview.\u201d We hold that, for a state prisoner who does not\nseek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judgment be-\ncomes \u201cfinal\u201d on the date that the time for seeking such\nreview expires.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in\nTexas state court. The intermediate state appellate court,\nthe Texas Court of Appeals, affirmed Gonzalez\u2019s conviction\non July 12, 2006. Gonzalez then allowed his time for\nseeking discretionary review with the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals (Texas CCA)\u2014the State\u2019s highest court\nfor criminal appeals\u2014to expire on August 11, 2006. Tex.\nRule App. Proc. 68.2(a) (2011). The Texas Court of Ap-\npeals issued its mandate on September 26, 2006.\n   After Gonzalez, proceeding pro se, petitioned unsuccess-\nfully for state habeas relief, he filed a federal habeas\npetition under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 on January 24, 2008, in\nthe U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\nHis petition alleged, inter alia, that the nearly 10-year\ndelay between his indictment and trial violated his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. The District Court,\nwithout discussing Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional claims, dis-\nmissed Gonzalez\u2019s petition as time barred by the 1-year\nstatute of limitations in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Although Gonza-\nlez argued that his judgment had not become final until\nthe Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate, the Dis-\ntrict Court held that Gonzalez\u2019s judgment had become\nfinal when his time for seeking discretionary review in the\nTexas CCA expired on August 11, 2006. Counting from\nthat date, and tolling the limitations period for the time\nduring which Gonzalez\u2019s state habeas petition was pend-\ning, Gonzalez\u2019s limitations period elapsed on December 17,\n2007\u2014over a month before he filed his federal habeas\npetition. The District Court denied a COA.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Gonzalez applied to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit for a COA on two grounds: (1) his habeas\npetition was timely, and (2) his Sixth Amendment speedy-\ntrial right was violated. A Court of Appeals judge granted\na COA on the question \u201cwhether the habeas application\nwas timely filed because Gonzalez\u2019s conviction became\nfinal, and thus the limitations period commenced, on the\ndate the intermediate state appellate court issued its\nmandate.\u201d App. 347. The COA did not mention the Sixth\nAmendment question.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 623 F. 3d 222 (2010).\nAcknowledging that a sister Circuit had run the limita-\ntions period from the date of a state court\u2019s issuance of a\nmandate, the Court of Appeals deemed the mandate\u2019s\nissuance \u201cirrelevant\u201d to determining finality under\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Id., at 224, 226 (disagreeing with Riddle v.\nKemna, 523 F. 3d 850 (CA8 2008) (en banc)). The Court of\nAppeals held that because a judgment becomes final at\n\u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the\ntime for seeking such review,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), the limita-\ntions period begins to run for petitioners who fail to appeal\nto a State\u2019s highest court when the time for seeking fur-\nther direct review in the state court expires. The Court of\nAppeals therefore concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s conviction\nbecame final on August 11, 2006, and his habeas petition\nwas time barred.\n   The Court of Appeals did not address Gonzalez\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment claim or discuss whether the COA had been\nimproperly issued. Nor did the State allege any defect in\nthe COA or move to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Gonzalez petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.\nIn its brief in opposition, the State argued for the first\ntime that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to adju-\ndicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal because the COA identified only\na procedural issue, without also \u201cindicat[ing]\u201d a constitu-\ntional issue as required by \u00a72253(c)(3). We granted certio-\n4                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrari to decide two questions, both of which implicate splits\nin authority: (1) whether the Court of Appeals had juris-\ndiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal, notwithstanding\nthe \u00a72253(c)(3) defect;1 and (2) whether Gonzalez\u2019s habeas\npetition was time barred under \u00a72244(d)(1) due to the\ndate on which his judgment became final.2 564 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the Court of Appeals had juris-\ndiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.\n                               A\n  Section 2253, as amended by AEDPA, governs appeals\nin habeas corpus proceedings.         The first subsection,\n\u00a72253(a), is a general grant of jurisdiction, providing that\ndistrict courts\u2019 final orders in habeas proceedings \u201cshall be\nsubject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72253(a). The second, \u00a72253(b), limits jurisdiction\nover a particular type of final order. See \u00a72253(b) (\u201cThere\nshall be no right of appeal from a final order in a proceed-\ning to test the validity of a warrant [of] remov[al] . . .\u201d).\nThis case concerns the third, \u00a72253(c), which provides:\n       \u201c(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-\n     cate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Circuits have divided over whether a defect in a COA is a juris-\n\ndictional bar. Compare, e.g., Phelps v. Alameda, 366 F. 3d 722, 726\n(CA9 2004) (no); Porterfield v. Bell, 258 F. 3d 484, 485 (CA6 2001) (no);\nYoung v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 798\u2013799 (CA7 1997) (no), with\nUnited States v. Cepero, 224 F. 3d 256, 259\u2013262 (CA3 2000) (en banc)\n(yes).\n  2 The Circuits have divided over when a judgment becomes final if a\n\npetitioner forgoes review in a State\u2019s highest court. Compare, e.g., 623\nF. 3d 222, 226 (CA5 2010) (case below) (date when time for seeking\nsuch review expires); Hemmerle v. Schriro, 495 F. 3d 1069, 1073\u20131074\n(CA9 2007) (same), with Riddle v. Kemna, 523 F. 3d 850, 855\u2013856 (CA8\n2008) (en banc) (date when state court issues its mandate).\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals judge granted a COA\nthat identified a debatable procedural ruling, but did not\n\u201cindicate\u201d the issue on which Gonzalez had made a sub-\nstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as\nrequired by \u00a72253(c)(3). The question before us is whether\nthat defect deprived the Court of Appeals of the power to\nadjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal. We hold that it did not.\n  This Court has endeavored in recent years to \u201cbring\nsome discipline\u201d to the use of the term \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\nHenderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 5). Recognizing our \u201cless than meticulous\u201d use of the\nterm in the past, we have pressed a stricter distinction\nbetween truly jurisdictional rules, which govern \u201ca court\u2019s\nadjudicatory authority,\u201d and nonjurisdictional \u201cclaim-\nprocessing rules,\u201d which do not. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443, 454\u2013455 (2004). When a requirement goes to\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consid-\ner sua sponte issues that the parties have disclaimed or\nhave not presented. See United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S.\n625, 630 (2002). Subject-matter jurisdiction can never be\n6                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwaived or forfeited. The objections may be resurrected at\nany point in the litigation, and a valid objection may lead\na court midway through briefing to dismiss a complaint in\nits entirety. \u201c[M]any months of work on the part of the\nattorneys and the court may be wasted.\u201d Henderson, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Courts, we have said, should\nnot lightly attach those \u201cdrastic\u201d consequences to limits\nCongress has enacted. Ibid.\n   We accordingly have applied the following principle: A\nrule is jurisdictional \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states\nthat a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count\nas jurisdictional.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n515 (2006). But if \u201cCongress does not rank a statutory\nlimitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should\ntreat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.\u201d Id., at 516.3\nThat clear-statement principle makes particular sense in\nthis statute, as we consider\u2014against the backdrop of\n\u00a72253(a)\u2019s clear jurisdictional grant to the courts of ap-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Wehave also held that \u201ccontext, including this Court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a\nstatute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.\u201d Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\nMuchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13). Here, however,\neven though the requirement of a COA (or its predecessor, the certifi-\ncate of probable cause (CPC)) dates back to 1908, Congress did not\nenact the indication requirement until 1996. There is thus no \u201clong line\nof this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress\u201d on which to rely.\nUnion Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen.\nComm. of Adjustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 13).\n   The issuance of a CPC, like the issuance of a COA, was jurisdictional.\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, post, at 8\u201310 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), that fact does not suggest that the indication requirement is juris-\ndictional as well. If anything, the inference runs the other way. For\nnearly a century, a judge\u2019s granting or withholding of a CPC, absent\nany indication of issues, was the fully effective \u201cexpression of opinion,\u201d\npost, at 8, required for an appeal to proceed. AEDPA\u2019s new require-\nment that judges indicate the specific issues to be raised on appeal has\nno predecessor provision\u2014indeed, it is the primary difference between\na CPC and COA.\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

As we explained in Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003), \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s plain terms\u2014\n\u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of\nappealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of\nappeals\u201d\u2014establish that \u201cuntil a COA has been issued\nfederal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the\nmerits of appeals from habeas petitioners.\u201d Id., at 336.\nThe parties thus agree that \u00a72253(c)(1) is jurisdictional.\n   The parties also agree that \u00a72253(c)(2) is nonjurisdic-\ntional.4 That is for good reason. Section 2253(c)(2) speaks\nonly to when a COA may issue\u2014upon \u201ca substantial show-\ning of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d It does not\ncontain \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s jurisdictional terms. See Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (\u201c[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally . . .\u201d). And it\nwould be passing strange if, after a COA has issued, each\ncourt of appeals adjudicating an appeal were dutybound to\nrevisit the threshold showing and gauge its \u201csubstan-\ntial[ity]\u201d to verify its jurisdiction. That inquiry would be\nlargely duplicative of the merits question before the court.\n   It follows that \u00a72253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.\nLike \u00a72253(c)(2), it too reflects a threshold condition for\nthe issuance of a COA\u2014the COA\u2019s indication of \u201cwhich\nspecific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by\nparagraph (2).\u201d It too \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional\nterms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [ap-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The United States as amicus curiae contends that \u00a72253(c)(2) is\n\njurisdictional, but the State concedes that it is not.

S., at 515 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). The unambiguous jurisdictional\nterms of \u00a7\u00a72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) show that Congress\nwould have spoken in clearer terms if it intended\n\u00a72253(c)(3) to have similar jurisdictional force. Instead,\nthe contrast underscores that the failure to obtain a COA\nis jurisdictional, while a COA\u2019s failure to indicate an issue\nis not. A defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any\nCOA.\n   It is telling, moreover, that Congress placed the power\nto issue COAs in the hands of a \u201ccircuit justice or judge.\u201d5\nIt would seem somewhat counterintuitive to render a\npanel of court of appeals judges powerless to act on ap-\npeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empow-\nered one court of appeals judge to grant. Indeed, whereas\n\u00a72253(c)(2)\u2019s substantial-showing requirement at least de-\nscribes a burden that \u201cthe applicant\u201d seeking a COA\nbears, \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s indication requirement binds only the\njudge issuing the COA. Notably, Gonzalez advanced both\nthe timeliness and Sixth Amendment issues in his appli-\ncation for a COA. A petitioner, having successfully ob-\ntained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the\nCOA and, as in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done everything\nrequired of him by law. That fact would only compound\nthe \u201cunfai[r] prejudice\u201d resulting from the sua sponte\ndismissals and remands that jurisdictional treatment\nwould entail. Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The courts of appeals uniformly interpret \u201ccircuit justice or judge\u201d to\n\nencompass district judges.

Rule App. Proc. 22(b).\nHabeas Corpus Rule 11(a) requires district judges to decide whether to\ngrant or deny a COA in the first instance.\n    6 That fact also distinguishes the indication requirement from every\n\n\u201c \u2018similar provisio[n]\u2019 \u201d that the dissent claims we have deemed jurisdic-\ntional.

Florida, 560\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16). The COA process\nscreens out issues unworthy of judicial time and attention\nand ensures that frivolous claims are not assigned to\nmerits panels. Once a judge has made the determination\nthat a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in\nbriefing and argument, however, the COA has fulfilled\nthat gatekeeping function. Even if additional screening of\nalready-issued COAs for \u00a72253(c)(3) defects could further\nwinnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would\nnot outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra\nlayer of review. This case, in which the alleged defect\nwould be dispositive, exemplifies those inefficiencies; the\nState requests that we vacate and remand with instruc-\ntions to dismiss the appeal based on a \u00a72253(c)(3) defect\nthat it raised for the first time in response to a petition for\ncertiorari. And delay would be particularly fruitless in the\nnumerous cases where, as here, the district court dis-\nmissed the petition on procedural grounds and the court of\nappeals affirms, without having to address the omitted\nconstitutional issue at all.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cprocedural conditions for appealing a case from one Article III court to\nanother.\u201d Ibid.; but see, e.g., post, at 6\u20137, n. 2 (conceding that the \u201crule\u201d\ndoes not apply to criminal appeals); Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S.\n757, 763 (2001) (failure to sign notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional\nomission). All the cases, meanwhile, involved time limits (save one\ninvolving Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1), which we address\ninfra). In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we emphasized our\n\u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent\u201d for treating statutory time limits on\nappeals as jurisdictional, id., at 209, n. 2, but even \u201cBowles did not hold\n. . . that all statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be con-\nsidered jurisdictional,\u201d Reed Elsevier, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). This case, in any event, involves a different type of procedural\ncondition.\n10                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The State, aided by the United States as amicus curiae,\nmakes several arguments in support of jurisdictional\ntreatment of \u00a72253(c)(3). None is persuasive.\n   First, the State notes that although \u00a72253(c)(3) does not\nspeak in jurisdictional terms, it refers back to \u00a72253(c)(1),\nwhich does. The State argues that it is as if \u00a72253(c)(1)\nprovided: \u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-\ncate of appealability that shall indicate the specific issue or\nissues that satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2),\nan appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals.\u201d The\nproblem is that the statute provides no such thing. In-\nstead, Congress set off the requirements in distinct para-\ngraphs and, rather than mirroring their terms, excluded\nthe jurisdictional terms in one from the other. Notably,\nthe State concedes that \u00a72253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional,\neven though it too cross-references \u00a72253(c)(1) and is\ncross-referenced by \u00a72253(c)(3).\n   Second, the State seizes on the word \u201cshall\u201d in\n\u00a72253(c)(3), arguing that an omitted indication renders the\nCOA no COA at all. But calling a rule nonjurisdictional\ndoes not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely\nobjection can be ignored. If a party timely raises the\nCOA\u2019s failure to indicate a constitutional issue, the court\nof appeals panel must address the defect by considering an\namendment to the COA or remanding to the district judge\nfor specification of the issues.7 This Court, moreover, has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent\u2019s insistence that there is \u201cno practical, real-world effect\u201d\n\nto treating this rule as mandatory, post, at 4, ignores the real world.\nCourts of appeals regularly amend COAs or remand for specification of\nissues, notwithstanding the supposed potential to \u201cembarras[s] a\ncolleague.\u201d Post, at 5; see, e.g., Saunders v. Senkowski, 587 F. 3d 543,\n545 (CA2 2009) (per curiam) (amending COA to add issue); United\nStates v. Weaver, 195 F. 3d 52, 53 (CADC 1999) (remanding for specifi-\ncation of issues). The government frequently alleges COA defects as\ngrounds for dismissal (as the State did here, at this late stage), appar-\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlong \u201crejected the notion that \u2018all mandatory prescriptions,\nhowever emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d\nHenderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also Dolan\nv. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)\n(statute\u2019s reference to \u201cshall\u201d alone does not render statu-\ntory deadline jurisdictional). Nothing in \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\nprescription establishes that an omitted indication should\nremain an open issue throughout the case.\n   Third, the United States argues that the placement of\n\u00a72253(c)(3) in a section containing jurisdictional provisions\nsignals that it too is jurisdictional. In characterizing\ncertain requirements as nonjurisdictional, we have on\noccasion observed their \u201c \u2018separat[ion]\u2019 \u201d from jurisdictional\nprovisions. E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515.\nThe converse, however, is not necessarily true: Mere prox-\nimity will not turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional\nterms into a jurisdictional hurdle. In fact, \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\nproximity to \u00a7\u00a72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) highlights the ab-\nsence of clear jurisdictional terms in \u00a72253(c)(3).\n   Finally, the State analogizes a COA to a notice of ap-\npeal, pointing out that both a notice and its contents are\njurisdictional prerequisites. Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 3(c)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must:\n\u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\u201d; \u201c(B)\ndesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being ap-\npealed\u201d; and \u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is\ntaken.\u201d We have held that \u201cRule 3\u2019s dictates are jurisdic-\ntional in nature.\u201d Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nently not sharing the dissent\u2019s concern that such efforts \u201cyield nothing\nbut additional litigation expenses.\u201d Post, at 5; see, e.g., Porterfield, 258\nF. 3d, at 485; Cepero, 224 F. 3d, at 257. Habeas petitioners, too, have\nevery incentive to request that defects be resolved, not only to defuse\npotential problems later in the litigation, but also to ensure that the\nissue on which they sought appeal is certified and will receive full\nbriefing and consideration.\n12                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We reject this analogy. We construed the content re-\nquirements for notices of appeal as jurisdictional because\nwe were \u201cconvinced that the harshness of our construction\n[wa]s \u2018imposed by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d Torres v. Oakland\nScavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 318 (1988). Rule 4, we\nnoted, establishes mandatory time limits for filing a notice\nof appeal. Excusing a failure to name a party in a notice\nof appeal, in violation of Rule 3, would be \u201cequivalent to\npermitting courts to extend the time for filing a notice of\nappeal,\u201d in violation of Rule 4. Id., at 315. And \u201ctime\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as\njurisdictional in American law for well over a century.\u201d\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209, n. 2 (2007). Accord-\ningly, the Advisory Committee Note \u201cmakes no distinction\namong the various requirements of Rule 3 and Rule 4,\u201d\ntreating them \u201cas a single jurisdictional threshold.\u201d\nTorres, 487 U. S., at 315; see also id., at 316 (\u201cthe Advisory\nCommittee viewed the requirements of Rule 3 as jurisdic-\ntional in nature\u201d). Here, we find no similar basis for treat-\ning the paragraphs of \u00a72253(c) as a single jurisdictional\nthreshold.\n   Moreover, in explaining why the naming requirement\nwas jurisdictional in Torres, we reasoned that an unnamed\nparty leaves the notice\u2019s \u201cintended recipient[s]\u201d\u2014the\nappellee and court\u2014\u201cunable to determine with certitude\nwhether [that party] should be bound by an adverse judg-\nment or held liable for costs or sanctions.\u201d Id., at 318.\nThe party could sit on the fence, await the outcome, and\nopt to participate only if it was favorable. That possibility\nof gamesmanship is not present here. Unlike the party\nwho fails to submit a compliant notice of appeal, the habe-\nas petitioner who obtains a COA cannot control how that\nCOA is drafted.8 And whereas a party\u2019s failure to be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent claims that we fail to give stare decisis effect to Torres.\n\nPost, at 10.

AEDPA establishes a 1-year limitations\nperiod for state prisoners to file for federal habeas relief,\nwhich \u201crun[s] from the latest of \u201d four specified dates.9\n\u00a72244(d)(1). This case concerns the first of those dates:\n\u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\nseeking such review.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). The question before\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFederal Rule featuring a different textual, contextual, and historical\nbackdrop, the dissent notably fails to grapple with\u2014indeed, its opinion\nis bereft of quotation to\u2014any supporting reasoning in that opinion.\nThat reasoning is simply not applicable here.\n  9 Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1) provides:\n\n  \u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\nState court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014\n  \u201c(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;\n  \u201c(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application creat-\ned by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such\nState action;\n  \u201c(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recog-\nnized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases\non collateral review; or\n  \u201c(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims\npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence.\u201d\n14                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nus is when the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d if a petitioner\ndoes not appeal to a State\u2019s highest court.\n                              A\n  In construing the language of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), we do not\nwrite on a blank slate. In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S.\n522 (2003), we addressed AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations\nfor federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief. See\n\u00a72255(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (beginning 1-year period of\nlimitations from \u201cthe date on which the judgment of con-\nviction becomes final\u201d). We held that the federal judgment\nbecomes final \u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the\nmerits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari,\u201d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari,\n\u201cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d Id.,\nat 527. In so holding, we rejected the argument that, if a\npetitioner declines to seek certiorari, the limitations peri-\nod \u201cstarts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its\nmandate.\u201d Id., at 529.\n  In Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113 (2009), we\ndescribed Clay\u2019s interpretation as comporting \u201cwith the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text\u201d and saw \u201cno\nreason to depart\u201d from it in \u201cconstruing the similar lan-\nguage of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\u201d 555 U. S., at 119. The state\ncourt had permitted Jimenez to file an out-of-time direct\nappeal. We held that this \u201creset\u201d the limitations period;\nJimenez\u2019s judgment would now become final at \u201cthe con-\nclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking review of that [out-of-time] appeal.\u201d\nId., at 120\u2013121. Because Jimenez did not seek certiorari,\nwe made no mention of when the out-of-time appeal \u201ccon-\nclu[ded].\u201d Rather, we held that his judgment became final\nwhen his \u201ctime for seeking certiorari review in this Court\nexpired.\u201d Id., at 120. Nor did we mention the date on\nwhich the state court issued its mandate. Both Clay and\nJimenez thus suggested that the direct review process\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neither \u201cconcludes\u201d or \u201cexpires,\u201d depending on whether the\npetitioner pursues or forgoes direct appeal to this Court.\n   We now make clear what we suggested in those cases:\nThe text of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), which marks finality as of \u201cthe\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time\nfor seeking such review,\u201d consists of two prongs. Each\nprong\u2014the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d and the \u201cexpira-\ntion of the time for seeking such review\u201d\u2014relates to a\ndistinct category of petitioners. For petitioners who pur-\nsue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment\nbecomes final at the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d\u2014when\nthis Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a\npetition for certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judg-\nment becomes final at the \u201cexpiration of the time for seek-\ning such review\u201d\u2014when the time for pursuing direct\nreview in this Court, or in state court, expires. We thus\nagree with the Court of Appeals that because Gonzalez did\nnot appeal to the State\u2019s highest court, his judgment be-\ncame final when his time for seeking review with the\nState\u2019s highest court expired.\n                               B\n   Gonzalez offers an alternative reading of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A):\nCourts should determine both the \u201cconclusion of direct\nreview\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such\nreview\u201d for every petitioner who does not seek certiorari,\nthen start the 1-year clock from the \u201clatest of \u201d the two\ndates. Gonzalez rejects our uniform definition of the\n\u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d as the date on which this\nCourt affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a peti-\ntion for certiorari. In his view, whenever a petitioner does\nnot seek certiorari, the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d is the\ndate on which state law marks finality\u2014in Texas, the date\non which the mandate issues. Ex parte Johnson, 12 S. W.\n3d 472, 473 (Crim. App. 2000) (per curiam). Applying this\napproach, Gonzalez contends that his habeas petition was\n16                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntimely because his direct review \u201cconcluded\u201d when the\nmandate issued (on September 26, 2006), later than the\ndate on which his time for seeking Texas CCA review\n\u201cexpired\u201d (August 11, 2006). We find his construction of\nthe statute unpersuasive.\n   First, Gonzalez lacks a textual anchor for his later-\nin-time approach. The words \u201clatest of\u201d do not appear\nanywhere in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).         Rather, they appear in\n\u00a72244(d)(1) and refer to the \u201clatest of\u201d the dates in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D)\u2014the latter three of which\nare inapplicable here. Nothing in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) contem-\nplates any conflict between the \u201cconclusion of direct re-\nview\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such\nreview,\u201d much less instructs that the later of the two shall\nprevail.\n   Nor is Gonzalez\u2019s later-in-time reading necessary to give\nboth prongs of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) full effect. Our reading does\nso by applying one \u201cor\u201d the other, depending on whether\nthe direct review process concludes or expires. Treating\nthe judgment as final on one date \u201cor\u201d the other is con-\nsistent with the disjunctive language of the provision.\n   Second, Gonzalez misreads our precedents. Gonzalez\nasserts that in Jimenez, we made a later-in-time choice\nbetween the two prongs. That is mistaken. Rather, we\nchose between two \u201cexpiration\u201d dates corresponding to\ndifferent appeals: Jimenez initially failed to appeal to the\nTexas Court of Appeals and that appeal became final\nwhen his \u201ctime for seeking discretionary review . . . ex-\npired.\u201d 555 U. S., at 117, 119. When Jimenez was later\nallowed to file an out-of-time appeal, he pursued appeals\nwith both the Texas Court of Appeals and Texas CCA; the\nout-of-time appeal thus became final when his \u201c[t]ime for\nseeking certiorari review . . . with this Court expired.\u201d Id.,\nat 116, 120. We adopted the out-of-time appeal\u2019s date of\nfinality over the initial appeal\u2019s date of finality. Id., at\n119\u2013121. Critically, by deeming the initial appeal final at\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe expiration of time for seeking review in state court,\nand the out-of-time appeal final at the expiration of time\nfor seeking certiorari in this Court, we reinforced Clay\u2019s\nsuggestion that the \u201cexpiration\u201d prong governs all peti-\ntioners who do not pursue direct review all the way to this\nCourt.10\n   Third, Gonzalez argues that AEDPA\u2019s federalism con-\ncerns and respect for state-law procedures mean that we\nshould not read \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) to disregard state law. We\nagree. That is why a state court\u2019s reopening of direct\nreview will reset the limitations period. 555 U. S., at 121.\nThat is also why, just as we determine the \u201cexpiration of\nthe time for seeking [direct] review\u201d from this Court\u2019s\nfiling deadlines when petitioners forgo certiorari, we look\nto state-court filing deadlines when petitioners forgo state-\ncourt appeals. Referring to state-law procedures in that\ncontext makes sense because such deadlines are inherent-\nly court specific. There is no risk of relying on \u201cstate-law\nrules that may differ from the general federal rule.\u201d Clay,\n537 U. S., at 531.\n   By contrast, Gonzalez urges us to scour each State\u2019s\nlaws and cases to determine how it defines finality for\nevery petitioner who forgoes a state-court appeal. That ap-\nproach would usher in state-by-state definitions of the con-\nclusion of direct review. It would be at odds with the\nuniform definition we adopted in Clay and accepted in the\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) context in Jimenez. And it would pose\nserious administrability concerns. Even if roughly \u201chalf of\nthe States define the conclusion of direct review as the\nissuance of the mandate or similar process,\u201d Brief for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Gonzalez also argues that Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327\n\n(2007), supports his focus on the state court\u2019s issuance of the mandate\nbecause it referred to a mandate in determining when state postconvic-\ntion proceedings were no longer pending. Lawrence, however, is inap-\nposite. The case involved a different provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2),\nwhich by its terms refers to \u201cState\u201d procedures.\n18                     GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 40, that still leaves half with either different\nrules or no settled rules at all.11\n  Fourth, Gonzalez speculates that our reading will rob\nsome habeas petitioners of the full 1-year limitations pe-\nriod. Gonzalez asserts that our reading starts the clock\nrunning from the date that his time for seeking Texas\nCCA review expired, even though, under Texas law, he\ncould not file for state habeas relief until six weeks later,\non the date the Texas Court of Appeals issued its man-\ndate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07, \u00a73(a)\n(Vernon Supp. 2011). His inability to initiate state habeas\nproceedings during those six weeks, he argues, reduced his\n1-year federal habeas filing period by six weeks. We\nexpect, however, that it will be a rare situation where a\npetitioner confronting similar state laws faces a delay in\nthe mandate\u2019s issuance so excessive that it prevents him\nor her from filing a federal habeas petition within a year.12\nA petitioner who has exhausted his or her claims in state\ncourt need not await state habeas proceedings to seek\nfederal habeas relief on those claims. To the extent a\npetitioner has had his or her federal filing period severely\ntruncated by a delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance and has\nunexhausted claims that must be raised on state habeas\nreview, such a petitioner could file a request for a stay and\nabeyance from the federal district court. See Rhines v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Compare, e.g., PSL Realty Co. v. Granite Inv. Co., 86 Ill. 2d 291,\n\n304, 427 N. E. 2d 563, 569 (1981) (judgment is final \u201cwhen entered\u201d);\nGillis v. F & A Enterprises, 934 P. 2d 1253, 1256 (Wyo. 1997) (judgment\nis final when \u201copinion is filed with the clerk\u201d), with Ex parte Johnson,\n12 S. W. 3d 472, 473 (Texas CCA 2000) (per curiam) (judgment is final\nat \u201cissuance of the mandate\u201d).\n   12 We note that Gonzalez waited four months from the date of the\n\nmandate\u2019s issuance before filing a state habeas petition. See 623 F. 3d,\nat 223. When that petition was dismissed as improperly filed, Gonzalez\nwaited another three months before refiling. Ibid. Even then, his state\nhabeas proceedings concluded several weeks before his 1-year federal\ndeadline elapsed. Id., at 225.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nWeber, 544 U. S. 269, 277 (2005).\n  Finally, Gonzalez argues, as an alternative to his later-\nin-time construction, that his petition should be consid-\nered timely because it was filed within a year of when his\ntime for seeking this Court\u2019s review\u2014as opposed to the\nTexas CCA\u2019s review\u2014expired. We can review, however,\nonly judgments of a \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d or of a lower\nstate court if the \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d has denied\ndiscretionary review. This Court\u2019s Rule 13.1; see also 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71257(a) (2006 ed.). Because Gonzalez did not\nappeal to the Texas CCA, this Court would have lacked\njurisdiction over a petition for certiorari from the Texas\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming Gonzalez\u2019s conviction.\nWe therefore decline to incorporate the 90-day period for\nseeking certiorari in determining when Gonzalez\u2019s judg-\nment became final.\n                        *     *   *\n  In sum, we hold that \u00a72253(c)(3) is a mandatory but\nnonjurisdictional rule. Here, the COA\u2019s failure to \u201cindi-\ncate\u201d a constitutional issue did not deprive the Court of\nAppeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.\nWe further hold that, with respect to a state prisoner who\ndoes not seek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judg-\nment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) when the time\nfor seeking such review expires\u2014here, August 11, 2006.\nWe thus agree with the Court of Appeals that Gonzalez\u2019s\nfederal habeas petition was time barred.\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit is\n                                                  Affirmed.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. C. \u00a72253(c)\nis to spare three-judge courts of appeals the trouble of\nentertaining (and the prosecution the trouble of defending\nagainst) appeals from the denials of relief in habeas and\n\u00a72255 proceedings, unless a district or circuit judge has\nidentified an issue on which the applicant has made a\nsubstantial showing of a constitutional violation. Where\nno such constitutional issue has been identified, an appeal\non other, nonconstitutional, issues (such as the statute of\nlimitations issue that the Court decides today) will not lie.\n   Today\u2019s opinion transforms this into a provision that\nallows appeal so long as a district or circuit judge, for\nwhatever reason or for no reason at all, approves it. This\nmakes a hash of the statute. The opinion thinks this\nalchemy required by the Court\u2019s previously expressed\ndesire to \u201c \u2018bring some discipline\u2019 to the use of the term\n\u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 5 (quoting Henderson v.

I would re-\nverse the judgment below for want of jurisdiction.\n2                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                               I\nFair Meaning of the Text\n  Congress amended \u00a72253 to its current form in the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA). In its entirety, the section reads as follows:\n       \u201c(a) In a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding\n    under section 2255 before a district judge, the final\n    order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the\n    court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding\n    is held.\n       \u201c(b) There shall be no right of appeal from a final\n    order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant\n    to remove to another district or place for commitment\n    or trial a person charged with a criminal offense\n    against the United States, or to test the validity of\n    such person\u2019s detention pending removal proceedings.\n       \u201c(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a cer-\n    tificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken\n    to the court of appeals from\u2014\n        \u201c(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\n        in which the detention complained of arises out of\n        process issued by a State court; or\n        \u201c(B) the final order in a proceeding under section\n        2255.\n       \u201c(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under\n    paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a sub-\n    stantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n       \u201c(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph\n    (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy\n    the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d\nAs the Court acknowledges, ante, at 6\u20137, all three subsec-\ntions\u2014(a), (b), and (c)\u2014clearly speak to the jurisdiction of\nthe courts of appeals. Subsection (a) gives appellate juris-\ndiction to \u201cthe court of appeals for the circuit in which\nthe proceeding is held\u201d; subsection (b) carves out certain\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 336\n(2003).\n   Paragraph 2253(c)(3) says that a certificate of appeal-\nability must \u201cindicate\u201d which issue or issues in the case\ninvolve a substantial showing of a constitutional violation.\nEveryone agrees that the certificate issued below contains\nno such indication. See ante, at 5. It appears, in fact, that\nthe issuing judge never considered whether any of Gonza-\nlez\u2019s constitutional claims satisfied paragraph (2). As far\nas we know, no federal judge has ever determined that\nGonzalez \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of\na constitutional right.\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2). The Court does not\neven suggest that he has\u2014but it goes on to decide the\nstatute-of-limitations issue in the case.\n   Its basis for proceeding in this fashion is the remarkable\nstatement that \u201c[a] defective COA is not equivalent to the\nlack of any COA.\u201d Ante, at 8. That is simply not true with\nrespect to a significant defect in a legal document. Would\none say that a deed which lacks the words of conveyance is\nnot equivalent to the lack of a deed? Or that a passport\nwhich lacks the Secretary of State\u2019s affirmance of the\nbearer\u2019s citizenship is not equivalent to the lack of a pass-\nport? Minor technical defects are one thing, but a defect\nthat goes to the whole purpose of the instrument is some-\nthing else. And the whole purpose of the certificate-of-\nappealability procedure is to make sure that, before a case\ncan proceed to the court of appeals, a judge has made the\ndetermination that it presents a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right. To call something a\nvalid certificate of appealability which does not contain\nthe central finding that is the whole purpose of a certifi-\ncate of appealability is quite absurd.\n   The Court says that \u201c[o]nce a judge has made the de-\n4                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntermination that a COA is warranted and resources are\ndeployed in briefing and argument, . . . the COA has ful-\nfilled [its] gatekeeping function.\u201d Ante, at 10. But of\ncourse it has not done so\u2014it has performed no gatekeeping\nfunction whatever\u2014if \u201cthe determination that a COA is\nwarranted\u201d has not been accompanied by the issuing\njudge\u2019s opinion required to support the determination:\nthat there is an issue as to which the applicant has made\na \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2). As the very next sentence of today\u2019s\nopinion discloses, what the Court means by \u201chas fulfilled\n[its] gatekeeping function\u201d is simply that it will not be\nworth the trouble of going back, since that would \u201cnot\noutweigh the costs of further delay,\u201d ante, at 9.\n   That is doubtless true, and it demonstrates the hollow-\nness of the Court\u2019s assurance that \u201ccalling a rule nonjuris-\ndictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a\ntimely objection can be ignored,\u201d ante, at 10. That state-\nment is true enough as a general proposition: Calling the\nnumerosity requirement in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500 (2006), nonjurisdictional, for example, did not\neliminate it, where protest was made, as a continuing\nmandatory requirement for relief on the merits, id., at\n516. Even the time-of-filing requirement in Eberhart v.\nUnited States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam), continued\nto have \u201cbite\u201d even though it was held nonjurisdictional: It\nprevented relief when the failure to observe it was prop-\nerly challenged, id., at 19. But the Court has managed to\ncreate today a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement which\u2014precisely\nbecause it will not be worth the trouble of going back\u2014has\nno practical, real-world effect.1 What is the consequence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court suggests that I \u201cignor[e] the real world,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 7,\n\nin which litigants and courts have taken steps to correct a defective\nCOA. But these actions are unsurprising in a world in which there was\nthe possibility that this Court would treat \u00a72253(c)(3) as a jurisdictional\nrequirement and a court of appeals had already done so.

None whatever. The habeas peti-\ntioner already has what he wants, argument before the\ncourt of appeals. The government, for its part, is either\nconfident in its view that there has been no substantial\nshowing of denial of a constitutional right\u2014in which case\nit is just as easy (if not easier) to win before three judges\nas it is before one; or else it is not\u2014in which case a cru-\nsade to enforce \u00a72253(c) is likely to yield nothing but\nadditional litigation expenses. As for the three-judge\npanel of the court of appeals, it remains free, as always, to\nchoose whichever mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional basis it\nwishes for resolving the case. Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for\nBetter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 93\u201394 (1998). Why not\nchoose the one that is sure to be final and that might avoid\nembarrassing a colleague? No one has any interest in\nenforcing the \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement. Which is perhaps\nwhy, as I proceed to discuss, mandatory requirements for\ncourt-to-court appeal are always made jurisdictional.\nPast Treatment of Similar Provisions\n  As the Court acknowledges, \u201c \u2018context, including this\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years\npast, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement\nas jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3 (quoting Reed Elsevier,\nInc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13)).\nThus, we have said that a requirement prescribed as a\ncondition to obtaining judicial review of agency action\nis quite different (nonjurisdictional) from a requirement\nprescribed as a condition to appeal from one court to an-\nother (jurisdictional). See Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ \u2013\n___ (slip op., at 7\u20138). We have always\u2014always, without\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWorld of the Court\u2019s making, in which it is certain that an issuing\njudge\u2019s failure to identify any issue justifying a COA will not have\njurisdictional consequences, is yet unexplored.\n6                           GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                             SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nexception\u2014held that procedural conditions for appealing a\ncase from one Article III court to another are jurisdic-\ntional. When an appeal is \u201cnot taken within the time\nprescribed by law,\u201d the \u201cCourt of Appeals [is] without juris-\ndiction.\u201d George v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 293 U. S.\n377, 379 (1934) (per curiam); see also United States v.\nRobinson, 361 U. S. 220, 229\u2013230 (1960). When a party\u2019s\nname is not listed in the notice of appeal, as the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure require, the court has no\njurisdiction over that party\u2019s appeal. Torres v. Oakland\nScavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 314\u2013315 (1988).\n   When this Court reviewed cases by writ of error, the law\nre quired that the lower-court record be filed with the\nCourt \u201cbefore the end of the term next succeeding the\nissue of the writ.\u201d Edmonson v. Bloomshire, 7 Wall. 306,\n309 (1869). The Court routinely dismissed cases that did\nnot comply with that requirement. See, e.g., Mesa v.\nUnited States, 2 Black 721, 721\u2013722 (1863) (per curiam);\nEdmonson, supra, at 309\u2013310; Steamer Virginia v. West,\n19 How. 182, 183 (1857). The same jurisdictional treat-\nment was accorded to failure to serve notice on the de-\nfendant in error within the succeeding term, see, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

Section 518(a) of\nTitle 28 charges the Solicitor General with \u201cconduct[ing]\nand argu[ing] suits and appeals in the Supreme Court . . .\nin which the United States is interested.\u201d We held that,\nabsent independent statutory authority, an agency\u2019s peti-\ntion for certiorari filed without authorization from the\nSolicitor General does not suffice to invoke our jurisdic-\ntion. NRA Political Victory Fund, supra, at 98\u201399.3\n   Jurisdictional enforcement of procedural requirements\nfor appeal has deep roots in our jurisprudence. Chief\nJustice Taney dismissed an appeal in which the citation\nwas not issued and served in time, because \u201cwe have no\npower to receive an appeal in any other mode than that\nprovided by law.\u201d Villabolos, supra, at 90. And Chief\nJustice Chase wrote, in a case dismissing an appeal for\nfailure to file in time:\n     \u201cIn the Judiciary Act of 1789, and in many acts since,\n     Congress has provided for [appellate courts\u2019] exercise\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncases are \u201cnot enacted by Congress but [are] promulgated by this Court\nunder authority of Congress to prescribe rules,\u201d we have held that they\nmay \u201cbe relaxed by the Court in the exercise of its discretion when the\nends of justice so require.\u201d Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 64\n(1970). The indication requirement of \u00a72253(c)(3), of course, has been\n\u201cimposed by the legislature and not by the judicial process.\u201d Schiavone\nv. Fortune, 477 U. S. 21, 31 (1986).\n   3 The Court cites Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757 (2001), as a\n\ncounter-example. Ante, at 9, n. 6. We held there that an appellant\u2019s\nfailure to sign his notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(a),\nwithin the time prescribed for filing a notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule\nApp. Proc. 4(a)(1), did not require dismissal where the notice itself was\ntimely filed. 532 U. S., at 762\u2013763. We did not hold, however, that the\nsigning requirement was nonjurisdictional; we had no occasion to do so.\nWe held that Becker had complied with Civil Rule 11(a) because the\nerror was \u201c \u2018corrected promptly after being called to [his] attention,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 764 (quoting Fed.

The court has\n    always regarded appeals in other cases as excepted\n    from the grant of appellate power, and has always felt\n    itself bound to give effect to the regulations by which\n    Congress has prescribed the manner of its exercise.\u201d\n    Castro v. United States, 3 Wall. 46, 49 (1866).\nJurisdictional Nature of Predecessor Provision\n   But similarity to a general type of provision that has\nalways been held jurisdictional is not all that supports the\njurisdictional character of \u00a72253(c)(3). Its very predeces-\nsor statute made a judge\u2019s expression of opinion a condi-\ntion of appellate jurisdiction. The certificate of probable\ncause, of which the COA was born, arrived on the scene\nover 100 years ago in \u201cAn Act Restricting in certain cases\nthe right of appeal to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus\nproceedings,\u201d Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40:\n    \u201c[F]rom a final decision by a court of the United\n    States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the de-\n    tention complained of is by virtue of process issued\n    out of a State court no appeal to the Supreme Court\n    shall be allowed unless the United States court by\n    which the final decision was rendered or a justice of\n    the Supreme Court shall be of opinion that there ex-\n    ists probable cause for an appeal, in which event, on\n    allowing the same, the said court or justice shall cer-\n    tify that there is probable cause for such allowance.\u201d\nThe last version of this statute, before it was amended to\nits current form in AEDPA, provided for issuance of the\ncertificate of probable cause by a circuit judge instead of a\njustice. See \u00a72253, 62 Stat. 967 (codified at 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72253). Even applying the Court\u2019s simplistic rule that the\njurisdictional restriction must be contained in the very\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame paragraph as the procedural requirement, there is\nno doubt that under this statute a judge\u2019s certification that\nthere was probable cause for an appeal was jurisdictional.\nSee, e.g., Ex parte Patrick, 212 U. S. 555 (1908) (per cu-\nriam); Bilik v. Strassheim, 212 U. S. 551 (1908) (per cu-\nriam). There is no reason whatever to think that Congress\nrendered the statement of opinion unnecessary for juris-\ndiction by (1) extending the requirement for it to \u00a72255\nproceedings; (2) requiring the opinion to address a more\nspecific point (not just probable cause for an appeal but\npresence of an issue presenting a \u201csubstantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right\u201d)4; and (3) giving the\ndocument in which the judge is required to express the\nopinion a name (\u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d)\u2014so that\nnow a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d without opinion will\nsuffice. Neither any one of these steps, nor all of them\ncombined, suggest elimination of jurisdictional status for\nthe required expression of opinion.5 It would be an en-\ntirely strange way of achieving that result. It was not a\nstrange way, however, of dividing the now more complex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court believes that the fact that this \u201cnew requirement . . . has\nno predecessor provision\u201d suggests that it is nonjurisdictional. Ante, at\n6, n. 3. To begin with, it is not that new, and it has a predecessor\nprovision; it merely adds detail to the jurisdictional opinion that was\npreviously required. But even if the requirement were entirely unprec-\nedented, when it appears within a textual structure that makes it\njurisdictional (as our opinion in Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487\nU. S. 312 (1988), held, see infra, at 10\u201312), it would be an entirely\nunprecedented jurisdictional provision.\n  5 The Court\u2019s opinion suggests that \u201c[i]t would seem somewhat coun-\n\nterintuitive to render a panel of court of appeals judges powerless to act\non appeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empowered one\ncourt of appeals judge to grant.\u201d Ante, at 8. To begin with, we do not\nthink that an anomaly. It makes entire sense to enable a single circuit\njudge to nip improper appeals in the bud, sparing parties the trouble of\nan appeal, and courts the expenditure of three times as much judicial\nenergy. But if it were an anomaly, it would be one that existed as well\nunder the prior statute, which was held to be jurisdictional.\n10                 GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand lengthy provision into manageable subsections.\nStare Decisis Effect of Torres\n  In addition to the fact that conditions attached to court-\nto-court appeal have always been held jurisdictional, and\nthe fact that this statute\u2019s predecessor was held to be so,\nwe have considered, and found to be jurisdictional, a stat-\nute presenting precisely what is at issue here: a provision\ngoverning court-to-court appeals which made particular\ncontent a required element of a document that the statute\nsaid was necessary for jurisdiction; and which did that in a\nseparate section that \u201cexcluded the jurisdictional terms,\u201d\nante, at 10. That case flatly contradicts today\u2019s holding.\nIn Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, we\ndealt with Rule 3(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. Rule 3(a) of those Rules makes a notice of\nappeal necessary to appellate jurisdiction\u2014just as\n\u00a72253(c)(1) makes a certificate of appealability necessary.\nAnd Rule 3(c)(1), which, like \u00a72253(c)(3), does not contain\njurisdictional language, says what the requisite notice of\nappeal must contain\u2014just as \u00a72253(c)(3) says what the\nrequisite certificate of appealability must contain:\n     \u201cThe notice of appeal must:\n        \u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\n     by naming each one in the caption or body of the no-\n     tice . . . ;\n        \u201c(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof\n     being appealed; and\n        \u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d\nIn Torres we held that the Court of Appeals lacked juris-\ndiction over the appeal of a party not properly named in\nthe notice of appeal. 487 U. S., at 314\u2013315. The parallel\nis perfect.\n   The Court claims that the jurisdictional consequences of\nRule 3(c) were \u201c \u2018imposed by the legislature,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 12\n                       Cite as: 565 U.

S., at 515), that Rule 3(c) is jurisdictional.\nBut the legislature there did precisely what it did here:\nmade a particular document necessary to jurisdiction and\nthen specified what that document must contain.6 I cer-\ntainly agree that that is a clear statement that a docu-\nment with the requisite content is necessary to jurisdic-\ntion. But the Court does not. So to distinguish Torres it\nhas to find something else in Rule 3(c) that provided a\n\u201cclear statement\u201d of what \u201cCongress intended,\u201d ante, at 6\u2013\n7. The best it can come up with, ante, at 12, is an unclear\nstatement, and that not from Congress but from Advisory\nCommittee Notes referred to in the Torres opinion. Such\nNotes are (of course) \u201cthe product of the Advisory Commit-\ntee, and not Congress,\u201d and \u201cthey are transmitted to Con-\ngress before the rule is enacted into law.\u201d United States v.\nVonn, 535 U. S. 55, 64, n. 6 (2002). They are, in other\nwords, a species of legislative history. I know of no prece-\ndent for the proposition that legislative history can satisfy\na clear-statement requirement imposed by this Court\u2019s\nopinions. Does today\u2019s distinguishing of Torres mean that\nlegislative history can waive the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States? See United States v. Nordic Village,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 The Court\u2019s claim that \u201cTorres involved . . . a different textual, con-\n\ntextual, and historical backdrop,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 8, does not withstand\nscrutiny. First, consider the \u201ctextual backdrop.\u201d The Court cannot\nreally believe that Rule 3(c)(1)\u2019s statement that a notice of appeal \u201cmust\n. . . specify\u201d the appealing party is \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 jurisdictional language,\u201d ante,\nat 7, while \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s \u201cshall indicate\u201d the issue or issues is not. If it\ndid, it would say as much, since that would readily distinguish Torres.\nAnd then consider the \u201ccontextual\u201d (whatever that means) and \u201chistor-\nical backdrop.\u201d Each provision, in mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional\nlanguage, specifies what another document, itself jurisdictional in light\nof statutory text and history, must contain. The two cases are, of\ncourse, literally \u201cdifferent,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 8, but not in any legally\nrelevant way.\n12                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nInc., 503 U. S. 30, 33\u201334 (1992). Or abrogate the sover-\neign immunity of the States? See Atascadero State Hos-\npital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985). Or give retro-\nactive effect to new legislation? See Greene v. United\nStates, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964). Or foreclose review of\nagency actions? See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387\nU. S. 136, 141 (1967). Today\u2019s opinion is in this respect a\ntime-bomb.\n  To make matters worse, the Advisory Committee Note\nconsidered by the Torres Court\u2014as \u201csupport for [its]\nview,\u201d 487 U. S., at 315\u2014did not clearly say that Rule\n3(c)\u2019s requirements were jurisdictional. It said this:\n        \u201c \u2018Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice\n     of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court\n     within the time prescribed for taking an appeal. Be-\n     cause the timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u201cmanda-\n     tory and jurisdictional,\u201d United States v. Robinson,\n     361 U. S. 220, 224 (1960), compliance with the provi-\n     sions of those rules is of the utmost importance.\u2019 \u201d 487\n     U. S., at 315 (quoting 28 U. S. C. App., p. 467; altera-\n     tion omitted and emphasis added).\nTo say that timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdic-\ntional, and that placing within the notice of appeal what\nRule 3 says it must contain is \u201cof the utmost importance,\u201d\ndoes not remotely add up to a clear statement that placing\nwithin the notice of appeal what Rule 3 says it must con-\ntain is jurisdictional. There is simply no principled basis\nfor saying that Torres satisfies the \u201cclear-statement prin-\nciple,\u201d ante, at 6, except the commonsense notion that\nwhen a document is made jurisdictional, and the required\ncontents of that document specified, a document that does\nnot contain those contents cannot confer jurisdiction.7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court also tries to distinguish Torres on the ground that failure\n\nto comply with Rule 3 presented a different \u201cpossibility of gamesman-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court is not willing to say that Torres is no longer\ngood law, but I doubt whether future litigants will be so\ncoy. They know that in the past, to avoid the uncongenial\nrigidity of the rule that procedures attending court-to-\ncourt appeals are jurisdictional, we have performed won-\ndrous contortions to find compliance with those rules. For\nexample, in Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992), we\nheld that an \u201cinformal brief\u201d filed after a defective notice\nof appeal counted as a valid notice of appeal. In Foman v.\nDavis, 371 U. S. 178, 181 (1962), we held that a notice of\nappeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment\nwas also a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment.\nAnd in Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 270 (1988), we held\nthat a prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201cfiled\u201d when it was\ndelivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the dis-\ntrict court. These (shall we say) creative interpretations of\nthe procedural requirements were made necessary by the\nbackground principle that is centuries old: \u201c[I]f the mode\nprescribed for removing cases by writ of error or appeal\nbe too strict and technical, and likely to produce inconven-\nience or injustice, it is for Congress to provide a remedy\nby altering the existing laws; not for the court.\u201d United\nStates v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 113 (1848). But if we have\nbeen willing to expose ourselves to ridicule in order to\napprove implausible compliance with procedural prerequi-\nsites to appeal, surely we may be willing to continue and\nexpand the process of simply converting those obnoxious\nprerequisites into the now favored \u201cclaims processing\nrules,\u201d enabling us to avoid unseemly contortions by simp-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nship,\u201d ante, at 13, from that presented here. I fail to see the relevance\nof that happenstance. The premise of the Court\u2019s opinion is that the\nquestion of jurisdiction vel non is governed by a \u201cclear-statement\nprinciple,\u201d ante, at 6. The statement here is precisely as clear as the\nstatement in Torres. Do we enforce clear statements only when there is\na \u201cpossibility of gamesmanship\u201d? The Court\u2019s free-wheeling purposiv-\nism defies textual analysis.\n14                   GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nly invoking the ever-judge-friendly principles of equity.\n   What began as an effort to \u201c \u2018bring some discipline\u2019 to the\nuse of the term \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 5 (quoting Hen-\nderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5)), shows signs of\nbecoming a libertine, liberating romp through our estab-\nlished jurisprudence.\n                                II\n   A few remaining points raised by the Court\u2019s opinion\nwarrant response.\n   The Court holds that the requirement imposed by para-\ngraph (c)(2) (that a COA may issue \u201conly if the applicant has\nmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitution-\nal right\u201d) is not jurisdictional, and says that \u201c[i]t follows\nthat \u00a72253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nI need not reach the issue whether (c)(2) is jurisdictional\u2014\nthough it seems to me that the Court disposes rather\nsummarily of the Solicitor General\u2019s view that it is. And I\nneed not confront the Court with the back-at-you argu-\nment that if (c)(3) is jurisdictional (as I think) then (c)(2) is\nas well. For whether one runs it backwards or forwards,\nthe argument is a bad one. Assuming that (c)(2) is nonju-\nrisdictional, it does not at all \u201cfollow\u201d that (c)(3) is nonju-\nrisdictional as well. Paragraph (c)(3) is jurisdictional not\nbecause it is located in subsection (c), but because it de-\nscribes the required content of a COA. Paragraph (c)(2)\ndoes not; it sets forth the criterion for a COA\u2019s issuance. A\njudge may apply that criterion erroneously but still pro-\nduce a COA that (as paragraph (c)(3) requires) \u201cindicate[s]\nwhich specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required\nby paragraph (2).\u201d It no more follows that the erroneous-\nness of the judge\u2019s indication must destroy the jurisdiction\nthat the COA creates, than it followed under the predeces-\nsor statute that the erroneousness of the certification of\nprobable cause for an appeal destroyed the jurisdiction\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat the certification created.8 The two issues are quite\nseparate: what the judge must find, and what the COA (or\ncertification) must contain.\n  The Court points out that Gonzalez raised the Sixth\nAmendment issue in his application for a COA, that \u201c[a]\npetitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no\ncontrol over how the judge drafts the COA,\u201d and that the\npetitioner, \u201cas in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done every-\nthing required of him by law.\u201d Ante, at 8. Perhaps it is\ntrue that the defective COA was not at all Gonzalez\u2019s\nfault\u2014though he could have promptly moved to amend it.\nBut no-fault elimination of jurisdiction is not forbidden.\nIn Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we enforced a\ntime limit on notice of appeal where the district court had\npurported to extend the time to file and the appellant had\ncomplied with the court\u2019s order. Id., at 207, 213\u2013214. It\ndid not matter that the fault lay with the court.\n  Finally, the Court points out that treating \u00a72253(c)(3) as\njurisdictional would waste a lot of time. \u201cEven if addition-\nal screening of already-issued COAs for \u00a72253(c)(3) defects\ncould further winnow the cases before the courts of ap-\npeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay\nfrom the extra layer of review.\u201d Ante, at 9. But that is not\nan argument directed to the statute before us; it is an\nargument directed against enforcement of all jurisdiction-\nal requirements (all of which, I suspect, are the object of\nthe Court\u2019s mounting disfavor). And the argument may\nnot even be true, except in the (presumably rare) case\nwhere the jurisdictional prescription is disregarded. Over\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We held in Nowakowski v. Maroney, 386 U. S. 542, 543 (1967) (per\n\ncuriam), that \u201cwhen a district judge grants [a certificate of probable\ncause], the court of appeals must grant an appeal . . . and proceed to a\ndisposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.\u201d See\nalso Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 242 (1968) (Nowakowski\nrequires \u201cthat the appeal [be] considered on its merits . . . in cases\nwhere a certificate of probable cause has been granted\u201d).\n16                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe long term, the time saved to judges and lawyers by an\nenforceable requirement that appeals be screened by a\nsingle judge may vastly outweigh the time wasted by the\noccasional need for enforcement. That, it seems to me, is\nwhat Congress believed.\n                          *    *    *\n   Terminology is destiny. Today\u2019s holding, and the ero-\nsion of our prior jurisprudence that will perhaps follow\nupon it, is foreshadowed and facilitated by the unfortunate\nterminology with which we have chosen to accompany our\ncampaign to \u201cbring some discipline\u201d to determinations of\njurisdiction. We have said that the universe of rules\nplacing limitations upon the courts is divided into (1)\n\u201cclaims processing rules,\u201d and (2) jurisdiction-removing\nrules. Unless our prior jurisprudence is to be repudiated,\nthat is a false dichotomy. The requirement that the un-\nsuccessful litigant file a timely notice of appeal, for exam-\nple, is (if the term is to have any meaning) a claims-\nprocessing rule, ordering the process by which claims are\nadjudicated. Yet as discussed above, that, and all proce-\ndures that must be followed to proceed from one court to\nanother, have always been deemed jurisdictional. The\nproper dichotomy is between claims processing rules that\nare jurisdictional, and those that are not. To put it other-\nwise suggests a test for jurisdiction that is not to be found\nin our cases.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 It may well be that what I have called a false dichotomy was indeed\n\nmeant to revise our jurisprudence. In Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.

Argued November 2, 2011\u2014Decided January 10, 2012\nAfter the intermediate state appellate court affirmed his state-court\n  conviction, petitioner Gonzalez allowed his time for seeking discre-\n  tionary review with the State\u2019s highest court for criminal appeals to\n  expire. Roughly six weeks later, the intermediate state appellate\n  court issued its mandate. When Gonzalez subsequently sought fed-\n  eral habeas relief, the District Court dismissed Gonzalez\u2019s petition as\n  time barred by the 1-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism\n  and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Under 28 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), state prisoners have one year to file federal habeas\n  petitions running from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final\n  by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\n  seeking such review.\u201d The District Court held that Gonzalez\u2019s judg-\n  ment had become \u201cfinal\u201d when his time for seeking discretionary re-\n  view in the State\u2019s highest court expired, and that running the limi-\n  tations period from that date, his petition was untimely.\n     Under AEDPA, a habeas petitioner must obtain a certificate of ap-\n  pealability (COA) to appeal a district court\u2019s final order in a habeas\n  proceeding. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c)(1). The COA may issue only if the\n  petitioner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a consti-\n  tutional right,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2), and \u201cshall indicate which specific issue\u201d\n  satisfies that showing, \u00a72253(c)(3). A Fifth Circuit judge granted\n  Gonzalez a COA on the question whether his petition was timely.\n  The issued COA, however, failed to \u201cindicate\u201d a constitutional issue.\n     The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Gonzalez\u2019s petition was\n  untimely because the limitations period begins to run for petitioners\n  who fail to appeal to a State\u2019s highest court when the time for seeking\n2                        GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    further direct review in the state court expires. The Fifth Circuit did\n    not mention, and the State did not raise, the \u00a72253(c)(3) defect.\n    When Gonzalez petitioned this Court for review, the State argued for\n    the first time that the Fifth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate\n    Gonzalez\u2019s appeal based on the \u00a72253(c)(3) defect.\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule. A\n COA\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d a constitutional issue does not deprive a\n Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal. Pp. 4\u221213.\n       (a) A rule is jurisdictional \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states that\n a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdiction-\n al,\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515. Here, the only clear\n jurisdictional language in \u00a72253(c) appears in \u00a72253(c)(1). The par-\n ties agree that \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s plain terms make the issuance of a COA\n a jurisdictional prerequisite. The parties also agree that \u00a72253(c)(2),\n which speaks only to when a COA may issue and does not contain\n \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s jurisdictional terms, is nonjurisdictional. It follows that\n \u00a72253(c)(3) is also nonjurisdictional. Like \u00a72253(c)(2), it reflects a\n threshold condition for issuing a COA, and \u201cdoes not speak in juris-\n dictional terms or refer . . . to the jurisdiction of the [appeals] courts.\u201d\n Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515. Jurisdictional treatment also would\n thwart Congress\u2019s intent in AEDPA \u201cto eliminate delays in the feder-\n al habeas review process.\u201d Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___.\n Once a judge has determined that a COA is warranted and resources\n are deployed in briefing and argument, the COA has fulfilled its\n gatekeeping function. Pp. 4\u22129.\n       (b) The State\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Section\n 2253(c)(3)\u2019s cross-reference to \u00a72253(c)(1) does not mean \u00a72253(c)(3)\n can be read as part of \u00a72253(c)(1), as Congress set off the require-\n ments in distinct paragraphs with distinct terms. The word \u201cshall\u201d in\n \u00a72253(c)(3), meanwhile, underscores the rule\u2019s mandatory nature, but\n not all mandatory rules are jurisdictional. Nor does \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\n mere proximity to other jurisdictional provisions turn a rule that\n speaks in nonjurisdictional terms into a jurisdictional hurdle. Final-\n ly, the Court rejects the State\u2019s attempt to analogize a COA to a no-\n tice of appeal. Pp. 10\u221213.\n    2. For a state prisoner who does not seek review in a State\u2019s high-\n est court, the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\n on the date that the time for seeking such review expires. Pp. 13\u221219.\n       (a) In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, the Court held that a\n federal conviction becomes final \u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction\n on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certio-\n rari,\u201d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari, \u201cwhen the time for fil-\n ing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d Id., at 527.

S. 113, the Court adopted Clay\u2019s \u201cmost natural reading\n  of the statutory text\u201d in construing \u201cthe similar language of\n  \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\u201d Id., at 119. The Court made no mention of when\n  Jimenez\u2019s appeal concluded and held that his judgment became final\n  when his time for seeking certiorari expired. Section 2244(d)(1)(A)\n  thus consists of two prongs corresponding to two categories of peti-\n  tioners. For petitioners pursuing direct review all the way to this\n  Court, the judgment becomes final at the \u201cconclusion of direct re-\n  view,\u201d when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies\n  certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at\n  the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such review,\u201d when the time\n  for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.\n  Because Gonzalez did not appeal to the State\u2019s highest court, his\n  judgment became final when his time for seeking review with that\n  court expired. Pp. 13\u201315.\n       (b) Gonzalez argues that courts should determine both prongs for\n  every petitioner who does not seek certiorari, then start the 1-year\n  clock from the latest of the two dates. Gonzalez further contends that\n  when a petitioner does not seek certiorari, state law should define the\n  \u201cconclusion of direct review.\u201d The words \u201clatest of,\u201d however, appear\n  in \u00a72244(d)(1), not \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Nothing in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) contem-\n  plates any conflict between the two prongs or instructs that the later\n  of the two shall prevail. Gonzalez\u2019s approach of scouring each State\u2019s\n  laws and cases to determine how the State defines finality, moreover,\n  would contradict the uniform meaning of \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d\n  that Clay and Jimenez accepted. It will be a rare situation in which a\n  delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance is so severe as to prevent a petitioner\n  from filing a federal habeas petition within a year or requesting a\n  stay and abeyance. Finally, the Court rejects Gonzalez\u2019s alternative\n  argument that his petition is timely because it was filed within a\n  year of when his time for seeking certiorari review expired.

The\nfirst, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72253(c), provides that a habeas peti-\ntioner must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to\nappeal a federal district court\u2019s final order in a habeas\nproceeding. \u00a72253(c)(1). The COA may issue only if the\npetitioner has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of\na constitutional right,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2), and \u201cshall indicate\nwhich specific issue\u201d satisfies that showing. \u00a72253(c)(3).\nWe hold that \u00a72253(c)(3) is not a jurisdictional require-\nment. Accordingly, a judge\u2019s failure to \u201cindicate\u201d the\nrequisite constitutional issue in a COA does not deprive a\ncourt of appeals of subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudi-\ncate the habeas petitioner\u2019s appeal.\n   The second provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), estab-\nlishes a 1-year limitations period for state prisoners to file\nfederal habeas petitions, running from \u201cthe date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\n2                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re-\nview.\u201d We hold that, for a state prisoner who does not\nseek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judgment be-\ncomes \u201cfinal\u201d on the date that the time for seeking such\nreview expires.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in\nTexas state court. The intermediate state appellate court,\nthe Texas Court of Appeals, affirmed Gonzalez\u2019s conviction\non July 12, 2006. Gonzalez then allowed his time for\nseeking discretionary review with the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals (Texas CCA)\u2014the State\u2019s highest court\nfor criminal appeals\u2014to expire on August 11, 2006. Tex.\nRule App. Proc. 68.2(a) (2011). The Texas Court of Ap-\npeals issued its mandate on September 26, 2006.\n   After Gonzalez, proceeding pro se, petitioned unsuccess-\nfully for state habeas relief, he filed a federal habeas\npetition under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254 on January 24, 2008, in\nthe U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\nHis petition alleged, inter alia, that the nearly 10-year\ndelay between his indictment and trial violated his Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial. The District Court,\nwithout discussing Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional claims, dis-\nmissed Gonzalez\u2019s petition as time barred by the 1-year\nstatute of limitations in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Although Gonza-\nlez argued that his judgment had not become final until\nthe Texas Court of Appeals issued its mandate, the Dis-\ntrict Court held that Gonzalez\u2019s judgment had become\nfinal when his time for seeking discretionary review in the\nTexas CCA expired on August 11, 2006. Counting from\nthat date, and tolling the limitations period for the time\nduring which Gonzalez\u2019s state habeas petition was pend-\ning, Gonzalez\u2019s limitations period elapsed on December 17,\n2007\u2014over a month before he filed his federal habeas\npetition. The District Court denied a COA.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Gonzalez applied to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit for a COA on two grounds: (1) his habeas\npetition was timely, and (2) his Sixth Amendment speedy-\ntrial right was violated. A Court of Appeals judge granted\na COA on the question \u201cwhether the habeas application\nwas timely filed because Gonzalez\u2019s conviction became\nfinal, and thus the limitations period commenced, on the\ndate the intermediate state appellate court issued its\nmandate.\u201d App. 347. The COA did not mention the Sixth\nAmendment question.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 623 F. 3d 222 (2010).\nAcknowledging that a sister Circuit had run the limita-\ntions period from the date of a state court\u2019s issuance of a\nmandate, the Court of Appeals deemed the mandate\u2019s\nissuance \u201cirrelevant\u201d to determining finality under\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Id., at 224, 226 (disagreeing with Riddle v.\nKemna, 523 F. 3d 850 (CA8 2008) (en banc)). The Court of\nAppeals held that because a judgment becomes final at\n\u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the\ntime for seeking such review,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), the limita-\ntions period begins to run for petitioners who fail to appeal\nto a State\u2019s highest court when the time for seeking fur-\nther direct review in the state court expires. The Court of\nAppeals therefore concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s conviction\nbecame final on August 11, 2006, and his habeas petition\nwas time barred.\n   The Court of Appeals did not address Gonzalez\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment claim or discuss whether the COA had been\nimproperly issued. Nor did the State allege any defect in\nthe COA or move to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Gonzalez petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.\nIn its brief in opposition, the State argued for the first\ntime that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to adju-\ndicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal because the COA identified only\na procedural issue, without also \u201cindicat[ing]\u201d a constitu-\ntional issue as required by \u00a72253(c)(3). We granted certio-\n4                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrari to decide two questions, both of which implicate splits\nin authority: (1) whether the Court of Appeals had juris-\ndiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal, notwithstanding\nthe \u00a72253(c)(3) defect;1 and (2) whether Gonzalez\u2019s habeas\npetition was time barred under \u00a72244(d)(1) due to the\ndate on which his judgment became final.2 564 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                             II\n  We first consider whether the Court of Appeals had juris-\ndiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.\n                               A\n  Section 2253, as amended by AEDPA, governs appeals\nin habeas corpus proceedings.         The first subsection,\n\u00a72253(a), is a general grant of jurisdiction, providing that\ndistrict courts\u2019 final orders in habeas proceedings \u201cshall be\nsubject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72253(a). The second, \u00a72253(b), limits jurisdiction\nover a particular type of final order. See \u00a72253(b) (\u201cThere\nshall be no right of appeal from a final order in a proceed-\ning to test the validity of a warrant [of] remov[al] . . .\u201d).\nThis case concerns the third, \u00a72253(c), which provides:\n       \u201c(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-\n     cate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Circuits have divided over whether a defect in a COA is a juris-\n\ndictional bar. Compare, e.g., Phelps v. Alameda, 366 F. 3d 722, 726\n(CA9 2004) (no); Porterfield v. Bell, 258 F. 3d 484, 485 (CA6 2001) (no);\nYoung v.

Cepero, 224 F. 3d 256, 259\u2013262 (CA3 2000) (en banc)\n(yes).\n  2 The Circuits have divided over when a judgment becomes final if a\n\npetitioner forgoes review in a State\u2019s highest court. Compare, e.g., 623\nF. 3d 222, 226 (CA5 2010) (case below) (date when time for seeking\nsuch review expires); Hemmerle v. Schriro, 495 F. 3d 1069, 1073\u20131074\n(CA9 2007) (same), with Riddle v.

McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals judge granted a COA\nthat identified a debatable procedural ruling, but did not\n\u201cindicate\u201d the issue on which Gonzalez had made a sub-\nstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as\nrequired by \u00a72253(c)(3). The question before us is whether\nthat defect deprived the Court of Appeals of the power to\nadjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal. We hold that it did not.\n  This Court has endeavored in recent years to \u201cbring\nsome discipline\u201d to the use of the term \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\nHenderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.

Recognizing our \u201cless than meticulous\u201d use of the\nterm in the past, we have pressed a stricter distinction\nbetween truly jurisdictional rules, which govern \u201ca court\u2019s\nadjudicatory authority,\u201d and nonjurisdictional \u201cclaim-\nprocessing rules,\u201d which do not. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540\nU. S. 443, 454\u2013455 (2004). When a requirement goes to\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consid-\ner sua sponte issues that the parties have disclaimed or\nhave not presented. See United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S.\n625, 630 (2002). Subject-matter jurisdiction can never be\n6                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwaived or forfeited. The objections may be resurrected at\nany point in the litigation, and a valid objection may lead\na court midway through briefing to dismiss a complaint in\nits entirety. \u201c[M]any months of work on the part of the\nattorneys and the court may be wasted.\u201d Henderson, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). Courts, we have said, should\nnot lightly attach those \u201cdrastic\u201d consequences to limits\nCongress has enacted. Ibid.\n   We accordingly have applied the following principle: A\nrule is jurisdictional \u201c[i]f the Legislature clearly states\nthat a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count\nas jurisdictional.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n515 (2006). But if \u201cCongress does not rank a statutory\nlimitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should\ntreat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.\u201d Id., at 516.3\nThat clear-statement principle makes particular sense in\nthis statute, as we consider\u2014against the backdrop of\n\u00a72253(a)\u2019s clear jurisdictional grant to the courts of ap-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Wehave also held that \u201ccontext, including this Court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of similar provisions in many years past, is relevant to whether a\nstatute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.\u201d Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\nMuchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13). Here, however,\neven though the requirement of a COA (or its predecessor, the certifi-\ncate of probable cause (CPC)) dates back to 1908, Congress did not\nenact the indication requirement until 1996. There is thus no \u201clong line\nof this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress\u201d on which to rely.\nUnion Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen.\nComm. of Adjustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 13).\n   The issuance of a CPC, like the issuance of a COA, was jurisdictional.\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, post, at 8\u201310 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), that fact does not suggest that the indication requirement is juris-\ndictional as well. If anything, the inference runs the other way. For\nnearly a century, a judge\u2019s granting or withholding of a CPC, absent\nany indication of issues, was the fully effective \u201cexpression of opinion,\u201d\npost, at 8, required for an appeal to proceed. AEDPA\u2019s new require-\nment that judges indicate the specific issues to be raised on appeal has\nno predecessor provision\u2014indeed, it is the primary difference between\na CPC and COA.\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

As we explained in Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003), \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s plain terms\u2014\n\u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of\nappealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of\nappeals\u201d\u2014establish that \u201cuntil a COA has been issued\nfederal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the\nmerits of appeals from habeas petitioners.\u201d Id., at 336.\nThe parties thus agree that \u00a72253(c)(1) is jurisdictional.\n   The parties also agree that \u00a72253(c)(2) is nonjurisdic-\ntional.4 That is for good reason. Section 2253(c)(2) speaks\nonly to when a COA may issue\u2014upon \u201ca substantial show-\ning of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d It does not\ncontain \u00a72253(c)(1)\u2019s jurisdictional terms. See Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (\u201c[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally . . .\u201d). And it\nwould be passing strange if, after a COA has issued, each\ncourt of appeals adjudicating an appeal were dutybound to\nrevisit the threshold showing and gauge its \u201csubstan-\ntial[ity]\u201d to verify its jurisdiction. That inquiry would be\nlargely duplicative of the merits question before the court.\n   It follows that \u00a72253(c)(3) is nonjurisdictional as well.\nLike \u00a72253(c)(2), it too reflects a threshold condition for\nthe issuance of a COA\u2014the COA\u2019s indication of \u201cwhich\nspecific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by\nparagraph (2).\u201d It too \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional\nterms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [ap-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The United States as amicus curiae contends that \u00a72253(c)(2) is\n\njurisdictional, but the State concedes that it is not. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\n8                        GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npeals] courts.\u201d Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). The unambiguous jurisdictional\nterms of \u00a7\u00a72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) show that Congress\nwould have spoken in clearer terms if it intended\n\u00a72253(c)(3) to have similar jurisdictional force. Instead,\nthe contrast underscores that the failure to obtain a COA\nis jurisdictional, while a COA\u2019s failure to indicate an issue\nis not. A defective COA is not equivalent to the lack of any\nCOA.\n   It is telling, moreover, that Congress placed the power\nto issue COAs in the hands of a \u201ccircuit justice or judge.\u201d5\nIt would seem somewhat counterintuitive to render a\npanel of court of appeals judges powerless to act on ap-\npeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empow-\nered one court of appeals judge to grant. Indeed, whereas\n\u00a72253(c)(2)\u2019s substantial-showing requirement at least de-\nscribes a burden that \u201cthe applicant\u201d seeking a COA\nbears, \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s indication requirement binds only the\njudge issuing the COA. Notably, Gonzalez advanced both\nthe timeliness and Sixth Amendment issues in his appli-\ncation for a COA. A petitioner, having successfully ob-\ntained a COA, has no control over how the judge drafts the\nCOA and, as in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done everything\nrequired of him by law. That fact would only compound\nthe \u201cunfai[r] prejudice\u201d resulting from the sua sponte\ndismissals and remands that jurisdictional treatment\nwould entail. Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The courts of appeals uniformly interpret \u201ccircuit justice or judge\u201d to\n\nencompass district judges.

Rule App. Proc. 22(b).\nHabeas Corpus Rule 11(a) requires district judges to decide whether to\ngrant or deny a COA in the first instance.\n    6 That fact also distinguishes the indication requirement from every\n\n\u201c \u2018similar provisio[n]\u2019 \u201d that the dissent claims we have deemed jurisdic-\ntional.

Florida, 560\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16). The COA process\nscreens out issues unworthy of judicial time and attention\nand ensures that frivolous claims are not assigned to\nmerits panels. Once a judge has made the determination\nthat a COA is warranted and resources are deployed in\nbriefing and argument, however, the COA has fulfilled\nthat gatekeeping function. Even if additional screening of\nalready-issued COAs for \u00a72253(c)(3) defects could further\nwinnow the cases before the courts of appeals, that would\nnot outweigh the costs of further delay from the extra\nlayer of review. This case, in which the alleged defect\nwould be dispositive, exemplifies those inefficiencies; the\nState requests that we vacate and remand with instruc-\ntions to dismiss the appeal based on a \u00a72253(c)(3) defect\nthat it raised for the first time in response to a petition for\ncertiorari. And delay would be particularly fruitless in the\nnumerous cases where, as here, the district court dis-\nmissed the petition on procedural grounds and the court of\nappeals affirms, without having to address the omitted\nconstitutional issue at all.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cprocedural conditions for appealing a case from one Article III court to\nanother.\u201d Ibid.; but see, e.g., post, at 6\u20137, n. 2 (conceding that the \u201crule\u201d\ndoes not apply to criminal appeals); Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S.\n757, 763 (2001) (failure to sign notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional\nomission). All the cases, meanwhile, involved time limits (save one\ninvolving Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1), which we address\ninfra). In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we emphasized our\n\u201ccentury\u2019s worth of precedent\u201d for treating statutory time limits on\nappeals as jurisdictional, id., at 209, n. 2, but even \u201cBowles did not hold\n. . . that all statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be con-\nsidered jurisdictional,\u201d Reed Elsevier, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). This case, in any event, involves a different type of procedural\ncondition.\n10                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The State, aided by the United States as amicus curiae,\nmakes several arguments in support of jurisdictional\ntreatment of \u00a72253(c)(3). None is persuasive.\n   First, the State notes that although \u00a72253(c)(3) does not\nspeak in jurisdictional terms, it refers back to \u00a72253(c)(1),\nwhich does. The State argues that it is as if \u00a72253(c)(1)\nprovided: \u201cUnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certifi-\ncate of appealability that shall indicate the specific issue or\nissues that satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2),\nan appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals.\u201d The\nproblem is that the statute provides no such thing. In-\nstead, Congress set off the requirements in distinct para-\ngraphs and, rather than mirroring their terms, excluded\nthe jurisdictional terms in one from the other. Notably,\nthe State concedes that \u00a72253(c)(2) is nonjurisdictional,\neven though it too cross-references \u00a72253(c)(1) and is\ncross-referenced by \u00a72253(c)(3).\n   Second, the State seizes on the word \u201cshall\u201d in\n\u00a72253(c)(3), arguing that an omitted indication renders the\nCOA no COA at all. But calling a rule nonjurisdictional\ndoes not mean that it is not mandatory or that a timely\nobjection can be ignored. If a party timely raises the\nCOA\u2019s failure to indicate a constitutional issue, the court\nof appeals panel must address the defect by considering an\namendment to the COA or remanding to the district judge\nfor specification of the issues.7 This Court, moreover, has\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent\u2019s insistence that there is \u201cno practical, real-world effect\u201d\n\nto treating this rule as mandatory, post, at 4, ignores the real world.\nCourts of appeals regularly amend COAs or remand for specification of\nissues, notwithstanding the supposed potential to \u201cembarras[s] a\ncolleague.\u201d Post, at 5; see, e.g., Saunders v. Senkowski, 587 F. 3d 543,\n545 (CA2 2009) (per curiam) (amending COA to add issue); United\nStates v. Weaver, 195 F. 3d 52, 53 (CADC 1999) (remanding for specifi-\ncation of issues). The government frequently alleges COA defects as\ngrounds for dismissal (as the State did here, at this late stage), appar-\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlong \u201crejected the notion that \u2018all mandatory prescriptions,\nhowever emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d\nHenderson, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also Dolan\nv. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)\n(statute\u2019s reference to \u201cshall\u201d alone does not render statu-\ntory deadline jurisdictional). Nothing in \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\nprescription establishes that an omitted indication should\nremain an open issue throughout the case.\n   Third, the United States argues that the placement of\n\u00a72253(c)(3) in a section containing jurisdictional provisions\nsignals that it too is jurisdictional. In characterizing\ncertain requirements as nonjurisdictional, we have on\noccasion observed their \u201c \u2018separat[ion]\u2019 \u201d from jurisdictional\nprovisions. E.g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515.\nThe converse, however, is not necessarily true: Mere prox-\nimity will not turn a rule that speaks in nonjurisdictional\nterms into a jurisdictional hurdle. In fact, \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s\nproximity to \u00a7\u00a72253(a), (b), and (c)(1) highlights the ab-\nsence of clear jurisdictional terms in \u00a72253(c)(3).\n   Finally, the State analogizes a COA to a notice of ap-\npeal, pointing out that both a notice and its contents are\njurisdictional prerequisites. Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 3(c)(1) provides that a notice of appeal must:\n\u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\u201d; \u201c(B)\ndesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being ap-\npealed\u201d; and \u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is\ntaken.\u201d We have held that \u201cRule 3\u2019s dictates are jurisdic-\ntional in nature.\u201d Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nently not sharing the dissent\u2019s concern that such efforts \u201cyield nothing\nbut additional litigation expenses.\u201d Post, at 5; see, e.g., Porterfield, 258\nF. 3d, at 485; Cepero, 224 F. 3d, at 257. Habeas petitioners, too, have\nevery incentive to request that defects be resolved, not only to defuse\npotential problems later in the litigation, but also to ensure that the\nissue on which they sought appeal is certified and will receive full\nbriefing and consideration.\n12                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   We reject this analogy. We construed the content re-\nquirements for notices of appeal as jurisdictional because\nwe were \u201cconvinced that the harshness of our construction\n[wa]s \u2018imposed by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d Torres v. Oakland\nScavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 318 (1988). Rule 4, we\nnoted, establishes mandatory time limits for filing a notice\nof appeal. Excusing a failure to name a party in a notice\nof appeal, in violation of Rule 3, would be \u201cequivalent to\npermitting courts to extend the time for filing a notice of\nappeal,\u201d in violation of Rule 4. Id., at 315. And \u201ctime\nlimits for filing a notice of appeal have been treated as\njurisdictional in American law for well over a century.\u201d\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209, n. 2 (2007). Accord-\ningly, the Advisory Committee Note \u201cmakes no distinction\namong the various requirements of Rule 3 and Rule 4,\u201d\ntreating them \u201cas a single jurisdictional threshold.\u201d\nTorres, 487 U. S., at 315; see also id., at 316 (\u201cthe Advisory\nCommittee viewed the requirements of Rule 3 as jurisdic-\ntional in nature\u201d). Here, we find no similar basis for treat-\ning the paragraphs of \u00a72253(c) as a single jurisdictional\nthreshold.\n   Moreover, in explaining why the naming requirement\nwas jurisdictional in Torres, we reasoned that an unnamed\nparty leaves the notice\u2019s \u201cintended recipient[s]\u201d\u2014the\nappellee and court\u2014\u201cunable to determine with certitude\nwhether [that party] should be bound by an adverse judg-\nment or held liable for costs or sanctions.\u201d Id., at 318.\nThe party could sit on the fence, await the outcome, and\nopt to participate only if it was favorable. That possibility\nof gamesmanship is not present here. Unlike the party\nwho fails to submit a compliant notice of appeal, the habe-\nas petitioner who obtains a COA cannot control how that\nCOA is drafted.8 And whereas a party\u2019s failure to be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent claims that we fail to give stare decisis effect to Torres.\n\nPost, at 10.

AEDPA establishes a 1-year limitations\nperiod for state prisoners to file for federal habeas relief,\nwhich \u201crun[s] from the latest of \u201d four specified dates.9\n\u00a72244(d)(1). This case concerns the first of those dates:\n\u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\nseeking such review.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). The question before\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFederal Rule featuring a different textual, contextual, and historical\nbackdrop, the dissent notably fails to grapple with\u2014indeed, its opinion\nis bereft of quotation to\u2014any supporting reasoning in that opinion.\nThat reasoning is simply not applicable here.\n  9 Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1) provides:\n\n  \u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\nState court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014\n  \u201c(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;\n  \u201c(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application creat-\ned by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such\nState action;\n  \u201c(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recog-\nnized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases\non collateral review; or\n  \u201c(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims\npresented could have been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence.\u201d\n14                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nus is when the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d if a petitioner\ndoes not appeal to a State\u2019s highest court.\n                              A\n  In construing the language of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), we do not\nwrite on a blank slate. In Clay v. United States, 537 U. S.\n522 (2003), we addressed AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations\nfor federal prisoners seeking postconviction relief. See\n\u00a72255(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (beginning 1-year period of\nlimitations from \u201cthe date on which the judgment of con-\nviction becomes final\u201d). We held that the federal judgment\nbecomes final \u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the\nmerits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari,\u201d or, if a petitioner does not seek certiorari,\n\u201cwhen the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d Id.,\nat 527. In so holding, we rejected the argument that, if a\npetitioner declines to seek certiorari, the limitations peri-\nod \u201cstarts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its\nmandate.\u201d Id., at 529.\n  In Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113 (2009), we\ndescribed Clay\u2019s interpretation as comporting \u201cwith the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text\u201d and saw \u201cno\nreason to depart\u201d from it in \u201cconstruing the similar lan-\nguage of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\u201d 555 U. S., at 119. The state\ncourt had permitted Jimenez to file an out-of-time direct\nappeal. We held that this \u201creset\u201d the limitations period;\nJimenez\u2019s judgment would now become final at \u201cthe con-\nclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking review of that [out-of-time] appeal.\u201d\nId., at 120\u2013121. Because Jimenez did not seek certiorari,\nwe made no mention of when the out-of-time appeal \u201ccon-\nclu[ded].\u201d Rather, we held that his judgment became final\nwhen his \u201ctime for seeking certiorari review in this Court\nexpired.\u201d Id., at 120. Nor did we mention the date on\nwhich the state court issued its mandate. Both Clay and\nJimenez thus suggested that the direct review process\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neither \u201cconcludes\u201d or \u201cexpires,\u201d depending on whether the\npetitioner pursues or forgoes direct appeal to this Court.\n   We now make clear what we suggested in those cases:\nThe text of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), which marks finality as of \u201cthe\nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time\nfor seeking such review,\u201d consists of two prongs. Each\nprong\u2014the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d and the \u201cexpira-\ntion of the time for seeking such review\u201d\u2014relates to a\ndistinct category of petitioners. For petitioners who pur-\nsue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment\nbecomes final at the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d\u2014when\nthis Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a\npetition for certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judg-\nment becomes final at the \u201cexpiration of the time for seek-\ning such review\u201d\u2014when the time for pursuing direct\nreview in this Court, or in state court, expires. We thus\nagree with the Court of Appeals that because Gonzalez did\nnot appeal to the State\u2019s highest court, his judgment be-\ncame final when his time for seeking review with the\nState\u2019s highest court expired.\n                               B\n   Gonzalez offers an alternative reading of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A):\nCourts should determine both the \u201cconclusion of direct\nreview\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such\nreview\u201d for every petitioner who does not seek certiorari,\nthen start the 1-year clock from the \u201clatest of \u201d the two\ndates. Gonzalez rejects our uniform definition of the\n\u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d as the date on which this\nCourt affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a peti-\ntion for certiorari. In his view, whenever a petitioner does\nnot seek certiorari, the \u201cconclusion of direct review\u201d is the\ndate on which state law marks finality\u2014in Texas, the date\non which the mandate issues. Ex parte Johnson, 12 S. W.\n3d 472, 473 (Crim. App. 2000) (per curiam). Applying this\napproach, Gonzalez contends that his habeas petition was\n16                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntimely because his direct review \u201cconcluded\u201d when the\nmandate issued (on September 26, 2006), later than the\ndate on which his time for seeking Texas CCA review\n\u201cexpired\u201d (August 11, 2006). We find his construction of\nthe statute unpersuasive.\n   First, Gonzalez lacks a textual anchor for his later-\nin-time approach. The words \u201clatest of\u201d do not appear\nanywhere in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).         Rather, they appear in\n\u00a72244(d)(1) and refer to the \u201clatest of\u201d the dates in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D)\u2014the latter three of which\nare inapplicable here. Nothing in \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) contem-\nplates any conflict between the \u201cconclusion of direct re-\nview\u201d and the \u201cexpiration of the time for seeking such\nreview,\u201d much less instructs that the later of the two shall\nprevail.\n   Nor is Gonzalez\u2019s later-in-time reading necessary to give\nboth prongs of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) full effect. Our reading does\nso by applying one \u201cor\u201d the other, depending on whether\nthe direct review process concludes or expires. Treating\nthe judgment as final on one date \u201cor\u201d the other is con-\nsistent with the disjunctive language of the provision.\n   Second, Gonzalez misreads our precedents. Gonzalez\nasserts that in Jimenez, we made a later-in-time choice\nbetween the two prongs. That is mistaken. Rather, we\nchose between two \u201cexpiration\u201d dates corresponding to\ndifferent appeals: Jimenez initially failed to appeal to the\nTexas Court of Appeals and that appeal became final\nwhen his \u201ctime for seeking discretionary review . . . ex-\npired.\u201d 555 U. S., at 117, 119. When Jimenez was later\nallowed to file an out-of-time appeal, he pursued appeals\nwith both the Texas Court of Appeals and Texas CCA; the\nout-of-time appeal thus became final when his \u201c[t]ime for\nseeking certiorari review . . . with this Court expired.\u201d Id.,\nat 116, 120. We adopted the out-of-time appeal\u2019s date of\nfinality over the initial appeal\u2019s date of finality. Id., at\n119\u2013121. Critically, by deeming the initial appeal final at\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe expiration of time for seeking review in state court,\nand the out-of-time appeal final at the expiration of time\nfor seeking certiorari in this Court, we reinforced Clay\u2019s\nsuggestion that the \u201cexpiration\u201d prong governs all peti-\ntioners who do not pursue direct review all the way to this\nCourt.10\n   Third, Gonzalez argues that AEDPA\u2019s federalism con-\ncerns and respect for state-law procedures mean that we\nshould not read \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) to disregard state law. We\nagree. That is why a state court\u2019s reopening of direct\nreview will reset the limitations period. 555 U. S., at 121.\nThat is also why, just as we determine the \u201cexpiration of\nthe time for seeking [direct] review\u201d from this Court\u2019s\nfiling deadlines when petitioners forgo certiorari, we look\nto state-court filing deadlines when petitioners forgo state-\ncourt appeals. Referring to state-law procedures in that\ncontext makes sense because such deadlines are inherent-\nly court specific. There is no risk of relying on \u201cstate-law\nrules that may differ from the general federal rule.\u201d Clay,\n537 U. S., at 531.\n   By contrast, Gonzalez urges us to scour each State\u2019s\nlaws and cases to determine how it defines finality for\nevery petitioner who forgoes a state-court appeal. That ap-\nproach would usher in state-by-state definitions of the con-\nclusion of direct review. It would be at odds with the\nuniform definition we adopted in Clay and accepted in the\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) context in Jimenez. And it would pose\nserious administrability concerns. Even if roughly \u201chalf of\nthe States define the conclusion of direct review as the\nissuance of the mandate or similar process,\u201d Brief for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 Gonzalez also argues that Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327\n\n(2007), supports his focus on the state court\u2019s issuance of the mandate\nbecause it referred to a mandate in determining when state postconvic-\ntion proceedings were no longer pending. Lawrence, however, is inap-\nposite. The case involved a different provision, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2),\nwhich by its terms refers to \u201cState\u201d procedures.\n18                     GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner 40, that still leaves half with either different\nrules or no settled rules at all.11\n  Fourth, Gonzalez speculates that our reading will rob\nsome habeas petitioners of the full 1-year limitations pe-\nriod. Gonzalez asserts that our reading starts the clock\nrunning from the date that his time for seeking Texas\nCCA review expired, even though, under Texas law, he\ncould not file for state habeas relief until six weeks later,\non the date the Texas Court of Appeals issued its man-\ndate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07, \u00a73(a)\n(Vernon Supp. 2011). His inability to initiate state habeas\nproceedings during those six weeks, he argues, reduced his\n1-year federal habeas filing period by six weeks. We\nexpect, however, that it will be a rare situation where a\npetitioner confronting similar state laws faces a delay in\nthe mandate\u2019s issuance so excessive that it prevents him\nor her from filing a federal habeas petition within a year.12\nA petitioner who has exhausted his or her claims in state\ncourt need not await state habeas proceedings to seek\nfederal habeas relief on those claims. To the extent a\npetitioner has had his or her federal filing period severely\ntruncated by a delay in the mandate\u2019s issuance and has\nunexhausted claims that must be raised on state habeas\nreview, such a petitioner could file a request for a stay and\nabeyance from the federal district court.

W. 3d 472, 473 (Texas CCA 2000) (per curiam) (judgment is final\nat \u201cissuance of the mandate\u201d).\n   12 We note that Gonzalez waited four months from the date of the\n\nmandate\u2019s issuance before filing a state habeas petition. See 623 F. 3d,\nat 223. When that petition was dismissed as improperly filed, Gonzalez\nwaited another three months before refiling. Ibid. Even then, his state\nhabeas proceedings concluded several weeks before his 1-year federal\ndeadline elapsed. Id., at 225.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. 269, 277 (2005).\n  Finally, Gonzalez argues, as an alternative to his later-\nin-time construction, that his petition should be consid-\nered timely because it was filed within a year of when his\ntime for seeking this Court\u2019s review\u2014as opposed to the\nTexas CCA\u2019s review\u2014expired. We can review, however,\nonly judgments of a \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d or of a lower\nstate court if the \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d has denied\ndiscretionary review. This Court\u2019s Rule 13.1; see also 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71257(a) (2006 ed.). Because Gonzalez did not\nappeal to the Texas CCA, this Court would have lacked\njurisdiction over a petition for certiorari from the Texas\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision affirming Gonzalez\u2019s conviction.\nWe therefore decline to incorporate the 90-day period for\nseeking certiorari in determining when Gonzalez\u2019s judg-\nment became final.\n                        *     *   *\n  In sum, we hold that \u00a72253(c)(3) is a mandatory but\nnonjurisdictional rule. Here, the COA\u2019s failure to \u201cindi-\ncate\u201d a constitutional issue did not deprive the Court of\nAppeals of jurisdiction to adjudicate Gonzalez\u2019s appeal.\nWe further hold that, with respect to a state prisoner who\ndoes not seek review in a State\u2019s highest court, the judg-\nment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) when the time\nfor seeking such review expires\u2014here, August 11, 2006.\nWe thus agree with the Court of Appeals that Gonzalez\u2019s\nfederal habeas petition was time barred.\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit is\n                                                  Affirmed.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S.

Where\nno such constitutional issue has been identified, an appeal\non other, nonconstitutional, issues (such as the statute of\nlimitations issue that the Court decides today) will not lie.\n   Today\u2019s opinion transforms this into a provision that\nallows appeal so long as a district or circuit judge, for\nwhatever reason or for no reason at all, approves it. This\nmakes a hash of the statute. The opinion thinks this\nalchemy required by the Court\u2019s previously expressed\ndesire to \u201c \u2018bring some discipline\u2019 to the use of the term\n\u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 5 (quoting Henderson v.

I would re-\nverse the judgment below for want of jurisdiction.\n2                  GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                               I\nFair Meaning of the Text\n  Congress amended \u00a72253 to its current form in the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA). In its entirety, the section reads as follows:\n       \u201c(a) In a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding\n    under section 2255 before a district judge, the final\n    order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the\n    court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding\n    is held.\n       \u201c(b) There shall be no right of appeal from a final\n    order in a proceeding to test the validity of a warrant\n    to remove to another district or place for commitment\n    or trial a person charged with a criminal offense\n    against the United States, or to test the validity of\n    such person\u2019s detention pending removal proceedings.\n       \u201c(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a cer-\n    tificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken\n    to the court of appeals from\u2014\n        \u201c(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\n        in which the detention complained of arises out of\n        process issued by a State court; or\n        \u201c(B) the final order in a proceeding under section\n        2255.\n       \u201c(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under\n    paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a sub-\n    stantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n       \u201c(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph\n    (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy\n    the showing required by paragraph (2).\u201d\nAs the Court acknowledges, ante, at 6\u20137, all three subsec-\ntions\u2014(a), (b), and (c)\u2014clearly speak to the jurisdiction of\nthe courts of appeals. Subsection (a) gives appellate juris-\ndiction to \u201cthe court of appeals for the circuit in which\nthe proceeding is held\u201d; subsection (b) carves out certain\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 336\n(2003).\n   Paragraph 2253(c)(3) says that a certificate of appeal-\nability must \u201cindicate\u201d which issue or issues in the case\ninvolve a substantial showing of a constitutional violation.\nEveryone agrees that the certificate issued below contains\nno such indication. See ante, at 5. It appears, in fact, that\nthe issuing judge never considered whether any of Gonza-\nlez\u2019s constitutional claims satisfied paragraph (2). As far\nas we know, no federal judge has ever determined that\nGonzalez \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of\na constitutional right.\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2). The Court does not\neven suggest that he has\u2014but it goes on to decide the\nstatute-of-limitations issue in the case.\n   Its basis for proceeding in this fashion is the remarkable\nstatement that \u201c[a] defective COA is not equivalent to the\nlack of any COA.\u201d Ante, at 8. That is simply not true with\nrespect to a significant defect in a legal document. Would\none say that a deed which lacks the words of conveyance is\nnot equivalent to the lack of a deed? Or that a passport\nwhich lacks the Secretary of State\u2019s affirmance of the\nbearer\u2019s citizenship is not equivalent to the lack of a pass-\nport? Minor technical defects are one thing, but a defect\nthat goes to the whole purpose of the instrument is some-\nthing else. And the whole purpose of the certificate-of-\nappealability procedure is to make sure that, before a case\ncan proceed to the court of appeals, a judge has made the\ndetermination that it presents a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right. To call something a\nvalid certificate of appealability which does not contain\nthe central finding that is the whole purpose of a certifi-\ncate of appealability is quite absurd.\n   The Court says that \u201c[o]nce a judge has made the de-\n4                       GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntermination that a COA is warranted and resources are\ndeployed in briefing and argument, . . . the COA has ful-\nfilled [its] gatekeeping function.\u201d Ante, at 10. But of\ncourse it has not done so\u2014it has performed no gatekeeping\nfunction whatever\u2014if \u201cthe determination that a COA is\nwarranted\u201d has not been accompanied by the issuing\njudge\u2019s opinion required to support the determination:\nthat there is an issue as to which the applicant has made\na \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,\u201d \u00a72253(c)(2). As the very next sentence of today\u2019s\nopinion discloses, what the Court means by \u201chas fulfilled\n[its] gatekeeping function\u201d is simply that it will not be\nworth the trouble of going back, since that would \u201cnot\noutweigh the costs of further delay,\u201d ante, at 9.\n   That is doubtless true, and it demonstrates the hollow-\nness of the Court\u2019s assurance that \u201ccalling a rule nonjuris-\ndictional does not mean that it is not mandatory or that a\ntimely objection can be ignored,\u201d ante, at 10. That state-\nment is true enough as a general proposition: Calling the\nnumerosity requirement in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500 (2006), nonjurisdictional, for example, did not\neliminate it, where protest was made, as a continuing\nmandatory requirement for relief on the merits, id., at\n516. Even the time-of-filing requirement in Eberhart v.\nUnited States, 546 U. S. 12 (2005) (per curiam), continued\nto have \u201cbite\u201d even though it was held nonjurisdictional: It\nprevented relief when the failure to observe it was prop-\nerly challenged, id., at 19. But the Court has managed to\ncreate today a \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement which\u2014precisely\nbecause it will not be worth the trouble of going back\u2014has\nno practical, real-world effect.1 What is the consequence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court suggests that I \u201cignor[e] the real world,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 7,\n\nin which litigants and courts have taken steps to correct a defective\nCOA. But these actions are unsurprising in a world in which there was\nthe possibility that this Court would treat \u00a72253(c)(3) as a jurisdictional\nrequirement and a court of appeals had already done so.

None whatever. The habeas peti-\ntioner already has what he wants, argument before the\ncourt of appeals. The government, for its part, is either\nconfident in its view that there has been no substantial\nshowing of denial of a constitutional right\u2014in which case\nit is just as easy (if not easier) to win before three judges\nas it is before one; or else it is not\u2014in which case a cru-\nsade to enforce \u00a72253(c) is likely to yield nothing but\nadditional litigation expenses. As for the three-judge\npanel of the court of appeals, it remains free, as always, to\nchoose whichever mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional basis it\nwishes for resolving the case. Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for\nBetter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 93\u201394 (1998). Why not\nchoose the one that is sure to be final and that might avoid\nembarrassing a colleague? No one has any interest in\nenforcing the \u201cmandatory\u201d requirement. Which is perhaps\nwhy, as I proceed to discuss, mandatory requirements for\ncourt-to-court appeal are always made jurisdictional.\nPast Treatment of Similar Provisions\n  As the Court acknowledges, \u201c \u2018context, including this\nCourt\u2019s interpretation of similar provisions in many years\npast, is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement\nas jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3 (quoting Reed Elsevier,\nInc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13)).\nThus, we have said that a requirement prescribed as a\ncondition to obtaining judicial review of agency action\nis quite different (nonjurisdictional) from a requirement\nprescribed as a condition to appeal from one court to an-\nother (jurisdictional). See Henderson, 562 U. S., at ___ \u2013\n___ (slip op., at 7\u20138).

We did not hold, however, that the\nsigning requirement was nonjurisdictional; we had no occasion to do so.\nWe held that Becker had complied with Civil Rule 11(a) because the\nerror was \u201c \u2018corrected promptly after being called to [his] attention,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 764 (quoting Fed.

Its very predeces-\nsor statute made a judge\u2019s expression of opinion a condi-\ntion of appellate jurisdiction. The certificate of probable\ncause, of which the COA was born, arrived on the scene\nover 100 years ago in \u201cAn Act Restricting in certain cases\nthe right of appeal to the Supreme Court in habeas corpus\nproceedings,\u201d Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40:\n    \u201c[F]rom a final decision by a court of the United\n    States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the de-\n    tention complained of is by virtue of process issued\n    out of a State court no appeal to the Supreme Court\n    shall be allowed unless the United States court by\n    which the final decision was rendered or a justice of\n    the Supreme Court shall be of opinion that there ex-\n    ists probable cause for an appeal, in which event, on\n    allowing the same, the said court or justice shall cer-\n    tify that there is probable cause for such allowance.\u201d\nThe last version of this statute, before it was amended to\nits current form in AEDPA, provided for issuance of the\ncertificate of probable cause by a circuit judge instead of a\njustice. See \u00a72253, 62 Stat. 967 (codified at 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72253). Even applying the Court\u2019s simplistic rule that the\njurisdictional restriction must be contained in the very\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame paragraph as the procedural requirement, there is\nno doubt that under this statute a judge\u2019s certification that\nthere was probable cause for an appeal was jurisdictional.\nSee, e.g., Ex parte Patrick, 212 U. S. 555 (1908) (per cu-\nriam); Bilik v. Strassheim, 212 U. S. 551 (1908) (per cu-\nriam). There is no reason whatever to think that Congress\nrendered the statement of opinion unnecessary for juris-\ndiction by (1) extending the requirement for it to \u00a72255\nproceedings; (2) requiring the opinion to address a more\nspecific point (not just probable cause for an appeal but\npresence of an issue presenting a \u201csubstantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right\u201d)4; and (3) giving the\ndocument in which the judge is required to express the\nopinion a name (\u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d)\u2014so that\nnow a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d without opinion will\nsuffice. Neither any one of these steps, nor all of them\ncombined, suggest elimination of jurisdictional status for\nthe required expression of opinion.5 It would be an en-\ntirely strange way of achieving that result. It was not a\nstrange way, however, of dividing the now more complex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court believes that the fact that this \u201cnew requirement . . . has\nno predecessor provision\u201d suggests that it is nonjurisdictional. Ante, at\n6, n. 3. To begin with, it is not that new, and it has a predecessor\nprovision; it merely adds detail to the jurisdictional opinion that was\npreviously required. But even if the requirement were entirely unprec-\nedented, when it appears within a textual structure that makes it\njurisdictional (as our opinion in Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487\nU. S. 312 (1988), held, see infra, at 10\u201312), it would be an entirely\nunprecedented jurisdictional provision.\n  5 The Court\u2019s opinion suggests that \u201c[i]t would seem somewhat coun-\n\nterintuitive to render a panel of court of appeals judges powerless to act\non appeals based on COAs that Congress specifically empowered one\ncourt of appeals judge to grant.\u201d Ante, at 8. To begin with, we do not\nthink that an anomaly. It makes entire sense to enable a single circuit\njudge to nip improper appeals in the bud, sparing parties the trouble of\nan appeal, and courts the expenditure of three times as much judicial\nenergy. But if it were an anomaly, it would be one that existed as well\nunder the prior statute, which was held to be jurisdictional.\n10                 GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand lengthy provision into manageable subsections.\nStare Decisis Effect of Torres\n  In addition to the fact that conditions attached to court-\nto-court appeal have always been held jurisdictional, and\nthe fact that this statute\u2019s predecessor was held to be so,\nwe have considered, and found to be jurisdictional, a stat-\nute presenting precisely what is at issue here: a provision\ngoverning court-to-court appeals which made particular\ncontent a required element of a document that the statute\nsaid was necessary for jurisdiction; and which did that in a\nseparate section that \u201cexcluded the jurisdictional terms,\u201d\nante, at 10. That case flatly contradicts today\u2019s holding.\nIn Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, we\ndealt with Rule 3(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. Rule 3(a) of those Rules makes a notice of\nappeal necessary to appellate jurisdiction\u2014just as\n\u00a72253(c)(1) makes a certificate of appealability necessary.\nAnd Rule 3(c)(1), which, like \u00a72253(c)(3), does not contain\njurisdictional language, says what the requisite notice of\nappeal must contain\u2014just as \u00a72253(c)(3) says what the\nrequisite certificate of appealability must contain:\n     \u201cThe notice of appeal must:\n        \u201c(A) specify the party or parties taking the appeal\n     by naming each one in the caption or body of the no-\n     tice . . . ;\n        \u201c(B) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof\n     being appealed; and\n        \u201c(C) name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d\nIn Torres we held that the Court of Appeals lacked juris-\ndiction over the appeal of a party not properly named in\nthe notice of appeal. 487 U. S., at 314\u2013315. The parallel\nis perfect.\n   The Court claims that the jurisdictional consequences of\nRule 3(c) were \u201c \u2018imposed by the legislature,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 12\n                       Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                       11\n\n                           SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n(quoting Torres, supra, at 318), which according to the\nCourt\u2019s analysis \u201c \u2018clearly state[d],\u2019 \u201d ante, at 6 (quoting\nArbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515), that Rule 3(c) is jurisdictional.\nBut the legislature there did precisely what it did here:\nmade a particular document necessary to jurisdiction and\nthen specified what that document must contain.6 I cer-\ntainly agree that that is a clear statement that a docu-\nment with the requisite content is necessary to jurisdic-\ntion. But the Court does not. So to distinguish Torres it\nhas to find something else in Rule 3(c) that provided a\n\u201cclear statement\u201d of what \u201cCongress intended,\u201d ante, at 6\u2013\n7. The best it can come up with, ante, at 12, is an unclear\nstatement, and that not from Congress but from Advisory\nCommittee Notes referred to in the Torres opinion. Such\nNotes are (of course) \u201cthe product of the Advisory Commit-\ntee, and not Congress,\u201d and \u201cthey are transmitted to Con-\ngress before the rule is enacted into law.\u201d United States v.\nVonn, 535 U. S. 55, 64, n. 6 (2002). They are, in other\nwords, a species of legislative history. I know of no prece-\ndent for the proposition that legislative history can satisfy\na clear-statement requirement imposed by this Court\u2019s\nopinions. Does today\u2019s distinguishing of Torres mean that\nlegislative history can waive the sovereign immunity of\nthe United States? See United States v. Nordic Village,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 The Court\u2019s claim that \u201cTorres involved . . . a different textual, con-\n\ntextual, and historical backdrop,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 8, does not withstand\nscrutiny. First, consider the \u201ctextual backdrop.\u201d The Court cannot\nreally believe that Rule 3(c)(1)\u2019s statement that a notice of appeal \u201cmust\n. . . specify\u201d the appealing party is \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 jurisdictional language,\u201d ante,\nat 7, while \u00a72253(c)(3)\u2019s \u201cshall indicate\u201d the issue or issues is not. If it\ndid, it would say as much, since that would readily distinguish Torres.\nAnd then consider the \u201ccontextual\u201d (whatever that means) and \u201chistor-\nical backdrop.\u201d Each provision, in mandatory-but-not-jurisdictional\nlanguage, specifies what another document, itself jurisdictional in light\nof statutory text and history, must contain. The two cases are, of\ncourse, literally \u201cdifferent,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 8, but not in any legally\nrelevant way.\n12                      GONZALEZ v.

Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985). Or give retro-\nactive effect to new legislation? See Greene v. United\nStates, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964). Or foreclose review of\nagency actions? See Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387\nU. S. 136, 141 (1967). Today\u2019s opinion is in this respect a\ntime-bomb.\n  To make matters worse, the Advisory Committee Note\nconsidered by the Torres Court\u2014as \u201csupport for [its]\nview,\u201d 487 U. S., at 315\u2014did not clearly say that Rule\n3(c)\u2019s requirements were jurisdictional. It said this:\n        \u201c \u2018Rule 3 and Rule 4 combine to require that a notice\n     of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court\n     within the time prescribed for taking an appeal. Be-\n     cause the timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u201cmanda-\n     tory and jurisdictional,\u201d United States v. Robinson,\n     361 U. S. 220, 224 (1960), compliance with the provi-\n     sions of those rules is of the utmost importance.\u2019 \u201d 487\n     U. S., at 315 (quoting 28 U. S. C. App., p. 467; altera-\n     tion omitted and emphasis added).\nTo say that timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdic-\ntional, and that placing within the notice of appeal what\nRule 3 says it must contain is \u201cof the utmost importance,\u201d\ndoes not remotely add up to a clear statement that placing\nwithin the notice of appeal what Rule 3 says it must con-\ntain is jurisdictional. There is simply no principled basis\nfor saying that Torres satisfies the \u201cclear-statement prin-\nciple,\u201d ante, at 6, except the commonsense notion that\nwhen a document is made jurisdictional, and the required\ncontents of that document specified, a document that does\nnot contain those contents cannot confer jurisdiction.7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Court also tries to distinguish Torres on the ground that failure\n\nto comply with Rule 3 presented a different \u201cpossibility of gamesman-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

They know that in the past, to avoid the uncongenial\nrigidity of the rule that procedures attending court-to-\ncourt appeals are jurisdictional, we have performed won-\ndrous contortions to find compliance with those rules. For\nexample, in Smith v. Barry, 502 U. S. 244, 248 (1992), we\nheld that an \u201cinformal brief\u201d filed after a defective notice\nof appeal counted as a valid notice of appeal. In Foman v.\nDavis, 371 U. S. 178, 181 (1962), we held that a notice of\nappeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment\nwas also a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment.\nAnd in Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 270 (1988), we held\nthat a prisoner\u2019s notice of appeal was \u201cfiled\u201d when it was\ndelivered to prison authorities for forwarding to the dis-\ntrict court. These (shall we say) creative interpretations of\nthe procedural requirements were made necessary by the\nbackground principle that is centuries old: \u201c[I]f the mode\nprescribed for removing cases by writ of error or appeal\nbe too strict and technical, and likely to produce inconven-\nience or injustice, it is for Congress to provide a remedy\nby altering the existing laws; not for the court.\u201d United\nStates v.

But if we have\nbeen willing to expose ourselves to ridicule in order to\napprove implausible compliance with procedural prerequi-\nsites to appeal, surely we may be willing to continue and\nexpand the process of simply converting those obnoxious\nprerequisites into the now favored \u201cclaims processing\nrules,\u201d enabling us to avoid unseemly contortions by simp-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nship,\u201d ante, at 13, from that presented here. I fail to see the relevance\nof that happenstance. The premise of the Court\u2019s opinion is that the\nquestion of jurisdiction vel non is governed by a \u201cclear-statement\nprinciple,\u201d ante, at 6. The statement here is precisely as clear as the\nstatement in Torres. Do we enforce clear statements only when there is\na \u201cpossibility of gamesmanship\u201d? The Court\u2019s free-wheeling purposiv-\nism defies textual analysis.\n14                   GONZALEZ v.

And I\nneed not confront the Court with the back-at-you argu-\nment that if (c)(3) is jurisdictional (as I think) then (c)(2) is\nas well. For whether one runs it backwards or forwards,\nthe argument is a bad one. Assuming that (c)(2) is nonju-\nrisdictional, it does not at all \u201cfollow\u201d that (c)(3) is nonju-\nrisdictional as well. Paragraph (c)(3) is jurisdictional not\nbecause it is located in subsection (c), but because it de-\nscribes the required content of a COA. Paragraph (c)(2)\ndoes not; it sets forth the criterion for a COA\u2019s issuance. A\njudge may apply that criterion erroneously but still pro-\nduce a COA that (as paragraph (c)(3) requires) \u201cindicate[s]\nwhich specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required\nby paragraph (2).\u201d It no more follows that the erroneous-\nness of the judge\u2019s indication must destroy the jurisdiction\nthat the COA creates, than it followed under the predeces-\nsor statute that the erroneousness of the certification of\nprobable cause for an appeal destroyed the jurisdiction\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat the certification created.8 The two issues are quite\nseparate: what the judge must find, and what the COA (or\ncertification) must contain.\n  The Court points out that Gonzalez raised the Sixth\nAmendment issue in his application for a COA, that \u201c[a]\npetitioner, having successfully obtained a COA, has no\ncontrol over how the judge drafts the COA,\u201d and that the\npetitioner, \u201cas in Gonzalez\u2019s case, may have done every-\nthing required of him by law.\u201d Ante, at 8. Perhaps it is\ntrue that the defective COA was not at all Gonzalez\u2019s\nfault\u2014though he could have promptly moved to amend it.\nBut no-fault elimination of jurisdiction is not forbidden.\nIn Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007), we enforced a\ntime limit on notice of appeal where the district court had\npurported to extend the time to file and the appellant had\ncomplied with the court\u2019s order. Id., at 207, 213\u2013214. It\ndid not matter that the fault lay with the court.\n  Finally, the Court points out that treating \u00a72253(c)(3) as\njurisdictional would waste a lot of time. \u201cEven if addition-\nal screening of already-issued COAs for \u00a72253(c)(3) defects\ncould further winnow the cases before the courts of ap-\npeals, that would not outweigh the costs of further delay\nfrom the extra layer of review.\u201d Ante, at 9. But that is not\nan argument directed to the statute before us; it is an\nargument directed against enforcement of all jurisdiction-\nal requirements (all of which, I suspect, are the object of\nthe Court\u2019s mounting disfavor). And the argument may\nnot even be true, except in the (presumably rare) case\nwhere the jurisdictional prescription is disregarded. Over\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We held in Nowakowski v. Maroney, 386 U. S. 542, 543 (1967) (per\n\ncuriam), that \u201cwhen a district judge grants [a certificate of probable\ncause], the court of appeals must grant an appeal . . . and proceed to a\ndisposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.\u201d See\nalso Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 242 (1968) (Nowakowski\nrequires \u201cthat the appeal [be] considered on its merits . . . in cases\nwhere a certificate of probable cause has been granted\u201d).\n16                      GONZALEZ v. THALER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe long term, the time saved to judges and lawyers by an\nenforceable requirement that appeals be screened by a\nsingle judge may vastly outweigh the time wasted by the\noccasional need for enforcement. That, it seems to me, is\nwhat Congress believed.\n                          *    *    *\n   Terminology is destiny. Today\u2019s holding, and the ero-\nsion of our prior jurisprudence that will perhaps follow\nupon it, is foreshadowed and facilitated by the unfortunate\nterminology with which we have chosen to accompany our\ncampaign to \u201cbring some discipline\u201d to determinations of\njurisdiction. We have said that the universe of rules\nplacing limitations upon the courts is divided into (1)\n\u201cclaims processing rules,\u201d and (2) jurisdiction-removing\nrules. Unless our prior jurisprudence is to be repudiated,\nthat is a false dichotomy. The requirement that the un-\nsuccessful litigant file a timely notice of appeal, for exam-\nple, is (if the term is to have any meaning) a claims-\nprocessing rule, ordering the process by which claims are\nadjudicated. Yet as discussed above, that, and all proce-\ndures that must be followed to proceed from one court to\nanother, have always been deemed jurisdictional. The\nproper dichotomy is between claims processing rules that\nare jurisdictional, and those that are not. To put it other-\nwise suggests a test for jurisdiction that is not to be found\nin our cases.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 It may well be that what I have called a false dichotomy was indeed\n\nmeant to revise our jurisprudence. In Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443,\n455 (2004), we said by way of dictum the following: \u201cClarity would be\nfacilitated if courts and litigants used the label \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 not for\nclaim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the\nclasses of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal\njurisdiction) falling within a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u201d Unless an\nappeal lacking a timely filing of a notice of appeal can be considered one\nthat falls outside the appellate court\u2019s \u201csubject-matter jurisdiction\u201d\n(which would be an odd usage), Kontrick\u2019s dictum effectively announced\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    17\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   At the end of the day, the indication requirement in\n\u00a72253(c)(3) is \u201c \u2018imposed by the legislature and not by\nthe judicial process.\u2019 \u201d Torres, 487 U. S., at 318 (quoting\nSchiavone v. Fortune, 477 U. S., 21, 31 (1986)). Whether\nor not its enforcement leads to a harsh result, wastes time\nin this particular case, or (though the Court does not give\nthis as a reason) prevents us from reaching a circuit\nconflict we are dying to resolve, we are obliged to enforce it.\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ntoday\u2019s decision, the overruling of Torres and Browder v. Director, Dept. \n\nof Corrections of Ill., 434 U.

Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007) (decided after Kontrick), which\n\n(over the dissent of the author of Kontrick) reaffirmed Browder. \n I\nconfess error in joining the quoted portion of Kontrick. \n\n</pre>",
