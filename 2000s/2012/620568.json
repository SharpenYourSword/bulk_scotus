GREENWOOD ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10\u2013948.      Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided January 10, 2012\nAlthough respondents\u2019 credit card agreement required their claims to\n  be resolved by binding arbitration, they filed a lawsuit against peti-\n  tioner CompuCredit Corporation and a division of petitioner bank, al-\n  leging, inter alia, violations of the Credit Repair Organizations Act\n  (CROA). The Federal District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to\n  compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims\n  to be nonarbitrable. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can\n proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) re-\n quires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its\n terms. Pp. 2\u201310.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA establishes \u201ca liberal federal policy favor-\n ing arbitration.\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Con-\n str. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24. It requires that courts enforce arbitration\n agreements according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221. That is the case even when federal statu-\n tory claims are at issue, unless the FAA\u2019s mandate has been \u201cover-\n ridden by a contrary congressional command.\u201d Shearson/American\n Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226. Pp. 2\u20133.\n    (b) The CROA provides no such command. Respondents contend\n that the CROA\u2019s disclosure provision\u2014which requires credit repair\n organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes\n the sentence \u201c \u2018You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n that violates the [Act],\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a)\u2014gives consumers the\n right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA\n prohibits the waiver of \u201cany right of the consumer under this sub-\n chapter,\u201d \u00a71679f(a), the arbitration agreement\u2019s waiver of the \u201cright\u201d\n to bring a court action cannot be enforced. Respondents\u2019 premise is\n2               COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to\n    receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that\n    the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a\n    credit repair organization\u2019s \u201cliab[ility]\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to comply with\n    [the Act].\u201d \u00a71679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA\u2019s\n    mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not\n    demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a \u201cright\u201d to initial\n    judicial enforcement. Pp. 3\u20138.\n       (c) At the time of the CROA\u2019s enactment in 1996, arbitration claus-\n    es such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts gen-\n    erally, or in financial services contracts in particular. Had Congress\n    meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it\n    would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents\n    suggest.

WANDA GREENWOOD ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 10, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider whether the Credit Repair Organizations\nAct (CROA), 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679 et seq., precludes enforce-\nment of an arbitration agreement in a lawsuit alleging\nviolations of that Act.\n                             I\n  Respondents are individuals who applied for and re-\nceived an Aspire Visa credit card marketed by petitioner\nCompuCredit Corporation and issued by Columbus Bank\nand Trust, now a division of petitioner Synovus Bank. In\ntheir applications they agreed to be bound by a provision\nwhich read: \u201cAny claim, dispute or controversy (whether in\ncontract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or\nrelating to your Account, any transferred balances or this\nAgreement (collectively, \u2018Claims\u2019), upon the election of you\nor us, will be resolved by binding arbitration . . . .\u201d App.\n62.\n  In 2008, respondents filed a class-action complaint\nagainst CompuCredit and Columbus in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California,\nalleging, as relevant here, violations of the CROA. The\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims largely involved the defendants\u2019 allegedly mislead-\ning representation that the credit card could be used to\nrebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees\nupon opening of the accounts, which greatly reduced the\nadvertised credit limit.\n  The District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to\ncompel arbitration of the claims, concluding that \u201cCon-\ngress intended claims under the CROA to be non-\narbitrable.\u201d 617 F. Supp. 2d 980, 988 (2009). A panel of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed, Judge Tashima dissenting. 615 F. 3d 1204\n(2010). We granted certiorari, 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                               II\n  The background law governing the issue before us is the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq., enact-\ned in 1925 as a response to judicial hostility to arbitration.\nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 4). As relevant here, the FAA provides:\n       \u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or\n    a contract evidencing a transaction involving com-\n    merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\n    arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be\n    valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such\n    grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\n    of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72.\nThis provision establishes \u201ca liberal federal policy favoring\narbitration agreements.\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospi-\ntal v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983). See\nalso, e.g., Concepcion, supra, at __ (slip op., at 4); Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 25 (1991). It\nrequires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate accord-\ning to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985). That is the case even when\nthe claims at issue are federal statutory claims, unless the\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nFAA\u2019s mandate has been \u201coverridden by a contrary con-\ngressional command.\u201d Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987). See also Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 628 (1985). Respondents contend that the CROA\ncontains such a command.\n  That statute regulates the practices of credit repair\norganizations, defined as certain entities that offer ser-\nvices for the purpose of \u201c(i) improving any consumer\u2019s\ncredit record, credit history, or credit rating; or (ii) provid-\ning advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to\nany activity or service described in clause (i).\u201d1 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71679a(3). In its principal substantive provisions, the\nCROA prohibits certain practices, \u00a71679b, establishes\ncertain requirements for contracts with consumers,\n\u00a71679d, and gives consumers a right to cancel, \u00a71679e.\nEnforcement is achieved through the Act\u2019s provision of a\nprivate cause of action for violation, \u00a71679g, as well as\nthrough federal and state administrative enforcement,\n\u00a71679h.\n                            III\n  Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respond-\nents focus on the CROA\u2019s disclosure and nonwaiver provi-\nsions. The former, which is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit re-\npair organization must provide to the consumer before any\ncontract is executed. \u00a71679c(a). One sentence of that\nrequired statement reads, \u201c \u2018You have a right to sue a\ncredit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair\nOrganization Act.\u2019 \u201d The Act\u2019s nonwaiver provision states,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they\ncome within this definition. See 617 F. Supp. 980, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.\n2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d\n1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.\n4           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided\nby or any right of the consumer under this subchapter\u2014\n(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced\nby any Federal or State court or any other person.\u201d\n\u00a71679f(a).\n    The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reason-\ning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure\nprovision gives consumers the \u201cright to sue,\u201d which \u201cclear-\nly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.\u201d\n615 F. 3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision\nprohibits the waiver of \u201cany right of the consumer under\nthis subchapter,\u201d the arbitration agreement\u2014which\nwaived the right to bring an action in a court of law\u2014\ncannot be enforced. Id., at 1214.\n    The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclo-\nsure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an\naction in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an\nobligation on credit repair organizations to supply con-\nsumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation\nmarks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates\nis the right to receive the statement, which is meant to\ndescribe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere\nprovides. The statement informs consumers, for instance,\nthat they can dispute the accuracy of information in their\ncredit file and that \u201c \u2018[t]he credit bureau must then rein-\nvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete\ninformation.\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a). That description is\nderived from \u00a71681i(a), which sets out in great detail the\nprocedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event\nof challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly,\nthe required statement informs consumers that they may\n\u201c \u2018cancel your contract with any credit repair organization\nfor any reason within 3 business days from the date you\nsigned it\u2019 \u201d\u2014the right created and set forth in more detail\nin \u00a71679e. And the \u201cright to sue\u201d language describes the\nconsumer\u2019s right to enforce the credit repair organization\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cliab[ility]\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to comply with any provision of\nthis subchapter\u201d provided for in \u00a71679g(a).2 Thus, con-\ntrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, our interpretation does not\n\u201c[r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,\u201d post,\nat 6. The disclosure provision informs consumers of their\nright to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the\nstatute\u2014information they might otherwise not possess. It\nis the dissent\u2019s interpretation that effectively reduces a\nportion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the \u201cright\nto sue\u201d language in \u00a71679c(a) to \u201ccreate\u201d a right to sue in\ncourt not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section\nthat is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of\nrights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the\n\u201cright to sue\u201d elsewhere superfluous.\n   Respondents suggest that the CROA\u2019s civil-liability pro-\nvision, \u00a71679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra),\ndemonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a\n\u201cright\u201d to bring an action in court. They cite the provi-\nsion\u2019s repeated use of the terms \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass action,\u201d\nand \u201ccourt\u201d\u2014terms that they say call to mind a judicial\nproceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting\nthat respondents assign them. It is utterly commonplace\nfor statutes that create civil causes of action to describe\nthe details of those causes of action, including the relief\navailable, in the context of a court suit. If the mere formu-\nlation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were\nsufficient to establish the \u201ccontrary congressional com-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Accordingly, when a consumer sues to enforce liability under the\nCROA, he does so under \u00a71679g(a), not \u201cin light of \u00a71679c,\u201d post, at 4\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). An action under the CROA need not refer\nto \u00a71679c at all, unless it is based on the company\u2019s failure to provide\nthe statement required under that section. Section 1679g(a) creates the\n\u201cright\u201d at issue and describes it in detail not contained in \u00a71679c\u2019s\nsummary. When determining the scope of that right, it is therefore\n\u00a71679g(a)\u2014and not \u00a71679c\u2014that must govern.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand\u201d overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid\narbitration agreements covering federal causes of action\nwould be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In Gilmer\nwe enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a\ncause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: \u201cAny\nperson aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as\nwill effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7626(c)(1).     In McMahon we enforced an arbitration\nagreement with respect to a cause of action created by a\nprovision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: \u201cAny person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation\nof section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any\nappropriate United States district court and shall recover\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit\n. . . .\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71964(c). And in Mitsubishi Motors we\nenforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause\nof action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which\nread, in part: \u201c[A]ny person who shall be injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of anything forbidden in\nthe antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of\nthe United States . . . and shall recover threefold the\ndamages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including\na reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a715(a). Thus, we\nhave repeatedly recognized that contractually required\narbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription\nof civil liability in court. See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 28;\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S.,\nat 637. To be sure, none of the statutes described above\ncontained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us\ndoes. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judi-\ncial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial\nenforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is\nnot the waiver of a \u201cright of the consumer,\u201d \u00a71679f(a). It\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver\nprovision as a \u201ccongressional command\u201d that the FAA\nshall not apply.3\n   Moreover, if one believes that \u00a71679g\u2019s contemplation of\ncourt suit (combined with \u00a71679f(a)) establishes a nonwaiv-\nable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also\nbelieve that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial\njudicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,\nsince it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however,\nthat this mere \u201ccontemplation\u201d of suit in any competent\ncourt does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,\ndisabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-\nselection clause. And just as the contemplated availability\nof all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by\ncontractual specification, so also can the contemplated\navailability of judicial action be limited to judicial action\ncompelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The\nparties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the\nguarantee of \u00a71679g\u2014the guarantee of the legal power to\nimpose liability\u2014is preserved.\n   Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA\ndoes not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclo-\nsure provision effectively requires that credit repair organ-\nizations mislead consumers. We think not. The disclosure\nprovision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a\nmanner that is concise and comprehensible to the lay-\nman\u2014which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\nThe required statement says, for example, that the CROA\n\u201c \u2018prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Gilmer noted that the ADEA had been amended after conclusion of\n\nthe arbitration agreement in that case to preclude waiver of \u201crights\nor claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1)(C). The Court said in dictum that this provision \u201cdid\nnot explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of\nclaims,\u201d 500 U. S., at 29.\n8           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions,\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a). This is in some respects an\noverstatement, and in some respects an understatement,\nof the \u201cProhibited practices\u201d set forth in \u00a71679b. It would\ninclude, for example, deception apart from \u201cthe offer or\nsale of the services of the credit repair organization,\u201d\n\u00a71679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent\nthe required statement from being \u201cmisleading,\u201d that a\nconsumer has a right to be protected from deceptive prac-\ntices beyond those actually covered by \u00a71679b. So also\nwith respect to the statement\u2019s description of a \u201cright to\nsue.\u201d This is a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in\ncourt, to recover damages from credit repair organizations\nthat violate the CROA. We think most consumers would\nunderstand it this way, without regard to whether the suit\nin court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\nLeaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not\nmisleading\u2014and certainly not so misleading as to de-\nmand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to\ncontain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.\n                              IV\n   At the time of the CROA\u2019s enactment in 1996, arbitra-\ntion clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no\nrarity. Quite the contrary, the early 1990\u2019s saw the in-\ncreased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts\ngenerally, and in financial services contracts in particular.\nSee Ware, Arbitration and Unconscionability After Doc-\ntor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v.

The CROA itself\nfollowed a series of this Court\u2019s seminal decisions compelling arbitra-\ntion, decisions which held that the FAA had established a \u201cfederal\npolicy favoring arbitration,\u201d Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,\n500 U.

McMahon, 482\nU. S. 220, 227 (1987). To the extent Congress is ever \u201cstimulated\u201d by\nthis Court\u2019s decisions, post, at 8, there is no reason to think the Con-\ngress that enacted the CROA was any less stimulated than subsequent\nCongresses.\n10         COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

S. C. \u00a71679\net seq., are generally subject to valid arbitration agree-\nments unless Congress evinces a contrary intent in the\ntext, history, or purpose of the statute. See Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991). I\nagree with the Court that Congress has not shown that\nintent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I\nfind this to be a much closer case than the majority opin-\nion suggests.\n   The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provi-\nsion, see \u00a71679g(a), denominates the cause of action a\n\u201cright to sue\u201d in the mandatory disclosure statement,\n\u00a71679c(a), and then provides that \u201cright[s]\u201d may not be\nwaived, \u00a71679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the\nAct\u2014lay readers \u201cof limited economic means and . . .\ninexperienced in credit matters,\u201d \u00a71679(a)(2)\u2014reasonably\nmay interpret the phrase \u201cright to sue\u201d as promising a\nright to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that\nCongress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such\na construction of the liability provision.\n   But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is\nin my view no more compelling than the contrary con-\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstruction that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion\nnotes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a\ncause of action, and the liability provision that does is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other statutes that we\nhave held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this\nleaves the parties\u2019 arguments in equipoise, and our prece-\ndents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.\nThis is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitra-\ntion, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed\narbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts\nin favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we\nhave misread Congress\u2019 intent, then Congress can correct\nour error by amending the statute.\n   I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts\nthe liability provision of the Act with other, more recently\nenacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do\nnot understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress\nmust speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to\npreclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never\nsaid as much, and on numerous occasions have held that\nproof of Congress\u2019 intent may also be discovered in the\nhistory or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (\u201cIf\nsuch an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text\nof the [statute], its legislative history, or an \u2018inherent\nconflict\u2019 between arbitration and the [statute\u2019s] underlying\npurposes\u201d); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,\n482 U. S. 220, 227 (1987) (\u201cIf Congress did intend to limit\nor prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular\nclaim, such an intent \u2018will be deducible from [the statute\u2019s]\ntext or legislative history,\u2019 or from an inherent conflict\nbetween arbitration and the statute\u2019s underlying pur-\nposes\u201d (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985); citation omit-\nted)).

S. C. \u00a71679(a). Central\nto the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with\ninformation needed to make intelligent decisions about\npurchasing a repair organization\u2019s services. To that end,\nCongress directed that, \u201cbefore [execution of] any contract\n. . . between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organiza\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the organization must make certain disclosures.\nOne of the required disclosures reads:\n    \u201cYou have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n    that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits decep\u00ad\n    tive practices by [such] organizations.\u201d \u00a71679c(a).\nThe Act\u2019s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers\nmay bring in court: individual and class actions for dam\u00ad\nages (actual and punitive) and attorneys\u2019 fees. A further\nprovision renders void any purported waiver of any protec\u00ad\ntion or right the Act grants to consumers.\n   The Court today holds that credit repair organizations\ncan escape suit by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it\ncontracts that arbitration will serve as the parties\u2019 sole\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndispute-resolution mechanism. The \u201cright to sue,\u201d the\nCourt explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal\nrights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That\nreading may be comprehensible to one trained to \u201cthink\nlike a lawyer.\u201d But Congress enacted the CROA with\nvulnerable consumers in mind\u2014consumers likely to read\nthe words \u201cright to sue\u201d to mean the right to litigate in\ncourt, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding\narbitration.\n   In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that\nCongress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did\nnot authorize credit repair organizations to make a false\nor misleading disclosure\u2014telling consumers of a right they\ndo not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a\nnonwaivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a\ncredit repair organization cannot retract that right by\nmaking arbitration the consumer\u2019s sole recourse.\n                              I\n   CompuCredit marketed a credit card to consumers with\nweak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail\nand Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a\ncard under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby\n\u201crebuild poor credit\u201d and \u201cimprove [their] credit rating.\u201d\nApp. 40, Complaint \u00b611 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received\nCompuCredit\u2019s card, sought redress for multiple violations\nof the CROA.\n   Their complaint alleged that CompuCredit\u2019s promotion\u00ad\nal materials told potential customers that no deposit\nwould be required, and that cardholders would receive,\nupfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted,\nthey were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly\nfee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi\u00ad\nately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs\ncalculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCompuCredit\u2019s fee exactions did appear in the promotional\nmaterials: in small print, buried amidst other information,\nand removed from the clearer representation that no de-\nposit would be required. Id., at 40\u201341, Complaint \u00b6\u00b612\u2013\n13. Far from improving their credit rating, plaintiffs\ncomplained, CompuCredit knew that its card, saddled\nwith these fees, \u201cwould not provide any meaningful assis\u00ad\ntance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and\nimproving a credit rating.\u201d Id., at 48, Complaint \u00b641(b).\nFurthermore, plaintiffs stated, CompuCredit did not\nprovide them with the written disclosures of their rights\nrequired by the CROA. Id., at 42, Complaint \u00b623.\n  Seeking damages for the alleged violations, along with\nattorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiffs requested class certification. In\nthe District Court and Court of Appeals, they successfully\nresisted CompuCredit\u2019s motion to compel arbitration\npursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings.1\nThis Court, however, interprets the CROA to permit Com-\npuCredit\u2019s demand that plaintiffs proceed, if at all, before\nan arbitrator.2 I read the governing statute differently.\n                            II\n  Three sections of the CROA, considered together, indi\u00ad\ncate Congress\u2019 intention to preclude mandatory, creditor\u00ad\nimposed, arbitration of CROA claims. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71679c(a), 1679g, and 1679f. Before entering into any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The contract signed by cardholders did not itself require arbitration.\nRather, it incorporated by reference an \u201cenclosed insert\u201d providing that\nall disputes would be resolved by arbitration at the discretion of Com\u00ad\npuCredit or the cardholder. App. 61\u201363.\n  2 CompuCredit\u2019s form contract specified that arbitration was to occur\n\nunder the auspices of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). In 2009,\nafter the Attorney General of Minnesota filed an action alleging that\nNAF had engaged in numerous violations of consumer-protection laws,\nNAF entered into a consent decree barring it from handling consumer\narbitrations.

The liability created here, in\n\u00a71679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of \u00a71679c,\nmay sue to enforce.\n   The Act renders void and unenforceable \u201c[a]ny waiver by\nany consumer of any protection provided by or any right of\nthe consumer under this subchapter.\u201d \u00a71679f (emphasis\nadded).3 The rights listed in \u00a71679c(a) rendered nonwaiv-\nable by \u00a71679f are the \u201cright to sue\u201d and the \u201cright to\ncancel [a] contract . . . for any reason within 3 business\ndays from the date [the consumer] signed it.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Section 1679f(a), omitted from the Court\u2019s statutory appendix, ante,\n\nat 11\u201314, provides in full:\n   \u201cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any\nright of the consumer under this subchapter\u2014\n      \u201c(1) shall be treated as void; and\n      \u201c(2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other\n   person.\u201d\n   4 Two provisions, although described by \u00a71679c(a) as consumer\n\n\u201cright[s],\u201d are not rendered nonwaivable by \u00a71679f because they are not\n\u201cright[s] . . . under this subchapter.\u201d Rather, the \u201cright to dispute\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The question on which this case turns is what Congress\nmeant when it created a nonwaivable \u201cright to sue.\u201d\nRecall that Congress\u2019 target audience in the CROA is not\ncomposed of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced\nreading of statutory texts, but laypersons who receive a\ndisclosure statement in the mail. Recall, as well, Con\u00ad\ngress\u2019 findings that these individuals are often \u201cof limited\neconomic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.\u201d\n\u00a71679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context,\nthe Court construes the right to sue as \u201cthe legal right,\nenforceable in court, to recover damages . . . without re\u00ad\ngard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an\narbitration proceeding.\u201d Ante, at 8. I read Congress\u2019\nwords without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue,\nI would hold, means the right to litigate in court.\n   The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers\n\u201chave the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover dam\u00ad\nages from credit repair organizations that violate the\nCROA.\u201d Ibid. But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to\ncharacterize as merely \u201cimprecise,\u201d ibid., Congress\u2019 failure\nto include the caveat that access to court may be condi\u00ad\ntioned upon an anterior arbitration. The \u201cright to sue\u201d\nmay well be \u201ca colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers.\u201d See ibid. But it surely is not colloquially\nunderstood by recipients of the required disclosures as the\nright, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend\nagainst, court enforcement of an award rendered by the\narbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few,\nif any, credit repair customers would equate the \u201cright to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninaccurate information in your credit report\u201d and the \u201cright to obtain a\ncopy of your credit report\u201d referred to in \u00a71679c(a) are rights conferred\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code. See \u00a71681i(a), \u00a71681j. Section 1679f also\nmakes nonwaivable the \u201cprotection[s] provided . . . under this subchap\u00ad\nter\u201d (emphasis added); these protections include the prohibition of cer\u00ad\ntain business practices, see \u00a71679b, and the provision, in writing, of\ncertain contractual terms and conditions, see \u00a71679d.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsue,\u201d \u00a71679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review\ngiven to an arbitrator\u2019s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Asso-\nciates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586\u2013589\n(2008).\n  The Court discounts the references to \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass\naction,\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d in \u00a71679g, the provision that \u201ccre\u00ad\nate[s]\u201d the consumers\u2019 claim for relief. See ante, at 5.\nDespite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we\nhave enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes\narising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, how-\never, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,\nprime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit\nrepair organization to inform potential customers they\n\u201chave a right to sue\u201d an organization that violates the Act.\n\u00a71679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in\nconcert with \u00a71679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac\u00ad\nknowledgment that \u201ca statute is to be read as a whole,\nsince the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on\ncontext.\u201d King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221\n(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe\nCongress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure\nrequirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair\norganization that engages in deceptive practices may be\nsued in court.\n  Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see\nante, at 4\u20135, the Court\u2019s construction of the CROA scarcely\nadvances the Act\u2019s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro\u00ad\nspective customers \u201care provided with the information\nnecessary to make an informed decision,\u201d and also to\n\u201cprotect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising\nand business practices.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679(b). The Court\u2019s\ninterpretation, however, enables the very deception Con\u00ad\ngress sought to suppress. Today\u2019s decision permits credit\nrepair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print\nin a contract, an important right whose disclosure is de\u00ad\ncreed in the U. S. Code.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   This unfortunate result is not compelled by our prece\u00ad\ndents. The Court cites three decisions for the proposition,\nby now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a stat-\nutory right of action does not preclude agreements to\narbitrate disputes. See ante, at 5\u20136 (citing Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991);\nShearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S.\n220, 240 (1987); and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637 (1985)). As\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at\nissue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analo\u00ad\ngous to \u00a71679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would\nnot have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a\nnonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration\nbecause the statutes conferred no underlying right to\nproceed in court.\n   Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes\nwe have construed in the past in just that respect. The\nAct does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates\nthat claim as an action entailing a \u201cright to sue\u201d; man\u00ad\ndates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any\ncontract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any\n\u201cright\u201d conferred by the Act. Neither Gilmer, McMahon,\nnor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.5\n                            III\n  The Court\u2019s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has\nspoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 \u201c[I]f one believes [the CROA] . . . establishes a nonwaivable right to\n\ninitial judicial enforcement,\u201d the Court states, \u201cone must also believe\nthat it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in\nany competent judicial tribunal.\u201d Ante, at 7. In Sportin\u2019 Life\u2019s words,\n\u201cit ain\u2019t necessarily so.\u201d While there is good reason to believe Congress\ncared about the institutional location of consumers\u2019 suits under the\nCROA, there is no reason to think Congress sought to disturb the\npersonal jurisdiction and venue rules that determine in which court a\ncivil action may be brought.\n8             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nforum and proscribing arbitration, but here, it did not do\nso. The two statutes the Court cites as exemplary post\u00ad\ndate the CROA\u2019s enactment by 14 and 6 years, respective\u00ad\nly. (A third merely delegates regulatory authority over\ncertain arbitration agreements.) See ante, at 9. Notably,\nthese recent statutes were framed following a string of\nthis Court\u2019s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to\ncontractual stipulations.6 Our decisions have increasingly\nalerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver\nprescriptions with meticulous care. But the Congress that\ndrafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we\ncannot fairly assess that enactment in the light of subse\u00ad\nquent legislative responses to developments unknown to\nthe CROA\u2019s drafters. Cf. United States v. Price, 361 U. S.\n304, 313 (1960) (\u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress\nform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an\nearlier one.\u201d).\n   Beyond question, the Federal Arbitration Act, \u201cstanding\nalone,\u201d favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 226. To depart from that rule,\nhowever, Congress need not employ \u201cmagic words.\u201d See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6. In determining whether the Arbitration\nAct\u2019s general rule has been displaced by another statutory\nprescription, it remains our responsibility to examine\ncarefully \u201cthe text of the [statute], its legislative history,\u201d\nand Congress\u2019 \u201cunderlying purposes.\u201d Gilmer, 500 U.

Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided January 10, 2012\nAlthough respondents\u2019 credit card agreement required their claims to\n  be resolved by binding arbitration, they filed a lawsuit against peti-\n  tioner CompuCredit Corporation and a division of petitioner bank, al-\n  leging, inter alia, violations of the Credit Repair Organizations Act\n  (CROA). The Federal District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to\n  compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims\n  to be nonarbitrable. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can\n proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) re-\n quires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its\n terms. Pp. 2\u201310.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA establishes \u201ca liberal federal policy favor-\n ing arbitration.\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Con-\n str. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24. It requires that courts enforce arbitration\n agreements according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221. That is the case even when federal statu-\n tory claims are at issue, unless the FAA\u2019s mandate has been \u201cover-\n ridden by a contrary congressional command.\u201d Shearson/American\n Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226. Pp. 2\u20133.\n    (b) The CROA provides no such command. Respondents contend\n that the CROA\u2019s disclosure provision\u2014which requires credit repair\n organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes\n the sentence \u201c \u2018You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n that violates the [Act],\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a)\u2014gives consumers the\n right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA\n prohibits the waiver of \u201cany right of the consumer under this sub-\n chapter,\u201d \u00a71679f(a), the arbitration agreement\u2019s waiver of the \u201cright\u201d\n to bring a court action cannot be enforced. Respondents\u2019 premise is\n2               COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to\n    receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that\n    the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a\n    credit repair organization\u2019s \u201cliab[ility]\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to comply with\n    [the Act].\u201d \u00a71679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA\u2019s\n    mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not\n    demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a \u201cright\u201d to initial\n    judicial enforcement. Pp. 3\u20138.\n       (c) At the time of the CROA\u2019s enactment in 1996, arbitration claus-\n    es such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts gen-\n    erally, or in financial services contracts in particular. Had Congress\n    meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it\n    would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents\n    suggest.

The former, which is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit re-\npair organization must provide to the consumer before any\ncontract is executed. \u00a71679c(a). One sentence of that\nrequired statement reads, \u201c \u2018You have a right to sue a\ncredit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair\nOrganization Act.\u2019 \u201d The Act\u2019s nonwaiver provision states,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they\ncome within this definition.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.\n2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d\n1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.\n4           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided\nby or any right of the consumer under this subchapter\u2014\n(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced\nby any Federal or State court or any other person.\u201d\n\u00a71679f(a).\n    The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reason-\ning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure\nprovision gives consumers the \u201cright to sue,\u201d which \u201cclear-\nly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.\u201d\n615 F. 3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision\nprohibits the waiver of \u201cany right of the consumer under\nthis subchapter,\u201d the arbitration agreement\u2014which\nwaived the right to bring an action in a court of law\u2014\ncannot be enforced. Id., at 1214.\n    The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclo-\nsure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an\naction in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an\nobligation on credit repair organizations to supply con-\nsumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation\nmarks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates\nis the right to receive the statement, which is meant to\ndescribe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere\nprovides. The statement informs consumers, for instance,\nthat they can dispute the accuracy of information in their\ncredit file and that \u201c \u2018[t]he credit bureau must then rein-\nvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete\ninformation.\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a). That description is\nderived from \u00a71681i(a), which sets out in great detail the\nprocedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event\nof challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly,\nthe required statement informs consumers that they may\n\u201c \u2018cancel your contract with any credit repair organization\nfor any reason within 3 business days from the date you\nsigned it\u2019 \u201d\u2014the right created and set forth in more detail\nin \u00a71679e. And the \u201cright to sue\u201d language describes the\nconsumer\u2019s right to enforce the credit repair organization\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cliab[ility]\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to comply with any provision of\nthis subchapter\u201d provided for in \u00a71679g(a).2 Thus, con-\ntrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, our interpretation does not\n\u201c[r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,\u201d post,\nat 6. The disclosure provision informs consumers of their\nright to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the\nstatute\u2014information they might otherwise not possess. It\nis the dissent\u2019s interpretation that effectively reduces a\nportion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the \u201cright\nto sue\u201d language in \u00a71679c(a) to \u201ccreate\u201d a right to sue in\ncourt not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section\nthat is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of\nrights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the\n\u201cright to sue\u201d elsewhere superfluous.\n   Respondents suggest that the CROA\u2019s civil-liability pro-\nvision, \u00a71679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra),\ndemonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a\n\u201cright\u201d to bring an action in court. They cite the provi-\nsion\u2019s repeated use of the terms \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass action,\u201d\nand \u201ccourt\u201d\u2014terms that they say call to mind a judicial\nproceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting\nthat respondents assign them. It is utterly commonplace\nfor statutes that create civil causes of action to describe\nthe details of those causes of action, including the relief\navailable, in the context of a court suit. If the mere formu-\nlation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were\nsufficient to establish the \u201ccontrary congressional com-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Accordingly, when a consumer sues to enforce liability under the\nCROA, he does so under \u00a71679g(a), not \u201cin light of \u00a71679c,\u201d post, at 4\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). An action under the CROA need not refer\nto \u00a71679c at all, unless it is based on the company\u2019s failure to provide\nthe statement required under that section. Section 1679g(a) creates the\n\u201cright\u201d at issue and describes it in detail not contained in \u00a71679c\u2019s\nsummary. When determining the scope of that right, it is therefore\n\u00a71679g(a)\u2014and not \u00a71679c\u2014that must govern.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand\u201d overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid\narbitration agreements covering federal causes of action\nwould be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In Gilmer\nwe enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a\ncause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: \u201cAny\nperson aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as\nwill effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\u201d 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7626(c)(1).     In McMahon we enforced an arbitration\nagreement with respect to a cause of action created by a\nprovision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: \u201cAny person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation\nof section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any\nappropriate United States district court and shall recover\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit\n. . . .\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71964(c). And in Mitsubishi Motors we\nenforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause\nof action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which\nread, in part: \u201c[A]ny person who shall be injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of anything forbidden in\nthe antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of\nthe United States . . . and shall recover threefold the\ndamages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including\na reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a715(a). Thus, we\nhave repeatedly recognized that contractually required\narbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription\nof civil liability in court. See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 28;\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S.,\nat 637. To be sure, none of the statutes described above\ncontained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us\ndoes. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judi-\ncial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial\nenforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is\nnot the waiver of a \u201cright of the consumer,\u201d \u00a71679f(a). It\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver\nprovision as a \u201ccongressional command\u201d that the FAA\nshall not apply.3\n   Moreover, if one believes that \u00a71679g\u2019s contemplation of\ncourt suit (combined with \u00a71679f(a)) establishes a nonwaiv-\nable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also\nbelieve that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial\njudicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,\nsince it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however,\nthat this mere \u201ccontemplation\u201d of suit in any competent\ncourt does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,\ndisabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-\nselection clause. And just as the contemplated availability\nof all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by\ncontractual specification, so also can the contemplated\navailability of judicial action be limited to judicial action\ncompelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The\nparties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the\nguarantee of \u00a71679g\u2014the guarantee of the legal power to\nimpose liability\u2014is preserved.\n   Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA\ndoes not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclo-\nsure provision effectively requires that credit repair organ-\nizations mislead consumers. We think not. The disclosure\nprovision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a\nmanner that is concise and comprehensible to the lay-\nman\u2014which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\nThe required statement says, for example, that the CROA\n\u201c \u2018prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Gilmer noted that the ADEA had been amended after conclusion of\n\nthe arbitration agreement in that case to preclude waiver of \u201crights\nor claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1)(C). The Court said in dictum that this provision \u201cdid\nnot explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of\nclaims,\u201d 500 U. S., at 29.\n8           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions,\u2019 \u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679c(a). This is in some respects an\noverstatement, and in some respects an understatement,\nof the \u201cProhibited practices\u201d set forth in \u00a71679b. It would\ninclude, for example, deception apart from \u201cthe offer or\nsale of the services of the credit repair organization,\u201d\n\u00a71679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent\nthe required statement from being \u201cmisleading,\u201d that a\nconsumer has a right to be protected from deceptive prac-\ntices beyond those actually covered by \u00a71679b. So also\nwith respect to the statement\u2019s description of a \u201cright to\nsue.\u201d This is a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in\ncourt, to recover damages from credit repair organizations\nthat violate the CROA. We think most consumers would\nunderstand it this way, without regard to whether the suit\nin court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\nLeaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not\nmisleading\u2014and certainly not so misleading as to de-\nmand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to\ncontain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.\n                              IV\n   At the time of the CROA\u2019s enactment in 1996, arbitra-\ntion clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no\nrarity. Quite the contrary, the early 1990\u2019s saw the in-\ncreased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts\ngenerally, and in financial services contracts in particular.\nSee Ware, Arbitration and Unconscionability After Doc-\ntor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 31 Wake Forest L. Rev.\n1001, 1001, and n. 3 (1996); J. Shimabukuro, Congres-\nsional Research Service Report for Congress, The Federal\nArbitration Act: Background and Recent Developments 1\n(2002).\n   Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common\nprovisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a man-\nner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.

See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a726(n)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV) (\u201cNo predispute arbitration agree-\nment shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement re-\nquires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section\u201d);\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71226(a)(2) (2006 ed.) (\u201cNotwithstanding any\nother provision of law, whenever a motor vehicle franchise\ncontract provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a\ncontroversy arising out of or relating to such contract,\narbitration may be used to settle such controversy only if\nafter such controversy arises all parties to such controver-\nsy consent in writing to use arbitration to settle such\ncontroversy\u201d); cf. 12 U.

C. \u00a75518(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)\n(granting authority to the newly created Consumer Finan-\ncial Protection Bureau to regulate predispute arbitration\nagreements in contracts for consumer financial products\nor services).4 That Congress would have sought to achieve\nthe same result in the CROA through combination of the\nnonwaiver provision with the \u201cright to sue\u201d phrase in the\ndisclosure provision, and the references to \u201caction\u201d and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The dissent questions the relevance of these statutes, since they\n\npostdated the CROA and since this Court\u2019s intervening decisions\ncompelling arbitration \u201cincreasingly alerted Congress to the utility of\ndrafting antiwaiver prescriptions with meticulous care.\u201d Post, at 8.\nBut as the dissent implicitly recognizes, Congress had been \u201calerted\u201d\nmuch before these post-CROA statutes were passed. The CROA itself\nfollowed a series of this Court\u2019s seminal decisions compelling arbitra-\ntion, decisions which held that the FAA had established a \u201cfederal\npolicy favoring arbitration,\u201d Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,\n500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991), and that \u201c[t]he burden is on the party opposing\narbitration . . . to show that Congress intended to preclude a waiver of\njudicial remedies,\u201d Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482\nU. S. 220, 227 (1987). To the extent Congress is ever \u201cstimulated\u201d by\nthis Court\u2019s decisions, post, at 8, there is no reason to think the Con-\ngress that enacted the CROA was any less stimulated than subsequent\nCongresses.\n10         COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

See Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991). I\nagree with the Court that Congress has not shown that\nintent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I\nfind this to be a much closer case than the majority opin-\nion suggests.\n   The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provi-\nsion, see \u00a71679g(a), denominates the cause of action a\n\u201cright to sue\u201d in the mandatory disclosure statement,\n\u00a71679c(a), and then provides that \u201cright[s]\u201d may not be\nwaived, \u00a71679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the\nAct\u2014lay readers \u201cof limited economic means and . . .\ninexperienced in credit matters,\u201d \u00a71679(a)(2)\u2014reasonably\nmay interpret the phrase \u201cright to sue\u201d as promising a\nright to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that\nCongress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such\na construction of the liability provision.\n   But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is\nin my view no more compelling than the contrary con-\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstruction that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion\nnotes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a\ncause of action, and the liability provision that does is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other statutes that we\nhave held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this\nleaves the parties\u2019 arguments in equipoise, and our prece-\ndents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.\nThis is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitra-\ntion, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed\narbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts\nin favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we\nhave misread Congress\u2019 intent, then Congress can correct\nour error by amending the statute.\n   I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts\nthe liability provision of the Act with other, more recently\nenacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do\nnot understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress\nmust speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to\npreclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never\nsaid as much, and on numerous occasions have held that\nproof of Congress\u2019 intent may also be discovered in the\nhistory or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (\u201cIf\nsuch an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text\nof the [statute], its legislative history, or an \u2018inherent\nconflict\u2019 between arbitration and the [statute\u2019s] underlying\npurposes\u201d); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,\n482 U. S. 220, 227 (1987) (\u201cIf Congress did intend to limit\nor prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular\nclaim, such an intent \u2018will be deducible from [the statute\u2019s]\ntext or legislative history,\u2019 or from an inherent conflict\nbetween arbitration and the statute\u2019s underlying pur-\nposes\u201d (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985); citation omit-\nted)).

WANDA GREENWOOD ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 10, 2012]\n\n\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting.\n    Congress enacted the Credit Repair Organizations Act\n(CROA) to protect consumers \u201cwho have experienced\ncredit problems\u201d\u2014\u201cparticularly those of limited economic\nmeans\u201d\u2014against the unfair and deceptive practices of\ncredit repair organizations. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679(a). Central\nto the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with\ninformation needed to make intelligent decisions about\npurchasing a repair organization\u2019s services. To that end,\nCongress directed that, \u201cbefore [execution of] any contract\n. . . between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organiza\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the organization must make certain disclosures.\nOne of the required disclosures reads:\n    \u201cYou have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n    that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits decep\u00ad\n    tive practices by [such] organizations.\u201d \u00a71679c(a).\nThe Act\u2019s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers\nmay bring in court: individual and class actions for dam\u00ad\nages (actual and punitive) and attorneys\u2019 fees. A further\nprovision renders void any purported waiver of any protec\u00ad\ntion or right the Act grants to consumers.\n   The Court today holds that credit repair organizations\ncan escape suit by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it\ncontracts that arbitration will serve as the parties\u2019 sole\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndispute-resolution mechanism. The \u201cright to sue,\u201d the\nCourt explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal\nrights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That\nreading may be comprehensible to one trained to \u201cthink\nlike a lawyer.\u201d But Congress enacted the CROA with\nvulnerable consumers in mind\u2014consumers likely to read\nthe words \u201cright to sue\u201d to mean the right to litigate in\ncourt, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding\narbitration.\n   In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that\nCongress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did\nnot authorize credit repair organizations to make a false\nor misleading disclosure\u2014telling consumers of a right they\ndo not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a\nnonwaivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a\ncredit repair organization cannot retract that right by\nmaking arbitration the consumer\u2019s sole recourse.\n                              I\n   CompuCredit marketed a credit card to consumers with\nweak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail\nand Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a\ncard under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby\n\u201crebuild poor credit\u201d and \u201cimprove [their] credit rating.\u201d\nApp. 40, Complaint \u00b611 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received\nCompuCredit\u2019s card, sought redress for multiple violations\nof the CROA.\n   Their complaint alleged that CompuCredit\u2019s promotion\u00ad\nal materials told potential customers that no deposit\nwould be required, and that cardholders would receive,\nupfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted,\nthey were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly\nfee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi\u00ad\nately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs\ncalculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCompuCredit\u2019s fee exactions did appear in the promotional\nmaterials: in small print, buried amidst other information,\nand removed from the clearer representation that no de-\nposit would be required. Id., at 40\u201341, Complaint \u00b6\u00b612\u2013\n13. Far from improving their credit rating, plaintiffs\ncomplained, CompuCredit knew that its card, saddled\nwith these fees, \u201cwould not provide any meaningful assis\u00ad\ntance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and\nimproving a credit rating.\u201d Id., at 48, Complaint \u00b641(b).\nFurthermore, plaintiffs stated, CompuCredit did not\nprovide them with the written disclosures of their rights\nrequired by the CROA. Id., at 42, Complaint \u00b623.\n  Seeking damages for the alleged violations, along with\nattorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiffs requested class certification. In\nthe District Court and Court of Appeals, they successfully\nresisted CompuCredit\u2019s motion to compel arbitration\npursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings.1\nThis Court, however, interprets the CROA to permit Com-\npuCredit\u2019s demand that plaintiffs proceed, if at all, before\nan arbitrator.2 I read the governing statute differently.\n                            II\n  Three sections of the CROA, considered together, indi\u00ad\ncate Congress\u2019 intention to preclude mandatory, creditor\u00ad\nimposed, arbitration of CROA claims. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71679c(a), 1679g, and 1679f. Before entering into any\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The contract signed by cardholders did not itself require arbitration.\nRather, it incorporated by reference an \u201cenclosed insert\u201d providing that\nall disputes would be resolved by arbitration at the discretion of Com\u00ad\npuCredit or the cardholder. App. 61\u201363.\n  2 CompuCredit\u2019s form contract specified that arbitration was to occur\n\nunder the auspices of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). In 2009,\nafter the Attorney General of Minnesota filed an action alleging that\nNAF had engaged in numerous violations of consumer-protection laws,\nNAF entered into a consent decree barring it from handling consumer\narbitrations. See Press Release by Lori Swanson, Attorney General of\nMinnesota (July 19, 2009).\n4             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nconsumer contract, credit repair organizations must give\npotential customers a written statement of rights they\npossess under that Act and related consumer-protection\nlaws. \u00a71679c(a). Congress dictated every word of the\nrequired notification. Credit repair organizations must\ntell consumers, in plain terms, how they may enforce their\nrights: \u201cYou have a right to sue a credit repair organiza\u00ad\ntion that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.\u201d\nIbid.\n   The \u201cright to sue\u201d refers to the claim for relief Congress\nafforded consumers in \u00a71679g. \u201cAny person\u201d who violates\nanother\u2019s rights under the CROA \u201cshall be liable\u201d for\nactual damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and may be liable for\npunitive damages as well. \u00a71679g(a)(1)\u2013(3). The Act sets\nout the factors \u201cthe court shall consider\u201d in determining\nthe amount of punitive damages \u201cthe court may allow\u201d\naggrieved consumers to recover, either individually or as a\nclass. \u00a71679g(a)(2) and (b). The liability created here, in\n\u00a71679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of \u00a71679c,\nmay sue to enforce.\n   The Act renders void and unenforceable \u201c[a]ny waiver by\nany consumer of any protection provided by or any right of\nthe consumer under this subchapter.\u201d \u00a71679f (emphasis\nadded).3 The rights listed in \u00a71679c(a) rendered nonwaiv-\nable by \u00a71679f are the \u201cright to sue\u201d and the \u201cright to\ncancel [a] contract . . . for any reason within 3 business\ndays from the date [the consumer] signed it.\u201d4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Section 1679f(a), omitted from the Court\u2019s statutory appendix, ante,\n\nat 11\u201314, provides in full:\n   \u201cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any\nright of the consumer under this subchapter\u2014\n      \u201c(1) shall be treated as void; and\n      \u201c(2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other\n   person.\u201d\n   4 Two provisions, although described by \u00a71679c(a) as consumer\n\n\u201cright[s],\u201d are not rendered nonwaivable by \u00a71679f because they are not\n\u201cright[s] . . . under this subchapter.\u201d Rather, the \u201cright to dispute\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The question on which this case turns is what Congress\nmeant when it created a nonwaivable \u201cright to sue.\u201d\nRecall that Congress\u2019 target audience in the CROA is not\ncomposed of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced\nreading of statutory texts, but laypersons who receive a\ndisclosure statement in the mail. Recall, as well, Con\u00ad\ngress\u2019 findings that these individuals are often \u201cof limited\neconomic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.\u201d\n\u00a71679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context,\nthe Court construes the right to sue as \u201cthe legal right,\nenforceable in court, to recover damages . . . without re\u00ad\ngard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an\narbitration proceeding.\u201d Ante, at 8. I read Congress\u2019\nwords without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue,\nI would hold, means the right to litigate in court.\n   The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers\n\u201chave the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover dam\u00ad\nages from credit repair organizations that violate the\nCROA.\u201d Ibid. But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to\ncharacterize as merely \u201cimprecise,\u201d ibid., Congress\u2019 failure\nto include the caveat that access to court may be condi\u00ad\ntioned upon an anterior arbitration. The \u201cright to sue\u201d\nmay well be \u201ca colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers.\u201d See ibid. But it surely is not colloquially\nunderstood by recipients of the required disclosures as the\nright, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend\nagainst, court enforcement of an award rendered by the\narbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few,\nif any, credit repair customers would equate the \u201cright to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninaccurate information in your credit report\u201d and the \u201cright to obtain a\ncopy of your credit report\u201d referred to in \u00a71679c(a) are rights conferred\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code. See \u00a71681i(a), \u00a71681j. Section 1679f also\nmakes nonwaivable the \u201cprotection[s] provided . . . under this subchap\u00ad\nter\u201d (emphasis added); these protections include the prohibition of cer\u00ad\ntain business practices, see \u00a71679b, and the provision, in writing, of\ncertain contractual terms and conditions, see \u00a71679d.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsue,\u201d \u00a71679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review\ngiven to an arbitrator\u2019s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Asso-\nciates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586\u2013589\n(2008).\n  The Court discounts the references to \u201caction,\u201d \u201cclass\naction,\u201d and \u201ccourt\u201d in \u00a71679g, the provision that \u201ccre\u00ad\nate[s]\u201d the consumers\u2019 claim for relief. See ante, at 5.\nDespite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we\nhave enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes\narising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, how-\never, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,\nprime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit\nrepair organization to inform potential customers they\n\u201chave a right to sue\u201d an organization that violates the Act.\n\u00a71679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in\nconcert with \u00a71679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac\u00ad\nknowledgment that \u201ca statute is to be read as a whole,\nsince the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on\ncontext.\u201d King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221\n(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe\nCongress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure\nrequirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair\norganization that engages in deceptive practices may be\nsued in court.\n  Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see\nante, at 4\u20135, the Court\u2019s construction of the CROA scarcely\nadvances the Act\u2019s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro\u00ad\nspective customers \u201care provided with the information\nnecessary to make an informed decision,\u201d and also to\n\u201cprotect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising\nand business practices.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71679(b). The Court\u2019s\ninterpretation, however, enables the very deception Con\u00ad\ngress sought to suppress. Today\u2019s decision permits credit\nrepair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print\nin a contract, an important right whose disclosure is de\u00ad\ncreed in the U. S. Code.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   This unfortunate result is not compelled by our prece\u00ad\ndents. The Court cites three decisions for the proposition,\nby now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a stat-\nutory right of action does not preclude agreements to\narbitrate disputes. See ante, at 5\u20136 (citing Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991);\nShearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S.\n220, 240 (1987); and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637 (1985)). As\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at\nissue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analo\u00ad\ngous to \u00a71679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would\nnot have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a\nnonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration\nbecause the statutes conferred no underlying right to\nproceed in court.\n   Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes\nwe have construed in the past in just that respect. The\nAct does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates\nthat claim as an action entailing a \u201cright to sue\u201d; man\u00ad\ndates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any\ncontract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any\n\u201cright\u201d conferred by the Act. Neither Gilmer, McMahon,\nnor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.5\n                            III\n  The Court\u2019s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has\nspoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 \u201c[I]f one believes [the CROA] . . . establishes a nonwaivable right to\n\ninitial judicial enforcement,\u201d the Court states, \u201cone must also believe\nthat it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in\nany competent judicial tribunal.\u201d Ante, at 7. In Sportin\u2019 Life\u2019s words,\n\u201cit ain\u2019t necessarily so.\u201d While there is good reason to believe Congress\ncared about the institutional location of consumers\u2019 suits under the\nCROA, there is no reason to think Congress sought to disturb the\npersonal jurisdiction and venue rules that determine in which court a\ncivil action may be brought.\n8             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nforum and proscribing arbitration, but here, it did not do\nso. The two statutes the Court cites as exemplary post\u00ad\ndate the CROA\u2019s enactment by 14 and 6 years, respective\u00ad\nly. (A third merely delegates regulatory authority over\ncertain arbitration agreements.) See ante, at 9. Notably,\nthese recent statutes were framed following a string of\nthis Court\u2019s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to\ncontractual stipulations.6 Our decisions have increasingly\nalerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver\nprescriptions with meticulous care. But the Congress that\ndrafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we\ncannot fairly assess that enactment in the light of subse\u00ad\nquent legislative responses to developments unknown to\nthe CROA\u2019s drafters. Cf. United States v. Price, 361 U. S.\n304, 313 (1960) (\u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress\nform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an\nearlier one.\u201d).\n   Beyond question, the Federal Arbitration Act, \u201cstanding\nalone,\u201d favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 226. To depart from that rule,\nhowever, Congress need not employ \u201cmagic words.\u201d See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6. In determining whether the Arbitration\nAct\u2019s general rule has been displaced by another statutory\nprescription, it remains our responsibility to examine\ncarefully \u201cthe text of the [statute], its legislative history,\u201d\nand Congress\u2019 \u201cunderlying purposes.\u201d Gilmer, 500 U.
