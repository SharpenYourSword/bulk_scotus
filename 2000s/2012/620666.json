Argued November 8, 2011\u2014Decided January 10, 2012\r\nPetitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on\r\n  the testimony of a single eyewitness. During state postconviction re-\r\n  lief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by\r\n  the eyewitness contradicting his testimony. Smith argued that the\r\n  prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.\r\n  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State\r\n  from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and mate-\r\n  rial to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state\r\n  trial court rejected Smith\u2019s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\n  Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.\r\nHeld: Brady requires that Smith\u2019s conviction be reversed. The State\r\n does not dispute that the eyewitness\u2019s statements were favorable to\r\n Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under\r\n Brady, evidence is material if there is a \u201creasonable probability that,\r\n had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\r\n have been different.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469\u2013470. A \u201crea-\r\n sonable probability\u201d means that the likelihood of a different result is\r\n great enough to \u201cundermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d\r\n Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434. Evidence impeaching an eye-\r\n witness\u2019s testimony may not be material if the State\u2019s other evidence\r\n is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. United States v.\r\n Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112\u2013113, and n. 21. Here, however, the eyewit-\r\n ness\u2019s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime,\r\n and the eyewitness\u2019s undisclosed statements contradicted his testi-\r\n mony. The eyewitness\u2019s statements were plainly material, and the\r\n State\u2019s failure to disclose those statements to the defense thus violat-\r\n ed Brady.

BURL CAIN, WARDEN\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL\r\n             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA\r\n                               [January 10, 2012]\r\n\r\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\r\nCourt.\r\n   The State of Louisiana charged petitioner Juan Smith\r\nwith killing five people during an armed robbery. At\r\nSmith\u2019s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith\r\nto the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a\r\nfriend\u2019s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered\r\nthe home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly there-\r\nafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of\r\nBoatner\u2019s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as\r\nthe first gunman to come through the door. He claimed\r\nthat he had been face to face with Smith during the initial\r\nmoments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physi-\r\ncal evidence implicated Smith in the crime.\r\n   The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree\r\nmurder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith\u2019s\r\nconviction. State v. Smith, 797 So. 2d 193 (2001). The\r\nLouisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this\r\nCourt. 2001\u20132416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U. S.\r\n1201 (2003).\r\n   Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state\r\ncourts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the\r\n2                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npolice investigation of his case, including those of the lead\r\ninvestigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo\u2019s notes\r\ncontain statements by Boatner that conflict with his tes-\r\ntimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from\r\nthe night of the murder state that Boatner \u201ccould not . . .\r\nsupply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]\r\nthey were black males.\u201d App. 252\u2013253. Ronquillo also\r\nmade a handwritten account of a conversation he had with\r\nBoatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said\r\nhe \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d\r\nand \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d Id., at 308.\r\nAnd Ronquillo\u2019s typewritten report of that conversation\r\nstates that Boatner told Ronquillo he \u201ccould not identify\r\nany of the perpetrators of the murder.\u201d Id., at 259\u2013260.\r\n  Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,\r\ninter alia, that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Ron-\r\nquillo\u2019s notes violated this Court\u2019s decision in Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court re-\r\njected Smith\u2019s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\nAppeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We\r\ngranted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.\r\n  Under Brady, the State violates a defendant\u2019s right to\r\ndue process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the\r\ndefense and material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punish-\r\nment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute\r\nthat Boatner\u2019s statements in Ronquillo\u2019s notes were fa-\r\nvorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis-\r\nclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether\r\nBoatner\u2019s statements were material to the determination\r\nof Smith\u2019s guilt. We have explained that \u201cevidence is\r\n\u2018material\u2019 within the meaning of Brady when there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-\r\nclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been dif-\r\nferent.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469\u2013470 (2009). A\r\nreasonable probability does not mean that the defendant\r\n\u201cwould more likely than not have received a different\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nverdict with the evidence,\u201d only that the likelihood of a\r\ndifferent result is great enough to \u201cundermine[] confidence\r\nin the outcome of the trial.\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\r\n419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewit-\r\nness may not be material if the State\u2019s other evidence is\r\nstrong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See\r\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112\u2013113, and n. 21\r\n(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner\u2019s testimony\r\nwas the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And\r\nBoatner\u2019s undisclosed statements directly contradict his\r\ntestimony: Boatner told the jury that he had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d\r\nthat Smith was the gunman he stood \u201cface to face\u201d with on\r\nthe night of the crime, but Ronquillo\u2019s notes show Boatner\r\nsaying that he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t\r\nsee faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d\r\nApp. 196, 200, 308. Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements\r\nwere plainly material.\r\n   The State and the dissent advance various reasons why\r\nthe jury might have discounted Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made\r\nother remarks on the night of the murder indicating that\r\nhe could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but\r\nnot the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about\r\nwhich of Boatner\u2019s contradictory declarations the jury\r\nwould have believed. The State also contends that Boat-\r\nner\u2019s statements made five days after the crime can be\r\nexplained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the\r\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the\r\nState\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so.\r\n   The police files that Smith obtained in state postconvic-\r\ntion proceedings contain other evidence that Smith con-\r\ntends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.\r\nBecause we hold that Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements\r\n4                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith\u2019s convic-\r\ntion, we have no need to consider his arguments that the\r\nother undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under\r\nBrady.\r\n   The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District\r\nCourt of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

S. 83 (1963), did not disclose that the\r\neyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly\r\nafter the murders that he could not identify any of the\r\nperpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith\r\nhas not shown a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury\r\nwould have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.\r\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion\r\nof Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be\r\nmade \u201cin the context of the entire record,\u201d United States v.\r\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976), and \u201cturns on the cumu-\r\nlative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the gov-\r\nernment,\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995).\r\nApplying these principles, I would affirm the judgment\r\nof the Louisiana trial court.\r\n                             I\r\n   The evidence presented at trial showed the following\r\nfacts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several\r\nfriends gathered at Rebe Espadron\u2019s home in New Or-\r\nleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in\r\nthe kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car\r\nwithout a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen\u2019s\r\noutside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed\r\n2                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntheir way through the door, demanding drugs and money.\r\nTr. 153\u2013154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door\r\nput a gun in Boatner\u2019s face and pushed him backwards.\r\nId., at 154\u2013155. The men initially ordered Boatner and\r\nhis friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand\r\nup. At that time, the man who had been the first one\r\nthrough the door placed his gun under Boatner\u2019s chin. Id.,\r\nat 156\u2013157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted\r\nhim to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the\r\nhead with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.\r\nId., at 157\u2013158.\r\n   After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a\r\nback bedroom, where she had been when the men entered\r\nthe house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to\r\nthe kitchen, a man with a \u201ccovering\u201d over his mouth point-\r\ned his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at\r\n70\u201371. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back\r\ntoward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened\r\nfire. Id., at 71\u201372, 159.\r\n   When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A\r\nfifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally\r\nwounded and died later at the hospital. Of those original-\r\nly gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,\r\nwho suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first\r\nman\u2019s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who\r\nescaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had re-\r\nmained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police\r\nalso found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.\r\nYoung was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the\r\nhead. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never\r\nseen Young before, the police surmised that Young had\r\nbeen one of the perpetrators.1\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was\r\n\r\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

He testified at trial\r\nthat he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espa-\r\ndron\u2019s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the\r\nlaceration to his head. According to Narcisse, \u201cMr. Boat-\r\nner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.\u201d\r\nId., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that\r\nBoatner \u201chad a description\u201d of the person that he saw, the\r\ndetails of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.\r\n   Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the\r\nshootings, testified that Boatner had described the first\r\nman through the kitchen door as having a \u201cshort-type\r\nhaircut,\u201d \u201ca lot of golds in his teeth,\u201d and \u201cbrown-ski[n].\u201d2\r\nId., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that\r\nBoatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that\r\nBoatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the\r\nman initially came through the door and again when\r\nBoatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun\r\nto his chin. Id., at 117\u2013118.\r\n   Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months\r\nfollowing the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person\r\nphotograph arrays of potential suspects\u2014only one of\r\nwhich contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89\u2013100. Three\r\nweeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with\r\none of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.\r\nRonquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the\r\narray had a \u201csimilar haircut\u201d and \u201ca similar expression on\r\nhis face\u201d as the \u201cgentleman that came into the house\r\ninitially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,\u201d but that\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nas a result of being shot. 1 Record 49.\r\n  2 \u201cGolds\u201d are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to\r\n\r\nas \u201cgrills.\u201d See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South\r\nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p. 5, 2007 WLNR 2187080.

CAIN\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nBoatner \u201cwas positive this wasn\u2019t the individual.\u201d Id., at\r\n97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo\r\npresented Boatner with the array that included a photo-\r\ngraph of Smith. Tr. 99\u2013101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo\r\ntestified that Boatner identified Smith \u201cimmediately,\u201d\r\nstating, \u201c \u2018This is it. I\u2019ll never forget that face.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\r\n100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith\u2019s\r\nphotograph was the only one that Boatner identified.\r\n   Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to\r\nthe stand during Smith\u2019s trial. Boatner testified that\r\nSmith\u2019s face was the \u201c[s]ame face,\u201d id., at 174, and that\r\nSmith\u2019s mouth was the \u201c[s]ame mouth\u201d \u201cfull of gold,\u201d ibid.,\r\nas that of the first man who came through the kitchen\r\ndoor on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that\r\nSmith\u2019s hair at trial was \u201cshaved on the sides\u201d as it was\r\nduring the crime, but that \u201cthe top was a little bit lower\u201d\r\nat the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain-\r\ned that, during the attack, he had focused on the first\r\nman through the door\u2014who was unmasked\u2014but that he\r\n\u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d the faces of any of the other assailants or\r\nwhether they were masked. Id., at 154. On cross-\r\nexamination, Boatner testified that he had described the\r\nfirst man\u2019s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the\r\npolice. Id., at 178.\r\n   Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-\r\ndegree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,\r\nSmith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.\r\nSmith argued that the State had failed to disclose various\r\npolice notes revealing favorable evidence material to\r\nSmith\u2019s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-\r\ntrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita\r\nRussell and Espadron\u2019s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial\r\nstatement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; state-\r\nments by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling\u2019s\r\nfellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect\r\nPhillip Young. After holding a 4-day evidentiary hearing,\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe postconviction judge\u2014who had also presided over\r\nSmith\u2019s 2-day trial\u2014denied Smith\u2019s Brady claims.\r\n  Like the postconviction court below, I conclude that\r\nSmith is not entitled to a new trial under Brady. In my\r\nview, Smith has not established a reasonable probability\r\nthat the cumulative effect of this evidence would have\r\ncaused the jury to change its verdict.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by\r\nBoatner, which the Court concludes are \u201cplainly material.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nconversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that\r\nBoatner \u201ccould not . . . supply a description of the perpe-\r\ntrators other th[a]n they were black males.\u201d 5 Record 809.\r\nSecond, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nphone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five\r\ndays after the murders, states that \u201cBoatner . . . could not\r\nID anyone because couldn\u2019t see faces . . . glanced at 1st\r\none\u2014saw man\u2014through door\u2014can\u2019t tell if had\u2014faces\r\ncovered didn\u2019t see anyone . . . Could not ID\u2014would not\r\nknow them if\u2014I saw them.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo\u2019s\r\ntyped summary of this note states that Boatner advised\r\nhim that he \u201ccould not identify any perpetrators of the\r\nmurder.\u201d 5 id., at 817.\r\n  Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could\r\nhave been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during\r\ncross-examination. But the statements are not material\r\nfor purposes of Brady because they cannot \u201creasonably be\r\ntaken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\r\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles, 514 U. S., at\r\n435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that\r\nBoatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,\r\noffered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occa-\r\nsions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed\r\n6                            SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatements do not warrant a new trial.\r\n  The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo\u2019s\r\non-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpe-\r\ntrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner\r\nprovided him with a description of the perpetrator that\r\nBoatner saw. Narcisse\u2019s testimony thus corroborated\r\nBoatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw the first man and\r\ndescribed him to police.3 Narcisse\u2019s testimony also miti-\r\ngated the impeachment value of Ronquillo\u2019s on-scene note\r\nby indicating that, although Boatner may have provided\r\nno detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner\r\nhad described the first man to another officer.4\r\n  In any event, Ronquillo\u2019s notes reflect that Boatner\r\nprovided a description of the first perpetrator at the police\r\nstation only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.\r\n403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could \u201cde-\r\nscribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.\u201d 5\r\nRecord 866. He responded: \u201cI can tell you about one, the\r\none who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male\r\nwith a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complex-\r\nion, brown skinned.\u201d Ibid. When asked, \u201c[Y]ou say you\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    3 Ina pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he \u201cgave a description\r\nto the officer that came to the scene.\u201d Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner\r\nresponded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective\r\nRonquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that\r\nthe first man through the door was \u201cheavy built with his hair with a\r\nfade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.\u201d Ibid.\r\nThat testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and\r\nOfficer Narcisse gave at trial.\r\n  4 Moreover, Boatner\u2019s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the\r\n\r\ncrime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postcon-\r\nviction hearing, \u201cthere were dead bodies everywhere,\u201d and Boatner was\r\n\u201ca little shook up.\u201d Id., at 402\u2013403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse\r\ntestified at trial that Boatner, while \u201cnot as frantic\u201d as Espadron, was a\r\n\u201cbit emotional\u201d when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34\r\n(Dec. 4, 1995).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncan\u2019t describe any of the other shooters besides the one\r\nwho put the gun in your face after you opened the door,\u201d\r\nBoatner replied, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Ibid. In his brief, Smith\r\ncites this station house statement as an example of favor-\r\nable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually\r\ncorroborates Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw and\r\ndescribed the first perpetrator to police and that he did not\r\nget a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the\r\ndescription Boatner provided was consistent with Smith\u2019s\r\nappearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner\u2019s\r\nstation house statement, but our cases instruct us to\r\nevaluate \u201cthe net effect of the evidence withheld by the\r\nState\u201d in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421\u2013\r\n422.\r\n   The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the\r\nfirst perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the\r\ncrime, but also that Boatner described him again three\r\nweeks later when he viewed a photograph array and elim-\r\ninated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before\r\nthe jury further indicated that, several months after the\r\ncrime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,\r\nafter evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month\r\ninvestigative period. What is more, the reliability of\r\nBoatner\u2019s out-of-court identification was extensively tested\r\nduring cross-examination at Smith\u2019s trial. In particular,\r\nBoatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith\u2019s\r\npicture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect\r\nhad tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,\r\nresponding, \u201cI picked out the person I seen come in that\r\nhouse that held a gun to my head and under my chin and\r\nthe person that was there when all my friends died.\u201d Tr.\r\n190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense\r\ncounsel\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d theory is supported by the fact that\r\nBoatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling\u2014\r\nwhose photograph was included in a separate array shown\r\nto Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified\r\n8                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nSmith\u2014even though Trackling\u2019s picture was next to\r\nSmith\u2019s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.\r\n   When weighed against Boatner\u2019s repeated and con-\r\nsistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court\r\nidentifications, Boatner\u2019s March 6 statement is also imma-\r\nterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo\u2019s note of his March\r\n6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contra-\r\ndiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although\r\nthe note states that Boatner \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone,\u201d it also\r\nstates that Boatner \u201cglanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014\r\nthrough door.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is con-\r\nsistent with Boatner\u2019s repeated statements that he only\r\nsaw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury\r\nwould have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner\u2019s\r\nstatement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five\r\ndays after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators\r\nwere still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-\r\nner\u2019s trial testimony that, following the murders of his\r\nfriends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleep-\r\ning, quit his job, and began drinking heavily\u2014so much so\r\nthat he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treat-\r\nment and grief counseling. Tr. 162\u2013163, 170\u2013171, 182\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6\r\nnote would have been further mitigated by the fact that,\r\nas Ronquillo explained, \u201con the night of the incident\r\n[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he\r\ngave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith\u2019s\r\ndescription.\u201d Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following\r\nhis March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed\r\nnumerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetra-\r\ntor, and ultimately identified him as Smith.\r\n   Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo\u2019s\r\nnotes of Boatner\u2019s on-scene and March 6 statements, it\r\nmight have believed that Boatner could not identify any of\r\nthe perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is\r\ninsufficient to establish a Brady violation.

See ante, at 3 (\u201c[T]he\r\nState\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so\u201d). But Smith\r\nis not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury\r\ncould have accorded some weight to Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatements. Smith\u2019s burden is to show a reasonable prob-\r\nability that the jury would have accorded those statements\r\nsufficient weight to alter its verdict.

CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note\r\nwas in his handwriting, but he testified that he never\r\ntalked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was\r\nmade, and that someone else could have relayed the in-\r\nformation to him. Tr. 415\u2013418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will\r\nassume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it\r\nwould have been admissible at Smith\u2019s trial as a dying\r\ndeclaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had\r\nminimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith\u2019s\r\nassertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which\r\nthe statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that\r\nRussell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in\r\n\u201cbad condition.\u201d Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reg-\r\ninald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she\r\nwas \u201cwhining\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t catch nothing [t]hat she\r\nsaid.\u201d Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith\r\ncontends that the note says \u201cexactly\u201d that the \u201cfirst person\r\nthrough the door had a black cloth across his face,\u201d that\r\nis not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11\r\n(emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)\r\n(hereinafter Reply Brief).

It is at\r\nleast as logical to read this statement as indicating only\r\nthat \u201cone\u201d of the \u201cpeople\u201d had a \u201cblack cloth across [his]\r\nface.\u201d Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing\r\nfurther after \u201cfirst one through door,\u201d and it is impossible\r\nto know whether the \u201cfirst one\u201d was also the \u201cone\u201d with a\r\n\u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201d\r\n  The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale\r\nMims, who lived down the street from Espadron\u2019s home\r\nand who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states\r\nthat Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron\u2019s home, \u201call\r\nwearing mask[s].\u201d Id., at 2518. Like Russell\u2019s purported\r\nstatement, this statement has minimal impeachment\r\nvalue in light of the record. Mims\u2019 undisclosed statement\r\ndoes not address whether some or all of the perpetrators\r\nwere masked inside Espadron\u2019s home.7 Moreover, had\r\nMims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably\r\nwould have testified, as he did at the postconviction hear-\r\ning, that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that he only saw three perpe-\r\ntrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were\r\nmasked. Tr. 269, 271\u2013273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n  Both Russell\u2019s purported statement and Mims\u2019 testimo-\r\nny are consistent with Boatner\u2019s testimony that he did not\r\nknow whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,\r\nid., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse\u2019s and\r\nEspadron\u2019s testimony that the single perpetrator whom\r\nEspadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover-\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  7 Smith ridicules the \u201cexceedingly peculiar\u201d notion that the perpetra-\r\n\r\ntors would have remained unmasked inside Espadron\u2019s home, only to\r\nmask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12\u201313. But that\r\nnotion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre\r\nthe witnesses who were inside the home\u2014as they did\u2014and were\r\nconcerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who\r\nmight see or hear the burglary.\r\n12                     SMITH v.

The\r\nnote states that \u201cLeary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM\r\nammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]\r\nwas typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], \u2018Mac[-]\r\n11\u2019 model type, semi automatic weapon.\u201d 5 Record 831.\r\nAccording to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary\u2019s\r\ntrial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found\r\nat the scene \u201cwas fired by one particular weapon, one 9-\r\nmillimeter handgun,\u201d Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an\r\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a \u201chandgun.\u201d Smith fur-\r\nther argues that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement could have\r\nbeen used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution\r\nattempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that\r\nShelita Russell\u2019s wounds could have been inflicted by a\r\n9-millimeter \u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by\r\ncalling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under\r\nhis chin was a 9-millimeter silver \u201chand gun,\u201d id., at 157\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995).\r\n   Contrary to Smith\u2019s contentions, Leary\u2019s pretrial state-\r\nment does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.\r\nLeary\u2019s pretrial statement is consistent with his and\r\nBoatner\u2019s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11\r\npistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that\r\nsuch a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for\r\nPetitioner 48.

But even assuming that\r\nSmith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms\r\nexpert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather\r\nthan technical terminology.8\r\n  The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used\r\nthe term \u201chandgun,\u201d he did not understand it to exclude\r\nautomatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the im-\r\nmediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,\r\nBoatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a \u201cMa[c]\r\n10\u201d or \u201cTech Nine\u201d \u201cUzi\u201d type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that\r\nweapon as a \u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner\u2019s\r\npretrial description of the silver or chrome \u201chandgun\u201d that\r\nthe first man held was consistent with Leary\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammu-\r\nnition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In\r\nhis station house statement, Boatner described the first\r\nman\u2019s weapon as a \u201cbig,\u201d \u201cautomatic pistol.\u201d Id., at 813,\r\n866. Because Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is neither im-\r\npeaching nor exculpatory, Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement\r\ncannot form the basis of a Brady violation.

Smith\r\nrelies on the fact that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement indicated that the\r\nammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun\r\nrecovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.\r\nId., at 18. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun\r\nrecovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith\u2019s repre-\r\nsentation. More importantly, Leary\u2019s statement suggests only that\r\nBannister\u2019s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at\r\nthe scene, not that Leary did not consider an \u201c[Intratec] or \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019 \u201d\r\nmodel type to be a handgun.\r\n14                     SMITH v.

S., at 281\u2013282 (To make out a Brady viola-\r\ntion, \u201c[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the\r\naccused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\r\nimpeaching\u201d).\r\n                              D\r\n   Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and ma-\r\nterial undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert\r\nTrackling, a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse\u201d street gang\r\nwith which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric\r\nRogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.\r\n5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an\r\ninterview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which\r\nhe described a conversation that he had with Trackling\r\nwhile in prison. During that conversation, Trackling\r\ndescribed the murders at Espadron\u2019s home and stated that\r\nhe had committed the crime along with \u201cFat, Buckle, and\r\na guy they call uh, Short Dog.\u201d Id., at 841. According to\r\nRogers, Fat\u2019s real name was \u201cDarnell [Donielle] Banister,\u201d\r\nBuckle\u2019s real name was \u201cContez [Kintad] Phillips,\u201d and\r\nShort Dog\u2019s real name was \u201cJuan.\u201d Id., at 843\u2013844.\r\n   Smith contends that Rogers\u2019 interview was exculpatory\r\nin two respects. First, he points to the following comment\r\nby Rogers later during the interview: \u201cThey call Contez\r\nPhilip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog\r\nthat\u2019s what they call him, they call Robert Home.\u201d Id., at\r\n845. Smith suggests that Rogers\u2019 prior identification of\r\n\u201cShort Dog\u201d as \u201cJuan [Smith]\u201d was equivocal in light of his\r\nlater statement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d was a man named \u201cRob-\r\nert Home.\u201d Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that\r\ndisclosure of Rogers\u2019 interview would have led the defense\r\nand the jury to learn of Rogers\u2019 allegation\u2014made for the\r\nfirst time 10 years after Smith\u2019s trial\u2014that the police had\r\nasked him to implicate Juan Smith as \u201cShort Dog,\u201d Tr.\r\n284\u2013285 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n   Neither argument is persuasive.

Id., at 832; see also id., at\r\n854\u2013855. Trackling\u2019s statement only strengthens the\r\ninculpatory nature of Rogers\u2019 interview.\r\n  Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed\r\nSmith\u2019s suggestion that Rogers identified \u201cShort Dog\u201d as a\r\nman named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d When this statement is taken\r\nin context, it appears that Rogers was describing the\r\nnickname\u2014\u201cHome\u201d9\u2014of Robert Trackling, the \u201cRobert\u201d\r\nwhom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his\r\ninterview. See id., at 839\u2013850. Indeed, Rogers\u2019 phrase-\r\nology, \u201cthey call Robert Home,\u201d was consistent with his pre-\r\nvious comments that \u201c[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,\u201d\r\nand \u201cthey call Darnell Banister Fat.\u201d Id., at 845 (emphasis\r\nadded).

Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009).

Smith contends that this note is\r\nexculpatory in that it suggests that he was \u201cnot involved\u201d\r\nin the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.\r\n  Young\u2019s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes\r\n(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, \u201cShort Dog\u201d\r\nand a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse.\u201d Such a conces-\r\nsion would only have strengthened the inculpatory value\r\nof the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that\r\nSmith was the \u201cShort Dog\u201d who committed the murders at\r\nEspadron\u2019s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of\r\nthe note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is\r\nunclear whether Ronquillo\u2019s note reflects a statement by\r\nYoung that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not responsible for shooting\r\nthe victims or a statement that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not re-\r\nsponsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that\r\n\u201cShort Dog\u201d and others were not with Young when he went\r\nto the house is certainly not a clear statement that \u201cShort\r\nDog\u201d did not commit the murders, especially in light of\r\nevidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on\r\n18                         SMITH v.

Accordingly,\r\nRonquillo explained, \u201cI never had hide nor hair actually of\r\nwhat [Young] said.\u201d Id., at 423.\r\n   The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo\u2019s note, of\r\nunclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop\r\nof doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communi-\r\ncated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence\r\nagainst the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner\u2019s de-\r\nscriptions and identifications and Rogers\u2019 and Trackling\u2019s\r\nstatements, which corroborated Boatner\u2019s identification.\r\nWhen all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it\r\nmust be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability\r\nthat the jury would have reached a different verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  11 In his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car\r\nthat arrived at Espadron\u2019s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers\u2019\r\ninterview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from\r\nEspadron\u2019s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.\r\n   12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undis-\r\n\r\nclosed note to impeach Ronquillo\u2019s trial testimony that Young was not\r\nable to communicate with him \u201cat all.\u201d That argument lacks merit.\r\nRonquillo\u2019s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that\r\nno communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he\r\nsimply \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand anything that [Young] was saying.\u201d See Tr.\r\n103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with\r\nthe garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,\r\nif any, impeachment value.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Rather, the question is whether the cu-\r\nmulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence\r\nin Smith\u2019s case \u201cput[s] the whole case in such a different\r\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles,\r\n514 U.

When, as in this case, the Court departs\r\nfrom its usual practice of declining to review alleged mis-\r\napplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456\r\n(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and\r\nTHOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consid-\r\ner all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not\r\ndecline to review all of the facts on the assumption that\r\nthe remainder of the record would only further support\r\nSmith\u2019s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.\r\nAnte, at 3\u20134.\r\n   Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the\r\nrecord evidence confirms that, from the night of the mur-\r\nders through trial, Boatner consistently described\u2014with\r\none understandable exception\u2014the first perpetrator\r\nthrough the door, that Boatner\u2019s description matched\r\nSmith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-\r\ncourt identifications implicating Smith. Some of the un-\r\ndisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him\r\nat all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa-\r\ntory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because\r\nwhat remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment\r\nand exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the\r\nwhole record, I must dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that\r\nthe State violated Brady.\r\n",

Smith argued that the\r\n  prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.\r\n  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State\r\n  from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and mate-\r\n  rial to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state\r\n  trial court rejected Smith\u2019s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\n  Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.\r\nHeld: Brady requires that Smith\u2019s conviction be reversed. The State\r\n does not dispute that the eyewitness\u2019s statements were favorable to\r\n Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under\r\n Brady, evidence is material if there is a \u201creasonable probability that,\r\n had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\r\n have been different.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469\u2013470.

CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npolice investigation of his case, including those of the lead\r\ninvestigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo\u2019s notes\r\ncontain statements by Boatner that conflict with his tes-\r\ntimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from\r\nthe night of the murder state that Boatner \u201ccould not . . .\r\nsupply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]\r\nthey were black males.\u201d App. 252\u2013253. Ronquillo also\r\nmade a handwritten account of a conversation he had with\r\nBoatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said\r\nhe \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d\r\nand \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d Id., at 308.\r\nAnd Ronquillo\u2019s typewritten report of that conversation\r\nstates that Boatner told Ronquillo he \u201ccould not identify\r\nany of the perpetrators of the murder.\u201d Id., at 259\u2013260.\r\n  Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,\r\ninter alia, that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Ron-\r\nquillo\u2019s notes violated this Court\u2019s decision in Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court re-\r\njected Smith\u2019s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\nAppeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We\r\ngranted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.\r\n  Under Brady, the State violates a defendant\u2019s right to\r\ndue process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the\r\ndefense and material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punish-\r\nment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute\r\nthat Boatner\u2019s statements in Ronquillo\u2019s notes were fa-\r\nvorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis-\r\nclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether\r\nBoatner\u2019s statements were material to the determination\r\nof Smith\u2019s guilt. We have explained that \u201cevidence is\r\n\u2018material\u2019 within the meaning of Brady when there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-\r\nclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been dif-\r\nferent.\u201d Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469\u2013470 (2009). A\r\nreasonable probability does not mean that the defendant\r\n\u201cwould more likely than not have received a different\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Whitley, 514 U. S.\r\n419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewit-\r\nness may not be material if the State\u2019s other evidence is\r\nstrong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See\r\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112\u2013113, and n. 21\r\n(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner\u2019s testimony\r\nwas the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And\r\nBoatner\u2019s undisclosed statements directly contradict his\r\ntestimony: Boatner told the jury that he had \u201c[n]o doubt\u201d\r\nthat Smith was the gunman he stood \u201cface to face\u201d with on\r\nthe night of the crime, but Ronquillo\u2019s notes show Boatner\r\nsaying that he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t\r\nsee faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them.\u201d\r\nApp. 196, 200, 308. Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements\r\nwere plainly material.\r\n   The State and the dissent advance various reasons why\r\nthe jury might have discounted Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made\r\nother remarks on the night of the murder indicating that\r\nhe could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but\r\nnot the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about\r\nwhich of Boatner\u2019s contradictory declarations the jury\r\nwould have believed. The State also contends that Boat-\r\nner\u2019s statements made five days after the crime can be\r\nexplained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the\r\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the\r\nState\u2019s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so.\r\n   The police files that Smith obtained in state postconvic-\r\ntion proceedings contain other evidence that Smith con-\r\ntends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.\r\nBecause we hold that Boatner\u2019s undisclosed statements\r\n4                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith\u2019s convic-\r\ntion, we have no need to consider his arguments that the\r\nother undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under\r\nBrady.\r\n   The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District\r\nCourt of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several\r\nfriends gathered at Rebe Espadron\u2019s home in New Or-\r\nleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in\r\nthe kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car\r\nwithout a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen\u2019s\r\noutside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed\r\n2                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntheir way through the door, demanding drugs and money.\r\nTr. 153\u2013154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door\r\nput a gun in Boatner\u2019s face and pushed him backwards.\r\nId., at 154\u2013155. The men initially ordered Boatner and\r\nhis friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand\r\nup. At that time, the man who had been the first one\r\nthrough the door placed his gun under Boatner\u2019s chin. Id.,\r\nat 156\u2013157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted\r\nhim to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the\r\nhead with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.\r\nId., at 157\u2013158.\r\n   After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a\r\nback bedroom, where she had been when the men entered\r\nthe house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to\r\nthe kitchen, a man with a \u201ccovering\u201d over his mouth point-\r\ned his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at\r\n70\u201371. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back\r\ntoward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened\r\nfire. Id., at 71\u201372, 159.\r\n   When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A\r\nfifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally\r\nwounded and died later at the hospital. Of those original-\r\nly gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,\r\nwho suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first\r\nman\u2019s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who\r\nescaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had re-\r\nmained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police\r\nalso found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.\r\nYoung was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the\r\nhead. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never\r\nseen Young before, the police surmised that Young had\r\nbeen one of the perpetrators.1\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was\r\n\r\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

He testified at trial\r\nthat he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espa-\r\ndron\u2019s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the\r\nlaceration to his head. According to Narcisse, \u201cMr. Boat-\r\nner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.\u201d\r\nId., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that\r\nBoatner \u201chad a description\u201d of the person that he saw, the\r\ndetails of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.\r\n   Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the\r\nshootings, testified that Boatner had described the first\r\nman through the kitchen door as having a \u201cshort-type\r\nhaircut,\u201d \u201ca lot of golds in his teeth,\u201d and \u201cbrown-ski[n].\u201d2\r\nId., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that\r\nBoatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that\r\nBoatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the\r\nman initially came through the door and again when\r\nBoatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun\r\nto his chin. Id., at 117\u2013118.\r\n   Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months\r\nfollowing the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person\r\nphotograph arrays of potential suspects\u2014only one of\r\nwhich contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89\u2013100. Three\r\nweeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with\r\none of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.\r\nRonquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the\r\narray had a \u201csimilar haircut\u201d and \u201ca similar expression on\r\nhis face\u201d as the \u201cgentleman that came into the house\r\ninitially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,\u201d but that\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nas a result of being shot. 1 Record 49.\r\n  2 \u201cGolds\u201d are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to\r\n\r\nas \u201cgrills.\u201d See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South\r\nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p. 5, 2007 WLNR 2187080.

A few months later, Ronquillo\r\npresented Boatner with the array that included a photo-\r\ngraph of Smith. Tr. 99\u2013101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo\r\ntestified that Boatner identified Smith \u201cimmediately,\u201d\r\nstating, \u201c \u2018This is it. I\u2019ll never forget that face.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\r\n100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith\u2019s\r\nphotograph was the only one that Boatner identified.\r\n   Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to\r\nthe stand during Smith\u2019s trial. Boatner testified that\r\nSmith\u2019s face was the \u201c[s]ame face,\u201d id., at 174, and that\r\nSmith\u2019s mouth was the \u201c[s]ame mouth\u201d \u201cfull of gold,\u201d ibid.,\r\nas that of the first man who came through the kitchen\r\ndoor on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that\r\nSmith\u2019s hair at trial was \u201cshaved on the sides\u201d as it was\r\nduring the crime, but that \u201cthe top was a little bit lower\u201d\r\nat the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain-\r\ned that, during the attack, he had focused on the first\r\nman through the door\u2014who was unmasked\u2014but that he\r\n\u201cdidn\u2019t notice\u201d the faces of any of the other assailants or\r\nwhether they were masked. Id., at 154. On cross-\r\nexamination, Boatner testified that he had described the\r\nfirst man\u2019s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the\r\npolice. Id., at 178.\r\n   Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-\r\ndegree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,\r\nSmith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.\r\nSmith argued that the State had failed to disclose various\r\npolice notes revealing favorable evidence material to\r\nSmith\u2019s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-\r\ntrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita\r\nRussell and Espadron\u2019s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial\r\nstatement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; state-\r\nments by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling\u2019s\r\nfellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect\r\nPhillip Young.

In my\r\nview, Smith has not established a reasonable probability\r\nthat the cumulative effect of this evidence would have\r\ncaused the jury to change its verdict.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by\r\nBoatner, which the Court concludes are \u201cplainly material.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nconversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that\r\nBoatner \u201ccould not . . . supply a description of the perpe-\r\ntrators other th[a]n they were black males.\u201d 5 Record 809.\r\nSecond, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nphone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five\r\ndays after the murders, states that \u201cBoatner . . . could not\r\nID anyone because couldn\u2019t see faces . . . glanced at 1st\r\none\u2014saw man\u2014through door\u2014can\u2019t tell if had\u2014faces\r\ncovered didn\u2019t see anyone . . . Could not ID\u2014would not\r\nknow them if\u2014I saw them.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo\u2019s\r\ntyped summary of this note states that Boatner advised\r\nhim that he \u201ccould not identify any perpetrators of the\r\nmurder.\u201d 5 id., at 817.\r\n  Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could\r\nhave been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during\r\ncross-examination. But the statements are not material\r\nfor purposes of Brady because they cannot \u201creasonably be\r\ntaken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\r\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles, 514 U. S., at\r\n435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that\r\nBoatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,\r\noffered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occa-\r\nsions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed\r\n6                            SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatements do not warrant a new trial.\r\n  The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo\u2019s\r\non-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpe-\r\ntrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner\r\nprovided him with a description of the perpetrator that\r\nBoatner saw. Narcisse\u2019s testimony thus corroborated\r\nBoatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw the first man and\r\ndescribed him to police.3 Narcisse\u2019s testimony also miti-\r\ngated the impeachment value of Ronquillo\u2019s on-scene note\r\nby indicating that, although Boatner may have provided\r\nno detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner\r\nhad described the first man to another officer.4\r\n  In any event, Ronquillo\u2019s notes reflect that Boatner\r\nprovided a description of the first perpetrator at the police\r\nstation only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.\r\n403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could \u201cde-\r\nscribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.\u201d 5\r\nRecord 866. He responded: \u201cI can tell you about one, the\r\none who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male\r\nwith a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complex-\r\nion, brown skinned.\u201d Ibid. When asked, \u201c[Y]ou say you\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n    3 Ina pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he \u201cgave a description\r\nto the officer that came to the scene.\u201d Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner\r\nresponded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective\r\nRonquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that\r\nthe first man through the door was \u201cheavy built with his hair with a\r\nfade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.\u201d Ibid.\r\nThat testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and\r\nOfficer Narcisse gave at trial.\r\n  4 Moreover, Boatner\u2019s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the\r\n\r\ncrime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postcon-\r\nviction hearing, \u201cthere were dead bodies everywhere,\u201d and Boatner was\r\n\u201ca little shook up.\u201d Id., at 402\u2013403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse\r\ntestified at trial that Boatner, while \u201cnot as frantic\u201d as Espadron, was a\r\n\u201cbit emotional\u201d when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34\r\n(Dec. 4, 1995).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

In his brief, Smith\r\ncites this station house statement as an example of favor-\r\nable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually\r\ncorroborates Boatner\u2019s trial testimony that he saw and\r\ndescribed the first perpetrator to police and that he did not\r\nget a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the\r\ndescription Boatner provided was consistent with Smith\u2019s\r\nappearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner\u2019s\r\nstation house statement, but our cases instruct us to\r\nevaluate \u201cthe net effect of the evidence withheld by the\r\nState\u201d in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421\u2013\r\n422.\r\n   The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the\r\nfirst perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the\r\ncrime, but also that Boatner described him again three\r\nweeks later when he viewed a photograph array and elim-\r\ninated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before\r\nthe jury further indicated that, several months after the\r\ncrime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,\r\nafter evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month\r\ninvestigative period. What is more, the reliability of\r\nBoatner\u2019s out-of-court identification was extensively tested\r\nduring cross-examination at Smith\u2019s trial. In particular,\r\nBoatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith\u2019s\r\npicture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect\r\nhad tainted his identification.

That Boatner credibly rejected defense\r\ncounsel\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d theory is supported by the fact that\r\nBoatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling\u2014\r\nwhose photograph was included in a separate array shown\r\nto Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified\r\n8                      SMITH v.

As an initial matter, Ronquillo\u2019s note of his March\r\n6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contra-\r\ndiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although\r\nthe note states that Boatner \u201cdidn\u2019t see anyone,\u201d it also\r\nstates that Boatner \u201cglanced at 1st one\u2014saw man\u2014\r\nthrough door.\u201d 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is con-\r\nsistent with Boatner\u2019s repeated statements that he only\r\nsaw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury\r\nwould have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner\u2019s\r\nstatement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five\r\ndays after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators\r\nwere still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-\r\nner\u2019s trial testimony that, following the murders of his\r\nfriends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleep-\r\ning, quit his job, and began drinking heavily\u2014so much so\r\nthat he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treat-\r\nment and grief counseling. Tr. 162\u2013163, 170\u2013171, 182\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6\r\nnote would have been further mitigated by the fact that,\r\nas Ronquillo explained, \u201con the night of the incident\r\n[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he\r\ngave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith\u2019s\r\ndescription.\u201d Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following\r\nhis March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed\r\nnumerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetra-\r\ntor, and ultimately identified him as Smith.\r\n   Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo\u2019s\r\nnotes of Boatner\u2019s on-scene and March 6 statements, it\r\nmight have believed that Boatner could not identify any of\r\nthe perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is\r\ninsufficient to establish a Brady violation.

But Smith\r\nis not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury\r\ncould have accorded some weight to Boatner\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatements.

Tr. 415\u2013418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will\r\nassume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it\r\nwould have been admissible at Smith\u2019s trial as a dying\r\ndeclaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had\r\nminimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith\u2019s\r\nassertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which\r\nthe statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that\r\nRussell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in\r\n\u201cbad condition.\u201d Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995).

And, although Smith\r\ncontends that the note says \u201cexactly\u201d that the \u201cfirst person\r\nthrough the door had a black cloth across his face,\u201d that\r\nis not how the note reads.

It is at\r\nleast as logical to read this statement as indicating only\r\nthat \u201cone\u201d of the \u201cpeople\u201d had a \u201cblack cloth across [his]\r\nface.\u201d Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing\r\nfurther after \u201cfirst one through door,\u201d and it is impossible\r\nto know whether the \u201cfirst one\u201d was also the \u201cone\u201d with a\r\n\u201cblack cloth across [his] face.\u201d\r\n  The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale\r\nMims, who lived down the street from Espadron\u2019s home\r\nand who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states\r\nthat Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron\u2019s home, \u201call\r\nwearing mask[s].\u201d Id., at 2518. Like Russell\u2019s purported\r\nstatement, this statement has minimal impeachment\r\nvalue in light of the record. Mims\u2019 undisclosed statement\r\ndoes not address whether some or all of the perpetrators\r\nwere masked inside Espadron\u2019s home.7 Moreover, had\r\nMims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably\r\nwould have testified, as he did at the postconviction hear-\r\ning, that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that he only saw three perpe-\r\ntrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were\r\nmasked. Tr. 269, 271\u2013273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n  Both Russell\u2019s purported statement and Mims\u2019 testimo-\r\nny are consistent with Boatner\u2019s testimony that he did not\r\nknow whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,\r\nid., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse\u2019s and\r\nEspadron\u2019s testimony that the single perpetrator whom\r\nEspadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover-\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  7 Smith ridicules the \u201cexceedingly peculiar\u201d notion that the perpetra-\r\n\r\ntors would have remained unmasked inside Espadron\u2019s home, only to\r\nmask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12\u201313. But that\r\nnotion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre\r\nthe witnesses who were inside the home\u2014as they did\u2014and were\r\nconcerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who\r\nmight see or hear the burglary.\r\n12                     SMITH v.

The\r\nnote states that \u201cLeary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM\r\nammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]\r\nwas typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], \u2018Mac[-]\r\n11\u2019 model type, semi automatic weapon.\u201d 5 Record 831.\r\nAccording to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary\u2019s\r\ntrial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found\r\nat the scene \u201cwas fired by one particular weapon, one 9-\r\nmillimeter handgun,\u201d Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an\r\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a \u201chandgun.\u201d Smith fur-\r\nther argues that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement could have\r\nbeen used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution\r\nattempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that\r\nShelita Russell\u2019s wounds could have been inflicted by a\r\n9-millimeter \u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by\r\ncalling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under\r\nhis chin was a 9-millimeter silver \u201chand gun,\u201d id., at 157\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995).\r\n   Contrary to Smith\u2019s contentions, Leary\u2019s pretrial state-\r\nment does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.\r\nLeary\u2019s pretrial statement is consistent with his and\r\nBoatner\u2019s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11\r\npistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that\r\nsuch a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for\r\nPetitioner 48. Moreover, a \u201chandgun\u201d is simply \u201c[a] fire-\r\narm that can be used with one hand,\u201d American Heritage\r\nDictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

But even assuming that\r\nSmith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms\r\nexpert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather\r\nthan technical terminology.8\r\n  The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used\r\nthe term \u201chandgun,\u201d he did not understand it to exclude\r\nautomatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the im-\r\nmediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,\r\nBoatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a \u201cMa[c]\r\n10\u201d or \u201cTech Nine\u201d \u201cUzi\u201d type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that\r\nweapon as a \u201chandgun,\u201d id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner\u2019s\r\npretrial description of the silver or chrome \u201chandgun\u201d that\r\nthe first man held was consistent with Leary\u2019s undisclosed\r\nstatement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammu-\r\nnition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In\r\nhis station house statement, Boatner described the first\r\nman\u2019s weapon as a \u201cbig,\u201d \u201cautomatic pistol.\u201d Id., at 813,\r\n866. Because Leary\u2019s pretrial statement is neither im-\r\npeaching nor exculpatory, Leary\u2019s undisclosed statement\r\ncannot form the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler,\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  8 Smith argues that Leary himself considered an \u201c[Intratec] or \u2018Mac[-]\r\n11\u2019 \u201d model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith\r\nrelies on the fact that Leary\u2019s pretrial statement indicated that the\r\nammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun\r\nrecovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.\r\nId., at 18. Leary\u2019s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun\r\nrecovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith\u2019s repre-\r\nsentation. More importantly, Leary\u2019s statement suggests only that\r\nBannister\u2019s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at\r\nthe scene, not that Leary did not consider an \u201c[Intratec] or \u2018Mac[-]11\u2019 \u201d\r\nmodel type to be a handgun.\r\n14                     SMITH v.

S., at 281\u2013282 (To make out a Brady viola-\r\ntion, \u201c[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the\r\naccused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\r\nimpeaching\u201d).\r\n                              D\r\n   Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and ma-\r\nterial undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert\r\nTrackling, a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse\u201d street gang\r\nwith which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric\r\nRogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.\r\n5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an\r\ninterview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which\r\nhe described a conversation that he had with Trackling\r\nwhile in prison. During that conversation, Trackling\r\ndescribed the murders at Espadron\u2019s home and stated that\r\nhe had committed the crime along with \u201cFat, Buckle, and\r\na guy they call uh, Short Dog.\u201d Id., at 841. According to\r\nRogers, Fat\u2019s real name was \u201cDarnell [Donielle] Banister,\u201d\r\nBuckle\u2019s real name was \u201cContez [Kintad] Phillips,\u201d and\r\nShort Dog\u2019s real name was \u201cJuan.\u201d Id., at 843\u2013844.\r\n   Smith contends that Rogers\u2019 interview was exculpatory\r\nin two respects. First, he points to the following comment\r\nby Rogers later during the interview: \u201cThey call Contez\r\nPhilip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog\r\nthat\u2019s what they call him, they call Robert Home.\u201d Id., at\r\n845. Smith suggests that Rogers\u2019 prior identification of\r\n\u201cShort Dog\u201d as \u201cJuan [Smith]\u201d was equivocal in light of his\r\nlater statement that \u201cShort Dog\u201d was a man named \u201cRob-\r\nert Home.\u201d Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that\r\ndisclosure of Rogers\u2019 interview would have led the defense\r\nand the jury to learn of Rogers\u2019 allegation\u2014made for the\r\nfirst time 10 years after Smith\u2019s trial\u2014that the police had\r\nasked him to implicate Juan Smith as \u201cShort Dog,\u201d Tr.\r\n284\u2013285 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n   Neither argument is persuasive.

Id., at 832; see also id., at\r\n854\u2013855. Trackling\u2019s statement only strengthens the\r\ninculpatory nature of Rogers\u2019 interview.\r\n  Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed\r\nSmith\u2019s suggestion that Rogers identified \u201cShort Dog\u201d as a\r\nman named \u201cRobert Home.\u201d When this statement is taken\r\nin context, it appears that Rogers was describing the\r\nnickname\u2014\u201cHome\u201d9\u2014of Robert Trackling, the \u201cRobert\u201d\r\nwhom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his\r\ninterview. See id., at 839\u2013850. Indeed, Rogers\u2019 phrase-\r\nology, \u201cthey call Robert Home,\u201d was consistent with his pre-\r\nvious comments that \u201c[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,\u201d\r\nand \u201cthey call Darnell Banister Fat.\u201d Id., at 845 (emphasis\r\nadded).

Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On\r\nthis record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and\r\nTrackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confi-\r\ndence in the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.10\r\n                            E\r\n  Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten\r\nnote by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip\r\nYoung\u2014the man found injured at the scene and suspected\r\nof having participated in the crime\u2014is also material evi-\r\ndence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified\r\nthat he met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a\r\nresult of permanent brain damage suffered in the shoot-\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  10 Detective Byron Adams, who took Rogers\u2019 statement, did not testify\r\n\r\nat the postconviction hearing because he had died in the meantime. He\r\nthus had no opportunity to address Rogers\u2019 recantation or his newly\r\nminted allegation that Detective Adams asked Rogers to implicate\r\nSmith. Smith argues that \u201cthere is no reason to believe that . . . Adams\r\nwould have contradicted Rogers\u2014much less that the jury would have\r\nbelieved [him] if [he] did.\u201d Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no support\r\nfor his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have admitted to\r\nframing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the allegation, the jury\r\nwould have believed Rogers\u2014a convicted murderer who never ex-\r\nplained any motive Adams would have had to frame Smith\u2014over the\r\ndetective.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nings. Id., at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo,\r\nYoung \u201cwas strapped to a chair. He really couldn\u2019t talk,\r\n[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.\r\nHe couldn\u2019t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube\r\nby the people there. He was in really bad shape.\u201d Id., at\r\n102\u2013103. When asked whether Young was able to com-\r\nmunicate with him \u201cat all,\u201d Ronquillo responded, \u201cNo. I\r\ncouldn\u2019t understand anything that he was saying.\u201d Id., at\r\n103.\r\n  The undisclosed note from Ronquillo\u2019s meeting with\r\nYoung reads as follows: \u201cShort Dog/Bucko/Fats\u2014No\u2014\r\nDidn\u2019t shoot me\u2014No\u2014Not with me when went to house\u2014\r\nYes\u2014one of people in house shot me\u2014No\u2014Not responsi-\r\nble\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Didn\u2019t drive to house\u2014\u2018Posse\u2019\u2014Yes\u2014Knows\r\nnames of perps\u2014Yes\u2014Drove in car\u2014Yes\u2014girlfriend\u2019s\r\ncar.\u201d 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is\r\nexculpatory in that it suggests that he was \u201cnot involved\u201d\r\nin the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.\r\n  Young\u2019s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes\r\n(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, \u201cShort Dog\u201d\r\nand a member of the \u201cCut Throat Posse.\u201d Such a conces-\r\nsion would only have strengthened the inculpatory value\r\nof the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that\r\nSmith was the \u201cShort Dog\u201d who committed the murders at\r\nEspadron\u2019s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of\r\nthe note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is\r\nunclear whether Ronquillo\u2019s note reflects a statement by\r\nYoung that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not responsible for shooting\r\nthe victims or a statement that the \u201cPosse\u201d was not re-\r\nsponsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that\r\n\u201cShort Dog\u201d and others were not with Young when he went\r\nto the house is certainly not a clear statement that \u201cShort\r\nDog\u201d did not commit the murders, especially in light of\r\nevidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on\r\n18                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe night of the murders.11 Second, had the jury learned\r\nof Ronquillo\u2019s note, it would have presumably heard Ron-\r\nquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that\r\nhe was not even sure whether his note actually reflected\r\nstatements by Young, given that Young \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d\r\nwas \u201cjumbled,\u201d could only \u201ckind of move his head,\u201d and\r\nsometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked\r\na question.12 Tr. 423\u2013424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly,\r\nRonquillo explained, \u201cI never had hide nor hair actually of\r\nwhat [Young] said.\u201d Id., at 423.\r\n   The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo\u2019s note, of\r\nunclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop\r\nof doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communi-\r\ncated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence\r\nagainst the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner\u2019s de-\r\nscriptions and identifications and Rogers\u2019 and Trackling\u2019s\r\nstatements, which corroborated Boatner\u2019s identification.\r\nWhen all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it\r\nmust be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability\r\nthat the jury would have reached a different verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  11 In his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car\r\nthat arrived at Espadron\u2019s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers\u2019\r\ninterview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from\r\nEspadron\u2019s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.\r\n   12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undis-\r\n\r\nclosed note to impeach Ronquillo\u2019s trial testimony that Young was not\r\nable to communicate with him \u201cat all.\u201d That argument lacks merit.\r\nRonquillo\u2019s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that\r\nno communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he\r\nsimply \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand anything that [Young] was saying.\u201d See Tr.\r\n103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with\r\nthe garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,\r\nif any, impeachment value.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n                        *      *    *\r\n   The question presented here is not whether a prudent\r\nprosecutor should have disclosed the information that\r\nSmith identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cu-\r\nmulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence\r\nin Smith\u2019s case \u201cput[s] the whole case in such a different\r\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles,\r\n514 U. S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court departs\r\nfrom its usual practice of declining to review alleged mis-\r\napplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456\r\n(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and\r\nTHOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consid-\r\ner all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not\r\ndecline to review all of the facts on the assumption that\r\nthe remainder of the record would only further support\r\nSmith\u2019s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.\r\nAnte, at 3\u20134.\r\n   Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the\r\nrecord evidence confirms that, from the night of the mur-\r\nders through trial, Boatner consistently described\u2014with\r\none understandable exception\u2014the first perpetrator\r\nthrough the door, that Boatner\u2019s description matched\r\nSmith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-\r\ncourt identifications implicating Smith. Some of the un-\r\ndisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him\r\nat all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa-\r\ntory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because\r\nwhat remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment\r\nand exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the\r\nwhole record, I must dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that\r\nthe State violated Brady.\r\n</pre>",
