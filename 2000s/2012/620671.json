NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n No. 10–8974. Argued November 2, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012\nAround 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, the Nashua, New Hampshire Police\n  Department received a call reporting that an African-American male\n  was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of the caller’s apart-\n  ment building. When an officer responding to the call asked eyewit-\n  ness Nubia Blandon to describe the man, Blandon pointed to her\n  kitchen window and said the man she saw breaking into the car was\n  standing in the parking lot, next to a police officer. Petitioner Barion\n  Perry’s arrest followed this identification.\n     Before trial, Perry moved to suppress Blandon’s identification on\n  the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process. The\n  New Hampshire trial court denied the motion. To determine whether\n  due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification\n  at trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a two-\n  step inquiry: The trial court must first decide whether the police used\n  an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure; if they did, the\n  court must next consider whether that procedure so tainted the re-\n  sulting identification as to render it unreliable and thus inadmissi-\n  ble. Perry’s challenge, the court found, failed at step one, for Blan-\n  don’s identification did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive\n  procedure employed by the police. A jury subsequently convicted\n  Perry of theft by unauthorized taking.\n     On appeal, Perry argued that the trial court erred in requiring an\n  initial showing that police arranged a suggestive identification pro-\n  cedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry contended, suffice to\n  require court evaluation of the reliability of an eyewitness identifica-\n  tion before allowing it to be presented to the jury. The New Hamp-\n  shire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s argument and affirmed his\n  conviction.\n  Held: The Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial\n2                      PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the\n    identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive cir-\n    cumstances arranged by law enforcement. Pp. 6–19.\n       (a) The Constitution protects a defendant against a conviction\n    based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting in-\n    troduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to\n    persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unwor-\n    thy of credit. Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair that its\n    admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,” Dowling v.\n    United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (internal quotation marks omitted),\n    does the Due Process Clause preclude its admission.\n       Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry\n    relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification\n    procedures. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293; Simmons v. United\n    States, 390 U. S. 377; Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440; Neil v. Big-\n    gers, 409 U. S. 188; and Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98. These\n    cases detail the approach appropriately used to determine whether\n    due process requires suppression of an eyewitness identification\n    tainted by police arrangement. First, due process concerns arise only\n    when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is\n    both suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409 U. S.,\n    at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure, however, sup-\n    pression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable conse-\n    quence. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at\n    198–199. Instead, due process requires courts to assess, on a case-by-\n    case basis, whether improper police conduct created a “substantial\n    likelihood of misidentification.” Id., at 201. “[R]eliability [of the eye-\n    witness identification] is the linchpin” of that evaluation.\n    Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a witness’]\n    ability to make an accurate identification” are “outweighed by the\n    corrupting effect” of law enforcement suggestion, the identification\n    should be suppressed. Id., at 114, 116. Otherwise, the identification,\n    assuming no other barrier to its admission, should be submitted to\n    the jury. Pp. 6–10.\n       (b) Perry argues that it was mere happenstance that all of the cas-\n    es in the Stovall line involved improper police action. The rationale\n    underlying this Court’s decisions, Perry asserts, calls for a rule re-\n    quiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability\n    any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances.\n    This Court disagrees.\n       If “reliability is the linchpin” of admissibility under the Due Pro-\n    cess Clause, Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114, Perry contends, it should\n    not matter whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the\n    suggestive circumstances that marred the identification. This argu-\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nment removes Brathwaite’s statement from its mooring, attributing\nto it a meaning that a fair reading of the opinion does not bear. The\ndue process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into\nplay only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.\n   Perry’s contention also ignores a key premise of Brathwaite: A pri-\nmary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnec-\nessarily suggestive circumstances is to deter law enforcement use of\nimproper procedures in the first place. This deterrence rationale is\ninapposite in cases, like Perry’s, where there is no improper police\nconduct. Perry also places significant weight on United States v.\nWade, 388 U. S. 218, describing it as a decision not anchored to im-\nproper police conduct. But the risk of police rigging was the very\ndanger that prompted the Court in Wade to extend a defendant’s\nright to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.\n   Perry’s position would also open the door to judicial preview, under\nthe banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifica-\ntions. There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewit-\nness with poor vision or one who harbors a grudge against the de-\nfendant, for example, should be regarded as inherently more reliable\nthan Blandon’s identification here. Even if this Court could, as Perry\ncontends, distinguish “suggestive circumstances” from other factors\nbearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation\nwould still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examina-\ntions, for most eyewitness identifications involve some element of\nsuggestion. Pp. 10–14.\n   (c) In urging a broadly applicable rule, Perry maintains that eye-\nwitness identifications are uniquely unreliable. The fallibility of\neyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state\nconduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen\nthe evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its cre-\nditworthiness. The Court’s unwillingness to adopt such a rule rests,\nin large part, on its recognition that the jury, not the judge, tradi-\ntionally determines the reliability of evidence. It also takes account\nof other safeguards built into the adversary system that caution ju-\nries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of ques-\ntionable reliability. These protections include the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment rights to counsel and to confront and cross-examine the\neyewitness, eyewitness-specific instructions warning juries to take\ncare in appraising identification evidence, and state and federal rules\nof evidence permitting trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact\nor potential for misleading the jury. Many of these safeguards were\navailed of by Perry’s defense. Given the safeguards generally appli-\ncable in criminal trials, the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness tes-\n4                     PERRY v.

NEW HAMPSHIRE\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                    NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                               [January 11, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In our system of justice, fair trial for persons charged\nwith criminal offenses is secured by the Sixth Amend-\nment, which guarantees to defendants the right to counsel,\ncompulsory process to obtain defense witnesses, and the\nopportunity to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecu-\ntion. Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in\nstate trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the\nreliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the\nprovince of the jury to determine. This Court has recog-\nnized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of\neyewitness identification, applicable when the police have\narranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to\nidentify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.\n   An identification infected by improper police influence,\nour case law holds, is not automatically excluded. Instead,\nthe trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability\npretrial. If there is “a very substantial likelihood of irrep-\narable misidentification,” Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 384 (1968), the judge must disallow presenta-\ntion of the evidence at trial. But if the indicia of reliability\nare strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the\n2                   PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npolice-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identifica-\ntion evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will\nultimately determine its worth.\n   We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability\nto cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not\narranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests\nthat we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken\nidentification will yield a miscarriage of justice.1 Our\ndecisions, however, turn on the presence of state action\nand aim to deter police from rigging identification proce-\ndures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph\narray. When no improper law enforcement activity is\ninvolved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the\nrights and opportunities generally designed for that pur-\npose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment\nlineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evi-\ndence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of\neyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                         I\n                         A\n  Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, Joffre Ullon called\nthe Nashua, New Hampshire, Police Department and\n\n——————\n   1 The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances\n\nraise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See post, at 6,\n9, 14–17. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single\ncase in which we have required pretrial screening absent a police-\narranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no\nsuch cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the\npolice arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a\n“longstanding rule,” post, at 6, that never existed. Nor are we, as the\ndissent suggests, imposing a mens rea requirement, post, at 1, 7, or\notherwise altering our precedent in any way. As our case law makes\nclear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unneces-\nsarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended\nthe arranged procedure to be suggestive.\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreported that an African-American male was trying to\nbreak into cars parked in the lot of Ullon’s apartment\nbuilding. Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon\narriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what “sounded like\na metal bat hitting the ground.” App. 37a–38a. She then\nsaw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.\nPerry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifi-\ners in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind\nhim. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.\n“[I] found them on the ground,” Perry responded. Id.,\nat 39a.\n   Meanwhile, Ullon’s wife, Nubia Blandon, woke her\nneighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen\nsomeone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went\ndownstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first\nobserved that one of the rear windows had been shattered.\nOn further inspection, he discovered that the speakers\nand amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were\nhis bat and wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and\ntold her about Blandon’s alert and his own subsequent\nobservations.\n   By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene.\nClay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that\nofficer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.\nClay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building\nand took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon’s and\nClavijo’s apartments were located. They met Blandon in\nthe hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.\n   Asked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated\nthat, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a\ntall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and\nlooking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo’s\ncar, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.2\n——————\n  2 The box, which Clay found on the ground near where she first en-\n\ncountered Perry, contained car-stereo speakers. App. 177a–178a.\n4                   PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Clay asked Blandon for a more specific description of the\nman. Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the\nperson she saw breaking into Clavijo’s car was standing in\nthe parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry’s arrest\nfollowed this identification.\n   About a month later, the police showed Blandon a pho-\ntographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked\nher to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo’s car.\nBlandon was unable to identify Perry.\n                              B\n   Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with\none count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of\ncriminal mischief.3 Before trial, he moved to suppress\nBlandon’s identification on the ground that admitting it at\ntrial would violate due process. Blandon witnessed what\namounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot,\nPerry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would\nidentify him as the culprit. Id., at 15a–16a.\n   The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion.\nId., at 82a–88a. To determine whether due process pro-\nhibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at\ntrial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions in-\nstruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must de-\ncide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive\nidentification procedure. Id., at 85a. If they did, the court\nmust next consider whether the improper identification\nprocedure so tainted the resulting identification as to\nrender it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. Ibid.\n(citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977)).\n   Perry’s challenge, the Superior Court concluded, failed\nat step one: Blandon’s identification of Perry on the night\n——————\n  3 The theft charge was based on the taking of items from Clavijo’s car,\n\nwhile the criminal mischief count was founded on the shattering of\nClavijo’s car window.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the crime did not result from an unnecessarily sugges-\ntive procedure “manufacture[d] . . . by the police.” App.\n86a–87a. Blandon pointed to Perry “spontaneously,” the\ncourt noted, “without any inducement from the police.”\nId., at 85a–86a. Clay did not ask Blandon whether the\nman standing in the parking lot was the man Blandon had\nseen breaking into Clavijo’s car. Ibid. Nor did Clay ask\nBlandon to move to the window from which she had ob-\nserved the break-in. Id., at 86a.\n   The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons\nto question the accuracy of Blandon’s identification: the\nparking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was stand-\ning next to a police officer; Perry was the only African-\nAmerican man in the vicinity; and Blandon was unable,\nlater, to pick Perry out of a photographic array. Id., at\n86a–87a. But “[b]ecause the police procedures were not\nunnecessarily suggestive,” the court ruled that the relia-\nbility of Blandon’s testimony was for the jury to consider.\nId., at 87a.\n   At the ensuing trial, Blandon and Clay testified to\nBlandon’s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry\nguilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.\n   On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissi-\nbility of Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The trial\ncourt erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial show-\ning that the police arranged the suggestive identification\nprocedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued,\nsuffice to trigger the court’s duty to evaluate the reliability\nof the resulting identification before allowing presentation\nof the evidence to the jury.\n   The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s\nargument and affirmed his conviction. Id., at 9a–11a.\nOnly where the police employ suggestive identification\ntechniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause\nrequire a trial court to assess the reliability of identifica-\ntion evidence before permitting a jury to consider it. Id.,\n6                    PERRY v.

S. 342, 352\n(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we im-\nposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See,\ne.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (Due\nprocess prohibits the State’s “knowin[g] use [of] false\nevidence,” because such use violates “any concept of or-\ndered liberty.”).\n   Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated\nhere, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving police-\narranged identification procedures. In Stovall v. Denno,\n388 U. S. 293 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness\nidentified the defendant as her assailant after police offic-\ners brought the defendant to the witness’ hospital room.\nId., at 295. At the time the witness made the identifica-\ntion, the defendant—the only African-American in the\nroom—was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.\nIbid. Although the police-arranged showup was undenia-\nbly suggestive, the Court held that no due process viola-\ntion occurred. Id., at 302. Crucial to the Court’s decision\nwas the procedure’s necessity: The witness was the only\nperson who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the\nwitness could not leave her hospital room; and it was\nuncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant\nin more neutral circumstances. Ibid.\n   A year later, in Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377\n(1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to\npolice use of a photographic array. When a witness identi-\n8                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the\nCourt ruled, the identification should be suppressed only\nwhere “the photographic identification procedure was so\n[unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very sub-\nstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Id., at\n384–385. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal\nBureau of Investigation agents in Simmons was both\nnecessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identifi-\ncation, the Court rejected the defendant’s due process\nchallenge to admission of the identification. Id., at 385–\n386. In contrast, the Court held in Foster v. California,\n394 U. S. 440 (1969), that due process required the exclu-\nsion of an eyewitness identification obtained through\npolice-arranged procedures that “made it all but inevitable\nthat [the witness] would identify [the defendant].” Id., at\n443.\n   Synthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.\nBiggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and reiterated in Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), the approach appropri-\nately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause\nrequires suppression of an eyewitness identification taint-\ned by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first,\nthat due process concerns arise only when law enforce-\nment officers use an identification procedure that is both\nsuggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409\nU. S., at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure,\nthe Court next said, suppression of the resulting identifi-\ncation is not the inevitable consequence. Brathwaite, 432\nU. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198–199.\n   A rule requiring automatic exclusion, the Court rea-\nsoned, would “g[o] too far,” for it would “kee[p] evidence\nfrom the jury that is reliable and relevant,” and “may\nresult, on occasion, in the guilty going free.” Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 112; see id., at 113 (when an “identification is\nreliable despite an unnecessarily suggestive [police] identi-\nfication procedure,” automatic exclusion “is a Draconian\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction,” one “that may frustrate rather than promote\njustice”).\n   Instead of mandating a per se exclusionary rule, the\nCourt held that the Due Process Clause requires courts to\nassess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police\nconduct created a “substantial likelihood of misidentifi-\ncation.” Biggers, 409 U. S., at 201; see Brathwaite, 432\nU. S., at 116. “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identifica-\ntion] is the linchpin” of that evaluation, the Court stated\nin Brathwaite. Id., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a\nwitness’] ability to make an accurate identification” are\n“outweighed by the corrupting effect” of law enforcement\nsuggestion, the identification should be suppressed. Id., at\n114, 116. Otherwise, the evidence (if admissible in all\nother respects) should be submitted to the jury.5\n   Applying this “totality of the circumstances” approach,\nid., at 110, the Court held in Biggers that law enforce-\nment’s use of an unnecessarily suggestive showup did not\nrequire suppression of the victim’s identification of her\nassailant. 409 U. S., at 199–200. Notwithstanding the\nimproper procedure, the victim’s identification was relia-\nble: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time\nunder adequate light, provided police with a detailed de-\nscription of her attacker long before the showup, and\nhad “no doubt” that the defendant was the person she had\nseen. Id., at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSimilarly, the Court concluded in Brathwaite that police\nuse of an unnecessarily suggestive photo array did not\n——————\n  5 Among  “factors to be considered” in evaluating a witness’ “ability to\nmake an accurate identification,” the Court listed: “the opportunity of\nthe witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’\ndegree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal,\nthe level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time\nbetween the crime and the confrontation.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432\nU. S. 98, 114 (1977) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 199–200\n(1972)).\n10               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire exclusion of the resulting identification. 432 U. S.,\nat 114–117. The witness, an undercover police officer,\nviewed the defendant in good light for several minutes,\nprovided a thorough description of the suspect, and was\ncertain of his identification. Id., at 115. Hence, the “indi-\ncators of [the witness’] ability to make an accurate identi-\nfication [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect\nof the challenged identification.” Id., at 116.\n                              B\n  Perry concedes that, in contrast to every case in the\nStovall line, law enforcement officials did not arrange the\nsuggestive circumstances surrounding Blandon’s identifi-\ncation. See Brief for Petitioner 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(counsel for Perry) (“[W]e do not allege any manipulation\nor intentional orchestration by the police.”). He contends,\nhowever, that it was mere happenstance that each of\nthe Stovall cases involved improper police action. The\nrationale underlying our decisions, Perry asserts, supports\na rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evi-\ndence for reliability any time an identification is made\nunder suggestive circumstances. We disagree.\n  Perry’s argument depends, in large part, on the Court’s\nstatement in Brathwaite that “reliability is the linchpin in\ndetermining the admissibility of identification testimony.”\n432 U. S., at 114. If reliability is the linchpin of admissi-\nbility under the Due Process Clause, Perry maintains, it\nshould make no difference whether law enforcement was\nresponsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that\nmarred the identification.\n  Perry has removed our statement in Brathwaite from its\nmooring, and thereby attributes to the statement a mean-\ning a fair reading of our opinion does not bear. As just\nexplained, supra, at 8–9, the Brathwaite Court’s reference\nto reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning\nthe appropriate remedy when the police use an unneces-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsarily suggestive identification procedure.      The Court\nadopted a judicial screen for reliability as a course prefer-\nable to a per se rule requiring exclusion of identification\nevidence whenever law enforcement officers employ an\nimproper procedure. The due process check for reliability,\nBrathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the\ndefendant establishes improper police conduct. The very\npurpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriv-\ning the jury of identification evidence that is reliable,\nnotwithstanding improper police conduct. 432 U. S., at\n112–113.6\n   Perry’s contention that improper police action was not\nessential to the reliability check Brathwaite required is\nechoed by the dissent. Post, at 3–4. Both ignore a key\npremise of the Brathwaite decision: A primary aim of ex-\ncluding identification evidence obtained under unneces-\nsarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter\nlaw enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and\nphoto arrays in the first place. See 432 U. S., at 112.\nAlerted to the prospect that identification evidence im-\nproperly obtained may be excluded, the Court reasoned,\npolice officers will “guard against unnecessarily suggestive\nprocedures.” Ibid. This deterrence rationale is inapposite\nin cases, like Perry’s, in which the police engaged in no\nimproper conduct.\n   Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970), another deci-\nsion in the Stovall line, similarly shows that the Court has\nlinked the due process check, not to suspicion of eyewit-\nness testimony generally, but only to improper police\narrangement of the circumstances surrounding an identi-\n——————\n  6 The Court’s description of the question presented in Brathwaite\n\nassumes that improper state action occurred: “[Does] the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment compe[l] the exclusion, in a state\ncriminal trial, apart from any consideration of reliability, of pretrial\nidentification evidence obtained by a police procedure that was both\nsuggestive and unnecessary.” 432 U. S., at 99.\n12                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfication. The defendants in Coleman contended that a\nwitness’ in-court identifications violated due process,\nbecause a pretrial stationhouse lineup was “so unduly\nprejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification\nas fatally to taint [the later identifications].” 399 U. S., at\n3 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected this argument.\nId., at 5–6 (plurality opinion), 13–14 (Black, J., concur-\nring), 22, n. 2 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), 28, n. 2 (Stewart,\nJ., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the\nplurality explained, because nothing “the police said or did\nprompted [the witness’] virtually spontaneous identifica-\ntion of [the defendants].” Id., at 6. True, Coleman was the\nonly person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality\nnoted, but “nothing in the record show[ed] that he was\nrequired to do so.” Ibid. See also Colorado v. Connelly,\n479 U. S. 157, 163, 167 (1986) (Where the “crucial element\nof police overreaching” is missing, the admissibility of an\nallegedly unreliable confession is “a matter to be governed\nby the evidentiary laws of the forum, . . . and not by the\nDue Process Clause.”).\n   Perry and the dissent place significant weight on United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), describing it as a\ndecision not anchored to improper police conduct. See\nBrief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21–22, 28; post, at 2–4, 8–10.\nIn fact, the risk of police rigging was the very danger to\nwhich the Court responded in Wade when it recognized a\ndefendant’s right to counsel at postindictment, police-\norganized identification procedures. 388 U. S., at 233,\n235–236. “[T]he confrontation compelled by the State\nbetween the accused and the victim or witnesses,” the\nCourt began, “is peculiarly riddled with innumerable\ndangers and variable factors which might seriously, even\ncrucially, derogate from a fair trial.” Id., at 228 (emphasis\nadded). “A major factor contributing to the high incidence\nof miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,” the\nCourt continued, “has been the degree of suggestion inher-\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nent in the manner in which the prosecution presents\nthe suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). To illustrate the improper suggestion it\nwas concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed\nlineups where “all in the lineup but the suspect were\nknown to the identifying witness, . . . the other partici-\npants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance\nto the suspect, . . . only the suspect was required to wear\ndistinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, . . .\nthe witness is told by the police that they have caught the\nculprit after which the defendant is brought before the\nwitness alone or is viewed in jail, . . . the suspect is point-\ned out before or during a lineup, . . . the participants in the\nlineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits\nonly the suspect.” Id., at 233 (footnotes omitted). Beyond\ngenuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices\nprompted the Court to extend a defendant’s right to coun-\nsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups. Id., at\n235.\n   Perry’s argument, reiterated by the dissent, thus lacks\nsupport in the case law he cites. Moreover, his position\nwould open the door to judicial preview, under the banner\nof due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifica-\ntions. External suggestion is hardly the only factor that\ncasts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness’ tes-\ntimony. As one of Perry’s amici points out, many other\nfactors bear on “the likelihood of misidentification,” post,\nat 9—for example, the passage of time between exposure\nto and identification of the defendant, whether the witness\nwas under stress when he first encountered the suspect,\nhow much time the witness had to observe the suspect,\nhow far the witness was from the suspect, whether the\nsuspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and\nthe witness. Brief for American Psychological Association\nas Amicus Curiae 9–12. There is no reason why an iden-\ntification made by an eyewitness with poor vision, for ex-\n14               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nample, or one who harbors a grudge against the defend-\nant, should be regarded as inherently more reliable, less of\na “threat to the fairness of trial,” post, at 14, than the\nidentification Blandon made in this case. To embrace\nPerry’s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the\nreach of due process as a constraint on the admission of\nevidence.\n   Perry maintains that the Court can limit the due pro-\ncess check he proposes to identifications made under\n“suggestive circumstances.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–14. Even\nif we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from\nother factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evi-\ndence, Perry’s limitation would still involve trial courts,\nroutinely, in preliminary examinations. Most eyewitness\nidentifications involve some element of suggestion. In-\ndeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifi-\ncations volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve\nsuggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness\nidentifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a\nphotograph of the defendant in the press captioned “theft\nsuspect,” or hearing a radio report implicating the defend-\nant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the\ndefendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the\nday and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circum-\nstances might have “suggested” to the witness that the\ndefendant was the person the witness observed commit-\nting the crime.\n                            C\n  In urging a broadly applicable due process check on\neyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewit-\nness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of\nevidence. See Brief for Petitioner 17–22 (citing studies\nshowing that eyewitness misidentifications are the leading\ncause of wrongful convictions); Brief for American Psycho-\nlogical Association as Amicus Curiae 14–17 (describing\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

See also post, at 14–17.\nWe do not doubt either the importance or the fallibility of\neyewitness identifications. Indeed, in recognizing that\ndefendants have a constitutional right to counsel at\npostindictment police lineups, we observed that “the an-\nnals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken\nidentification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228.\n   We have concluded in other contexts, however, that the\npotential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone\nrender its introduction at the defendant’s trial fundamen-\ntally unfair. See, e.g., Ventris, 556 U. S., at 594, n. (declin-\ning to “craft a broa[d] exclusionary rule for uncorroborated\nstatements obtained [from jailhouse snitches],” even\nthough “rewarded informant testimony” may be inherently\nuntrustworthy); Dowling, 493 U. S., at 353 (rejecting ar-\ngument that the introduction of evidence concerning\nacquitted conduct is fundamentally unfair because such\nevidence is “inherently unreliable”). We reach a similar\nconclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does\nnot, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a\ndue process rule requiring a trial court to screen such\nevidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess\nits creditworthiness.\n   Our unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process\nas Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our\nrecognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally de-\ntermines the reliability of evidence. See supra, at 7. We\nalso take account of other safeguards built into our adver-\nsary system that caution juries against placing undue\nweight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.\nThese protections include the defendant’s Sixth Amend-\nment right to confront the eyewitness. See Maryland v.\nCraig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (“The central concern of\nthe Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the\nevidence against a criminal defendant.”). Another is the\n16                   PERRY v.

Eyewitness-specific jury instructions, which\nmany federal and state courts have adopted,7 likewise\nwarn the jury to take care in appraising identification\nevidence. See, e.g., United States v. Telfaire, 469 F. 2d\n552, 558–559 (CADC 1972) (per curiam) (D. C.

The constitutional requirement that\nthe government prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubi-\nous identification evidence.\n   State and federal rules of evidence, moreover, permit\ntrial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact\nor potential for misleading the jury.

Our cases\nthus establish a clear rule: The admission at trial of\nout-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from imper-\nmissibly suggestive circumstances that pose a very substan-\ntial likelihood of misidentification violates due process.\nThe Court today announces that that rule does not even\n“com[e] into play” unless the suggestive circumstances are\nimproperly “police-arranged.” Ante, at 2, 11.\n   Our due process concern, however, arises not from the\nact of suggestion, but rather from the corrosive effects of\nsuggestion on the reliability of the resulting identification.\nBy rendering protection contingent on improper police\narrangement of the suggestive circumstances, the Court\neffectively grafts a mens rea inquiry onto our rule. The\nCourt’s holding enshrines a murky distinction—between\nsuggestive confrontations intentionally orchestrated by\nthe police and, as here, those inadvertently caused by\npolice actions—that will sow confusion. It ignores our\nprecedents’ acute sensitivity to the hazards of intentional\nand unintentional suggestion alike and unmoors our rule\nfrom the very interest it protects, inviting arbitrary re-\n2                    PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsults. And it recasts the driving force of our decisions as\nan interest in police deterrence, rather than reliability.\nBecause I see no warrant for declining to assess the cir-\ncumstances of this case under our ordinary approach, I\nrespectfully dissent.1\n                               I\n   The “driving force” behind United States v. Wade, 388\nU. S. 218 (1967), Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263\n(1967), and Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967), was\n“the Court’s concern with the problems of eyewitness\nidentification”—specifically, “the concern that the jury not\nhear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has as-\npects of reliability.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98,\n111–112 (1977). We have pointed to the “ ‘formidable’ ”\nnumber of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identi-\nfication” in the annals of criminal law. Wade, 388 U. S., at\n228. We have warned of the “vagaries” and “ ‘proverbi-\nally untrustworthy’ ” nature of eyewitness identifications.\nIbid. And we have singled out a “major factor contrib-\nuting” to that proverbial unreliability: “the suggestibility\ninherent in the context of the pretrial identification.” Id.,\nat 228, 235.\n   Our precedents make no distinction between intentional\nand unintentional suggestion. To the contrary, they ex-\nplicitly state that “[s]uggestion can be created intentional-\nly or unintentionally in many subtle ways.” Id., at 229.\nRather than equate suggestive conduct with misconduct,\nwe specifically have disavowed the assumption that sug-\ngestive influences may only be “the result of police proce-\ndures intentionally designed to prejudice an accused.” Id.,\nat 235; see also id., at 236 (noting “grave potential for\nprejudice, intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup”); id., at\n——————\n  1 Because the facts of this case involve police action, I do not reach the\n\nquestion whether due process is triggered in situations involving no\npolice action whatsoever.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n239 (describing lack of lineup regulations addressing\n“risks of abuse and unintentional suggestion”). “Persons\nwho conduct the identification procedure may suggest,\nintentionally or unintentionally, that they expect the\nwitness to identify the accused.” Moore v. Illinois, 434\nU. S. 220, 224 (1977). The implication is that even police\nacting with the best of intentions can inadvertently signal\n“ ‘that’s the man.’ ” Wade, 388 U. S., at 236; see also Kirby\nv. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 690–691 (1972) (“[I]t is always\nnecessary to ‘scrutinize any pretrial confrontation . . .’ ”).2\n    In Wade itself, we noted that the “potential for improper\ninfluence [in pretrial confrontations] is illustrated by the\ncircumstances . . . [i]n the present case.” 388 U. S., at\n233–234. We then highlighted not the lineup procedure,\nbut rather a preprocedure encounter: The two witnesses\nwho later identified Wade in the lineup had seen Wade\noutside while “await[ing] assembly of the lineup.” Id., at\n234. Wade had been standing in the hallway, which hap-\npened to be “observable to the witnesses through an open\ndoor.” Ibid. One witness saw Wade “within sight of\nan FBI agent”; the other saw him “in the custody of the\nagent.” Ibid. In underscoring the hazards of these cir-\ncumstances, we made no mention of whether the encoun-\nter had been arranged; indeed, the facts suggest that it\nwas not.\n    More generally, our precedents focus not on the act of\nsuggestion, but on suggestion’s “corrupting effect” on\n——————\n  2 Wade held that the dangers of pretrial identification procedures\n\nnecessitated a right to counsel; that same day, Stovall held that a\ndefendant ineligible for the Wade rule was still entitled to challenge the\nconfrontation as a due process violation. Because the two were com-\npanion cases advancing interrelated rules to avoid unfairness at trial\nresulting from suggestive pretrial confrontations, Wade’s exposition of\nthe dangers of suggestiveness informs both contexts. See Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 112 (1977) (“Wade and its companion cases\nreflect the concern that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless\nthat evidence has aspects of reliability”).\n4                 PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreliability. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Eyewitness\nevidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we have\nexplained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the\nadversary process. An eyewitness who has made an iden-\ntification often becomes convinced of its accuracy. “Re-\ngardless of how the initial misidentification comes about,\nthe witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the\nimage of the photograph rather than of the person actually\nseen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent . . .\ncourtroom identification.” Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (emphasis added); see also\nWade, 388 U. S., at 229 (witness is “not likely” to recant).\nSuggestion bolsters that confidence.\n   At trial, an eyewitness’ artificially inflated confidence in\nan identification’s accuracy complicates the jury’s task of\nassessing witness credibility and reliability. It also im-\npairs the defendant’s ability to attack the eyewitness’\ncredibility. Stovall, 388 U. S., at 298. That in turn jeop-\nardizes the defendant’s basic right to subject his accuser\nto meaningful cross-examination. See Wade, 388 U. S.,\nat 235 (“[C]ross-examination . . . cannot be viewed as an\nabsolute assurance of accuracy and reliability . . . where so\nmany variables and pitfalls exist”). The end result of\nsuggestion, whether intentional or unintentional, is to\nfortify testimony bearing directly on guilt that juries find\nextremely convincing and are hesitant to discredit. See\nid., at 224 (“[A]t pretrial proceedings . . . the results might\nwell settle the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a\nmere formality”); Gilbert, 388 U. S., at 273 (“[T]he witness’\ntestimony of his lineup identification will enhance the\nimpact of his in-court identification on the jury”).\n   Consistent with our focus on reliability, we have de-\nclined to adopt a per se rule excluding all suggestive iden-\ntifications. Instead, “reliability is the linchpin” in deciding\nadmissibility. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. We have\nexplained that a suggestive identification procedure “does\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nnot in itself intrude upon a constitutionally protected in-\nterest.” Id., at 113, n. 13; see also Neil v. Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188, 198–199 (1972) (rejecting the proposition that\n“unnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the exclusion\nof evidence”). “Suggestive confrontations are disapproved\nbecause they increase the likelihood of misidentifica-\ntion”—and “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which\nviolates a defendant’s right to due process.” Id., at 198;\nsee also United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F. 2d\n397, 406 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.) (“The due process clause\napplies only to proceedings which result in a deprivation of\nlife, liberty or property. . . . [I]f a constitutional violation\nresults from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in\nthe police station”). In short, “ ‘what the Stovall due pro-\ncess right protects is an evidentiary interest.’ ” Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 113, n. 14.\n   To protect that evidentiary interest, we have applied a\ntwo-step inquiry: First, the defendant has the burden of\nshowing that the eyewitness identification was derived\nthrough “impermissibly suggestive” means.3 Simmons,\n390 U. S., at 384. Second, if the defendant meets that\nburden, courts consider whether the identification was\n——————\n   3 Our precedents refer to “impermissibly,” “unnecessarily,” and “un-\n\nduly” suggestive circumstances interchangeably. See, e.g., Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 105, n. 8, 107–108, 110, 112–113 (“impermissibly” and\n“unnecessarily”); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196–199 (1972) (“im-\npermissibly” and “unnecessarily”); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 3–\n5 (1970) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”); Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”). The Circuits\nhave followed suit. E.g., Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6\n1986) (“unduly”); Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980)\n(“unnecessarily or impermissibly”). All reinforce our focus not on the\nact of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness rises to such a\nlevel that it undermines reliability. Police machinations can heighten\nthe likelihood of misidentification, but they are no prerequisite to\nfinding a confrontation “so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a\nvery substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification.” Simmons, 390\nU. S., at 384.\n6                 PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreliable under the totality of the circumstances. That step\nentails considering the witness’ opportunity to view the\nperpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description,\nlevel of certainty, and the time between the crime and\npretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against\nthe “corrupting effect of the suggestive identification.”\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S., at 108, 114. Most identifications\nwill be admissible. The standard of “fairness as required\nby the Due Process Clause,” id., at 113, however, demands\nthat a subset of the most unreliable identifications—those\ncarrying a “ ‘very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentifi-\ncation’ ”—will be excluded. Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority today creates a novel and significant limi-\ntation on our longstanding rule: Eyewitness identifications\nso impermissibly suggestive that they pose a very sub-\nstantial likelihood of an unreliable identification will be\ndeemed inadmissible at trial only if the suggestive circum-\nstances were “police-arranged.” Ante, at 2. Absent “im-\nproper police arrangement,” “improper police conduct,” or\n“rigging,” the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not\neven “com[e] into play.” Ante, at 2, 11. I cannot agree.\n   The majority does not simply hold that an eyewitness\nidentification must be the product of police action to trig-\nger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather, the majority\nmaintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise\nto the identification must be “police-arranged,” “police\nrigg[ed],” “police-designed,” or “police-organized.” Ante, at\n2, 12–13. Those terms connote a degree of intentional\norchestration or manipulation. See Brief for Respondent\n19 (no indication that police “deliberately tried to manipu-\nlate any evidence”); Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18 (“[N]o one deliberately arranged the circum-\nstances to obtain an identification”). The majority cate-\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

The majority thus\nappears to graft a mens rea requirement onto our existing\nrule.4\n  As this case illustrates, police intent is now paramount.\nAs the Court acknowledges, Perry alleges an “accidental\nshowup.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis added); see\nante, at 4. He was the only African-American at the scene\nof the crime standing next to a police officer. For the\nmajority, the fact that the police did not intend that\nshowup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the course\nof a police procedure, ends the inquiry. The police were\nquestioning the eyewitness, Blandon, about the perpetra-\ntor’s identity, and were intentionally detaining Perry in\nthe parking lot—but had not intended for Blandon to\nidentify the perpetrator from her window. Presumably, in\nthe majority’s view, had the police asked Blandon to move\nto the window to identify the perpetrator, that could have\nmade all the difference. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37.\n  I note, however, that the majority leaves what is re-\nquired by its arrangement-focused inquiry less than clear.\nIn parts, the opinion suggests that the police must arrange\nan identification “procedure,” regardless of whether they\n“inten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.” Ante,\nat 2, n. 1; see also ante, at 7–8. Elsewhere, it indicates\nthat the police must arrange the “suggestive circum-\nstances” that lead the witness to identify the accused. See\n——————\n  4 The majority denies that it has imposed a mens rea requirement, see\n\nante, at 2, n. 1, but by confining our due process concerns to police-\narranged identification procedures, that is just what it has done. The\nmajority acknowledges that “whether or not [the police] intended the\narranged procedure to be suggestive” is irrelevant under our prece-\ndents, ibid., but still places dispositive weight on whether or not the\npolice intended the procedure itself.\n8                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nante, at 1–2, 10–11, 18–19. Still elsewhere it refers to “im-\nproper” police conduct, ante, at 1–2, 9–12, connoting bad\nfaith. Does police “arrangement” relate to the procedure, the\nsuggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do\nsuggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the\nsame concerns? If the police need not “inten[d] the ar-\nranged procedure to be suggestive,” ante, at 2, n. 1, what\nmakes the police action “improper”? And does that mean\nthat good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a\npolice-arranged lineup can be “impermissibly sugges-\ntive”? If no, the majority runs headlong into Wade. If\nyes, on what basis—if not deterrence—does it distinguish\nunintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental\nconfrontation?\n   The arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless con-\nfusion. If the police had called Perry and Blandon to\nthe police station for interviews, and Blandon saw Perry\nbeing questioned, would that be sufficiently “improper\npolice arrangement”? If Perry had voluntarily come to the\npolice station, would that change the result? Today’s\nopinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry\ncontingent on a murky line-drawing exercise. Whereas\nour two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability—and\ncould account for the spontaneity of the witness’ identifi-\ncation and degree of police manipulation under the total-\nity of the circumstances—today’s opinion forecloses that\nassessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.\n                             B\n  The majority regards its limitation on our two-step rule\nas compelled by precedent. Its chief rationale, ante, at 7–\n13, is that none of our prior cases involved situations\nwhere the police “did not arrange the suggestive circum-\nstances.” Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2, n. 1. That is not\nnecessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional en-\ncounter highlighted in Wade. But even if it were true, it is\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              9\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nunsurprising. The vast majority of eyewitness identifica-\ntions that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are\nobtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays\narranged by the police. Our precedents reflect that practi-\ncal reality.\n   It is also beside the point. Our due process concerns\nwere not predicated on the source of suggestiveness.\nRather, “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which\nviolates a defendant’s right to due process,” Biggers, 409\nU. S., at 198, and we are concerned with suggestion in-\nsofar as it has “corrupting effect[s]” on the identification’s\nreliability. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Accordingly,\nwhether the police have created the suggestive circum-\nstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting iden-\ntification raises the same due process concerns. It is no\nmore or less likely to misidentify the perpetrator. It is\nno more or less powerful to the jury. And the defendant\nis no more or less equipped to challenge the identifica-\ntion through cross-examination or prejudiced at trial. The\narrangement-focused inquiry thus untethers our doctrine\nfrom the very “ ‘evidentiary interest’ ” it was designed to\nprotect, inviting arbitrary results. Id., at 113, n. 14.\n   Indeed, it is the majority’s approach that lies in tension\nwith our precedents. Whereas we previously disclaimed\nthe crabbed view of suggestiveness as “the result of po-\nlice procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an ac-\ncused,” Wade, 388 U. S., at 235, the majority’s focus on\npolice rigging and improper conduct will revive it. Where-\nas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and unin-\ntentional suggestiveness alike, see supra, at 2–3, today’s\ndecision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated\nsuggestive confrontations. We once described the “pri-\nmary evil to be avoided” as the likelihood of misidentification.\nBiggers, 409 U. S., at 198. Today’s decision, however,\nmeans that even if that primary evil is at its apex, we\nneed not avoid it at all so long as the suggestive circum-\n10               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nstances do not stem from improper police arrangement.\n                              C\n   The majority gives several additional reasons for why\napplying our due process rule beyond improperly police-\narranged circumstances is unwarranted. In my view, none\nwithstands close inspection.\n   First, the majority insists that our precedents “aim to\ndeter police from rigging identification procedures,” so our\nrule should be limited to applications that advance that\n“primary aim” and “key premise.” Ante, at 2, 11 (citing\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112). That mischaracterizes our\ncases. We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite because\nBrathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking\ndeterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence de-\nmanded a per se rule excluding all suggestive identifica-\ntions. He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of\nsuggestive identifications under the totality of the circum-\nstances, “cannot be expected to have a significant deter-\nrent impact.” Id., at 111.\n   We rebutted Brathwaite’s criticism in language the\nmajority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing\nBrathwaite’s argument, we acknowledged “several inter-\nests to be considered.” Ibid. We then compared the two\nrules under each interest: First, we noted the “driving\nforce” behind Wade and its companion cases—“the concern\nthat the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that\nevidence has aspects of reliability”—and found both ap-\nproaches “responsive to this concern,” but the per se rule\nto go “too far” in suppressing reliable evidence. 432 U. S.,\nat 111–112. We noted a “second factor”—deterrence—\nconceding that the per se rule had “more significant deter-\nrent effect,” but noting that our rule “also has an influence\non police behavior.” Id., at 112. Finally, we noted a “third\nfactor”—“the effect on the administration of justice”—\ndescribing the per se rule as having serious drawbacks on\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthis front. Ibid. That was no list of “primary aim[s].” Nor\nwas it a ringing endorsement of the primacy of deterrence.\nWe simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite,\nthat our rule was not without deterrence benefits. To\nthe contrary, we clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary\nconcern to reliability, the “driving force” of our doctrine. It\nis a stretch to claim that our rule cannot apply wherever\n“[t]his deterrence rationale is inapposite.” Ante, at 11.\n   Second, the majority states that Coleman v. Alabama,\n399 U. S. 1 (1970), held that “[n]o due process violation\noccurred . . . because nothing ‘the police said or did\nprompted’ ” the identification and shows that our rule is\nlinked “only to improper police arrangement.” Ante, at\n11–12. That misreads the decision. In Coleman, the\npetitioners challenged a witness’ in-court identification of\nthem at trial on grounds that it had been tainted by a\nsuggestive pretrial lineup. We held that no due process\nviolation occurred because the in-court identification ap-\npeared to be “entirely based upon observations at the\ntime of the assault and not at all induced by the conduct of\nthe lineup,” and thus could not be said to stem from an\nidentification procedure “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as\nto give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.’ ” 399 U. S., at 5–6 (plurality opinion).\nWe then dismissed each of the asserted suggestive influ-\nences as having had no bearing on the identification at all:\nThe petitioners claimed that the police intimated to the\nwitness that his attackers were in the lineup; we found the\nrecord “devoid of evidence that anything the police said or\ndid” induced the identification. Id., at 6. The petitioners\nclaimed that they alone were made to say certain words;\nwe found that the witness identified petitioners before\neither said anything. One petitioner claimed he was\nsingled out to wear a hat; we found that the witness’\nidentification “d[id] not appear . . . based on the fact that\nhe remembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat.” Ibid.\n12               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThus, far from indicating that improper police conduct is a\nprerequisite, Coleman merely held that there had been no\ninfluence on the witness. In fact, in concluding that the\nlineup was not “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as to give\nrise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misi-\ndentification,’ ” Coleman indicates that the two-step in-\nquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of\npolice misconduct.\n   Third, the majority emphasizes that we should rely on\nthe jury to determine the reliability of evidence. See ante,\nat 15–16. But our cases are rooted in the assumption that\neyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation\nthat it is “the province of the jury to weigh the credibility\nof competing witnesses.” Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586,\n594, n. (2009). As noted, jurors find eyewitness evidence\nunusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility\nis hindered by a witness’ false confidence in the accuracy\nof his or her identification. That disability in no way de-\npends on the intent behind the suggestive circumstances.\n   The majority’s appeals to protecting the jury’s domain,\nmoreover, appeared in dissent after dissent from our de-\ncisions. See Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440, 447\n(1969) (Black, J., dissenting) (“[T]he jury is the sole tribu-\nnal to weigh and determine facts” and “must . . . be al-\nlowed to hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it\ncan recognize the truth”); Simmons, 390 U. S., at 395\n(Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The\nweight of the evidence . . . is not a question for the Court\nbut for the jury”). So too does the majority’s assurance\nthat other constitutional protections like the Sixth\nAmendment rights to compulsory process and confronta-\ntion can suffice to expose unreliable identifications. Com-\npare ante, at 6, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448–449 (Black,\nJ., dissenting) (“The Constitution sets up its own stand-\nards of unfairness in criminal trials,” including the Sixth\nAmendment “right to compulsory process” and “right to\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconfront . . . witnesses”). So too does the majority’s appeal\nto leave reliability to the rules of evidence. Compare ante,\nat 17, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting)\n(“ ‘Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair\ntrials’ ”), and Stovall, 388 U. S., at 306 (Black, J., dissent-\ning) (“[T]he result . . . is to put into a constitutional mould\na rule of evidence”). Those arguments did not prevail\nthen; they should not prevail here.\n    Fourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule\nbeyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would\nentail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage\nin “preliminary judicial inquiry” into “most, if not all,\neyewitness identifications.” Ante, at 13, 18. But that is\ninaccurate. The burden of showing “impermissibly sug-\ngestive” circumstances is the defendant’s, so the objection\nfalls to the defendant to raise. And as is implicit in the\nmajority’s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules\nof evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial\ncourts will be entertaining defendants’ objections, pretrial\nor at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event.\nThe relevant question, then, is what the standard of ad-\nmissibility governing such objections should be. I see no\nreason to water down the standard for an equally sugges-\ntive and unreliable identification simply because the\nsuggestive confrontation was unplanned.\n    It bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for\nsuppression. The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to\ntestify before a jury. To date, Foster is the only case in\nwhich we have found a due process violation. 394 U. S., at\n443. There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal\nCircuits that, having seen no basis for an arrangement-\nbased distinction in our precedents, have long indicated\nthat due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identifi-\ncation procedures. See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117,\n128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506,\n1516 (CA1 1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6\n14               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1986); see also Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9\n1980). Today’s decision nonetheless precludes even the\npossibility that an unintended confrontation will meet\nthat bar, mandating summary dismissal of every such\nclaim at the threshold.\n   Finally, the majority questions how to “rationally dis-\ntinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the\nreliability of eyewitness evidence,” such as “poor vision” or\na prior “grudge,” ante, at 13–14, and more broadly, how to\ndistinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of argu-\nably unreliable evidence. Ante, at 14–15. Our precedents,\nhowever, did just that. We emphasized the “ ‘formidable\nnumber of instances in the records of English and Amer-\nican trials’ ” of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken\nidentification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228. We then observed\nthat “ ‘the influence of improper suggestion upon identify-\ning witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of\njustice than any other single factor.’ ” Id., at 229. More-\nover, the majority points to no other type of evidence that\nshares the rare confluence of characteristics that makes\neyewitness evidence a unique threat to the fairness of\ntrial. Jailhouse informants, cf. ante, at 15, unreliable as\nthey may be, are not similarly resistant to the traditional\ntools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are met\nwith particular skepticism by juries.\n   It would be one thing if the passage of time had cast\ndoubt on the empirical premises of our precedents. But\njust the opposite has happened. A vast body of scientific\nliterature has reinforced every concern our precedents\narticulated nearly a half-century ago, though it merits\nbarely a parenthetical mention in the majority opinion.\nAnte, at 14. Over the past three decades, more than two\nthousand studies related to eyewitness identification have\nbeen published.

NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n No. 10–8974. Argued November 2, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012\nAround 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, the Nashua, New Hampshire Police\n  Department received a call reporting that an African-American male\n  was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of the caller’s apart-\n  ment building. When an officer responding to the call asked eyewit-\n  ness Nubia Blandon to describe the man, Blandon pointed to her\n  kitchen window and said the man she saw breaking into the car was\n  standing in the parking lot, next to a police officer. Petitioner Barion\n  Perry’s arrest followed this identification.\n     Before trial, Perry moved to suppress Blandon’s identification on\n  the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process. The\n  New Hampshire trial court denied the motion. To determine whether\n  due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification\n  at trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a two-\n  step inquiry: The trial court must first decide whether the police used\n  an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure; if they did, the\n  court must next consider whether that procedure so tainted the re-\n  sulting identification as to render it unreliable and thus inadmissi-\n  ble. Perry’s challenge, the court found, failed at step one, for Blan-\n  don’s identification did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive\n  procedure employed by the police. A jury subsequently convicted\n  Perry of theft by unauthorized taking.\n     On appeal, Perry argued that the trial court erred in requiring an\n  initial showing that police arranged a suggestive identification pro-\n  cedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry contended, suffice to\n  require court evaluation of the reliability of an eyewitness identifica-\n  tion before allowing it to be presented to the jury. The New Hamp-\n  shire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s argument and affirmed his\n  conviction.\n  Held: The Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial\n2                      PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the\n    identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive cir-\n    cumstances arranged by law enforcement. Pp. 6–19.\n       (a) The Constitution protects a defendant against a conviction\n    based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting in-\n    troduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to\n    persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unwor-\n    thy of credit. Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair that its\n    admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,” Dowling v.\n    United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (internal quotation marks omitted),\n    does the Due Process Clause preclude its admission.\n       Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry\n    relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification\n    procedures. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293; Simmons v. United\n    States, 390 U. S. 377; Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440; Neil v. Big-\n    gers, 409 U. S. 188; and Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98. These\n    cases detail the approach appropriately used to determine whether\n    due process requires suppression of an eyewitness identification\n    tainted by police arrangement. First, due process concerns arise only\n    when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is\n    both suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409 U. S.,\n    at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure, however, sup-\n    pression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable conse-\n    quence. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at\n    198–199. Instead, due process requires courts to assess, on a case-by-\n    case basis, whether improper police conduct created a “substantial\n    likelihood of misidentification.” Id., at 201. “[R]eliability [of the eye-\n    witness identification] is the linchpin” of that evaluation.\n    Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a witness’]\n    ability to make an accurate identification” are “outweighed by the\n    corrupting effect” of law enforcement suggestion, the identification\n    should be suppressed. Id., at 114, 116. Otherwise, the identification,\n    assuming no other barrier to its admission, should be submitted to\n    the jury. Pp. 6–10.\n       (b) Perry argues that it was mere happenstance that all of the cas-\n    es in the Stovall line involved improper police action. The rationale\n    underlying this Court’s decisions, Perry asserts, calls for a rule re-\n    quiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability\n    any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances.\n    This Court disagrees.\n       If “reliability is the linchpin” of admissibility under the Due Pro-\n    cess Clause, Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114, Perry contends, it should\n    not matter whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the\n    suggestive circumstances that marred the identification. This argu-\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nment removes Brathwaite’s statement from its mooring, attributing\nto it a meaning that a fair reading of the opinion does not bear. The\ndue process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into\nplay only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.\n   Perry’s contention also ignores a key premise of Brathwaite: A pri-\nmary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnec-\nessarily suggestive circumstances is to deter law enforcement use of\nimproper procedures in the first place. This deterrence rationale is\ninapposite in cases, like Perry’s, where there is no improper police\nconduct. Perry also places significant weight on United States v.\nWade, 388 U. S. 218, describing it as a decision not anchored to im-\nproper police conduct. But the risk of police rigging was the very\ndanger that prompted the Court in Wade to extend a defendant’s\nright to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.\n   Perry’s position would also open the door to judicial preview, under\nthe banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifica-\ntions. There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewit-\nness with poor vision or one who harbors a grudge against the de-\nfendant, for example, should be regarded as inherently more reliable\nthan Blandon’s identification here. Even if this Court could, as Perry\ncontends, distinguish “suggestive circumstances” from other factors\nbearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation\nwould still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examina-\ntions, for most eyewitness identifications involve some element of\nsuggestion. Pp. 10–14.\n   (c) In urging a broadly applicable rule, Perry maintains that eye-\nwitness identifications are uniquely unreliable. The fallibility of\neyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state\nconduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen\nthe evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its cre-\nditworthiness. The Court’s unwillingness to adopt such a rule rests,\nin large part, on its recognition that the jury, not the judge, tradi-\ntionally determines the reliability of evidence. It also takes account\nof other safeguards built into the adversary system that caution ju-\nries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of ques-\ntionable reliability. These protections include the defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment rights to counsel and to confront and cross-examine the\neyewitness, eyewitness-specific instructions warning juries to take\ncare in appraising identification evidence, and state and federal rules\nof evidence permitting trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact\nor potential for misleading the jury. Many of these safeguards were\navailed of by Perry’s defense. Given the safeguards generally appli-\ncable in criminal trials, the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness tes-\n4                     PERRY v.

NEW HAMPSHIRE\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                    NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                               [January 11, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In our system of justice, fair trial for persons charged\nwith criminal offenses is secured by the Sixth Amend-\nment, which guarantees to defendants the right to counsel,\ncompulsory process to obtain defense witnesses, and the\nopportunity to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecu-\ntion. Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in\nstate trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the\nreliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the\nprovince of the jury to determine. This Court has recog-\nnized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of\neyewitness identification, applicable when the police have\narranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to\nidentify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.\n   An identification infected by improper police influence,\nour case law holds, is not automatically excluded. Instead,\nthe trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability\npretrial. If there is “a very substantial likelihood of irrep-\narable misidentification,” Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 384 (1968), the judge must disallow presenta-\ntion of the evidence at trial. But if the indicia of reliability\nare strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the\n2                   PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npolice-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identifica-\ntion evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will\nultimately determine its worth.\n   We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability\nto cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not\narranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests\nthat we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken\nidentification will yield a miscarriage of justice.1 Our\ndecisions, however, turn on the presence of state action\nand aim to deter police from rigging identification proce-\ndures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph\narray. When no improper law enforcement activity is\ninvolved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the\nrights and opportunities generally designed for that pur-\npose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment\nlineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evi-\ndence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of\neyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                         I\n                         A\n  Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, Joffre Ullon called\nthe Nashua, New Hampshire, Police Department and\n\n——————\n   1 The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances\n\nraise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See post, at 6,\n9, 14–17. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single\ncase in which we have required pretrial screening absent a police-\narranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no\nsuch cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the\npolice arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a\n“longstanding rule,” post, at 6, that never existed. Nor are we, as the\ndissent suggests, imposing a mens rea requirement, post, at 1, 7, or\notherwise altering our precedent in any way. As our case law makes\nclear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unneces-\nsarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended\nthe arranged procedure to be suggestive.\n                   Cite as: 565 U.

Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon\narriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what “sounded like\na metal bat hitting the ground.” App. 37a–38a. She then\nsaw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.\nPerry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifi-\ners in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind\nhim. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.\n“[I] found them on the ground,” Perry responded. Id.,\nat 39a.\n   Meanwhile, Ullon’s wife, Nubia Blandon, woke her\nneighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen\nsomeone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went\ndownstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first\nobserved that one of the rear windows had been shattered.\nOn further inspection, he discovered that the speakers\nand amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were\nhis bat and wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and\ntold her about Blandon’s alert and his own subsequent\nobservations.\n   By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene.\nClay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that\nofficer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.\nClay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building\nand took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon’s and\nClavijo’s apartments were located. They met Blandon in\nthe hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.\n   Asked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated\nthat, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a\ntall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and\nlooking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo’s\ncar, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.2\n——————\n  2 The box, which Clay found on the ground near where she first en-\n\ncountered Perry, contained car-stereo speakers. App. 177a–178a.\n4                   PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Clay asked Blandon for a more specific description of the\nman. Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the\nperson she saw breaking into Clavijo’s car was standing in\nthe parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry’s arrest\nfollowed this identification.\n   About a month later, the police showed Blandon a pho-\ntographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked\nher to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo’s car.\nBlandon was unable to identify Perry.\n                              B\n   Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with\none count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of\ncriminal mischief.3 Before trial, he moved to suppress\nBlandon’s identification on the ground that admitting it at\ntrial would violate due process. Blandon witnessed what\namounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot,\nPerry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would\nidentify him as the culprit. Id., at 15a–16a.\n   The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion.\nId., at 82a–88a. To determine whether due process pro-\nhibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at\ntrial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions in-\nstruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must de-\ncide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive\nidentification procedure. Id., at 85a. If they did, the court\nmust next consider whether the improper identification\nprocedure so tainted the resulting identification as to\nrender it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. Ibid.\n(citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977)).\n   Perry’s challenge, the Superior Court concluded, failed\nat step one: Blandon’s identification of Perry on the night\n——————\n  3 The theft charge was based on the taking of items from Clavijo’s car,\n\nwhile the criminal mischief count was founded on the shattering of\nClavijo’s car window.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the crime did not result from an unnecessarily sugges-\ntive procedure “manufacture[d] . . . by the police.” App.\n86a–87a. Blandon pointed to Perry “spontaneously,” the\ncourt noted, “without any inducement from the police.”\nId., at 85a–86a. Clay did not ask Blandon whether the\nman standing in the parking lot was the man Blandon had\nseen breaking into Clavijo’s car. Ibid. Nor did Clay ask\nBlandon to move to the window from which she had ob-\nserved the break-in. Id., at 86a.\n   The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons\nto question the accuracy of Blandon’s identification: the\nparking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was stand-\ning next to a police officer; Perry was the only African-\nAmerican man in the vicinity; and Blandon was unable,\nlater, to pick Perry out of a photographic array. Id., at\n86a–87a. But “[b]ecause the police procedures were not\nunnecessarily suggestive,” the court ruled that the relia-\nbility of Blandon’s testimony was for the jury to consider.\nId., at 87a.\n   At the ensuing trial, Blandon and Clay testified to\nBlandon’s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry\nguilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.\n   On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissi-\nbility of Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The trial\ncourt erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial show-\ning that the police arranged the suggestive identification\nprocedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued,\nsuffice to trigger the court’s duty to evaluate the reliability\nof the resulting identification before allowing presentation\nof the evidence to the jury.\n   The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s\nargument and affirmed his conviction. Id., at 9a–11a.\nOnly where the police employ suggestive identification\ntechniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause\nrequire a trial court to assess the reliability of identifica-\ntion evidence before permitting a jury to consider it.

See Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586, 594, n. (2009)\n(“Our legal system . . . is built on the premise that it is the\nprovince of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing\nwitnesses.”). Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair\nthat its admission violates fundamental conceptions of\njustice,” Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352\n(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we im-\nposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See,\ne.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (Due\nprocess prohibits the State’s “knowin[g] use [of] false\nevidence,” because such use violates “any concept of or-\ndered liberty.”).\n   Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated\nhere, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving police-\narranged identification procedures. In Stovall v. Denno,\n388 U. S. 293 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness\nidentified the defendant as her assailant after police offic-\ners brought the defendant to the witness’ hospital room.\nId., at 295. At the time the witness made the identifica-\ntion, the defendant—the only African-American in the\nroom—was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.\nIbid. Although the police-arranged showup was undenia-\nbly suggestive, the Court held that no due process viola-\ntion occurred. Id., at 302. Crucial to the Court’s decision\nwas the procedure’s necessity: The witness was the only\nperson who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the\nwitness could not leave her hospital room; and it was\nuncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant\nin more neutral circumstances. Ibid.\n   A year later, in Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377\n(1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to\npolice use of a photographic array. When a witness identi-\n8                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the\nCourt ruled, the identification should be suppressed only\nwhere “the photographic identification procedure was so\n[unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very sub-\nstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Id., at\n384–385. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal\nBureau of Investigation agents in Simmons was both\nnecessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identifi-\ncation, the Court rejected the defendant’s due process\nchallenge to admission of the identification. Id., at 385–\n386. In contrast, the Court held in Foster v. California,\n394 U. S. 440 (1969), that due process required the exclu-\nsion of an eyewitness identification obtained through\npolice-arranged procedures that “made it all but inevitable\nthat [the witness] would identify [the defendant].” Id., at\n443.\n   Synthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.\nBiggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and reiterated in Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), the approach appropri-\nately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause\nrequires suppression of an eyewitness identification taint-\ned by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first,\nthat due process concerns arise only when law enforce-\nment officers use an identification procedure that is both\nsuggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409\nU. S., at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure,\nthe Court next said, suppression of the resulting identifi-\ncation is not the inevitable consequence. Brathwaite, 432\nU. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198–199.\n   A rule requiring automatic exclusion, the Court rea-\nsoned, would “g[o] too far,” for it would “kee[p] evidence\nfrom the jury that is reliable and relevant,” and “may\nresult, on occasion, in the guilty going free.” Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 112; see id., at 113 (when an “identification is\nreliable despite an unnecessarily suggestive [police] identi-\nfication procedure,” automatic exclusion “is a Draconian\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction,” one “that may frustrate rather than promote\njustice”).\n   Instead of mandating a per se exclusionary rule, the\nCourt held that the Due Process Clause requires courts to\nassess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police\nconduct created a “substantial likelihood of misidentifi-\ncation.” Biggers, 409 U. S., at 201; see Brathwaite, 432\nU. S., at 116. “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identifica-\ntion] is the linchpin” of that evaluation, the Court stated\nin Brathwaite. Id., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a\nwitness’] ability to make an accurate identification” are\n“outweighed by the corrupting effect” of law enforcement\nsuggestion, the identification should be suppressed. Id., at\n114, 116. Otherwise, the evidence (if admissible in all\nother respects) should be submitted to the jury.5\n   Applying this “totality of the circumstances” approach,\nid., at 110, the Court held in Biggers that law enforce-\nment’s use of an unnecessarily suggestive showup did not\nrequire suppression of the victim’s identification of her\nassailant. 409 U. S., at 199–200. Notwithstanding the\nimproper procedure, the victim’s identification was relia-\nble: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time\nunder adequate light, provided police with a detailed de-\nscription of her attacker long before the showup, and\nhad “no doubt” that the defendant was the person she had\nseen. Id., at 200 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSimilarly, the Court concluded in Brathwaite that police\nuse of an unnecessarily suggestive photo array did not\n——————\n  5 Among  “factors to be considered” in evaluating a witness’ “ability to\nmake an accurate identification,” the Court listed: “the opportunity of\nthe witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’\ndegree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal,\nthe level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time\nbetween the crime and the confrontation.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432\nU. S. 98, 114 (1977) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 199–200\n(1972)).\n10               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire exclusion of the resulting identification. 432 U. S.,\nat 114–117. The witness, an undercover police officer,\nviewed the defendant in good light for several minutes,\nprovided a thorough description of the suspect, and was\ncertain of his identification. Id., at 115. Hence, the “indi-\ncators of [the witness’] ability to make an accurate identi-\nfication [were] hardly outweighed by the corrupting effect\nof the challenged identification.” Id., at 116.\n                              B\n  Perry concedes that, in contrast to every case in the\nStovall line, law enforcement officials did not arrange the\nsuggestive circumstances surrounding Blandon’s identifi-\ncation. See Brief for Petitioner 34; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(counsel for Perry) (“[W]e do not allege any manipulation\nor intentional orchestration by the police.”). He contends,\nhowever, that it was mere happenstance that each of\nthe Stovall cases involved improper police action. The\nrationale underlying our decisions, Perry asserts, supports\na rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evi-\ndence for reliability any time an identification is made\nunder suggestive circumstances. We disagree.\n  Perry’s argument depends, in large part, on the Court’s\nstatement in Brathwaite that “reliability is the linchpin in\ndetermining the admissibility of identification testimony.”\n432 U. S., at 114. If reliability is the linchpin of admissi-\nbility under the Due Process Clause, Perry maintains, it\nshould make no difference whether law enforcement was\nresponsible for creating the suggestive circumstances that\nmarred the identification.\n  Perry has removed our statement in Brathwaite from its\nmooring, and thereby attributes to the statement a mean-\ning a fair reading of our opinion does not bear. As just\nexplained, supra, at 8–9, the Brathwaite Court’s reference\nto reliability appears in a portion of the opinion concerning\nthe appropriate remedy when the police use an unneces-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsarily suggestive identification procedure.      The Court\nadopted a judicial screen for reliability as a course prefer-\nable to a per se rule requiring exclusion of identification\nevidence whenever law enforcement officers employ an\nimproper procedure. The due process check for reliability,\nBrathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the\ndefendant establishes improper police conduct. The very\npurpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriv-\ning the jury of identification evidence that is reliable,\nnotwithstanding improper police conduct. 432 U. S., at\n112–113.6\n   Perry’s contention that improper police action was not\nessential to the reliability check Brathwaite required is\nechoed by the dissent. Post, at 3–4. Both ignore a key\npremise of the Brathwaite decision: A primary aim of ex-\ncluding identification evidence obtained under unneces-\nsarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter\nlaw enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and\nphoto arrays in the first place. See 432 U. S., at 112.\nAlerted to the prospect that identification evidence im-\nproperly obtained may be excluded, the Court reasoned,\npolice officers will “guard against unnecessarily suggestive\nprocedures.” Ibid. This deterrence rationale is inapposite\nin cases, like Perry’s, in which the police engaged in no\nimproper conduct.\n   Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1 (1970), another deci-\nsion in the Stovall line, similarly shows that the Court has\nlinked the due process check, not to suspicion of eyewit-\nness testimony generally, but only to improper police\narrangement of the circumstances surrounding an identi-\n——————\n  6 The Court’s description of the question presented in Brathwaite\n\nassumes that improper state action occurred: “[Does] the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment compe[l] the exclusion, in a state\ncriminal trial, apart from any consideration of reliability, of pretrial\nidentification evidence obtained by a police procedure that was both\nsuggestive and unnecessary.” 432 U. S., at 99.\n12                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfication. The defendants in Coleman contended that a\nwitness’ in-court identifications violated due process,\nbecause a pretrial stationhouse lineup was “so unduly\nprejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification\nas fatally to taint [the later identifications].” 399 U. S., at\n3 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected this argument.\nId., at 5–6 (plurality opinion), 13–14 (Black, J., concur-\nring), 22, n. 2 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), 28, n. 2 (Stewart,\nJ., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the\nplurality explained, because nothing “the police said or did\nprompted [the witness’] virtually spontaneous identifica-\ntion of [the defendants].” Id., at 6. True, Coleman was the\nonly person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality\nnoted, but “nothing in the record show[ed] that he was\nrequired to do so.” Ibid. See also Colorado v. Connelly,\n479 U. S. 157, 163, 167 (1986) (Where the “crucial element\nof police overreaching” is missing, the admissibility of an\nallegedly unreliable confession is “a matter to be governed\nby the evidentiary laws of the forum, . . . and not by the\nDue Process Clause.”).\n   Perry and the dissent place significant weight on United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), describing it as a\ndecision not anchored to improper police conduct. See\nBrief for Petitioner 12, 15, 21–22, 28; post, at 2–4, 8–10.\nIn fact, the risk of police rigging was the very danger to\nwhich the Court responded in Wade when it recognized a\ndefendant’s right to counsel at postindictment, police-\norganized identification procedures. 388 U. S., at 233,\n235–236. “[T]he confrontation compelled by the State\nbetween the accused and the victim or witnesses,” the\nCourt began, “is peculiarly riddled with innumerable\ndangers and variable factors which might seriously, even\ncrucially, derogate from a fair trial.” Id., at 228 (emphasis\nadded). “A major factor contributing to the high incidence\nof miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification,” the\nCourt continued, “has been the degree of suggestion inher-\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nent in the manner in which the prosecution presents\nthe suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). To illustrate the improper suggestion it\nwas concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed\nlineups where “all in the lineup but the suspect were\nknown to the identifying witness, . . . the other partici-\npants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance\nto the suspect, . . . only the suspect was required to wear\ndistinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, . . .\nthe witness is told by the police that they have caught the\nculprit after which the defendant is brought before the\nwitness alone or is viewed in jail, . . . the suspect is point-\ned out before or during a lineup, . . . the participants in the\nlineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits\nonly the suspect.” Id., at 233 (footnotes omitted). Beyond\ngenuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices\nprompted the Court to extend a defendant’s right to coun-\nsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups. Id., at\n235.\n   Perry’s argument, reiterated by the dissent, thus lacks\nsupport in the case law he cites. Moreover, his position\nwould open the door to judicial preview, under the banner\nof due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifica-\ntions. External suggestion is hardly the only factor that\ncasts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness’ tes-\ntimony. As one of Perry’s amici points out, many other\nfactors bear on “the likelihood of misidentification,” post,\nat 9—for example, the passage of time between exposure\nto and identification of the defendant, whether the witness\nwas under stress when he first encountered the suspect,\nhow much time the witness had to observe the suspect,\nhow far the witness was from the suspect, whether the\nsuspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and\nthe witness.

Even\nif we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from\nother factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evi-\ndence, Perry’s limitation would still involve trial courts,\nroutinely, in preliminary examinations. Most eyewitness\nidentifications involve some element of suggestion. In-\ndeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifi-\ncations volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve\nsuggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness\nidentifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a\nphotograph of the defendant in the press captioned “theft\nsuspect,” or hearing a radio report implicating the defend-\nant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the\ndefendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the\nday and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circum-\nstances might have “suggested” to the witness that the\ndefendant was the person the witness observed commit-\nting the crime.\n                            C\n  In urging a broadly applicable due process check on\neyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewit-\nness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of\nevidence. See Brief for Petitioner 17–22 (citing studies\nshowing that eyewitness misidentifications are the leading\ncause of wrongful convictions); Brief for American Psycho-\nlogical Association as Amicus Curiae 14–17 (describing\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

See also post, at 14–17.\nWe do not doubt either the importance or the fallibility of\neyewitness identifications. Indeed, in recognizing that\ndefendants have a constitutional right to counsel at\npostindictment police lineups, we observed that “the an-\nnals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken\nidentification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228.\n   We have concluded in other contexts, however, that the\npotential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone\nrender its introduction at the defendant’s trial fundamen-\ntally unfair. See, e.g., Ventris, 556 U. S., at 594, n. (declin-\ning to “craft a broa[d] exclusionary rule for uncorroborated\nstatements obtained [from jailhouse snitches],” even\nthough “rewarded informant testimony” may be inherently\nuntrustworthy); Dowling, 493 U. S., at 353 (rejecting ar-\ngument that the introduction of evidence concerning\nacquitted conduct is fundamentally unfair because such\nevidence is “inherently unreliable”). We reach a similar\nconclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does\nnot, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a\ndue process rule requiring a trial court to screen such\nevidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess\nits creditworthiness.\n   Our unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process\nas Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our\nrecognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally de-\ntermines the reliability of evidence. See supra, at 7. We\nalso take account of other safeguards built into our adver-\nsary system that caution juries against placing undue\nweight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.\nThese protections include the defendant’s Sixth Amend-\nment right to confront the eyewitness. See Maryland v.\nCraig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (“The central concern of\nthe Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reliability of the\nevidence against a criminal defendant.”). Another is the\n16                   PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant’s right to the effective assistance of an attorney,\nwho can expose the flaws in the eyewitness’ testimony\nduring cross-examination and focus the jury’s attention on\nthe fallibility of such testimony during opening and closing\narguments. Eyewitness-specific jury instructions, which\nmany federal and state courts have adopted,7 likewise\nwarn the jury to take care in appraising identification\nevidence. See, e.g., United States v. Telfaire, 469 F. 2d\n552, 558–559 (CADC 1972) (per curiam) (D. C. Circuit\nModel Jury Instructions) (“If the identification by the\nwitness may have been influenced by the circumstances\nunder which the defendant was presented to him for iden-\ntification, you should scrutinize the identification with\ngreat care.”).

The constitutional requirement that\nthe government prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt also impedes convictions based on dubi-\nous identification evidence.\n   State and federal rules of evidence, moreover, permit\ntrial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact\nor potential for misleading the jury. See, e.g., Fed. Rule\nEvid. 403; N. H. Rule Evid. 403 (2011). See also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 19–22 (inquiring whether the standard Perry\nseeks differs materially from the one set out in Rule 403).\nIn appropriate cases, some States also permit defendants\nto present expert testimony on the hazards of eyewitness\nidentification evidence. See, e.g., State v. Clopten, 2009\nUT 84, A33, 223 P. 3d 1103, 1113 (“We expect . . . that in\ncases involving eyewitness identification of strangers or\nnear-strangers, trial courts will routinely admit expert\ntestimony [on the dangers of such evidence].”).\n   Many of the safeguards just noted were at work at\nPerry’s trial. During her opening statement, Perry’s court-\nappointed attorney cautioned the jury about the vulnera-\nbility of Blandon’s identification. App. 115a (Blandon,\n“the eyewitness that the State needs you to believe[,] can’t\npick [Perry] out of a photo array. How carefully did she\nreally see what was going on? . . . How well could she\nreally see him?”). While cross-examining Blandon and\nOfficer Clay, Perry’s attorney constantly brought up the\nweaknesses of Blandon’s identification. She highlighted:\n(1) the significant distance between Blandon’s window and\nthe parking lot, id., at 226a; (2) the lateness of the hour,\nid., at 225a; (3) the van that partly obstructed Blandon’s\nview, id., at 226a; (4) Blandon’s concession that she was\n“so scared [she] really didn’t pay attention” to what Perry\nwas wearing, id., at 233a; (5) Blandon’s inability to de-\nscribe Perry’s facial features or other identifying marks,\nid., at 205a, 233a–235a; (6) Blandon’s failure to pick Perry\n18               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nout of a photo array, id., at 235a; and (7) Perry’s position\nnext to a uniformed, gun-bearing police officer at the\nmoment Blandon made her identification, id., at 202a–\n205a. Perry’s counsel reminded the jury of these frailties\nduring her summation.          Id., at 374a–375a (Blandon\n“wasn’t able to tell you much about who she saw . . . . She\ncouldn’t pick [Perry] out of a lineup, out of a photo array\n. . . . [Blandon said] [t]hat guy that was with the police\nofficer, that’s who was circling. Again, think about the\ncontext with the guns, the uniforms. Powerful, powerful\ncontext clues.”).\n     After closing arguments, the trial court read the jury a\nlengthy instruction on identification testimony and the\nfactors the jury should consider when evaluating it. Id.,\nat 399a–401a. The court also instructed the jury that\nthe defendant’s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, id., at 390a, 392a, 395a–396a, and specifically\ncautioned that “one of the things the State must prove\n[beyond a reasonable doubt] is the identification of the\ndefendant as the person who committed the offense,” id.,\nat 398a–399a.\n    Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal\ntrials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry’s case,\nwe hold that the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness\ntestimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its\nreliability, did not render Perry’s trial fundamentally\nunfair.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the New\nHampshire courts’ appraisal of our decisions.

Our cases\nthus establish a clear rule: The admission at trial of\nout-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from imper-\nmissibly suggestive circumstances that pose a very substan-\ntial likelihood of misidentification violates due process.\nThe Court today announces that that rule does not even\n“com[e] into play” unless the suggestive circumstances are\nimproperly “police-arranged.” Ante, at 2, 11.\n   Our due process concern, however, arises not from the\nact of suggestion, but rather from the corrosive effects of\nsuggestion on the reliability of the resulting identification.\nBy rendering protection contingent on improper police\narrangement of the suggestive circumstances, the Court\neffectively grafts a mens rea inquiry onto our rule. The\nCourt’s holding enshrines a murky distinction—between\nsuggestive confrontations intentionally orchestrated by\nthe police and, as here, those inadvertently caused by\npolice actions—that will sow confusion. It ignores our\nprecedents’ acute sensitivity to the hazards of intentional\nand unintentional suggestion alike and unmoors our rule\nfrom the very interest it protects, inviting arbitrary re-\n2                    PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsults. And it recasts the driving force of our decisions as\nan interest in police deterrence, rather than reliability.\nBecause I see no warrant for declining to assess the cir-\ncumstances of this case under our ordinary approach, I\nrespectfully dissent.1\n                               I\n   The “driving force” behind United States v. Wade, 388\nU. S. 218 (1967), Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263\n(1967), and Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967), was\n“the Court’s concern with the problems of eyewitness\nidentification”—specifically, “the concern that the jury not\nhear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has as-\npects of reliability.” Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98,\n111–112 (1977). We have pointed to the “ ‘formidable’ ”\nnumber of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identi-\nfication” in the annals of criminal law. Wade, 388 U. S., at\n228. We have warned of the “vagaries” and “ ‘proverbi-\nally untrustworthy’ ” nature of eyewitness identifications.\nIbid. And we have singled out a “major factor contrib-\nuting” to that proverbial unreliability: “the suggestibility\ninherent in the context of the pretrial identification.” Id.,\nat 228, 235.\n   Our precedents make no distinction between intentional\nand unintentional suggestion. To the contrary, they ex-\nplicitly state that “[s]uggestion can be created intentional-\nly or unintentionally in many subtle ways.” Id., at 229.\nRather than equate suggestive conduct with misconduct,\nwe specifically have disavowed the assumption that sug-\ngestive influences may only be “the result of police proce-\ndures intentionally designed to prejudice an accused.” Id.,\nat 235; see also id., at 236 (noting “grave potential for\nprejudice, intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup”); id., at\n——————\n  1 Because the facts of this case involve police action, I do not reach the\n\nquestion whether due process is triggered in situations involving no\npolice action whatsoever.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Illinois, 434\nU. S. 220, 224 (1977). The implication is that even police\nacting with the best of intentions can inadvertently signal\n“ ‘that’s the man.’ ” Wade, 388 U. S., at 236; see also Kirby\nv. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 690–691 (1972) (“[I]t is always\nnecessary to ‘scrutinize any pretrial confrontation . . .’ ”).2\n    In Wade itself, we noted that the “potential for improper\ninfluence [in pretrial confrontations] is illustrated by the\ncircumstances . . . [i]n the present case.” 388 U. S., at\n233–234. We then highlighted not the lineup procedure,\nbut rather a preprocedure encounter: The two witnesses\nwho later identified Wade in the lineup had seen Wade\noutside while “await[ing] assembly of the lineup.” Id., at\n234. Wade had been standing in the hallway, which hap-\npened to be “observable to the witnesses through an open\ndoor.” Ibid. One witness saw Wade “within sight of\nan FBI agent”; the other saw him “in the custody of the\nagent.” Ibid. In underscoring the hazards of these cir-\ncumstances, we made no mention of whether the encoun-\nter had been arranged; indeed, the facts suggest that it\nwas not.\n    More generally, our precedents focus not on the act of\nsuggestion, but on suggestion’s “corrupting effect” on\n——————\n  2 Wade held that the dangers of pretrial identification procedures\n\nnecessitated a right to counsel; that same day, Stovall held that a\ndefendant ineligible for the Wade rule was still entitled to challenge the\nconfrontation as a due process violation. Because the two were com-\npanion cases advancing interrelated rules to avoid unfairness at trial\nresulting from suggestive pretrial confrontations, Wade’s exposition of\nthe dangers of suggestiveness informs both contexts. See Manson v.\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S. 98, 112 (1977) (“Wade and its companion cases\nreflect the concern that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless\nthat evidence has aspects of reliability”).\n4                 PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreliability. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Eyewitness\nevidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we have\nexplained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the\nadversary process. An eyewitness who has made an iden-\ntification often becomes convinced of its accuracy. “Re-\ngardless of how the initial misidentification comes about,\nthe witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the\nimage of the photograph rather than of the person actually\nseen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent . . .\ncourtroom identification.” Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (emphasis added); see also\nWade, 388 U. S., at 229 (witness is “not likely” to recant).\nSuggestion bolsters that confidence.\n   At trial, an eyewitness’ artificially inflated confidence in\nan identification’s accuracy complicates the jury’s task of\nassessing witness credibility and reliability. It also im-\npairs the defendant’s ability to attack the eyewitness’\ncredibility. Stovall, 388 U. S., at 298. That in turn jeop-\nardizes the defendant’s basic right to subject his accuser\nto meaningful cross-examination. See Wade, 388 U. S.,\nat 235 (“[C]ross-examination . . . cannot be viewed as an\nabsolute assurance of accuracy and reliability . . . where so\nmany variables and pitfalls exist”). The end result of\nsuggestion, whether intentional or unintentional, is to\nfortify testimony bearing directly on guilt that juries find\nextremely convincing and are hesitant to discredit. See\nid., at 224 (“[A]t pretrial proceedings . . . the results might\nwell settle the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a\nmere formality”); Gilbert, 388 U. S., at 273 (“[T]he witness’\ntestimony of his lineup identification will enhance the\nimpact of his in-court identification on the jury”).\n   Consistent with our focus on reliability, we have de-\nclined to adopt a per se rule excluding all suggestive iden-\ntifications. Instead, “reliability is the linchpin” in deciding\nadmissibility. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. We have\nexplained that a suggestive identification procedure “does\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Biggers, 409\nU. S. 188, 198–199 (1972) (rejecting the proposition that\n“unnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the exclusion\nof evidence”). “Suggestive confrontations are disapproved\nbecause they increase the likelihood of misidentifica-\ntion”—and “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which\nviolates a defendant’s right to due process.” Id., at 198;\nsee also United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F. 2d\n397, 406 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.) (“The due process clause\napplies only to proceedings which result in a deprivation of\nlife, liberty or property. . . . [I]f a constitutional violation\nresults from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in\nthe police station”). In short, “ ‘what the Stovall due pro-\ncess right protects is an evidentiary interest.’ ” Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 113, n. 14.\n   To protect that evidentiary interest, we have applied a\ntwo-step inquiry: First, the defendant has the burden of\nshowing that the eyewitness identification was derived\nthrough “impermissibly suggestive” means.3 Simmons,\n390 U. S., at 384. Second, if the defendant meets that\nburden, courts consider whether the identification was\n——————\n   3 Our precedents refer to “impermissibly,” “unnecessarily,” and “un-\n\nduly” suggestive circumstances interchangeably. See, e.g., Brathwaite,\n432 U. S., at 105, n. 8, 107–108, 110, 112–113 (“impermissibly” and\n“unnecessarily”); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196–199 (1972) (“im-\npermissibly” and “unnecessarily”); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 3–\n5 (1970) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”); Simmons v. United States, 390\nU. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”). The Circuits\nhave followed suit. E.g., Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6\n1986) (“unduly”); Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980)\n(“unnecessarily or impermissibly”). All reinforce our focus not on the\nact of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness rises to such a\nlevel that it undermines reliability. Police machinations can heighten\nthe likelihood of misidentification, but they are no prerequisite to\nfinding a confrontation “so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a\nvery substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification.” Simmons, 390\nU. S., at 384.\n6                 PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreliable under the totality of the circumstances. That step\nentails considering the witness’ opportunity to view the\nperpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description,\nlevel of certainty, and the time between the crime and\npretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against\nthe “corrupting effect of the suggestive identification.”\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S., at 108, 114. Most identifications\nwill be admissible. The standard of “fairness as required\nby the Due Process Clause,” id., at 113, however, demands\nthat a subset of the most unreliable identifications—those\ncarrying a “ ‘very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentifi-\ncation’ ”—will be excluded. Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   The majority today creates a novel and significant limi-\ntation on our longstanding rule: Eyewitness identifications\nso impermissibly suggestive that they pose a very sub-\nstantial likelihood of an unreliable identification will be\ndeemed inadmissible at trial only if the suggestive circum-\nstances were “police-arranged.” Ante, at 2. Absent “im-\nproper police arrangement,” “improper police conduct,” or\n“rigging,” the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not\neven “com[e] into play.” Ante, at 2, 11. I cannot agree.\n   The majority does not simply hold that an eyewitness\nidentification must be the product of police action to trig-\nger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather, the majority\nmaintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise\nto the identification must be “police-arranged,” “police\nrigg[ed],” “police-designed,” or “police-organized.” Ante, at\n2, 12–13. Those terms connote a degree of intentional\norchestration or manipulation. See Brief for Respondent\n19 (no indication that police “deliberately tried to manipu-\nlate any evidence”); Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 18 (“[N]o one deliberately arranged the circum-\nstances to obtain an identification”). The majority cate-\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

The majority thus\nappears to graft a mens rea requirement onto our existing\nrule.4\n  As this case illustrates, police intent is now paramount.\nAs the Court acknowledges, Perry alleges an “accidental\nshowup.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis added); see\nante, at 4. He was the only African-American at the scene\nof the crime standing next to a police officer. For the\nmajority, the fact that the police did not intend that\nshowup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the course\nof a police procedure, ends the inquiry. The police were\nquestioning the eyewitness, Blandon, about the perpetra-\ntor’s identity, and were intentionally detaining Perry in\nthe parking lot—but had not intended for Blandon to\nidentify the perpetrator from her window. Presumably, in\nthe majority’s view, had the police asked Blandon to move\nto the window to identify the perpetrator, that could have\nmade all the difference. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37.\n  I note, however, that the majority leaves what is re-\nquired by its arrangement-focused inquiry less than clear.\nIn parts, the opinion suggests that the police must arrange\nan identification “procedure,” regardless of whether they\n“inten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.” Ante,\nat 2, n. 1; see also ante, at 7–8. Elsewhere, it indicates\nthat the police must arrange the “suggestive circum-\nstances” that lead the witness to identify the accused. See\n——————\n  4 The majority denies that it has imposed a mens rea requirement, see\n\nante, at 2, n. 1, but by confining our due process concerns to police-\narranged identification procedures, that is just what it has done. The\nmajority acknowledges that “whether or not [the police] intended the\narranged procedure to be suggestive” is irrelevant under our prece-\ndents, ibid., but still places dispositive weight on whether or not the\npolice intended the procedure itself.\n8                PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nante, at 1–2, 10–11, 18–19. Still elsewhere it refers to “im-\nproper” police conduct, ante, at 1–2, 9–12, connoting bad\nfaith. Does police “arrangement” relate to the procedure, the\nsuggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do\nsuggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the\nsame concerns? If the police need not “inten[d] the ar-\nranged procedure to be suggestive,” ante, at 2, n. 1, what\nmakes the police action “improper”? And does that mean\nthat good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a\npolice-arranged lineup can be “impermissibly sugges-\ntive”? If no, the majority runs headlong into Wade. If\nyes, on what basis—if not deterrence—does it distinguish\nunintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental\nconfrontation?\n   The arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless con-\nfusion. If the police had called Perry and Blandon to\nthe police station for interviews, and Blandon saw Perry\nbeing questioned, would that be sufficiently “improper\npolice arrangement”? If Perry had voluntarily come to the\npolice station, would that change the result? Today’s\nopinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry\ncontingent on a murky line-drawing exercise. Whereas\nour two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability—and\ncould account for the spontaneity of the witness’ identifi-\ncation and degree of police manipulation under the total-\nity of the circumstances—today’s opinion forecloses that\nassessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.\n                             B\n  The majority regards its limitation on our two-step rule\nas compelled by precedent. Its chief rationale, ante, at 7–\n13, is that none of our prior cases involved situations\nwhere the police “did not arrange the suggestive circum-\nstances.” Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2, n. 1. That is not\nnecessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional en-\ncounter highlighted in Wade. But even if it were true, it is\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              9\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nunsurprising. The vast majority of eyewitness identifica-\ntions that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are\nobtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays\narranged by the police. Our precedents reflect that practi-\ncal reality.\n   It is also beside the point. Our due process concerns\nwere not predicated on the source of suggestiveness.\nRather, “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which\nviolates a defendant’s right to due process,” Biggers, 409\nU. S., at 198, and we are concerned with suggestion in-\nsofar as it has “corrupting effect[s]” on the identification’s\nreliability. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Accordingly,\nwhether the police have created the suggestive circum-\nstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting iden-\ntification raises the same due process concerns. It is no\nmore or less likely to misidentify the perpetrator. It is\nno more or less powerful to the jury. And the defendant\nis no more or less equipped to challenge the identifica-\ntion through cross-examination or prejudiced at trial. The\narrangement-focused inquiry thus untethers our doctrine\nfrom the very “ ‘evidentiary interest’ ” it was designed to\nprotect, inviting arbitrary results. Id., at 113, n. 14.\n   Indeed, it is the majority’s approach that lies in tension\nwith our precedents. Whereas we previously disclaimed\nthe crabbed view of suggestiveness as “the result of po-\nlice procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an ac-\ncused,” Wade, 388 U. S., at 235, the majority’s focus on\npolice rigging and improper conduct will revive it. Where-\nas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and unin-\ntentional suggestiveness alike, see supra, at 2–3, today’s\ndecision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated\nsuggestive confrontations. We once described the “pri-\nmary evil to be avoided” as the likelihood of misidentification.\nBiggers, 409 U. S., at 198. Today’s decision, however,\nmeans that even if that primary evil is at its apex, we\nneed not avoid it at all so long as the suggestive circum-\n10               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nstances do not stem from improper police arrangement.\n                              C\n   The majority gives several additional reasons for why\napplying our due process rule beyond improperly police-\narranged circumstances is unwarranted. In my view, none\nwithstands close inspection.\n   First, the majority insists that our precedents “aim to\ndeter police from rigging identification procedures,” so our\nrule should be limited to applications that advance that\n“primary aim” and “key premise.” Ante, at 2, 11 (citing\nBrathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112). That mischaracterizes our\ncases. We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite because\nBrathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking\ndeterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence de-\nmanded a per se rule excluding all suggestive identifica-\ntions. He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of\nsuggestive identifications under the totality of the circum-\nstances, “cannot be expected to have a significant deter-\nrent impact.” Id., at 111.\n   We rebutted Brathwaite’s criticism in language the\nmajority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing\nBrathwaite’s argument, we acknowledged “several inter-\nests to be considered.” Ibid. We then compared the two\nrules under each interest: First, we noted the “driving\nforce” behind Wade and its companion cases—“the concern\nthat the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that\nevidence has aspects of reliability”—and found both ap-\nproaches “responsive to this concern,” but the per se rule\nto go “too far” in suppressing reliable evidence. 432 U. S.,\nat 111–112. We noted a “second factor”—deterrence—\nconceding that the per se rule had “more significant deter-\nrent effect,” but noting that our rule “also has an influence\non police behavior.” Id., at 112. Finally, we noted a “third\nfactor”—“the effect on the administration of justice”—\ndescribing the per se rule as having serious drawbacks on\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthis front. Ibid. That was no list of “primary aim[s].” Nor\nwas it a ringing endorsement of the primacy of deterrence.\nWe simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite,\nthat our rule was not without deterrence benefits. To\nthe contrary, we clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary\nconcern to reliability, the “driving force” of our doctrine. It\nis a stretch to claim that our rule cannot apply wherever\n“[t]his deterrence rationale is inapposite.” Ante, at 11.\n   Second, the majority states that Coleman v. Alabama,\n399 U. S. 1 (1970), held that “[n]o due process violation\noccurred . . . because nothing ‘the police said or did\nprompted’ ” the identification and shows that our rule is\nlinked “only to improper police arrangement.” Ante, at\n11–12. That misreads the decision. In Coleman, the\npetitioners challenged a witness’ in-court identification of\nthem at trial on grounds that it had been tainted by a\nsuggestive pretrial lineup. We held that no due process\nviolation occurred because the in-court identification ap-\npeared to be “entirely based upon observations at the\ntime of the assault and not at all induced by the conduct of\nthe lineup,” and thus could not be said to stem from an\nidentification procedure “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as\nto give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.’ ” 399 U. S., at 5–6 (plurality opinion).\nWe then dismissed each of the asserted suggestive influ-\nences as having had no bearing on the identification at all:\nThe petitioners claimed that the police intimated to the\nwitness that his attackers were in the lineup; we found the\nrecord “devoid of evidence that anything the police said or\ndid” induced the identification. Id., at 6. The petitioners\nclaimed that they alone were made to say certain words;\nwe found that the witness identified petitioners before\neither said anything. One petitioner claimed he was\nsingled out to wear a hat; we found that the witness’\nidentification “d[id] not appear . . . based on the fact that\nhe remembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat.” Ibid.\n12               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nThus, far from indicating that improper police conduct is a\nprerequisite, Coleman merely held that there had been no\ninfluence on the witness. In fact, in concluding that the\nlineup was not “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as to give\nrise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misi-\ndentification,’ ” Coleman indicates that the two-step in-\nquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of\npolice misconduct.\n   Third, the majority emphasizes that we should rely on\nthe jury to determine the reliability of evidence. See ante,\nat 15–16. But our cases are rooted in the assumption that\neyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation\nthat it is “the province of the jury to weigh the credibility\nof competing witnesses.” Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586,\n594, n. (2009). As noted, jurors find eyewitness evidence\nunusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility\nis hindered by a witness’ false confidence in the accuracy\nof his or her identification. That disability in no way de-\npends on the intent behind the suggestive circumstances.\n   The majority’s appeals to protecting the jury’s domain,\nmoreover, appeared in dissent after dissent from our de-\ncisions. See Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440, 447\n(1969) (Black, J., dissenting) (“[T]he jury is the sole tribu-\nnal to weigh and determine facts” and “must . . . be al-\nlowed to hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it\ncan recognize the truth”); Simmons, 390 U. S., at 395\n(Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The\nweight of the evidence . . . is not a question for the Court\nbut for the jury”). So too does the majority’s assurance\nthat other constitutional protections like the Sixth\nAmendment rights to compulsory process and confronta-\ntion can suffice to expose unreliable identifications. Com-\npare ante, at 6, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448–449 (Black,\nJ., dissenting) (“The Constitution sets up its own stand-\nards of unfairness in criminal trials,” including the Sixth\nAmendment “right to compulsory process” and “right to\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconfront . . . witnesses”). So too does the majority’s appeal\nto leave reliability to the rules of evidence. Compare ante,\nat 17, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting)\n(“ ‘Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair\ntrials’ ”), and Stovall, 388 U. S., at 306 (Black, J., dissent-\ning) (“[T]he result . . . is to put into a constitutional mould\na rule of evidence”). Those arguments did not prevail\nthen; they should not prevail here.\n    Fourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule\nbeyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would\nentail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage\nin “preliminary judicial inquiry” into “most, if not all,\neyewitness identifications.” Ante, at 13, 18. But that is\ninaccurate. The burden of showing “impermissibly sug-\ngestive” circumstances is the defendant’s, so the objection\nfalls to the defendant to raise. And as is implicit in the\nmajority’s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules\nof evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial\ncourts will be entertaining defendants’ objections, pretrial\nor at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event.\nThe relevant question, then, is what the standard of ad-\nmissibility governing such objections should be. I see no\nreason to water down the standard for an equally sugges-\ntive and unreliable identification simply because the\nsuggestive confrontation was unplanned.\n    It bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for\nsuppression. The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to\ntestify before a jury. To date, Foster is the only case in\nwhich we have found a due process violation. 394 U. S., at\n443. There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal\nCircuits that, having seen no basis for an arrangement-\nbased distinction in our precedents, have long indicated\nthat due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identifi-\ncation procedures. See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117,\n128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506,\n1516 (CA1 1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6\n14               PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n1986); see also Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9\n1980). Today’s decision nonetheless precludes even the\npossibility that an unintended confrontation will meet\nthat bar, mandating summary dismissal of every such\nclaim at the threshold.\n   Finally, the majority questions how to “rationally dis-\ntinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the\nreliability of eyewitness evidence,” such as “poor vision” or\na prior “grudge,” ante, at 13–14, and more broadly, how to\ndistinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of argu-\nably unreliable evidence. Ante, at 14–15. Our precedents,\nhowever, did just that. We emphasized the “ ‘formidable\nnumber of instances in the records of English and Amer-\nican trials’ ” of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken\nidentification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228. We then observed\nthat “ ‘the influence of improper suggestion upon identify-\ning witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of\njustice than any other single factor.’ ” Id., at 229. More-\nover, the majority points to no other type of evidence that\nshares the rare confluence of characteristics that makes\neyewitness evidence a unique threat to the fairness of\ntrial. Jailhouse informants, cf. ante, at 15, unreliable as\nthey may be, are not similarly resistant to the traditional\ntools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are met\nwith particular skepticism by juries.\n   It would be one thing if the passage of time had cast\ndoubt on the empirical premises of our precedents. But\njust the opposite has happened. A vast body of scientific\nliterature has reinforced every concern our precedents\narticulated nearly a half-century ago, though it merits\nbarely a parenthetical mention in the majority opinion.\nAnte, at 14. Over the past three decades, more than two\nthousand studies related to eyewitness identification have\nbeen published. One state supreme court recently ap-\npointed a special master to conduct an exhaustive survey\nof the current state of the scientific evidence and conclud-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.
