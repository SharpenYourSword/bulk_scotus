Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided January 11, 2012\nPetitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drill-\n  ing platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California\n  coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility. Employee Juan\n  Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore plat-\n  form, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore\n  facility. His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the\n  Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33\n  U. S. C. \u00a7901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands\n  Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries \u201coccurring\n  as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]\u201d for the purpose of\n  extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b). The\n  Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that\n  \u00a71333(b) did not cover Valladolid\u2019s fatal injury because his accident\n  occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department\u2019s Benefits\n  Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting\n  tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA \u201cmust es-\n  tablish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive opera-\n  tions on the shelf.\u201d\nHeld: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a\n substantial nexus between his injury and his employer\u2019s extractive\n operations on the OCS. Pp. 3\u201314.\n    (a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of\n \u00a71333(b)\u2019s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress\n intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, \u00a71333(b) extends to all\n injuries that would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d operations on the\n OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be\n    flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have\n    been injured but for his traveling to the rig. In contrast, the Fifth\n    Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish \u201ca bright-\n    line geographic boundary,\u201d extending \u00a71333(b) coverage only to em-\n    ployees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the\n    waters above the OCS. Under its \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test, a welder in-\n    jured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligi-\n    ble for \u00a71333(b) benefits. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that \u00a71333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can es-\n    tablish a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between their injury and extractive op-\n    erations on the OCS. The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpre-\n    tation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to\n    those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS\n    and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\n    duration and nature. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Contrary to Pacific\u2019s position, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d\n    test is not the best interpretation of \u00a71333(b). Pp. 6\u201312.\n         (1) Nothing in the text of \u00a71333(b) suggests that an injury must\n    occur on the OCS. The provision has only two requirements: The ex-\n    tractive operations must be \u201cconducted on the [OCS],\u201d and the em-\n    ployee\u2019s injury must occur \u201cas the result of\u201d those operations. If, as\n    Pacific suggests, the purpose of \u00a71333(b) was to geographically limit\n    the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Con-\n    gress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from \u00a71333(b)\n    the words \u201cas the result of operations conducted.\u201d Moreover, Con-\n    gress\u2019 decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but\n    not in \u00a71333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit \u00a71333(b).\n    This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470\n    U. S. 414, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, nei-\n    ther of which held that \u00a71333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS in-\n    juries. Section 1333(b)\u2019s text also gives no indication that Congress\n    intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits\n    from LHWCA coverage. To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incor-\n    porated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees\n    might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. Pp. 6\u201310.\n         (2) Also unpersuasive is Pacific\u2019s alternative argument that\n    \u00a71333(b) imports the LHWCA\u2019s strict situs-of-injury requirement,\n    which provides benefits only for injuries occurring \u201cupon the naviga-\n    ble waters\u201d of the United States, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7903(a). It is unlikely\n    that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers\u2019\n    compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combi-\n    nation of two separate legislative Acts. In addition, under Pacific\u2019s\n    alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  navigable waters above the shelf. Thus, even employees on a crew\n  ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a\n  platform explosion would be excluded from \u00a71333(b) coverage. That\n  view cannot be squared with \u00a71333(b)\u2019s language. Pp. 11\u201312.\n        (3) Pacific\u2019s policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation\n  of \u00a71333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLA\u2019s text. P. 12.\n     (c) Neither the Solicitor General\u2019s status-based inquiry nor the\n  Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test are compatible with \u00a71333(b). The Solic-\n  itor General\u2019s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA\u2019s text, because\n  \u00a71333(b)\u2019s \u201coccurring as the result of operations\u201d language plainly\n  suggests causation. And when taken to its logical conclusion, the\n  Third Circuit\u2019s test, though nominally based on causation, is essen-\n  tially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all\n  employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from\n  the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are do-\n  ing at the time of injury. Because LHWCA coverage was extended\n  only to injuries \u201coccurring as the result of operations conducted on\n  the [OCS],\u201d \u00a71333(b)\u2019s focus should be on injuries resulting from\n  those \u201coperations.\u201d Pp. 12\u201314.\n     (d) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test is more faithful to\n  \u00a71333(b)\u2019s text. This Court understands that test to require the in-\n  jured employee to establish a significant causal link between his in-\n  jury and his employer\u2019s on-OCS extractive operations. The test may\n  not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and\n  courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has estab-\n  lished the required significant causal link. Whether an employee in-\n  jured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the\n  circumstances of each case. It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit\n  to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the \u201csub-\n  stantial-nexus\u201d test.

S. C. \u00a7901 et seq., to injuries\n\u201coccurring as the result of operations conducted on the\nouter Continental Shelf\u201d for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the shelf. 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\ndetermined that the OCSLA extends coverage to an em-\nployee who can establish a substantial nexus between his\ninjury and his employer\u2019s extractive operations on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. We affirm.\n                               I\n  Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific),\noperates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental\nShelf off the coast of California and an onshore oil and gas\nprocessing facility in Ventura County, California. Pacific\nemployed Juan Valladolid as a general manual laborer\u2014\nknown in the trade as a roustabout\u2014in its oil exploration\n2   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 per-\ncent of his time on one of Pacific\u2019s offshore drilling plat-\nforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up\nlitter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, main-\ntaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the\nplatform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his\ntime working at Pacific\u2019s onshore processing facility,\nwhere he also performed maintenance duties, including\npainting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain cul-\nverts, and operating a forklift.\n   While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in\na forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a\nclaim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the\nextension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The\nOCSLA provides, in relevant part:\n      \u201cWith respect to disability or death of an employee\n    resulting from any injury occurring as the result of\n    operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\n    for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,\n    or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or\n    involving rights to the natural resources, of the sub-\n    soil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, com-\n    pensation shall be payable under the provisions of the\n    [LHWCA].\u201d 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b).\n  After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\ndismissed respondent\u2019s claim. The ALJ reasoned that\nValladolid\u2019s fatal injury was not covered under \u00a71333(b)\nbecause his accident occurred on land, rather than on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board affirmed,\nconcluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage\nprovided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees\nwithin the \u201cgeographical locale\u201d of the Outer Continental\nShelf. L. V. v. Pacific Operations Offshore, LLP, 42 BRBS\n67, 71 (2008) (per curiam).\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \u00a71333(b) nei-\nther contains a \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d requirement, as the Fifth\nCircuit has held, nor imposes a \u201cbut for\u201d causation re-\nquirement, as the Third Circuit has held. See 604 F. 3d\n1126, 1130\u20131140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of Mills v.\nDirector, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 877\nF. 2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); Curtis v. Schlumberger\nOffshore Service, Inc., 849 F. 2d 805 (CA3 1988)). Instead,\nthe Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe claimant must\nestablish a substantial nexus between the injury and ex-\ntractive operations on the shelf\u201d to qualify for workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits under the OCSLA. 604 F. 3d, at\n1139. We granted Pacific\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari\nto resolve this conflict. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n  In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67\nStat. 29, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71301 et seq., which extended the\nboundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues\ninto the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress en-\nacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government\u2019s\nauthority and control over the \u201couter Continental Shelf,\u201d\ndefined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction\nand control of the United States lying seaward and outside\nof the submerged lands within the extended State bound-\naries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331(a), 1332(1). As\ndefined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf in-\ncludes the \u201csubmerged lands\u201d beyond the extended state\nboundaries, \u00a71331(a), but not the waters above those\nsubmerged lands or artificial islands or installations\nattached to the seabed. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we refer to\nthe entire geographical zone as the \u201cOCS.\u201d\n  Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and\nfederal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,\n\u00a71333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of\n4    PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncivil and political jurisdiction \u201cto the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands,\nand all installations and other devices permanently or\ntemporarily attached to the seabed,\u201d for the purpose of\nextracting its natural resources. Section 1333(a)(2)(A)\nmakes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State\napplicable to \u201cthat portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\nouter Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\nstructures erected thereon, which would be within the\narea of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\nto the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d Sec-\ntion 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits available for the\n\u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf \u201d for the purpose of extracting\nits natural resources.\n   The question before us is the scope of coverage under\n\u00a71333(b). The parties agree that \u00a71333(b) covers employ-\nees, such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who\nare injured while working directly on the OCS to extract\nits natural resources. They disagree, however, whether\nemployees who are involved in extraction operations but\nwho are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under\nthe OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the\nphrase \u201cany injury occurring as the result of operations\nconducted on the outer Continental Shelf\u201d in \u00a71333(b).\n   The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpre-\ntations. In Curtis v. Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc.,\n849 F. 2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because\nCongress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive,\n\u00a71333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have oc-\ncurred \u201cbut for\u201d operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit\nthus concluded that an employee who worked on a semi-\nsubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident\non the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwas eligible for \u00a71333(b) benefits. Id., at 806, 811. As the\nThird Circuit summarized, \u201c \u2018But for\u2019 [Curtis\u2019] travelling to\n[his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting \u2018operations\u2019\nwithin \u00a71333(b), employee Curtis would not have sus-\ntained injuries in the automobile accident.\u201d Id., at 811.\n   In Mills v. Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en\nbanc, adopted a narrower interpretation of \u00a71333(b). The\ncourt concluded that Congress intended to establish \u201ca\nbright-line geographic boundary for \u00a71333(b) coverage,\u201d\nand held that \u00a71333(b) extends coverage only to employees\nengaged in OCS extractive activities who \u201csuffer injury or\ndeath on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.\u201d\nId., at 362. Applying its \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test, the Fifth\nCircuit held that a welder who was injured on land during\nthe construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible\nfor \u00a71333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.\n   In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d requirement as unsupported by\nthe text of \u00a71333(b), and the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test\nas too broad to be consistent with Congress\u2019 intent. 604\nF. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a\nthird interpretation of \u00a71333(b), holding that a \u201cclaimant\nmust establish a substantial nexus between the injury and\nextractive operations on the shelf\u201d to be eligible for\n\u00a71333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. \u201cTo meet the standard,\u201d\nthe Ninth Circuit explained, \u201cthe claimant must show that\nthe work performed directly furthers outer continental\nshelf operations and is in the regular course of such opera-\ntions.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpreta-\ntion of \u00a71333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United\nStates Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the\nDirector administers the OCSLA workers\u2019 compensation scheme\nestablished by \u00a71333(b).\n6   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nage to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries\nsuffered by employees of companies engaged in resource\nextraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of\nthose employees who spend a substantial portion of their\nworktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations.\nBrief for Federal Respondent 32\u201333. According to the\nSolicitor General, this test would provide \u00a71333(b) cover-\nage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose\nduties contribute to operations on the OCS and who per-\nform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\nduration and nature. Id., at 35.\n                             III\n  Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d\ntest presents the best interpretation of \u00a71333(b). The crux\nof Pacific\u2019s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be\n\u201cthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf \u201d for purposes of \u00a71333(b). Pacific asserts that\nbecause Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did\nnot occur as the result of extraction operations conducted\non the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We disagree.\n                              A\n  The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to\nthe \u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf.\u201d \u00a71333(b). Contrary to the\nview of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that lan-\nguage suggests that the injury to the employee must occur\non the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two require-\nments: The extractive operations must be \u201cconducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf,\u201d and the employee\u2019s injury\nmust occur \u201cas the result of \u201d those operations.\n  Despite the lack of a textual \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d require-\nment in \u00a71333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

Pacific offers no basis for this\nassertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many\nOCS platforms are physically connected to onshore pro-\ncessing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult\nto imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that\ncould injure employees located off the OCS.\n   Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of \u00a71333(b)\nwas to geographically limit the extension of LHWCA\ncoverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress\ncould easily have achieved that goal by omitting the fol-\nlowing six words in \u00a71333(b)\u2019s text: \u201cas the result of opera-\ntions conducted.\u201d Had Congress done so, the statute\nwould extend LHWCA coverage to the \u201cdisability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the\nouter Continental Shelf.\u201d But that is not the text of the\nstatute Congress enacted.\n   Pacific also argues that, because all of \u00a71333(b)\u2019s neigh-\nboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we\nshould infer that Congress intended to include a situs-of-\ninjury requirement in \u00a71333(b). See, e.g., \u00a71333(a)(2)(A)\n(adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State\nas federal law \u201cfor that portion of the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and\nfixed structures erected thereon, which would be within\nthe area of the State if its boundaries were extended sea-\nward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf \u201d).2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See also 43 U.

Con-\ngress\u2019 decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly\nwhere the other subsections of \u00a71333 apply, but to include\nno similar restriction on injuries in \u00a71333(b), convinces us\nthat Congress did not intend \u00a71333(b) to apply only to\ninjuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, \u00a71333(b) extends\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation coverage to any employee\ninjury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs\n\u201cas the result of operations conducted on the outer Conti-\nnental Shelf.\u201d\n  Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by lan-\nguage in Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414\n(1985), and Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S.\n207 (1986); but neither of those cases held that \u00a71333(b)\nextends only to injuries that occur on the OCS. In Herb\u2019s\nWelding, this Court considered whether an oil platform\nwelder, who worked both within the territorial waters of\nLouisiana and on the OCS, was covered under the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napplicable to any unfair labor act \u201coccurring upon any artificial island,\ninstallation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this sec-\ntion\u201d); \u00a71333(d)(1) (granting the Coast Guard enforcement authority\n\u201con the artificial islands, installations, and other devices referred to in\nsubsection (a) of this section or on the waters adjacent thereto\u201d);\n\u00a71333(d)(2) (granting the Coast Guard authority to mark \u201cany artificial\nisland, installation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection\u201d for the protection of navigation); \u00a71333(e) (granting the Army\nauthority to prevent the obstruction of access \u201cto the artificial islands,\ninstallations, and other devices referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection\u201d); \u00a71333(f) (saving clause applying \u201cto the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and the artificial islands, installations, and\nother devices referred to in subsection (a) of this section\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The Court explicitly declined\nto address whether the employee was eligible for workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits under \u00a71333(b) because that ques-\ntion was neither passed upon by the Court of Appeals nor\nfully briefed and argued before this Court. Id., at 426,\nn. 12. Although the Court acknowledged that an employee\nmight walk in and out of workers\u2019 compensation coverage\nduring his employment due to the \u201cexplicit geographic\nlimitation to the [OCSLA\u2019s] incorporation of the LHWCA,\u201d\nid., at 427, the exact meaning of that statement is unclear.\nWe cannot ascertain whether the comment was a refer-\nence to \u00a71333(b)\u2019s explicit situs-of-operations requirement,\nas respondents suggest, or the recognition of an implicit\nsitus-of-injury requirement, as Pacific argues. In any\nevent, the ambiguous comment was made without analy-\nsis in dicta and does not control this case.\n   The same is true of the Court\u2019s opinion in Offshore\nLogistics. In that case, the Court considered whether the\nwidows of oil platform workers who were killed when their\nhelicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongful-\ndeath suits under Louisiana law. In the Court\u2019s analysis\nof \u00a71333, it stated, \u201cCongress determined that the general\nscope of OCSLA\u2019s coverage . . . would be determined prin-\ncipally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured\nor killed.\u201d 477 U. S., at 219\u2013220 (citing the situs require-\nment in \u00a71333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court com-\nmented: \u201cOnly one provision of OCSLA superimposes a\nstatus requirement on the otherwise determinative\nOCSLA situs requirement; \u00a71333(b) makes compensation\nfor the death or injury of an \u2018employee\u2019 resulting from\ncertain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable\nunder the [LHWCA].\u201d Ibid., n. 2. These comments about\nthe scope of the OCSLA\u2019s coverage and its determinative\n\u201csitus requirement\u201d do not provide definitive evidence that\n\u00a71333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS.\n10   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAs in Herb\u2019s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement\nin the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding \u00a71333(b) was\nreferring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or\nto an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the\nentire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly\nstated, \u00a71333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at\n219\u2013220.\n  Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries\nwithin the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage\ncreated by \u00a71333(b) runs counter to Congress\u2019 intent in\ndrafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress in-\ntended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that\nboth filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated juris-\ndictional overlaps between existing state and federal pro-\ngrams. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury\nrequirement to narrow the scope of \u00a71333(b), an off-OCS\nworker could be eligible for both state and federal workers\u2019\ncompensation coverage.\n    There is no indication in the text, however, that the\nOCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage\nwhen they are also eligible for state benefits. To the con-\ntrary, the LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation scheme incor-\nporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured\nemployees might be eligible for both state and federal\nbenefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides\nthat \u201cany amounts paid to an employee for the same in-\njury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed\nunder [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers\u2019 com-\npensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against\nany liability imposed by [the LHWCA].\u201d 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a7903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any\ntextual support for Pacific\u2019s argument, convinces us that\nCongress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)\u2019s\ncoverage to only those geographic areas where state work-\ners\u2019 compensation schemes do not apply.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from\nthe interaction of \u00a71333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.\nSpecifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA\ncontains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33\nU. S. C. \u00a7903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occur-\nring \u201cupon the navigable waters\u201d of the United States),\nand because 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b) extends the LHWCA\nworkers\u2019 compensation scheme to the OCS, \u00a71333(b) in-\ncorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement\nfrom \u00a7903(a). According to Pacific, the words \u201coccurring as\nthe result of operations\u201d in \u00a71333(b) impose a status re-\nquirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement, with the result that employees who\nare injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to\nextractive operations, are excluded from the workers\u2019\ncompensation coverage created by \u00a71333(b). Thus, an\naccountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling\nplatform would be ineligible under \u00a71333(b) despite being\nan employee who is injured on the OCS.\n   Although this alternative argument has the advantage\nof assigning some meaning to the words \u201coccurring as the\nresult of operations\u201d in \u00a71333(b), we still find it unpersua-\nsive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose\na situs-of-injury requirement in \u00a71333(b) through such a\nnonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate\nlegislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an\nexpress situs-of-injury requirement in the text of \u00a71333(b)\nwould have been simple. Second, combining the \u00a71333(b)\ndefinition of \u201cUnited States\u201d with the LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. \u00a7903(a) would result in\nan OCS workers\u2019 compensation scheme that applies only\nto the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and\nfixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)(3)\n(stating that \u201cthe term \u2018United States\u2019 when used in a\ngeographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf\n12   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand artificial islands and fixed structures thereon\u201d).\nPacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navi-\ngable waters above the shelf, including the waters imme-\ndiately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,\nunder Pacific\u2019s view, even employees on a crew ship im-\nmediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured\nduring a platform explosion would be excluded from\n\u00a71333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the\ntext of the statute, which applies to \u201cany injury occurring\nas the result of operations conducted\u201d on the OCS.\n                             C\n   Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of\na situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot\njustify an interpretation of \u00a71333(b) that is inconsistent\nwith the text of the OCSLA. \u201c[I]f Congress\u2019 coverage\ndecisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Con-\ngress to change them. We should not legislate for them.\u201d\nHerb\u2019s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of\n\u00a71333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion\nof injuries that occur beyond the OCS.\n                             IV\n   The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based\ninquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a\ndifferent test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Gov-\nernment proposes that when a worker is injured on the\nOCS, he is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits if he\nis employed by a company engaged in extractive opera-\ntions on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the\nOCS, the employee will be covered only if his \u201cduties\ncontribute to operations\u201d on the OCS and if he performs\n\u201cwork on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of\nboth its duration and nature.\u201d Brief for Federal Respond-\nent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as\npresently enacted. The \u201coccurring as the result of opera-\ntions\u201d language in \u00a71333(b) plainly suggests causation.\nAlthough the Government asserts that a status-based test\nwould be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot\nignore the language enacted by Congress.\n   The Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test is nominally based on\ncausation, but it is also incompatible with \u00a71333(b). Tak-\nen to its logical conclusion, the \u201cbut for\u201d test would extend\nworkers\u2019 compensation coverage to all employees of a\nbusiness engaged in the extraction of natural resources\nfrom the OCS, no matter where those employees work or\nwhat they are doing when they are injured. This test\ncould reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office\nemployees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with\nextractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress ex-\ntended LHWCA coverage only to injuries \u201coccurring as\nthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf,\u201d we think that \u00a71333(b) should be interpreted in\na manner that focuses on injuries that result from those\n\u201coperations.\u201d This view is consistent with our past treat-\nment of similar language in other contexts. In Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258\n(1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influ-\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a\ncause of action to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business\nor property by reason of a violation of section 1962.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a \u201cbut\nfor\u201d interpretation, stating that such a construction was\n\u201chardly compelled\u201d and that it was highly unlikely that\nCongress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs\nto recover. 503 U. S., at 265\u2013266. Instead, we adopted a\nproximate-cause standard consistent with our prior inter-\npretation of the same language in the Sherman and Clay-\n14   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nton Acts. Id., at 267\u2013268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)\u2019s\nlanguage hardly compels the Third Circuit\u2019s expansive\n\u201cbut for\u201d interpretation.\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test is more faithful to the text of\n\u00a71333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test to require\nthe injured employee to establish a significant causal link\nbetween the injury that he suffered and his employer\u2019s on-\nOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the OCS.\n   Although the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test may not be the easiest\nto administer, it best reflects the text of \u00a71333(b), which\nestablishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a \u201cbut for\u201d test.\nWe are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to\ndetermine whether an injured employee has established a\nsignificant causal link between the injury he suffered and\nhis employer\u2019s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we\nexpect that employees injured while performing tasks on\nthe OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an em-\nployee injured while performing an off-OCS task quali-\nfies\u2014like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore\nscrap metal consolidation\u2014is a question that will depend\non the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth\nCircuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board\nto apply the \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test in the first instance,\nand we agree with that disposition.\n   The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to\nthe Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

My\ndisagreement is limited to the last two substantive para-\ngraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n\u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test for determining the scope of cover-\nage under 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b). The Court indulges in con-\nsiderable understatement when it acknowledges that this\ntest \u201cmay not be the easiest to administer,\u201d ante, at 14.\n\u201cSubstantial nexus\u201d is novel legalese with no established\nmeaning in the present context. I agree with the Court\u2019s\nrejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the\nparties\u2014which, though easier to apply, are unmoored\nfrom the text of \u00a71333(b). But if we must adopt an inde-\nterminate standard (and the statute\u2019s \u201cas the result of \u201d\nlanguage leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to\nthe devil of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s imagining. I would hold\nthat an employee may recover under \u00a71333(b) if his injury\nwas proximately caused by operations on the Outer Conti-\nnental Shelf (OCS).\n  The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is \u201cshorthand for a concept:\nInjuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v.

Life is too short to pursue\nevery event to its most remote, \u201cbut-for,\u201d consequences,\nand the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough\nguide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of\ncause-and-effect. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protec-\ntion Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 287 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in\nrejecting the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test for \u00a71333(b)\ncoverage, we have interpreted statutes with language\nsimilar to \u00a71333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause\nstandard. See ante, at 13\u201314.\n   Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in\ntort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions,\nit can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation\nschemes like this one. In Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 119 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans\u2019 com-\npensation statute covering injuries that occurred \u201cas the\nresult of \u201d medical treatment (precisely the language at\nissue here); we suggested that the requisite \u201ccausal con-\nnection\u201d between the injury and medical treatment may\nbe \u201climited to proximate causation so as to narrow the\nclass of compensable cases . . . by eliminating remote conse-\nquences.\u201d Similarly, some state workers\u2019 compensation\nlaws use the concept of proximate cause to determine\nentitlement. See, e.g., Ex parte Patton, __ So. 3d __, __\n(Ala. 2011); Marandino v. Prometheus Pharmacy, 294\nConn. 564, 591, 986 A. 2d 1023, 1041 (2010); Grant v.\nGrant Textiles, 372 S. C. 196, 201, 641 S.

But \u201cit is often easier to dis-\nparage the product of centuries of common law than to\ndevise a plausible substitute.\u201d McBride, 564 U. S., at ___\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\u20133). Unlike the\nsubstantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a \u201cvo-\ncabulary\u201d for answering questions like the one raised by\nthe facts of this case. It may be productive, for example, to\nconsider whether the injury was \u201cwithin the scope of the\nrisk\u201d created by OCS operations, or whether some \u201csuper-\nseding or intervening cause\u201d exists. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n15). In addition to that vocabulary, precedents on proxi-\nmate cause \u201cfurnish illustrations of situations which\njudicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to\nbe on one side of the line or the other.\u201d Exxon Co., U. S. A.\nv. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 839 (1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   \u201cSubstantial nexus,\u201d by contrast, is an indeterminate\nphrase that lacks all pedigree.

Perhaps (who knows?) later\nCalifornia Supreme Court cases will \u201cclarify\u201d this general requirement\nby saying that it requires a \u201csubstantial nexoos\u201d between the employ-\nment and the injury.\n4   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v.

City of Valdez, 557 U. S. 1, 11\n(2009). That clarification\u2014and any further clarification in\nthe Commerce Clause context\u2014will not be remotely help-\nful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-\nnexus test in the very different legal context of workers\u2019\ncompensation under \u00a71333(b). In this latter context, I\nassume the Court means by \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d a sub-\nstantial causal nexus\u2014since \u00a71333(b)\u2019s \u201cas the result of \u201d\nlanguage \u201cplainly suggests causation,\u201d ante, at 13. Like\nthe word \u201cnexus\u201d itself, the definition of \u201csubstantial\nnexus\u201d in our state-tax cases does not require any causal\nrelationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by\ncomparison, represents a much more natural interpreta-\ntion of a statute that turns on causation.\n   Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel \u201csub-\nstantial [causal] nexus\u201d test, a new tertium quid of causal-\nity\u2014somewhere between but-for causality and proximate\ncause? One might think so, since there is no other sensi-\nble reason to (1) reject but-for cause, (2) say nothing about\nthe natural alternative (proximate cause), and (3) embrace\nthe \u201csubstantial [causal] nexus\u201d novelty. On the other\nhand, the Court\u2019s opinion suggests at least some connec-\ntion (that is to say, in the Court\u2019s favored lawspeak, some\n\u201cnexus\u201d) between the proximate-cause standard and the\nsubstantial-nexus test, since it cites one of our proximate-\ncause cases just before concluding that \u201c[a]ccordingly, . . .\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u2018substantial-nexus\u2019 test is more faithful\nto the text of \u00a71333(b)\u201d than the Third Circuit\u2019s but-for\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

In the opinion below, moreover, the\nNinth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s pre-\n1989 case law, which required \u201c \u2018 that the claimant show a\nnexus . . . similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.\u2019 \u201d\n604 F. 3d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting Mills v.

Who knows whether this is a tertium quid or not?\nThe Court has given us a new test whose contours are\nentirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for\nit except that it will add complexity to the law and litiga-\ntion to the courts.\n   Finally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a\npeculiarity) that the Court\u2019s opinion creates: The statutory\ntext at issue requires compensation for \u201cdisability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the\nresult of operations conducted on the outer Continental\nShelf . . . .\u201d \u00a71333(b) (emphasis added). Before today,\nI would have thought it clear that courts must apply\nproximate-cause analysis to the \u201cresulting from\u201d provision;\nbut that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds\ntoday) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neigh-\nboring \u201coccurring as the result of \u201d provision. Surely both\nphrases express the same concept. What a tangled web we\nweave.\n   I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment to remand\nthe case to the Benefits Review Board, but with instruc-\ntions to apply a proximate-cause test.\n",

Argued October 11, 2011\u2014Decided January 11, 2012\nPetitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drill-\n  ing platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California\n  coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility. Employee Juan\n  Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore plat-\n  form, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore\n  facility. His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the\n  Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33\n  U. S. C. \u00a7901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands\n  Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries \u201coccurring\n  as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]\u201d for the purpose of\n  extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b). The\n  Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that\n  \u00a71333(b) did not cover Valladolid\u2019s fatal injury because his accident\n  occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department\u2019s Benefits\n  Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting\n  tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA \u201cmust es-\n  tablish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive opera-\n  tions on the shelf.\u201d\nHeld: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a\n substantial nexus between his injury and his employer\u2019s extractive\n operations on the OCS. Pp. 3\u201314.\n    (a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of\n \u00a71333(b)\u2019s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress\n intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, \u00a71333(b) extends to all\n injuries that would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d operations on the\n OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be\n    flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have\n    been injured but for his traveling to the rig. In contrast, the Fifth\n    Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish \u201ca bright-\n    line geographic boundary,\u201d extending \u00a71333(b) coverage only to em-\n    ployees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the\n    waters above the OCS. Under its \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test, a welder in-\n    jured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligi-\n    ble for \u00a71333(b) benefits. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that \u00a71333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can es-\n    tablish a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between their injury and extractive op-\n    erations on the OCS. The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpre-\n    tation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to\n    those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS\n    and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\n    duration and nature. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Contrary to Pacific\u2019s position, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d\n    test is not the best interpretation of \u00a71333(b). Pp. 6\u201312.\n         (1) Nothing in the text of \u00a71333(b) suggests that an injury must\n    occur on the OCS. The provision has only two requirements: The ex-\n    tractive operations must be \u201cconducted on the [OCS],\u201d and the em-\n    ployee\u2019s injury must occur \u201cas the result of\u201d those operations. If, as\n    Pacific suggests, the purpose of \u00a71333(b) was to geographically limit\n    the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Con-\n    gress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from \u00a71333(b)\n    the words \u201cas the result of operations conducted.\u201d Moreover, Con-\n    gress\u2019 decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but\n    not in \u00a71333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit \u00a71333(b).\n    This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470\n    U. S. 414, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, nei-\n    ther of which held that \u00a71333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS in-\n    juries. Section 1333(b)\u2019s text also gives no indication that Congress\n    intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits\n    from LHWCA coverage. To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incor-\n    porated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees\n    might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. Pp. 6\u201310.\n         (2) Also unpersuasive is Pacific\u2019s alternative argument that\n    \u00a71333(b) imports the LHWCA\u2019s strict situs-of-injury requirement,\n    which provides benefits only for injuries occurring \u201cupon the naviga-\n    ble waters\u201d of the United States, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7903(a). It is unlikely\n    that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers\u2019\n    compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combi-\n    nation of two separate legislative Acts. In addition, under Pacific\u2019s\n    alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  navigable waters above the shelf. Thus, even employees on a crew\n  ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a\n  platform explosion would be excluded from \u00a71333(b) coverage. That\n  view cannot be squared with \u00a71333(b)\u2019s language. Pp. 11\u201312.\n        (3) Pacific\u2019s policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation\n  of \u00a71333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLA\u2019s text. P. 12.\n     (c) Neither the Solicitor General\u2019s status-based inquiry nor the\n  Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test are compatible with \u00a71333(b). The Solic-\n  itor General\u2019s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA\u2019s text, because\n  \u00a71333(b)\u2019s \u201coccurring as the result of operations\u201d language plainly\n  suggests causation. And when taken to its logical conclusion, the\n  Third Circuit\u2019s test, though nominally based on causation, is essen-\n  tially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all\n  employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from\n  the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are do-\n  ing at the time of injury. Because LHWCA coverage was extended\n  only to injuries \u201coccurring as the result of operations conducted on\n  the [OCS],\u201d \u00a71333(b)\u2019s focus should be on injuries resulting from\n  those \u201coperations.\u201d Pp. 12\u201314.\n     (d) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test is more faithful to\n  \u00a71333(b)\u2019s text. This Court understands that test to require the in-\n  jured employee to establish a significant causal link between his in-\n  jury and his employer\u2019s on-OCS extractive operations. The test may\n  not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and\n  courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has estab-\n  lished the required significant causal link. Whether an employee in-\n  jured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the\n  circumstances of each case. It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit\n  to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the \u201csub-\n  stantial-nexus\u201d test.

Valladolid spent about 98 per-\ncent of his time on one of Pacific\u2019s offshore drilling plat-\nforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up\nlitter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, main-\ntaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the\nplatform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his\ntime working at Pacific\u2019s onshore processing facility,\nwhere he also performed maintenance duties, including\npainting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain cul-\nverts, and operating a forklift.\n   While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in\na forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a\nclaim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the\nextension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The\nOCSLA provides, in relevant part:\n      \u201cWith respect to disability or death of an employee\n    resulting from any injury occurring as the result of\n    operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\n    for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,\n    or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or\n    involving rights to the natural resources, of the sub-\n    soil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, com-\n    pensation shall be payable under the provisions of the\n    [LHWCA].\u201d 43 U.

The ALJ reasoned that\nValladolid\u2019s fatal injury was not covered under \u00a71333(b)\nbecause his accident occurred on land, rather than on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board affirmed,\nconcluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage\nprovided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees\nwithin the \u201cgeographical locale\u201d of the Outer Continental\nShelf.

C. \u00a71301 et seq., which extended the\nboundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues\ninto the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress en-\nacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government\u2019s\nauthority and control over the \u201couter Continental Shelf,\u201d\ndefined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction\nand control of the United States lying seaward and outside\nof the submerged lands within the extended State bound-\naries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71331(a), 1332(1). As\ndefined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf in-\ncludes the \u201csubmerged lands\u201d beyond the extended state\nboundaries, \u00a71331(a), but not the waters above those\nsubmerged lands or artificial islands or installations\nattached to the seabed. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we refer to\nthe entire geographical zone as the \u201cOCS.\u201d\n  Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and\nfederal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,\n\u00a71333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of\n4    PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v.

Section 1333(a)(2)(A)\nmakes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State\napplicable to \u201cthat portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\nouter Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\nstructures erected thereon, which would be within the\narea of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\nto the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.\u201d Sec-\ntion 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits available for the\n\u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf \u201d for the purpose of extracting\nits natural resources.\n   The question before us is the scope of coverage under\n\u00a71333(b). The parties agree that \u00a71333(b) covers employ-\nees, such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who\nare injured while working directly on the OCS to extract\nits natural resources. They disagree, however, whether\nemployees who are involved in extraction operations but\nwho are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under\nthe OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the\nphrase \u201cany injury occurring as the result of operations\nconducted on the outer Continental Shelf\u201d in \u00a71333(b).\n   The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpre-\ntations. In Curtis v. Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc.,\n849 F. 2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because\nCongress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive,\n\u00a71333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have oc-\ncurred \u201cbut for\u201d operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit\nthus concluded that an employee who worked on a semi-\nsubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident\non the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,\n                   Cite as: 565 U.

Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en\nbanc, adopted a narrower interpretation of \u00a71333(b). The\ncourt concluded that Congress intended to establish \u201ca\nbright-line geographic boundary for \u00a71333(b) coverage,\u201d\nand held that \u00a71333(b) extends coverage only to employees\nengaged in OCS extractive activities who \u201csuffer injury or\ndeath on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.\u201d\nId., at 362. Applying its \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d test, the Fifth\nCircuit held that a welder who was injured on land during\nthe construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible\nfor \u00a71333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.\n   In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d requirement as unsupported by\nthe text of \u00a71333(b), and the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test\nas too broad to be consistent with Congress\u2019 intent. 604\nF. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a\nthird interpretation of \u00a71333(b), holding that a \u201cclaimant\nmust establish a substantial nexus between the injury and\nextractive operations on the shelf\u201d to be eligible for\n\u00a71333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. \u201cTo meet the standard,\u201d\nthe Ninth Circuit explained, \u201cthe claimant must show that\nthe work performed directly furthers outer continental\nshelf operations and is in the regular course of such opera-\ntions.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpreta-\ntion of \u00a71333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United\nStates Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the\nDirector administers the OCSLA workers\u2019 compensation scheme\nestablished by \u00a71333(b).\n6   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v.

Id., at 35.\n                             III\n  Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d\ntest presents the best interpretation of \u00a71333(b). The crux\nof Pacific\u2019s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be\n\u201cthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf \u201d for purposes of \u00a71333(b). Pacific asserts that\nbecause Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did\nnot occur as the result of extraction operations conducted\non the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We disagree.\n                              A\n  The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to\nthe \u201cdisability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf.\u201d \u00a71333(b). Contrary to the\nview of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that lan-\nguage suggests that the injury to the employee must occur\non the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two require-\nments: The extractive operations must be \u201cconducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf,\u201d and the employee\u2019s injury\nmust occur \u201cas the result of \u201d those operations.\n  Despite the lack of a textual \u201csitus-of-injury\u201d require-\nment in \u00a71333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

Pacific offers no basis for this\nassertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many\nOCS platforms are physically connected to onshore pro-\ncessing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult\nto imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that\ncould injure employees located off the OCS.\n   Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of \u00a71333(b)\nwas to geographically limit the extension of LHWCA\ncoverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress\ncould easily have achieved that goal by omitting the fol-\nlowing six words in \u00a71333(b)\u2019s text: \u201cas the result of opera-\ntions conducted.\u201d Had Congress done so, the statute\nwould extend LHWCA coverage to the \u201cdisability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the\nouter Continental Shelf.\u201d But that is not the text of the\nstatute Congress enacted.\n   Pacific also argues that, because all of \u00a71333(b)\u2019s neigh-\nboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we\nshould infer that Congress intended to include a situs-of-\ninjury requirement in \u00a71333(b). See, e.g., \u00a71333(a)(2)(A)\n(adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State\nas federal law \u201cfor that portion of the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and\nfixed structures erected thereon, which would be within\nthe area of the State if its boundaries were extended sea-\nward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf \u201d).2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See also 43 U.

Con-\ngress\u2019 decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly\nwhere the other subsections of \u00a71333 apply, but to include\nno similar restriction on injuries in \u00a71333(b), convinces us\nthat Congress did not intend \u00a71333(b) to apply only to\ninjuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, \u00a71333(b) extends\nLHWCA workers\u2019 compensation coverage to any employee\ninjury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs\n\u201cas the result of operations conducted on the outer Conti-\nnental Shelf.\u201d\n  Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by lan-\nguage in Herb\u2019s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414\n(1985), and Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S.\n207 (1986); but neither of those cases held that \u00a71333(b)\nextends only to injuries that occur on the OCS. In Herb\u2019s\nWelding, this Court considered whether an oil platform\nwelder, who worked both within the territorial waters of\nLouisiana and on the OCS, was covered under the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napplicable to any unfair labor act \u201coccurring upon any artificial island,\ninstallation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this sec-\ntion\u201d); \u00a71333(d)(1) (granting the Coast Guard enforcement authority\n\u201con the artificial islands, installations, and other devices referred to in\nsubsection (a) of this section or on the waters adjacent thereto\u201d);\n\u00a71333(d)(2) (granting the Coast Guard authority to mark \u201cany artificial\nisland, installation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection\u201d for the protection of navigation); \u00a71333(e) (granting the Army\nauthority to prevent the obstruction of access \u201cto the artificial islands,\ninstallations, and other devices referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection\u201d); \u00a71333(f) (saving clause applying \u201cto the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and the artificial islands, installations, and\nother devices referred to in subsection (a) of this section\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The Court explicitly declined\nto address whether the employee was eligible for workers\u2019\ncompensation benefits under \u00a71333(b) because that ques-\ntion was neither passed upon by the Court of Appeals nor\nfully briefed and argued before this Court. Id., at 426,\nn. 12. Although the Court acknowledged that an employee\nmight walk in and out of workers\u2019 compensation coverage\nduring his employment due to the \u201cexplicit geographic\nlimitation to the [OCSLA\u2019s] incorporation of the LHWCA,\u201d\nid., at 427, the exact meaning of that statement is unclear.\nWe cannot ascertain whether the comment was a refer-\nence to \u00a71333(b)\u2019s explicit situs-of-operations requirement,\nas respondents suggest, or the recognition of an implicit\nsitus-of-injury requirement, as Pacific argues. In any\nevent, the ambiguous comment was made without analy-\nsis in dicta and does not control this case.\n   The same is true of the Court\u2019s opinion in Offshore\nLogistics. In that case, the Court considered whether the\nwidows of oil platform workers who were killed when their\nhelicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongful-\ndeath suits under Louisiana law. In the Court\u2019s analysis\nof \u00a71333, it stated, \u201cCongress determined that the general\nscope of OCSLA\u2019s coverage . . . would be determined prin-\ncipally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured\nor killed.\u201d 477 U. S., at 219\u2013220 (citing the situs require-\nment in \u00a71333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court com-\nmented: \u201cOnly one provision of OCSLA superimposes a\nstatus requirement on the otherwise determinative\nOCSLA situs requirement; \u00a71333(b) makes compensation\nfor the death or injury of an \u2018employee\u2019 resulting from\ncertain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable\nunder the [LHWCA].\u201d Ibid., n. 2. These comments about\nthe scope of the OCSLA\u2019s coverage and its determinative\n\u201csitus requirement\u201d do not provide definitive evidence that\n\u00a71333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS.\n10   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAs in Herb\u2019s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement\nin the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding \u00a71333(b) was\nreferring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or\nto an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the\nentire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly\nstated, \u00a71333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at\n219\u2013220.\n  Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries\nwithin the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage\ncreated by \u00a71333(b) runs counter to Congress\u2019 intent in\ndrafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress in-\ntended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that\nboth filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated juris-\ndictional overlaps between existing state and federal pro-\ngrams. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury\nrequirement to narrow the scope of \u00a71333(b), an off-OCS\nworker could be eligible for both state and federal workers\u2019\ncompensation coverage.\n    There is no indication in the text, however, that the\nOCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage\nwhen they are also eligible for state benefits. To the con-\ntrary, the LHWCA workers\u2019 compensation scheme incor-\nporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured\nemployees might be eligible for both state and federal\nbenefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides\nthat \u201cany amounts paid to an employee for the same in-\njury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed\nunder [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers\u2019 com-\npensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against\nany liability imposed by [the LHWCA].\u201d 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a7903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any\ntextual support for Pacific\u2019s argument, convinces us that\nCongress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)\u2019s\ncoverage to only those geographic areas where state work-\ners\u2019 compensation schemes do not apply.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from\nthe interaction of \u00a71333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.\nSpecifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA\ncontains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33\nU. S. C. \u00a7903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occur-\nring \u201cupon the navigable waters\u201d of the United States),\nand because 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b) extends the LHWCA\nworkers\u2019 compensation scheme to the OCS, \u00a71333(b) in-\ncorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement\nfrom \u00a7903(a). According to Pacific, the words \u201coccurring as\nthe result of operations\u201d in \u00a71333(b) impose a status re-\nquirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement, with the result that employees who\nare injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to\nextractive operations, are excluded from the workers\u2019\ncompensation coverage created by \u00a71333(b). Thus, an\naccountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling\nplatform would be ineligible under \u00a71333(b) despite being\nan employee who is injured on the OCS.\n   Although this alternative argument has the advantage\nof assigning some meaning to the words \u201coccurring as the\nresult of operations\u201d in \u00a71333(b), we still find it unpersua-\nsive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose\na situs-of-injury requirement in \u00a71333(b) through such a\nnonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate\nlegislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an\nexpress situs-of-injury requirement in the text of \u00a71333(b)\nwould have been simple. Second, combining the \u00a71333(b)\ndefinition of \u201cUnited States\u201d with the LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. \u00a7903(a) would result in\nan OCS workers\u2019 compensation scheme that applies only\nto the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and\nfixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)(3)\n(stating that \u201cthe term \u2018United States\u2019 when used in a\ngeographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf\n12   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand artificial islands and fixed structures thereon\u201d).\nPacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navi-\ngable waters above the shelf, including the waters imme-\ndiately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,\nunder Pacific\u2019s view, even employees on a crew ship im-\nmediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured\nduring a platform explosion would be excluded from\n\u00a71333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the\ntext of the statute, which applies to \u201cany injury occurring\nas the result of operations conducted\u201d on the OCS.\n                             C\n   Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of\na situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot\njustify an interpretation of \u00a71333(b) that is inconsistent\nwith the text of the OCSLA. \u201c[I]f Congress\u2019 coverage\ndecisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Con-\ngress to change them. We should not legislate for them.\u201d\nHerb\u2019s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of\n\u00a71333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion\nof injuries that occur beyond the OCS.\n                             IV\n   The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based\ninquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a\ndifferent test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Gov-\nernment proposes that when a worker is injured on the\nOCS, he is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits if he\nis employed by a company engaged in extractive opera-\ntions on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the\nOCS, the employee will be covered only if his \u201cduties\ncontribute to operations\u201d on the OCS and if he performs\n\u201cwork on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of\nboth its duration and nature.\u201d Brief for Federal Respond-\nent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as\npresently enacted. The \u201coccurring as the result of opera-\ntions\u201d language in \u00a71333(b) plainly suggests causation.\nAlthough the Government asserts that a status-based test\nwould be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot\nignore the language enacted by Congress.\n   The Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test is nominally based on\ncausation, but it is also incompatible with \u00a71333(b). Tak-\nen to its logical conclusion, the \u201cbut for\u201d test would extend\nworkers\u2019 compensation coverage to all employees of a\nbusiness engaged in the extraction of natural resources\nfrom the OCS, no matter where those employees work or\nwhat they are doing when they are injured. This test\ncould reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office\nemployees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with\nextractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress ex-\ntended LHWCA coverage only to injuries \u201coccurring as\nthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf,\u201d we think that \u00a71333(b) should be interpreted in\na manner that focuses on injuries that result from those\n\u201coperations.\u201d This view is consistent with our past treat-\nment of similar language in other contexts. In Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258\n(1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influ-\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a\ncause of action to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business\nor property by reason of a violation of section 1962.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a \u201cbut\nfor\u201d interpretation, stating that such a construction was\n\u201chardly compelled\u201d and that it was highly unlikely that\nCongress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs\nto recover. 503 U. S., at 265\u2013266. Instead, we adopted a\nproximate-cause standard consistent with our prior inter-\npretation of the same language in the Sherman and Clay-\n14   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nton Acts. Id., at 267\u2013268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b)\u2019s\nlanguage hardly compels the Third Circuit\u2019s expansive\n\u201cbut for\u201d interpretation.\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test is more faithful to the text of\n\u00a71333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test to require\nthe injured employee to establish a significant causal link\nbetween the injury that he suffered and his employer\u2019s on-\nOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the OCS.\n   Although the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test may not be the easiest\nto administer, it best reflects the text of \u00a71333(b), which\nestablishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a \u201cbut for\u201d test.\nWe are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to\ndetermine whether an injured employee has established a\nsignificant causal link between the injury he suffered and\nhis employer\u2019s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we\nexpect that employees injured while performing tasks on\nthe OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an em-\nployee injured while performing an off-OCS task quali-\nfies\u2014like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore\nscrap metal consolidation\u2014is a question that will depend\non the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth\nCircuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board\nto apply the \u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test in the first instance,\nand we agree with that disposition.\n   The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to\nthe Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

My\ndisagreement is limited to the last two substantive para-\ngraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n\u201csubstantial-nexus\u201d test for determining the scope of cover-\nage under 43 U. S. C. \u00a71333(b). The Court indulges in con-\nsiderable understatement when it acknowledges that this\ntest \u201cmay not be the easiest to administer,\u201d ante, at 14.\n\u201cSubstantial nexus\u201d is novel legalese with no established\nmeaning in the present context. I agree with the Court\u2019s\nrejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the\nparties\u2014which, though easier to apply, are unmoored\nfrom the text of \u00a71333(b). But if we must adopt an inde-\nterminate standard (and the statute\u2019s \u201cas the result of \u201d\nlanguage leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to\nthe devil of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s imagining. I would hold\nthat an employee may recover under \u00a71333(b) if his injury\nwas proximately caused by operations on the Outer Conti-\nnental Shelf (OCS).\n  The term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is \u201cshorthand for a concept:\nInjuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto legal liability.\u201d CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). Life is too short to pursue\nevery event to its most remote, \u201cbut-for,\u201d consequences,\nand the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough\nguide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of\ncause-and-effect. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protec-\ntion Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 287 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in\nrejecting the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cbut for\u201d test for \u00a71333(b)\ncoverage, we have interpreted statutes with language\nsimilar to \u00a71333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause\nstandard. See ante, at 13\u201314.\n   Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in\ntort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions,\nit can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation\nschemes like this one. In Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 119 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans\u2019 com-\npensation statute covering injuries that occurred \u201cas the\nresult of \u201d medical treatment (precisely the language at\nissue here); we suggested that the requisite \u201ccausal con-\nnection\u201d between the injury and medical treatment may\nbe \u201climited to proximate causation so as to narrow the\nclass of compensable cases . . . by eliminating remote conse-\nquences.\u201d Similarly, some state workers\u2019 compensation\nlaws use the concept of proximate cause to determine\nentitlement.

Indeed, the statutory law of California, where Mr.\nValladolid died while at work, limits workers\u2019 compensa-\ntion liability to cases \u201c[w]here the injury is proximately\ncaused by the employment, either with or without negli-\ngence.\u201d Cal.

C. \u00a71333(b) could\nnot similarly be cabined by the familiar limits of proxi-\nmate causation.\n   To be sure, proximate cause is an imperfect legal doc-\ntrine; I have no illusions that its tenets are easy to de-\nscribe or straightforward to apply. Judicial opinions do\nnot provide a uniform formulation of the test, and border-\nline cases are rarely clear. But \u201cit is often easier to dis-\nparage the product of centuries of common law than to\ndevise a plausible substitute.\u201d McBride, 564 U. S., at ___\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\u20133). Unlike the\nsubstantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a \u201cvo-\ncabulary\u201d for answering questions like the one raised by\nthe facts of this case. It may be productive, for example, to\nconsider whether the injury was \u201cwithin the scope of the\nrisk\u201d created by OCS operations, or whether some \u201csuper-\nseding or intervening cause\u201d exists. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n15). In addition to that vocabulary, precedents on proxi-\nmate cause \u201cfurnish illustrations of situations which\njudicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to\nbe on one side of the line or the other.\u201d Exxon Co., U. S. A.\nv. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 839 (1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   \u201cSubstantial nexus,\u201d by contrast, is an indeterminate\nphrase that lacks all pedigree. Our case law has used it as\na term of art in only one context, first appearing in Justice\nBlackmun\u2019s opinion for the Court in Complete Auto Trans-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunmistakable term-of-art reference to a rule found in the common law\nof torts does not establish a rule \u201cidentical to that found in the common\nlaw of torts,\u201d but merely \u201celaborat[es] the general requirement that the\ninjury arise out of the employment.\u201d LaTourette v. Workers\u2019 Compensa-\ntion App. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1278130\"><a href=\"/opinion/1278130/latourette-v-workerscomp-appeals-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651, n. 1, 951 P. 2d 1184, 1187, n. 1\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps (who knows?) later\nCalifornia Supreme Court cases will \u201cclarify\u201d this general requirement\nby saying that it requires a \u201csubstantial nexoos\u201d between the employ-\nment and the injury.\n4   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977): We sustain\nstate taxes against Commerce Clause challenges if they\nare, inter alia, \u201capplied to an activity with a substantial\nnexus with the taxing State.\u201d Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 183 (1995) (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[S]uch a nexus\nis established when the taxpayer \u2018avails itself of the sub-\nstantial privilege of carrying on business\u2019 in that jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d Polar Tankers, Inc. v. City of Valdez, 557 U. S. 1, 11\n(2009). That clarification\u2014and any further clarification in\nthe Commerce Clause context\u2014will not be remotely help-\nful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-\nnexus test in the very different legal context of workers\u2019\ncompensation under \u00a71333(b). In this latter context, I\nassume the Court means by \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d a sub-\nstantial causal nexus\u2014since \u00a71333(b)\u2019s \u201cas the result of \u201d\nlanguage \u201cplainly suggests causation,\u201d ante, at 13. Like\nthe word \u201cnexus\u201d itself, the definition of \u201csubstantial\nnexus\u201d in our state-tax cases does not require any causal\nrelationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by\ncomparison, represents a much more natural interpreta-\ntion of a statute that turns on causation.\n   Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel \u201csub-\nstantial [causal] nexus\u201d test, a new tertium quid of causal-\nity\u2014somewhere between but-for causality and proximate\ncause? One might think so, since there is no other sensi-\nble reason to (1) reject but-for cause, (2) say nothing about\nthe natural alternative (proximate cause), and (3) embrace\nthe \u201csubstantial [causal] nexus\u201d novelty. On the other\nhand, the Court\u2019s opinion suggests at least some connec-\ntion (that is to say, in the Court\u2019s favored lawspeak, some\n\u201cnexus\u201d) between the proximate-cause standard and the\nsubstantial-nexus test, since it cites one of our proximate-\ncause cases just before concluding that \u201c[a]ccordingly, . . .\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u2018substantial-nexus\u2019 test is more faithful\nto the text of \u00a71333(b)\u201d than the Third Circuit\u2019s but-for\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntest. Ante, at 13\u201314. In the opinion below, moreover, the\nNinth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s pre-\n1989 case law, which required \u201c \u2018 that the claimant show a\nnexus . . . similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.\u2019 \u201d\n604 F. 3d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting Mills v. Director,\nOffice of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 846 F. 2d\n1013, 1015 (CA5 1988), rev\u2019d en banc, 877 F. 2d 356\n(1989)). Who knows whether this is a tertium quid or not?\nThe Court has given us a new test whose contours are\nentirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for\nit except that it will add complexity to the law and litiga-\ntion to the courts.\n   Finally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a\npeculiarity) that the Court\u2019s opinion creates: The statutory\ntext at issue requires compensation for \u201cdisability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the\nresult of operations conducted on the outer Continental\nShelf . . . .\u201d \u00a71333(b) (emphasis added). Before today,\nI would have thought it clear that courts must apply\nproximate-cause analysis to the \u201cresulting from\u201d provision;\nbut that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds\ntoday) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neigh-\nboring \u201coccurring as the result of \u201d provision. Surely both\nphrases express the same concept. What a tangled web we\nweave.\n   I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment to remand\nthe case to the Benefits Review Board, but with instruc-\ntions to apply a proximate-cause test.\n</pre>",
