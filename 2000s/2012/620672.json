Argued October 11, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012\nPetitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific), operates two drill-\n  ing platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the California\n  coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility. Employee Juan\n  Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore plat-\n  form, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore\n  facility. His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the\n  Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33\n  U. S. C. §901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands\n  Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries “occurring\n  as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]” for the purpose of\n  extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The\n  Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that\n  §1333(b) did not cover Valladolid’s fatal injury because his accident\n  occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department’s Benefits\n  Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting\n  tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA “must es-\n  tablish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive opera-\n  tions on the shelf.”\nHeld: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a\n substantial nexus between his injury and his employer’s extractive\n operations on the OCS. Pp. 3–14.\n    (a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of\n §1333(b)’s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress\n intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, §1333(b) extends to all\n injuries that would not have occurred “but for” operations on the\n OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be\n    flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have\n    been injured but for his traveling to the rig. In contrast, the Fifth\n    Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish “a bright-\n    line geographic boundary,” extending §1333(b) coverage only to em-\n    ployees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the\n    waters above the OCS. Under its “situs-of-injury” test, a welder in-\n    jured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligi-\n    ble for §1333(b) benefits. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that §1333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can es-\n    tablish a “substantial nexus” between their injury and extractive op-\n    erations on the OCS. The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpre-\n    tation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to\n    those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS\n    and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\n    duration and nature. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) Contrary to Pacific’s position, the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”\n    test is not the best interpretation of §1333(b). Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Nothing in the text of §1333(b) suggests that an injury must\n    occur on the OCS. The provision has only two requirements: The ex-\n    tractive operations must be “conducted on the [OCS],” and the em-\n    ployee’s injury must occur “as the result of” those operations. If, as\n    Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b) was to geographically limit\n    the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Con-\n    gress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from §1333(b)\n    the words “as the result of operations conducted.” Moreover, Con-\n    gress’ decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but\n    not in §1333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit §1333(b).\n    This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470\n    U. S. 414, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, nei-\n    ther of which held that §1333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS in-\n    juries. Section 1333(b)’s text also gives no indication that Congress\n    intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits\n    from LHWCA coverage. To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incor-\n    porated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees\n    might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. Pp. 6–10.\n         (2) Also unpersuasive is Pacific’s alternative argument that\n    §1333(b) imports the LHWCA’s strict situs-of-injury requirement,\n    which provides benefits only for injuries occurring “upon the naviga-\n    ble waters” of the United States, 33 U. S. C. §903(a). It is unlikely\n    that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers’\n    compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combi-\n    nation of two separate legislative Acts. In addition, under Pacific’s\n    alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  navigable waters above the shelf. Thus, even employees on a crew\n  ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a\n  platform explosion would be excluded from §1333(b) coverage. That\n  view cannot be squared with §1333(b)’s language. Pp. 11–12.\n        (3) Pacific’s policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation\n  of §1333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLA’s text. P. 12.\n     (c) Neither the Solicitor General’s status-based inquiry nor the\n  Third Circuit’s “but for” test are compatible with §1333(b). The Solic-\n  itor General’s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA’s text, because\n  §1333(b)’s “occurring as the result of operations” language plainly\n  suggests causation. And when taken to its logical conclusion, the\n  Third Circuit’s test, though nominally based on causation, is essen-\n  tially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all\n  employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from\n  the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are do-\n  ing at the time of injury. Because LHWCA coverage was extended\n  only to injuries “occurring as the result of operations conducted on\n  the [OCS],” §1333(b)’s focus should be on injuries resulting from\n  those “operations.” Pp. 12–14.\n     (d) The Ninth Circuit’s “substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to\n  §1333(b)’s text. This Court understands that test to require the in-\n  jured employee to establish a significant causal link between his in-\n  jury and his employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. The test may\n  not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and\n  courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has estab-\n  lished the required significant causal link. Whether an employee in-\n  jured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the\n  circumstances of each case. It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit\n  to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the “sub-\n  stantial-nexus” test.

S. C. §901 et seq., to injuries\n“occurring as the result of operations conducted on the\nouter Continental Shelf” for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the shelf. 43 U. S. C. §1333(b).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\ndetermined that the OCSLA extends coverage to an em-\nployee who can establish a substantial nexus between his\ninjury and his employer’s extractive operations on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. We affirm.\n                               I\n  Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific),\noperates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental\nShelf off the coast of California and an onshore oil and gas\nprocessing facility in Ventura County, California. Pacific\nemployed Juan Valladolid as a general manual laborer—\nknown in the trade as a roustabout—in its oil exploration\n2   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 per-\ncent of his time on one of Pacific’s offshore drilling plat-\nforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up\nlitter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, main-\ntaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the\nplatform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his\ntime working at Pacific’s onshore processing facility,\nwhere he also performed maintenance duties, including\npainting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain cul-\nverts, and operating a forklift.\n   While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in\na forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a\nclaim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the\nextension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The\nOCSLA provides, in relevant part:\n      “With respect to disability or death of an employee\n    resulting from any injury occurring as the result of\n    operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\n    for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,\n    or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or\n    involving rights to the natural resources, of the sub-\n    soil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, com-\n    pensation shall be payable under the provisions of the\n    [LHWCA].” 43 U. S. C. §1333(b).\n  After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\ndismissed respondent’s claim. The ALJ reasoned that\nValladolid’s fatal injury was not covered under §1333(b)\nbecause his accident occurred on land, rather than on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States\nDepartment of Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed,\nconcluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage\nprovided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees\nwithin the “geographical locale” of the Outer Continental\nShelf.

S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that §1333(b) nei-\nther contains a “situs-of-injury” requirement, as the Fifth\nCircuit has held, nor imposes a “but for” causation re-\nquirement, as the Third Circuit has held. See 604 F. 3d\n1126, 1130–1140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of Mills v.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 877\nF. 2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); Curtis v. Schlumberger\nOffshore Service, Inc., 849 F. 2d 805 (CA3 1988)). Instead,\nthe Ninth Circuit concluded that “the claimant must\nestablish a substantial nexus between the injury and ex-\ntractive operations on the shelf” to qualify for workers’\ncompensation benefits under the OCSLA. 604 F. 3d, at\n1139. We granted Pacific’s petition for a writ of certiorari\nto resolve this conflict. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n  In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67\nStat. 29, 43 U. S. C. §1301 et seq., which extended the\nboundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues\ninto the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress en-\nacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government’s\nauthority and control over the “outer Continental Shelf,”\ndefined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction\nand control of the United States lying seaward and outside\nof the submerged lands within the extended State bound-\naries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. §§1331(a), 1332(1). As\ndefined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf in-\ncludes the “submerged lands” beyond the extended state\nboundaries, §1331(a), but not the waters above those\nsubmerged lands or artificial islands or installations\nattached to the seabed. For simplicity’s sake, we refer to\nthe entire geographical zone as the “OCS.”\n  Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and\nfederal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,\n§1333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of\n4    PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncivil and political jurisdiction “to the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands,\nand all installations and other devices permanently or\ntemporarily attached to the seabed,” for the purpose of\nextracting its natural resources. Section 1333(a)(2)(A)\nmakes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State\napplicable to “that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\nouter Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\nstructures erected thereon, which would be within the\narea of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\nto the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.” Sec-\ntion 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes\nLHWCA workers’ compensation benefits available for the\n“disability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf ” for the purpose of extracting\nits natural resources.\n   The question before us is the scope of coverage under\n§1333(b). The parties agree that §1333(b) covers employ-\nees, such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who\nare injured while working directly on the OCS to extract\nits natural resources. They disagree, however, whether\nemployees who are involved in extraction operations but\nwho are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under\nthe OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the\nphrase “any injury occurring as the result of operations\nconducted on the outer Continental Shelf” in §1333(b).\n   The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpre-\ntations. In Curtis v. Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc.,\n849 F. 2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because\nCongress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive,\n§1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have oc-\ncurred “but for” operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit\nthus concluded that an employee who worked on a semi-\nsubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident\non the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwas eligible for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 806, 811. As the\nThird Circuit summarized, “ ‘But for’ [Curtis’] travelling to\n[his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting ‘operations’\nwithin §1333(b), employee Curtis would not have sus-\ntained injuries in the automobile accident.” Id., at 811.\n   In Mills v. Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en\nbanc, adopted a narrower interpretation of §1333(b). The\ncourt concluded that Congress intended to establish “a\nbright-line geographic boundary for §1333(b) coverage,”\nand held that §1333(b) extends coverage only to employees\nengaged in OCS extractive activities who “suffer injury or\ndeath on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.”\nId., at 362. Applying its “situs-of-injury” test, the Fifth\nCircuit held that a welder who was injured on land during\nthe construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible\nfor §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.\n   In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth\nCircuit’s “situs-of-injury” requirement as unsupported by\nthe text of §1333(b), and the Third Circuit’s “but for” test\nas too broad to be consistent with Congress’ intent. 604\nF. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a\nthird interpretation of §1333(b), holding that a “claimant\nmust establish a substantial nexus between the injury and\nextractive operations on the shelf” to be eligible for\n§1333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. “To meet the standard,”\nthe Ninth Circuit explained, “the claimant must show that\nthe work performed directly furthers outer continental\nshelf operations and is in the regular course of such opera-\ntions.” Ibid.\n   The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpreta-\ntion of §1333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover-\n\n——————\n  1 The Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, United\nStates Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the\nDirector administers the OCSLA workers’ compensation scheme\nestablished by §1333(b).\n6   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nage to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries\nsuffered by employees of companies engaged in resource\nextraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of\nthose employees who spend a substantial portion of their\nworktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations.\nBrief for Federal Respondent 32–33. According to the\nSolicitor General, this test would provide §1333(b) cover-\nage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose\nduties contribute to operations on the OCS and who per-\nform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\nduration and nature. Id., at 35.\n                             III\n  Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”\ntest presents the best interpretation of §1333(b). The crux\nof Pacific’s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be\n“the result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf ” for purposes of §1333(b). Pacific asserts that\nbecause Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did\nnot occur as the result of extraction operations conducted\non the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for\nLHWCA workers’ compensation benefits. We disagree.\n                              A\n  The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to\nthe “disability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf.” §1333(b). Contrary to the\nview of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that lan-\nguage suggests that the injury to the employee must occur\non the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two require-\nments: The extractive operations must be “conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf,” and the employee’s injury\nmust occur “as the result of ” those operations.\n  Despite the lack of a textual “situs-of-injury” require-\nment in §1333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsible for an off-OCS employee to be injured “as the result\nof ” on-OCS operations. Pacific offers no basis for this\nassertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many\nOCS platforms are physically connected to onshore pro-\ncessing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult\nto imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that\ncould injure employees located off the OCS.\n   Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b)\nwas to geographically limit the extension of LHWCA\ncoverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress\ncould easily have achieved that goal by omitting the fol-\nlowing six words in §1333(b)’s text: “as the result of opera-\ntions conducted.” Had Congress done so, the statute\nwould extend LHWCA coverage to the “disability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the\nouter Continental Shelf.” But that is not the text of the\nstatute Congress enacted.\n   Pacific also argues that, because all of §1333(b)’s neigh-\nboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we\nshould infer that Congress intended to include a situs-of-\ninjury requirement in §1333(b). See, e.g., §1333(a)(2)(A)\n(adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State\nas federal law “for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and\nfixed structures erected thereon, which would be within\nthe area of the State if its boundaries were extended sea-\nward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf ”).2\n——————\n   2 See also 43 U.

Con-\ngress’ decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly\nwhere the other subsections of §1333 apply, but to include\nno similar restriction on injuries in §1333(b), convinces us\nthat Congress did not intend §1333(b) to apply only to\ninjuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, §1333(b) extends\nLHWCA workers’ compensation coverage to any employee\ninjury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs\n“as the result of operations conducted on the outer Conti-\nnental Shelf.”\n  Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by lan-\nguage in Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414\n(1985), and Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S.\n207 (1986); but neither of those cases held that §1333(b)\nextends only to injuries that occur on the OCS. In Herb’s\nWelding, this Court considered whether an oil platform\nwelder, who worked both within the territorial waters of\nLouisiana and on the OCS, was covered under the\n——————\napplicable to any unfair labor act “occurring upon any artificial island,\ninstallation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this sec-\ntion”); §1333(d)(1) (granting the Coast Guard enforcement authority\n“on the artificial islands, installations, and other devices referred to in\nsubsection (a) of this section or on the waters adjacent thereto”);\n§1333(d)(2) (granting the Coast Guard authority to mark “any artificial\nisland, installation, or other device referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection” for the protection of navigation); §1333(e) (granting the Army\nauthority to prevent the obstruction of access “to the artificial islands,\ninstallations, and other devices referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection”); §1333(f) (saving clause applying “to the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and the artificial islands, installations, and\nother devices referred to in subsection (a) of this section”).\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The Court explicitly declined\nto address whether the employee was eligible for workers’\ncompensation benefits under §1333(b) because that ques-\ntion was neither passed upon by the Court of Appeals nor\nfully briefed and argued before this Court. Id., at 426,\nn. 12. Although the Court acknowledged that an employee\nmight walk in and out of workers’ compensation coverage\nduring his employment due to the “explicit geographic\nlimitation to the [OCSLA’s] incorporation of the LHWCA,”\nid., at 427, the exact meaning of that statement is unclear.\nWe cannot ascertain whether the comment was a refer-\nence to §1333(b)’s explicit situs-of-operations requirement,\nas respondents suggest, or the recognition of an implicit\nsitus-of-injury requirement, as Pacific argues. In any\nevent, the ambiguous comment was made without analy-\nsis in dicta and does not control this case.\n   The same is true of the Court’s opinion in Offshore\nLogistics. In that case, the Court considered whether the\nwidows of oil platform workers who were killed when their\nhelicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongful-\ndeath suits under Louisiana law. In the Court’s analysis\nof §1333, it stated, “Congress determined that the general\nscope of OCSLA’s coverage . . . would be determined prin-\ncipally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured\nor killed.” 477 U. S., at 219–220 (citing the situs require-\nment in §1333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court com-\nmented: “Only one provision of OCSLA superimposes a\nstatus requirement on the otherwise determinative\nOCSLA situs requirement; §1333(b) makes compensation\nfor the death or injury of an ‘employee’ resulting from\ncertain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable\nunder the [LHWCA].” Ibid., n. 2. These comments about\nthe scope of the OCSLA’s coverage and its determinative\n“situs requirement” do not provide definitive evidence that\n§1333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS.\n10   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAs in Herb’s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement\nin the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding §1333(b) was\nreferring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or\nto an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the\nentire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly\nstated, §1333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at\n219–220.\n  Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries\nwithin the scope of the workers’ compensation coverage\ncreated by §1333(b) runs counter to Congress’ intent in\ndrafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress in-\ntended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that\nboth filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated juris-\ndictional overlaps between existing state and federal pro-\ngrams. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury\nrequirement to narrow the scope of §1333(b), an off-OCS\nworker could be eligible for both state and federal workers’\ncompensation coverage.\n    There is no indication in the text, however, that the\nOCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage\nwhen they are also eligible for state benefits. To the con-\ntrary, the LHWCA workers’ compensation scheme incor-\nporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured\nemployees might be eligible for both state and federal\nbenefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides\nthat “any amounts paid to an employee for the same in-\njury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed\nunder [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers’ com-\npensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against\nany liability imposed by [the LHWCA].” 33 U. S. C.\n§903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any\ntextual support for Pacific’s argument, convinces us that\nCongress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s\ncoverage to only those geographic areas where state work-\ners’ compensation schemes do not apply.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from\nthe interaction of §1333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.\nSpecifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA\ncontains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33\nU. S. C. §903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occur-\nring “upon the navigable waters” of the United States),\nand because 43 U. S. C. §1333(b) extends the LHWCA\nworkers’ compensation scheme to the OCS, §1333(b) in-\ncorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement\nfrom §903(a). According to Pacific, the words “occurring as\nthe result of operations” in §1333(b) impose a status re-\nquirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement, with the result that employees who\nare injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to\nextractive operations, are excluded from the workers’\ncompensation coverage created by §1333(b). Thus, an\naccountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling\nplatform would be ineligible under §1333(b) despite being\nan employee who is injured on the OCS.\n   Although this alternative argument has the advantage\nof assigning some meaning to the words “occurring as the\nresult of operations” in §1333(b), we still find it unpersua-\nsive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose\na situs-of-injury requirement in §1333(b) through such a\nnonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate\nlegislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an\nexpress situs-of-injury requirement in the text of §1333(b)\nwould have been simple. Second, combining the §1333(b)\ndefinition of “United States” with the LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. §903(a) would result in\nan OCS workers’ compensation scheme that applies only\nto the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and\nfixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)(3)\n(stating that “the term ‘United States’ when used in a\ngeographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf\n12   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand artificial islands and fixed structures thereon”).\nPacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navi-\ngable waters above the shelf, including the waters imme-\ndiately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,\nunder Pacific’s view, even employees on a crew ship im-\nmediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured\nduring a platform explosion would be excluded from\n§1333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the\ntext of the statute, which applies to “any injury occurring\nas the result of operations conducted” on the OCS.\n                             C\n   Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of\na situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot\njustify an interpretation of §1333(b) that is inconsistent\nwith the text of the OCSLA. “[I]f Congress’ coverage\ndecisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Con-\ngress to change them. We should not legislate for them.”\nHerb’s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of\n§1333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion\nof injuries that occur beyond the OCS.\n                             IV\n   The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based\ninquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a\ndifferent test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Gov-\nernment proposes that when a worker is injured on the\nOCS, he is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits if he\nis employed by a company engaged in extractive opera-\ntions on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the\nOCS, the employee will be covered only if his “duties\ncontribute to operations” on the OCS and if he performs\n“work on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of\nboth its duration and nature.” Brief for Federal Respond-\nent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncriteria by which an employee qualifies as a “seaman”\nunder the Jones Act), and might well have merit as legis-\nlation. But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as\npresently enacted. The “occurring as the result of opera-\ntions” language in §1333(b) plainly suggests causation.\nAlthough the Government asserts that a status-based test\nwould be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot\nignore the language enacted by Congress.\n   The Third Circuit’s “but for” test is nominally based on\ncausation, but it is also incompatible with §1333(b). Tak-\nen to its logical conclusion, the “but for” test would extend\nworkers’ compensation coverage to all employees of a\nbusiness engaged in the extraction of natural resources\nfrom the OCS, no matter where those employees work or\nwhat they are doing when they are injured. This test\ncould reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office\nemployees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with\nextractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress ex-\ntended LHWCA coverage only to injuries “occurring as\nthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf,” we think that §1333(b) should be interpreted in\na manner that focuses on injuries that result from those\n“operations.” This view is consistent with our past treat-\nment of similar language in other contexts. In Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258\n(1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influ-\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a\ncause of action to “[a]ny person injured in his business\nor property by reason of a violation of section 1962.” 18\nU. S. C. §1964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a “but\nfor” interpretation, stating that such a construction was\n“hardly compelled” and that it was highly unlikely that\nCongress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs\nto recover. 503 U. S., at 265–266. Instead, we adopted a\nproximate-cause standard consistent with our prior inter-\npretation of the same language in the Sherman and Clay-\n14   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nton Acts. Id., at 267–268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s\nlanguage hardly compels the Third Circuit’s expansive\n“but for” interpretation.\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s\n “substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to the text of\n§1333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit’s test to require\nthe injured employee to establish a significant causal link\nbetween the injury that he suffered and his employer’s on-\nOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the OCS.\n   Although the Ninth Circuit’s test may not be the easiest\nto administer, it best reflects the text of §1333(b), which\nestablishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a “but for” test.\nWe are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to\ndetermine whether an injured employee has established a\nsignificant causal link between the injury he suffered and\nhis employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we\nexpect that employees injured while performing tasks on\nthe OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an em-\nployee injured while performing an off-OCS task quali-\nfies—like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore\nscrap metal consolidation—is a question that will depend\non the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth\nCircuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board\nto apply the “substantial-nexus” test in the first instance,\nand we agree with that disposition.\n   The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to\nthe Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

My\ndisagreement is limited to the last two substantive para-\ngraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit’s\n“substantial-nexus” test for determining the scope of cover-\nage under 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The Court indulges in con-\nsiderable understatement when it acknowledges that this\ntest “may not be the easiest to administer,” ante, at 14.\n“Substantial nexus” is novel legalese with no established\nmeaning in the present context. I agree with the Court’s\nrejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the\nparties—which, though easier to apply, are unmoored\nfrom the text of §1333(b). But if we must adopt an inde-\nterminate standard (and the statute’s “as the result of ”\nlanguage leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to\nthe devil of the Ninth Circuit’s imagining. I would hold\nthat an employee may recover under §1333(b) if his injury\nwas proximately caused by operations on the Outer Conti-\nnental Shelf (OCS).\n  The term “proximate cause” is “shorthand for a concept:\nInjuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto legal liability.” CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). Life is too short to pursue\nevery event to its most remote, “but-for,” consequences,\nand the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough\nguide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of\ncause-and-effect. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protec-\ntion Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 287 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in\nrejecting the Third Circuit’s “but for” test for §1333(b)\ncoverage, we have interpreted statutes with language\nsimilar to §1333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause\nstandard. See ante, at 13–14.\n   Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in\ntort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions,\nit can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation\nschemes like this one. In Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 119 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans’ com-\npensation statute covering injuries that occurred “as the\nresult of ” medical treatment (precisely the language at\nissue here); we suggested that the requisite “causal con-\nnection” between the injury and medical treatment may\nbe “limited to proximate causation so as to narrow the\nclass of compensable cases . . . by eliminating remote conse-\nquences.” Similarly, some state workers’ compensation\nlaws use the concept of proximate cause to determine\nentitlement.

Unlike the\nsubstantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a “vo-\ncabulary” for answering questions like the one raised by\nthe facts of this case.

S. 274, 279 (1977): We sustain\nstate taxes against Commerce Clause challenges if they\nare, inter alia, “applied to an activity with a substantial\nnexus with the taxing State.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 183 (1995) (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). “[S]uch a nexus\nis established when the taxpayer ‘avails itself of the sub-\nstantial privilege of carrying on business’ in that jurisdic-\ntion.” Polar Tankers, Inc. v. City of Valdez, 557 U. S. 1, 11\n(2009). That clarification—and any further clarification in\nthe Commerce Clause context—will not be remotely help-\nful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-\nnexus test in the very different legal context of workers’\ncompensation under §1333(b). In this latter context, I\nassume the Court means by “substantial nexus” a sub-\nstantial causal nexus—since §1333(b)’s “as the result of ”\nlanguage “plainly suggests causation,” ante, at 13. Like\nthe word “nexus” itself, the definition of “substantial\nnexus” in our state-tax cases does not require any causal\nrelationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by\ncomparison, represents a much more natural interpreta-\ntion of a statute that turns on causation.\n   Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel “sub-\nstantial [causal] nexus” test, a new tertium quid of causal-\nity—somewhere between but-for causality and proximate\ncause? One might think so, since there is no other sensi-\nble reason to (1) reject but-for cause, (2) say nothing about\nthe natural alternative (proximate cause), and (3) embrace\nthe “substantial [causal] nexus” novelty. On the other\nhand, the Court’s opinion suggests at least some connec-\ntion (that is to say, in the Court’s favored lawspeak, some\n“nexus”) between the proximate-cause standard and the\nsubstantial-nexus test, since it cites one of our proximate-\ncause cases just before concluding that “[a]ccordingly, . . .\nthe Ninth Circuit’s ‘substantial-nexus’ test is more faithful\nto the text of §1333(b)” than the Third Circuit’s but-for\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the\n  Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33\n  U. S. C. §901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands\n  Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries “occurring\n  as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]” for the purpose of\n  extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The\n  Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that\n  §1333(b) did not cover Valladolid’s fatal injury because his accident\n  occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department’s Benefits\n  Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting\n  tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA “must es-\n  tablish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive opera-\n  tions on the shelf.”\nHeld: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a\n substantial nexus between his injury and his employer’s extractive\n operations on the OCS. Pp. 3–14.\n    (a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of\n §1333(b)’s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress\n intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, §1333(b) extends to all\n injuries that would not have occurred “but for” operations on the\n OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be\n    flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have\n    been injured but for his traveling to the rig. In contrast, the Fifth\n    Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish “a bright-\n    line geographic boundary,” extending §1333(b) coverage only to em-\n    ployees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the\n    waters above the OCS. Under its “situs-of-injury” test, a welder in-\n    jured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligi-\n    ble for §1333(b) benefits. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that §1333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can es-\n    tablish a “substantial nexus” between their injury and extractive op-\n    erations on the OCS. The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpre-\n    tation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to\n    those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS\n    and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\n    duration and nature. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) Contrary to Pacific’s position, the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”\n    test is not the best interpretation of §1333(b). Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Nothing in the text of §1333(b) suggests that an injury must\n    occur on the OCS. The provision has only two requirements: The ex-\n    tractive operations must be “conducted on the [OCS],” and the em-\n    ployee’s injury must occur “as the result of” those operations. If, as\n    Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b) was to geographically limit\n    the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Con-\n    gress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from §1333(b)\n    the words “as the result of operations conducted.” Moreover, Con-\n    gress’ decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but\n    not in §1333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit §1333(b).\n    This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470\n    U. S. 414, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, nei-\n    ther of which held that §1333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS in-\n    juries. Section 1333(b)’s text also gives no indication that Congress\n    intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits\n    from LHWCA coverage. To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incor-\n    porated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees\n    might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. Pp. 6–10.\n         (2) Also unpersuasive is Pacific’s alternative argument that\n    §1333(b) imports the LHWCA’s strict situs-of-injury requirement,\n    which provides benefits only for injuries occurring “upon the naviga-\n    ble waters” of the United States, 33 U. S. C. §903(a). It is unlikely\n    that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers’\n    compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combi-\n    nation of two separate legislative Acts. In addition, under Pacific’s\n    alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  navigable waters above the shelf. Thus, even employees on a crew\n  ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a\n  platform explosion would be excluded from §1333(b) coverage. That\n  view cannot be squared with §1333(b)’s language. Pp. 11–12.\n        (3) Pacific’s policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation\n  of §1333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLA’s text. P. 12.\n     (c) Neither the Solicitor General’s status-based inquiry nor the\n  Third Circuit’s “but for” test are compatible with §1333(b). The Solic-\n  itor General’s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA’s text, because\n  §1333(b)’s “occurring as the result of operations” language plainly\n  suggests causation. And when taken to its logical conclusion, the\n  Third Circuit’s test, though nominally based on causation, is essen-\n  tially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all\n  employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from\n  the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are do-\n  ing at the time of injury. Because LHWCA coverage was extended\n  only to injuries “occurring as the result of operations conducted on\n  the [OCS],” §1333(b)’s focus should be on injuries resulting from\n  those “operations.” Pp. 12–14.\n     (d) The Ninth Circuit’s “substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to\n  §1333(b)’s text. This Court understands that test to require the in-\n  jured employee to establish a significant causal link between his in-\n  jury and his employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. The test may\n  not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and\n  courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has estab-\n  lished the required significant causal link. Whether an employee in-\n  jured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the\n  circumstances of each case. It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit\n  to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the “sub-\n  stantial-nexus” test.

S. C. §901 et seq., to injuries\n“occurring as the result of operations conducted on the\nouter Continental Shelf” for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the shelf. 43 U. S. C. §1333(b).\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\ndetermined that the OCSLA extends coverage to an em-\nployee who can establish a substantial nexus between his\ninjury and his employer’s extractive operations on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. We affirm.\n                               I\n  Petitioner Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP (Pacific),\noperates two drilling platforms on the Outer Continental\nShelf off the coast of California and an onshore oil and gas\nprocessing facility in Ventura County, California. Pacific\nemployed Juan Valladolid as a general manual laborer—\nknown in the trade as a roustabout—in its oil exploration\n2   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 per-\ncent of his time on one of Pacific’s offshore drilling plat-\nforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up\nlitter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, main-\ntaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the\nplatform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his\ntime working at Pacific’s onshore processing facility,\nwhere he also performed maintenance duties, including\npainting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain cul-\nverts, and operating a forklift.\n   While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in\na forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a\nclaim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the\nextension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The\nOCSLA provides, in relevant part:\n      “With respect to disability or death of an employee\n    resulting from any injury occurring as the result of\n    operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf\n    for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,\n    or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or\n    involving rights to the natural resources, of the sub-\n    soil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, com-\n    pensation shall be payable under the provisions of the\n    [LHWCA].” 43 U. S. C. §1333(b).\n  After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\ndismissed respondent’s claim. The ALJ reasoned that\nValladolid’s fatal injury was not covered under §1333(b)\nbecause his accident occurred on land, rather than on the\nOuter Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States\nDepartment of Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed,\nconcluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage\nprovided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees\nwithin the “geographical locale” of the Outer Continental\nShelf.

S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that §1333(b) nei-\nther contains a “situs-of-injury” requirement, as the Fifth\nCircuit has held, nor imposes a “but for” causation re-\nquirement, as the Third Circuit has held. See 604 F. 3d\n1126, 1130–1140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of Mills v.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 877\nF. 2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); Curtis v. Schlumberger\nOffshore Service, Inc., 849 F. 2d 805 (CA3 1988)). Instead,\nthe Ninth Circuit concluded that “the claimant must\nestablish a substantial nexus between the injury and ex-\ntractive operations on the shelf” to qualify for workers’\ncompensation benefits under the OCSLA. 604 F. 3d, at\n1139. We granted Pacific’s petition for a writ of certiorari\nto resolve this conflict. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n  In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67\nStat. 29, 43 U. S. C. §1301 et seq., which extended the\nboundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues\ninto the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress en-\nacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government’s\nauthority and control over the “outer Continental Shelf,”\ndefined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction\nand control of the United States lying seaward and outside\nof the submerged lands within the extended State bound-\naries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. §§1331(a), 1332(1). As\ndefined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf in-\ncludes the “submerged lands” beyond the extended state\nboundaries, §1331(a), but not the waters above those\nsubmerged lands or artificial islands or installations\nattached to the seabed. For simplicity’s sake, we refer to\nthe entire geographical zone as the “OCS.”\n  Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and\nfederal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,\n§1333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of\n4    PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncivil and political jurisdiction “to the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands,\nand all installations and other devices permanently or\ntemporarily attached to the seabed,” for the purpose of\nextracting its natural resources. Section 1333(a)(2)(A)\nmakes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State\napplicable to “that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the\nouter Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed\nstructures erected thereon, which would be within the\narea of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward\nto the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.” Sec-\ntion 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes\nLHWCA workers’ compensation benefits available for the\n“disability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf ” for the purpose of extracting\nits natural resources.\n   The question before us is the scope of coverage under\n§1333(b). The parties agree that §1333(b) covers employ-\nees, such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who\nare injured while working directly on the OCS to extract\nits natural resources. They disagree, however, whether\nemployees who are involved in extraction operations but\nwho are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under\nthe OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the\nphrase “any injury occurring as the result of operations\nconducted on the outer Continental Shelf” in §1333(b).\n   The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpre-\ntations. In Curtis v. Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc.,\n849 F. 2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because\nCongress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive,\n§1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have oc-\ncurred “but for” operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit\nthus concluded that an employee who worked on a semi-\nsubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident\non the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwas eligible for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 806, 811. As the\nThird Circuit summarized, “ ‘But for’ [Curtis’] travelling to\n[his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting ‘operations’\nwithin §1333(b), employee Curtis would not have sus-\ntained injuries in the automobile accident.” Id., at 811.\n   In Mills v. Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en\nbanc, adopted a narrower interpretation of §1333(b). The\ncourt concluded that Congress intended to establish “a\nbright-line geographic boundary for §1333(b) coverage,”\nand held that §1333(b) extends coverage only to employees\nengaged in OCS extractive activities who “suffer injury or\ndeath on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.”\nId., at 362. Applying its “situs-of-injury” test, the Fifth\nCircuit held that a welder who was injured on land during\nthe construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible\nfor §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.\n   In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth\nCircuit’s “situs-of-injury” requirement as unsupported by\nthe text of §1333(b), and the Third Circuit’s “but for” test\nas too broad to be consistent with Congress’ intent. 604\nF. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a\nthird interpretation of §1333(b), holding that a “claimant\nmust establish a substantial nexus between the injury and\nextractive operations on the shelf” to be eligible for\n§1333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. “To meet the standard,”\nthe Ninth Circuit explained, “the claimant must show that\nthe work performed directly furthers outer continental\nshelf operations and is in the regular course of such opera-\ntions.” Ibid.\n   The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpreta-\ntion of §1333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover-\n\n——————\n  1 The Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, United\nStates Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the\nDirector administers the OCSLA workers’ compensation scheme\nestablished by §1333(b).\n6   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nage to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries\nsuffered by employees of companies engaged in resource\nextraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of\nthose employees who spend a substantial portion of their\nworktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations.\nBrief for Federal Respondent 32–33. According to the\nSolicitor General, this test would provide §1333(b) cover-\nage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose\nduties contribute to operations on the OCS and who per-\nform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both\nduration and nature. Id., at 35.\n                             III\n  Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”\ntest presents the best interpretation of §1333(b). The crux\nof Pacific’s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be\n“the result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf ” for purposes of §1333(b). Pacific asserts that\nbecause Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did\nnot occur as the result of extraction operations conducted\non the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for\nLHWCA workers’ compensation benefits. We disagree.\n                              A\n  The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to\nthe “disability or death of an employee resulting from any\ninjury occurring as the result of operations conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf.” §1333(b). Contrary to the\nview of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that lan-\nguage suggests that the injury to the employee must occur\non the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two require-\nments: The extractive operations must be “conducted on\nthe outer Continental Shelf,” and the employee’s injury\nmust occur “as the result of ” those operations.\n  Despite the lack of a textual “situs-of-injury” require-\nment in §1333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsible for an off-OCS employee to be injured “as the result\nof ” on-OCS operations. Pacific offers no basis for this\nassertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many\nOCS platforms are physically connected to onshore pro-\ncessing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult\nto imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that\ncould injure employees located off the OCS.\n   Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b)\nwas to geographically limit the extension of LHWCA\ncoverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress\ncould easily have achieved that goal by omitting the fol-\nlowing six words in §1333(b)’s text: “as the result of opera-\ntions conducted.” Had Congress done so, the statute\nwould extend LHWCA coverage to the “disability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the\nouter Continental Shelf.” But that is not the text of the\nstatute Congress enacted.\n   Pacific also argues that, because all of §1333(b)’s neigh-\nboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we\nshould infer that Congress intended to include a situs-of-\ninjury requirement in §1333(b). See, e.g., §1333(a)(2)(A)\n(adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State\nas federal law “for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of\nthe outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and\nfixed structures erected thereon, which would be within\nthe area of the State if its boundaries were extended sea-\nward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf ”).2\n——————\n   2 See also 43 U.

Con-\ngress’ decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly\nwhere the other subsections of §1333 apply, but to include\nno similar restriction on injuries in §1333(b), convinces us\nthat Congress did not intend §1333(b) to apply only to\ninjuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, §1333(b) extends\nLHWCA workers’ compensation coverage to any employee\ninjury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs\n“as the result of operations conducted on the outer Conti-\nnental Shelf.”\n  Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by lan-\nguage in Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414\n(1985), and Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S.\n207 (1986); but neither of those cases held that §1333(b)\nextends only to injuries that occur on the OCS.

The Court explicitly declined\nto address whether the employee was eligible for workers’\ncompensation benefits under §1333(b) because that ques-\ntion was neither passed upon by the Court of Appeals nor\nfully briefed and argued before this Court. Id., at 426,\nn. 12. Although the Court acknowledged that an employee\nmight walk in and out of workers’ compensation coverage\nduring his employment due to the “explicit geographic\nlimitation to the [OCSLA’s] incorporation of the LHWCA,”\nid., at 427, the exact meaning of that statement is unclear.\nWe cannot ascertain whether the comment was a refer-\nence to §1333(b)’s explicit situs-of-operations requirement,\nas respondents suggest, or the recognition of an implicit\nsitus-of-injury requirement, as Pacific argues. In any\nevent, the ambiguous comment was made without analy-\nsis in dicta and does not control this case.\n   The same is true of the Court’s opinion in Offshore\nLogistics. In that case, the Court considered whether the\nwidows of oil platform workers who were killed when their\nhelicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongful-\ndeath suits under Louisiana law. In the Court’s analysis\nof §1333, it stated, “Congress determined that the general\nscope of OCSLA’s coverage . . . would be determined prin-\ncipally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured\nor killed.” 477 U. S., at 219–220 (citing the situs require-\nment in §1333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court com-\nmented: “Only one provision of OCSLA superimposes a\nstatus requirement on the otherwise determinative\nOCSLA situs requirement; §1333(b) makes compensation\nfor the death or injury of an ‘employee’ resulting from\ncertain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable\nunder the [LHWCA].” Ibid., n. 2. These comments about\nthe scope of the OCSLA’s coverage and its determinative\n“situs requirement” do not provide definitive evidence that\n§1333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS.\n10   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAs in Herb’s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement\nin the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding §1333(b) was\nreferring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or\nto an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the\nentire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly\nstated, §1333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at\n219–220.\n  Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries\nwithin the scope of the workers’ compensation coverage\ncreated by §1333(b) runs counter to Congress’ intent in\ndrafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress in-\ntended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that\nboth filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated juris-\ndictional overlaps between existing state and federal pro-\ngrams. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury\nrequirement to narrow the scope of §1333(b), an off-OCS\nworker could be eligible for both state and federal workers’\ncompensation coverage.\n    There is no indication in the text, however, that the\nOCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage\nwhen they are also eligible for state benefits. To the con-\ntrary, the LHWCA workers’ compensation scheme incor-\nporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured\nemployees might be eligible for both state and federal\nbenefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides\nthat “any amounts paid to an employee for the same in-\njury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed\nunder [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers’ com-\npensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against\nany liability imposed by [the LHWCA].” 33 U. S. C.\n§903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any\ntextual support for Pacific’s argument, convinces us that\nCongress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s\ncoverage to only those geographic areas where state work-\ners’ compensation schemes do not apply.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from\nthe interaction of §1333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.\nSpecifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA\ncontains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33\nU. S. C. §903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occur-\nring “upon the navigable waters” of the United States),\nand because 43 U. S. C. §1333(b) extends the LHWCA\nworkers’ compensation scheme to the OCS, §1333(b) in-\ncorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement\nfrom §903(a). According to Pacific, the words “occurring as\nthe result of operations” in §1333(b) impose a status re-\nquirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement, with the result that employees who\nare injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to\nextractive operations, are excluded from the workers’\ncompensation coverage created by §1333(b). Thus, an\naccountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling\nplatform would be ineligible under §1333(b) despite being\nan employee who is injured on the OCS.\n   Although this alternative argument has the advantage\nof assigning some meaning to the words “occurring as the\nresult of operations” in §1333(b), we still find it unpersua-\nsive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose\na situs-of-injury requirement in §1333(b) through such a\nnonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate\nlegislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an\nexpress situs-of-injury requirement in the text of §1333(b)\nwould have been simple. Second, combining the §1333(b)\ndefinition of “United States” with the LHWCA situs-of-\ninjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. §903(a) would result in\nan OCS workers’ compensation scheme that applies only\nto the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and\nfixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)(3)\n(stating that “the term ‘United States’ when used in a\ngeographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf\n12   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand artificial islands and fixed structures thereon”).\nPacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navi-\ngable waters above the shelf, including the waters imme-\ndiately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,\nunder Pacific’s view, even employees on a crew ship im-\nmediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured\nduring a platform explosion would be excluded from\n§1333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the\ntext of the statute, which applies to “any injury occurring\nas the result of operations conducted” on the OCS.\n                             C\n   Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of\na situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot\njustify an interpretation of §1333(b) that is inconsistent\nwith the text of the OCSLA. “[I]f Congress’ coverage\ndecisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Con-\ngress to change them. We should not legislate for them.”\nHerb’s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of\n§1333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion\nof injuries that occur beyond the OCS.\n                             IV\n   The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based\ninquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a\ndifferent test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Gov-\nernment proposes that when a worker is injured on the\nOCS, he is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits if he\nis employed by a company engaged in extractive opera-\ntions on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the\nOCS, the employee will be covered only if his “duties\ncontribute to operations” on the OCS and if he performs\n“work on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of\nboth its duration and nature.” Brief for Federal Respond-\nent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncriteria by which an employee qualifies as a “seaman”\nunder the Jones Act), and might well have merit as legis-\nlation. But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as\npresently enacted. The “occurring as the result of opera-\ntions” language in §1333(b) plainly suggests causation.\nAlthough the Government asserts that a status-based test\nwould be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot\nignore the language enacted by Congress.\n   The Third Circuit’s “but for” test is nominally based on\ncausation, but it is also incompatible with §1333(b). Tak-\nen to its logical conclusion, the “but for” test would extend\nworkers’ compensation coverage to all employees of a\nbusiness engaged in the extraction of natural resources\nfrom the OCS, no matter where those employees work or\nwhat they are doing when they are injured. This test\ncould reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office\nemployees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with\nextractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress ex-\ntended LHWCA coverage only to injuries “occurring as\nthe result of operations conducted on the outer Continen-\ntal Shelf,” we think that §1333(b) should be interpreted in\na manner that focuses on injuries that result from those\n“operations.” This view is consistent with our past treat-\nment of similar language in other contexts. In Holmes v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258\n(1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influ-\nenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a\ncause of action to “[a]ny person injured in his business\nor property by reason of a violation of section 1962.” 18\nU. S. C. §1964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a “but\nfor” interpretation, stating that such a construction was\n“hardly compelled” and that it was highly unlikely that\nCongress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs\nto recover. 503 U. S., at 265–266. Instead, we adopted a\nproximate-cause standard consistent with our prior inter-\npretation of the same language in the Sherman and Clay-\n14   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nton Acts. Id., at 267–268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s\nlanguage hardly compels the Third Circuit’s expansive\n“but for” interpretation.\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s\n “substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to the text of\n§1333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit’s test to require\nthe injured employee to establish a significant causal link\nbetween the injury that he suffered and his employer’s on-\nOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting\nnatural resources from the OCS.\n   Although the Ninth Circuit’s test may not be the easiest\nto administer, it best reflects the text of §1333(b), which\nestablishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a “but for” test.\nWe are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to\ndetermine whether an injured employee has established a\nsignificant causal link between the injury he suffered and\nhis employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we\nexpect that employees injured while performing tasks on\nthe OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an em-\nployee injured while performing an off-OCS task quali-\nfies—like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore\nscrap metal consolidation—is a question that will depend\non the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth\nCircuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board\nto apply the “substantial-nexus” test in the first instance,\nand we agree with that disposition.\n   The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to\nthe Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

My\ndisagreement is limited to the last two substantive para-\ngraphs of Part IV, which endorse the Ninth Circuit’s\n“substantial-nexus” test for determining the scope of cover-\nage under 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The Court indulges in con-\nsiderable understatement when it acknowledges that this\ntest “may not be the easiest to administer,” ante, at 14.\n“Substantial nexus” is novel legalese with no established\nmeaning in the present context. I agree with the Court’s\nrejection of some of the clearer rules proposed by the\nparties—which, though easier to apply, are unmoored\nfrom the text of §1333(b). But if we must adopt an inde-\nterminate standard (and the statute’s “as the result of ”\nlanguage leaves us no choice) I prefer the devil we know to\nthe devil of the Ninth Circuit’s imagining. I would hold\nthat an employee may recover under §1333(b) if his injury\nwas proximately caused by operations on the Outer Conti-\nnental Shelf (OCS).\n  The term “proximate cause” is “shorthand for a concept:\nInjuries have countless causes, and not all should give rise\n2      PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nto legal liability.” CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). Life is too short to pursue\nevery event to its most remote, “but-for,” consequences,\nand the doctrine of proximate cause provides a rough\nguide for courts in cutting off otherwise endless chains of\ncause-and-effect. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protec-\ntion Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 287 (1992) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Thus, as the Court notes in\nrejecting the Third Circuit’s “but for” test for §1333(b)\ncoverage, we have interpreted statutes with language\nsimilar to §1333(b) as prescribing a proximate-cause\nstandard. See ante, at 13–14.\n   Although the doctrine of proximate cause is rooted in\ntort law and most commonly applied in negligence actions,\nit can also provide a useful guide in no-fault compensation\nschemes like this one. In Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 119 (1994), we considered a no-fault veterans’ com-\npensation statute covering injuries that occurred “as the\nresult of ” medical treatment (precisely the language at\nissue here); we suggested that the requisite “causal con-\nnection” between the injury and medical treatment may\nbe “limited to proximate causation so as to narrow the\nclass of compensable cases . . . by eliminating remote conse-\nquences.” Similarly, some state workers’ compensation\nlaws use the concept of proximate cause to determine\nentitlement. See, e.g., Ex parte Patton, __ So. 3d __, __\n(Ala. 2011); Marandino v. Prometheus Pharmacy, 294\nConn. 564, 591, 986 A. 2d 1023, 1041 (2010); Grant v.\nGrant Textiles, 372 S. C. 196, 201, 641 S. E. 2d 869, 871\n(2007). Indeed, the statutory law of California, where Mr.\nValladolid died while at work, limits workers’ compensa-\ntion liability to cases “[w]here the injury is proximately\ncaused by the employment, either with or without negli-\ngence.” Cal. Lab. Code Ann. §3600(a)(3) (West 2011).* I\n——————\n    * Strange to say, the California Supreme Court has held that this\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

C. §1333(b) could\nnot similarly be cabined by the familiar limits of proxi-\nmate causation.\n   To be sure, proximate cause is an imperfect legal doc-\ntrine; I have no illusions that its tenets are easy to de-\nscribe or straightforward to apply. Judicial opinions do\nnot provide a uniform formulation of the test, and border-\nline cases are rarely clear. But “it is often easier to dis-\nparage the product of centuries of common law than to\ndevise a plausible substitute.” McBride, 564 U. S., at ___\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2–3). Unlike the\nsubstantial-nexus test, proximate cause provides a “vo-\ncabulary” for answering questions like the one raised by\nthe facts of this case. It may be productive, for example, to\nconsider whether the injury was “within the scope of the\nrisk” created by OCS operations, or whether some “super-\nseding or intervening cause” exists. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n15). In addition to that vocabulary, precedents on proxi-\nmate cause “furnish illustrations of situations which\njudicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to\nbe on one side of the line or the other.” Exxon Co., U. S. A.\nv. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 839 (1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   “Substantial nexus,” by contrast, is an indeterminate\nphrase that lacks all pedigree. Our case law has used it as\na term of art in only one context, first appearing in Justice\nBlackmun’s opinion for the Court in Complete Auto Trans-\n\n——————\nunmistakable term-of-art reference to a rule found in the common law\nof torts does not establish a rule “identical to that found in the common\nlaw of torts,” but merely “elaborat[es] the general requirement that the\ninjury arise out of the employment.” LaTourette v.

Perhaps (who knows?) later\nCalifornia Supreme Court cases will “clarify” this general requirement\nby saying that it requires a “substantial nexoos” between the employ-\nment and the injury.\n4   PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977): We sustain\nstate taxes against Commerce Clause challenges if they\nare, inter alia, “applied to an activity with a substantial\nnexus with the taxing State.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 183 (1995) (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). “[S]uch a nexus\nis established when the taxpayer ‘avails itself of the sub-\nstantial privilege of carrying on business’ in that jurisdic-\ntion.” Polar Tankers, Inc. v. City of Valdez, 557 U. S. 1, 11\n(2009). That clarification—and any further clarification in\nthe Commerce Clause context—will not be remotely help-\nful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantial-\nnexus test in the very different legal context of workers’\ncompensation under §1333(b). In this latter context, I\nassume the Court means by “substantial nexus” a sub-\nstantial causal nexus—since §1333(b)’s “as the result of ”\nlanguage “plainly suggests causation,” ante, at 13. Like\nthe word “nexus” itself, the definition of “substantial\nnexus” in our state-tax cases does not require any causal\nrelationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by\ncomparison, represents a much more natural interpreta-\ntion of a statute that turns on causation.\n   Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel “sub-\nstantial [causal] nexus” test, a new tertium quid of causal-\nity—somewhere between but-for causality and proximate\ncause? One might think so, since there is no other sensi-\nble reason to (1) reject but-for cause, (2) say nothing about\nthe natural alternative (proximate cause), and (3) embrace\nthe “substantial [causal] nexus” novelty. On the other\nhand, the Court’s opinion suggests at least some connec-\ntion (that is to say, in the Court’s favored lawspeak, some\n“nexus”) between the proximate-cause standard and the\nsubstantial-nexus test, since it cites one of our proximate-\ncause cases just before concluding that “[a]ccordingly, . . .\nthe Ninth Circuit’s ‘substantial-nexus’ test is more faithful\nto the text of §1333(b)” than the Third Circuit’s but-for\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

In the opinion below, moreover, the\nNinth Circuit purported to endorse the Fifth Circuit’s pre-\n1989 case law, which required “ ‘ that the claimant show a\nnexus . . . similar to the proximate cause test in tort law.’ ”\n604 F. 3d 1126, 1140 (CA9 2010) (quoting Mills v. Director,\nOffice of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 846 F. 2d\n1013, 1015 (CA5 1988), rev’d en banc, 877 F. 2d 356\n(1989)). Who knows whether this is a tertium quid or not?\nThe Court has given us a new test whose contours are\nentirely undescribed, and which has nothing to be said for\nit except that it will add complexity to the law and litiga-\ntion to the courts.\n   Finally, I must note an additional uncertainty (or else a\npeculiarity) that the Court’s opinion creates: The statutory\ntext at issue requires compensation for “disability or death\nof an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the\nresult of operations conducted on the outer Continental\nShelf . . . .” §1333(b) (emphasis added). Before today,\nI would have thought it clear that courts must apply\nproximate-cause analysis to the “resulting from” provision;\nbut that would seem quite peculiar if (as the Court holds\ntoday) we apply substantial-nexus analysis to the neigh-\nboring “occurring as the result of ” provision.
