EQUAL EMPLOYMENT \n\n        OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10\u2013553.     Argued October 5, 2011\u2014Decided January 11, 2012\nPetitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is\n  a member congregation of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod.\n  The Synod classifies its school teachers into two categories: \u201ccalled\u201d\n  and \u201clay.\u201d \u201cCalled\u201d teachers are regarded as having been called to\n  their vocation by God. To be eligible to be considered \u201ccalled,\u201d a\n  teacher must complete certain academic requirements, including a\n  course of theological study. Once called, a teacher receives the formal\n  title \u201cMinister of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d \u201cLay\u201d teachers, by con-\n  trast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lu-\n  theran. Although lay and called teachers at Hosanna-Tabor general-\n  ly performed the same duties, lay teachers were hired only when\n  called teachers were unavailable.\n     After respondent Cheryl Perich completed the required training,\n  Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accept-\n  ed the call and was designated a commissioned minister. In addition\n  to teaching secular subjects, Perich taught a religion class, led her\n  students in daily prayer and devotional exercises, and took her stu-\n  dents to a weekly school-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel\n  service herself about twice a year.\n     Perich developed narcolepsy and began the 2004\u20132005 school year\n  on disability leave. In January 2005, she notified the school principal\n  that she would be able to report to work in February. The principal\n  responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher\n  to fill Perich\u2019s position for the remainder of the school year. The\n  principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to re-\n  turn to the classroom. The congregation subsequently offered to pay\n2      HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                   AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    a portion of Perich\u2019s health insurance premiums in exchange for her\n    resignation as a called teacher. Perich refused to resign. In Febru-\n    ary, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until\n    she received written documentation that she had reported to work.\n    The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be\n    fired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and in-\n    tended to assert her legal rights. In a subsequent letter, the chair-\n    man of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would\n    consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds\n    for termination, the letter cited Perich\u2019s \u201cinsubordination and disrup-\n    tive behavior,\u201d as well as the damage she had done to her \u201cworking\n    relationship\u201d with the school by \u201cthreatening to take legal action.\u201d\n    The congregation voted to rescind Perich\u2019s call, and Hosanna-Tabor\n    sent her a letter of termination.\n       Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n    Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in\n    violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC brought\n    suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in\n    retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened\n    in the litigation. Invoking what is known as the \u201cministerial excep-\n    tion,\u201d Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the First\n    Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relation-\n    ship between a religious institution and one of its ministers. The\n    District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-\n    Tabor\u2019s favor. The Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded. It recog-\n    nized the existence of a ministerial exception rooted in the First\n    Amendment, but concluded that Perich did not qualify as a \u201cminister\u201d\n    under the exception.\nHeld:\n    1. The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First\n Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their\n churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimi-\n nation laws. Pp. 6\u201315.\n       (a) The First Amendment provides, in part, that \u201cCongress shall\n make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting\n the free exercise thereof.\u201d Familiar with life under the established\n Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the\n possibility of a national church. By forbidding the \u201cestablishment of\n religion\u201d and guaranteeing the \u201cfree exercise thereof,\u201d the Religion\n Clauses ensured that the new Federal Government\u2014unlike the Eng-\n lish Crown\u2014would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices. Pp. 6\u2013\n 10.\n       (b) This Court first considered the issue of government interfer-\n ence with a church\u2019s ability to select its own ministers in the context\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nof disputes over church property. This Court\u2019s decisions in that area\nconfirm that it is impermissible for the government to contradict a\nchurch\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers. See Watson v.\nJones, 13 Wall. 679; Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian\nOrthodox Church in North America, 344 U. S. 94; Serbian Eastern\nOrthodox Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, 426\nU. S. 696. Pp. 10\u201312.\n      (c) Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nand other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals\nhave uniformly recognized the existence of a \u201cministerial exception,\u201d\ngrounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of such\nlegislation to claims concerning the employment relationship be-\ntween a religious institution and its ministers. The Court agrees that\nthere is such a ministerial exception. Requiring a church to accept or\nretain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do\nso, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such ac-\ntion interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving\nthe church of control over the selection of those who will personify its\nbeliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the\nFree Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group\u2019s right to\nshape its own faith and mission through its appointments. According\nthe state the power to determine which individuals will minister to\nthe faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits\ngovernment involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n   The EEOC and Perich contend that religious organizations can de-\nfend against employment discrimination claims by invoking their\nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association. They thus see no\nneed\u2014and no basis\u2014for a special rule for ministers grounded in the\nReligion Clauses themselves. Their position, however, is hard to\nsquare with the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives spe-\ncial solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. The Court\ncannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have\nnothing to say about a religious organization\u2019s freedom to select its\nown ministers.\n   The EEOC and Perich also contend that Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, precludes recogni-\ntion of a ministerial exception. But Smith involved government regu-\nlation of only outward physical acts. The present case, in contrast,\nconcerns government interference with an internal church decision\nthat affects the faith and mission of the church itself. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   2. Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the minis-\nterial exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of this em-\nployment discrimination suit against her religious employer. Pp. 15\u2013\n21.\n4      HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                   AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n         (a) The ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a reli-\n    gious congregation. The Court, however, does not adopt a rigid for-\n    mula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister. Here, it\n    is enough to conclude that the exception covers Perich, given all the\n    circumstances of her employment. Hosanna-Tabor held her out as a\n    minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members. That\n    title represented a significant degree of religious training followed by\n    a formal process of commissioning. Perich also held herself out as a\n    minister by, for example, accepting the formal call to religious ser-\n    vice. And her job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church\u2019s\n    message and carrying out its mission: As a source of religious in-\n    struction, Perich played an important part in transmitting the Lu-\n    theran faith.\n       In concluding that Perich was not a minister under the exception,\n    the Sixth Circuit committed three errors. First, it failed to see any\n    relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister. Alt-\n    hough such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage,\n    the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a\n    minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious\n    training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description\n    of the employee\u2019s position. Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much\n    weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same\n    religious duties as Perich. Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive\n    that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church per-\n    form the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they did so only\n    because commissioned ministers were unavailable. Third, the Sixth\n    Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perich\u2019s performance of secular\n    duties. Although the amount of time an employee spends on particu-\n    lar activities is relevant in assessing that employee\u2019s status, that fac-\n    tor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the other con-\n    siderations discussed above. Pp. 15\u201319.\n         (b) Because Perich was a minister for purposes of the exception,\n    this suit must be dismissed. An order reinstating Perich as a called\n    teacher would have plainly violated the Church\u2019s freedom under the\n    Religion Clauses to select its own ministers. Though Perich no longer\n    seeks reinstatement, she continues to seek frontpay, backpay, com-\n    pensatory and punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. An award of\n    such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating\n    an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the First\n    Amendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief\n    would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to\n    have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling\n    that is barred by the ministerial exception.\n       Any suggestion that Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s asserted religious reason for\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  firing Perich was pretextual misses the point of the ministerial ex-\n  ception. The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church\u2019s\n  decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.\n  The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control\n  who will minister to the faithful is the church\u2019s alone. Pp. 19\u201320.\n       (c) Today the Court holds only that the ministerial exception bars\n  an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister,\n  challenging her church\u2019s decision to fire her. The Court expresses no\n  view on whether the exception bars other types of suits. Pp. 20\u201321.\n597 F. 3d 769, reversed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C. J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The\nquestion presented is whether the Establishment and Free\nExercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an\naction when the employer is a religious group and the\nemployee is one of the group\u2019s ministers.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n   Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church\nand School is a member congregation of the Lutheran\nChurch\u2013Missouri Synod, the second largest Lutheran\ndenomination in America. Hosanna-Tabor operated a\nsmall school in Redford, Michigan, offering a \u201cChrist-\ncentered education\u201d to students in kindergarten through\neighth grade. 582 F. Supp. 2d 881, 884 (ED Mich. 2008)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n2   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  The Synod classifies teachers into two categories:\n\u201ccalled\u201d and \u201clay.\u201d \u201cCalled\u201d teachers are regarded as\nhaving been called to their vocation by God through a\ncongregation. To be eligible to receive a call from a con-\ngregation, a teacher must satisfy certain academic\nrequirements. One way of doing so is by completing a\n\u201ccolloquy\u201d program at a Lutheran college or university. The\nprogram requires candidates to take eight courses of\ntheological study, obtain the endorsement of their local\nSynod district, and pass an oral examination by a faculty\ncommittee. A teacher who meets these requirements may\nbe called by a congregation. Once called, a teacher re-\nceives the formal title \u201cMinister of Religion, Commis-\nsioned.\u201d App. 42, 48. A commissioned minister serves for\nan open-ended term; at Hosanna-Tabor, a call could be\nrescinded only for cause and by a supermajority vote of the\ncongregation.\n  \u201cLay\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d teachers, by contrast, are not re-\nquired to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran.\nAt Hosanna-Tabor, they were appointed by the school\nboard, without a vote of the congregation, to one-year\nrenewable terms. Although teachers at the school general-\nly performed the same duties regardless of whether they\nwere lay or called, lay teachers were hired only when\ncalled teachers were unavailable.\n  Respondent Cheryl Perich was first employed by\nHosanna-Tabor as a lay teacher in 1999. After Perich com-\npleted her colloquy later that school year, Hosanna-Tabor\nasked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the\ncall and received a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d designating her a\ncommissioned minister. Id., at 42.\n  Perich taught kindergarten during her first four years\nat Hosanna-Tabor and fourth grade during the 2003\u20132004\nschool year. She taught math, language arts, social stud-\nies, science, gym, art, and music. She also taught a reli-\ngion class four days a week, led the students in prayer and\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Perich led the chapel service\nherself about twice a year.\n   Perich became ill in June 2004 with what was eventual-\nly diagnosed as narcolepsy. Symptoms included sudden\nand deep sleeps from which she could not be roused.\nBecause of her illness, Perich began the 2004\u20132005 school\nyear on disability leave. On January 27, 2005, however,\nPerich notified the school principal, Stacey Hoeft, that she\nwould be able to report to work the following month.\nHoeft responded that the school had already contracted\nwith a lay teacher to fill Perich\u2019s position for the remain-\nder of the school year. Hoeft also expressed concern that\nPerich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.\n   On January 30, Hosanna-Tabor held a meeting of its\ncongregation at which school administrators stated that\nPerich was unlikely to be physically capable of returning\nto work that school year or the next. The congregation\nvoted to offer Perich a \u201cpeaceful release\u201d from her call,\nwhereby the congregation would pay a portion of her\nhealth insurance premiums in exchange for her resigna-\ntion as a called teacher. Id., at 178, 186. Perich refused to\nresign and produced a note from her doctor stating that\nshe would be able to return to work on February 22. The\nschool board urged Perich to reconsider, informing her\nthat the school no longer had a position for her, but Perich\nstood by her decision not to resign.\n   On the morning of February 22\u2014the first day she was\nmedically cleared to return to work\u2014Perich presented\nherself at the school. Hoeft asked her to leave but she\nwould not do so until she obtained written documentation\nthat she had reported to work. Later that afternoon, Hoeft\ncalled Perich at home and told her that she would likely be\nfired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an\nattorney and intended to assert her legal rights.\n   Following a school board meeting that evening, board\n4    HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                 AND SCHOOL v.

Id., at 229.\nSalo subsequently followed up with a letter advising\nPerich that the congregation would consider whether to\nrescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds for ter-\nmination, the letter cited Perich\u2019s \u201cinsubordination and\ndisruptive behavior\u201d on February 22, as well as the dam-\nage she had done to her \u201cworking relationship\u201d with the\nschool by \u201cthreatening to take legal action.\u201d Id., at 55.\nThe congregation voted to rescind Perich\u2019s call on April 10,\nand Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination the\nnext day.\n                              B\n  Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Op-\nportunity Commission, alleging that her employment had\nbeen terminated in violation of the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act, 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712101 et seq.\n(1990). The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminat-\ning against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.\n\u00a712112(a). It also prohibits an employer from retaliating\n\u201cagainst any individual because such individual has op-\nposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or\nbecause such individual made a charge, testified, assisted,\nor participated in any manner in an investigation, pro-\nceeding, or hearing under [the ADA].\u201d \u00a712203(a).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The ADA itself provides religious entities with two defenses to\n\nclaims of discrimination that arise under subchapter I of the Act. The\nfirst provides that \u201c[t]his subchapter shall not prohibit a religious\ncorporation, association, educational institution, or society from giving\npreference in employment to individuals of a particular religion to\nperform work connected with the carrying on by such [entity] of its\nactivities.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The second provides that\n\u201c[u]nder this subchapter, a religious organization may require that all\napplicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such\norganization.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(2).

Perich intervened in the\nlitigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under both the\nADA and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights\nAct, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a737.1602(a) (1979). The EEOC\nand Perich sought Perich\u2019s reinstatement to her former\nposition (or frontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay,\ncompensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and\nother injunctive relief.\n   Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment. Invok-\ning what is known as the \u201cministerial exception,\u201d the\nChurch argued that the suit was barred by the First\nAmendment because the claims at issue concerned the\nemployment relationship between a religious institution\nand one of its ministers. According to the Church, Perich\nwas a minister, and she had been fired for a religious\nreason\u2014namely, that her threat to sue the Church vio-\nlated the Synod\u2019s belief that Christians should resolve their\ndisputes internally.\n   The District Court agreed that the suit was barred by\nthe ministerial exception and granted summary judgment\nin Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s favor. The court explained that\n\u201cHosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her\nout to the world as such long before this litigation began,\u201d\nand that the \u201cfacts surrounding Perich\u2019s employment in a\nreligious school with a sectarian mission\u201d supported the\nChurch\u2019s characterization. 582 F. Supp. 2d, at 891\u2013892.\nIn light of that determination, the court concluded that it\ncould \u201cinquire no further into her claims of retaliation.\u201d\nId., at 892.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00a712203(a), appears in a different subchapter\u2014subchapter IV. The \n\nEEOC and Perich contend, and Hosanna-Tabor does not dispute, that \n\nthese defenses therefore do not apply to retaliation claims. \n\n6   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nremanded, directing the District Court to proceed to the\nmerits of Perich\u2019s retaliation claims. The Court of Appeals\nrecognized the existence of a ministerial exception barring\ncertain employment discrimination claims against reli-\ngious institutions\u2014an exception \u201crooted in the First\nAmendment\u2019s guarantees of religious freedom.\u201d 597 F. 3d\n769, 777 (2010). The court concluded, however, that\nPerich did not qualify as a \u201cminister\u201d under the exception,\nnoting in particular that her duties as a called teacher\nwere identical to her duties as a lay teacher. Id., at 778\u2013\n781. Judge White concurred. She viewed the question\nwhether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer than\ndid the majority, but agreed that the \u201cfact that the duties\nof the contract teachers are the same as the duties of the\ncalled teachers is telling.\u201d Id., at 782, 784.\n  We granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   The First Amendment provides, in part, that \u201cCongress\nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d We have said\nthat these two Clauses \u201coften exert conflicting pressures,\u201d\nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 719 (2005), and that\nthere can be \u201cinternal tension . . . between the Establish-\nment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,\u201d Tilton v.\nRichardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (plurality opinion).\nNot so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government\nfrom interfering with the decision of a religious group to\nfire one of its ministers.\n                             A\n  Controversy between church and state over religious\noffices is hardly new. In 1215, the issue was addressed in\nthe very first clause of Magna Carta. There, King John\nagreed that \u201cthe English church shall be free, and shall\nhave its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe King in particular accepted the \u201cfreedom of elections,\u201d\na right \u201cthought to be of the greatest necessity and im-\nportance to the English church.\u201d J. Holt, Magna Carta\nApp. IV, p. 317, cl. 1 (1965).\n   That freedom in many cases may have been more the-\noretical than real. See, e.g., W. Warren, Henry II 312\n(1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the electors\nof a bishopric in Winchester, stating: \u201cI order you to hold a\nfree election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard\nmy clerk\u201d). In any event, it did not survive the reign of\nHenry VIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534,\n26 Hen. 8, ch. 1, made the English monarch the supreme\nhead of the Church, and the Act in Restraint of Annates,\n25 Hen. 8, ch. 20, passed that same year, gave him the\nauthority to appoint the Church\u2019s high officials. See G.\nElton, The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commen-\ntary 331\u2013332 (1960). Various Acts of Uniformity, enacted\nsubsequently, tightened further the government\u2019s grip on\nthe exercise of religion. See, e.g., Act of Uniformity, 1559,\n1 Eliz., ch. 2; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2 & 3 Edw. 6, ch. 1.\nThe Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service\nas a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed\ntenets and pledged to follow the mode of worship set forth\nin the Book of Common Prayer. Any minister who refused\nto make that pledge was \u201cdeprived of all his Spiritual\nPromotions.\u201d Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car. 2, ch. 4.\n   Seeking to escape the control of the national church, the\nPuritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect\ntheir own ministers and establish their own modes of\nworship. See T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and\nState in America to the Passage of the First Amendment 3\n(1986); McConnell, The Origins and Historical Under-\nstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev.\n1409, 1422 (1990). William Penn, the Quaker proprietor\nof what would eventually become Pennsylvania and Dela-\nware, also sought independence from the Church of Eng-\n8   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nland. The charter creating the province of Pennsylvania\ncontained no clause establishing a religion. See S. Cobb,\nThe Rise of Religious Liberty in America 440\u2013441 (1970).\n   Colonists in the South, in contrast, brought the Church\nof England with them. But even they sometimes chafed at\nthe control exercised by the Crown and its representatives\nover religious offices. In Virginia, for example, the law\nvested the governor with the power to induct ministers\npresented to him by parish vestries, 2 Hening\u2019s Statutes\nat Large 46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make\nsuch presentations and instead chose ministers on their\nown. See H. Eckenrode, Separation of Church and State\nin Virginia 13\u201319 (1910). Controversies over the selection\nof ministers also arose in other Colonies with Anglican\nestablishments, including North Carolina. See C. An-\ntieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom from Federal\nEstablishment: Formation and Early History of the First\nAmendment Religion Clauses 10\u201311 (1964). There, the\nroyal governor insisted that the right of presentation lay\nwith the Bishop of London, but the colonial assembly\nenacted laws placing that right in the vestries. Authori-\nties in England intervened, repealing those laws as incon-\nsistent with the rights of the Crown. See id., at 11;\nWeeks, Church and State in North Carolina, Johns Hop-\nkins U. Studies in Hist. & Pol. Sci., 11th Ser., Nos. 5\u20136,\npp. 29\u201336 (1893).\n   It was against this background that the First Amend-\nment was adopted. Familiar with life under the estab-\nlished Church of England, the founding generation sought\nto foreclose the possibility of a national church. See 1\nAnnals of Cong. 730\u2013731 (1789) (noting that the Estab-\nlishment Clause addressed the fear that \u201cone sect might\nobtain a pre-eminence, or two combine together, and\nestablish a religion to which they would compel others to\nconform\u201d (remarks of J.

The\nEstablishment Clause prevents the Government from\nappointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause pre-\nvents it from interfering with the freedom of religious\ngroups to select their own.\n   This understanding of the Religion Clauses was reflect-\ned in two events involving James Madison, \u201c \u2018the leading\narchitect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201d\nArizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83, 103 (1968)). The first occurred in\n1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the\nUnited States, solicited the Executive\u2019s opinion on who\nshould be appointed to direct the affairs of the Catholic\nChurch in the territory newly acquired by the Louisiana\nPurchase. After consulting with President Jefferson, then-\nSecretary of State Madison responded that the selection\nof church \u201cfunctionaries\u201d was an \u201centirely ecclesiastical\u201d\nmatter left to the Church\u2019s own judgment. Letter from\nJames Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20, 1806), reprint-\ned in 20 Records of the American Catholic Historical Soci-\nety 63 (1909). The \u201cscrupulous policy of the Constitution\nin guarding against a political interference with religious\naffairs,\u201d Madison explained, prevented the Government\nfrom rendering an opinion on the \u201cselection of ecclesiasti-\ncal individuals.\u201d Id., at 63\u201364.\n   The second episode occurred in 1811, when Madison was\nPresident. Congress had passed a bill incorporating the\nProtestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria in\nwhat was then the District of Columbia. Madison vetoed\nthe bill, on the ground that it \u201cexceeds the rightful author-\nity to which Governments are limited, by the essential\ndistinction between civil and religious functions, and\nviolates, in particular, the article of the Constitution of the\n10   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States, which declares, that \u2018Congress shall make\nno law respecting a religious establishment.\u2019 \u201d 22 Annals\nof Cong. 982\u2013983 (1811). Madison explained:\n     \u201cThe bill enacts into, and establishes by law, sundry\n     rules and proceedings relative purely to the organi-\n     zation and polity of the church incorporated, and\n     comprehending even the election and removal of the\n     Minister of the same; so that no change could be made\n     therein by the particular society, or by the general\n     church of which it is a member, and whose authority\n     it recognises.\u201d Id., at 983 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  Given this understanding of the Religion Clauses\u2014and\nthe absence of government employment regulation gener-\nally\u2014it was some time before questions about government\ninterference with a church\u2019s ability to select its own minis-\nters came before the courts. This Court touched upon the\nissue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over\nchurch property. Our decisions in that area confirm that\nit is impermissible for the government to contradict a\nchurch\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers.\n  In Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679 (1872), the Court con-\nsidered a dispute between antislavery and proslavery\nfactions over who controlled the property of the Walnut\nStreet Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. The\nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had recog-\nnized the antislavery faction, and this Court\u2014applying\nnot the Constitution but a \u201cbroad and sound view of the\nrelations of church and state under our system of laws\u201d\u2014\ndeclined to question that determination. Id., at 727. We\nexplained that \u201cwhenever the questions of discipline, or of\nfaith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been\ndecided by the highest of [the] church judicatories to which\nthe matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must\naccept such decisions as final, and as binding on them.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. As we would put it later, our opinion in Watson\n\u201cradiates . . . a spirit of freedom for religious organiza-\ntions, an independence from secular control or manipula-\ntion\u2014in short, power to decide for themselves, free from\nstate interference, matters of church government as well\nas those of faith and doctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas\nCathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America,\n344 U. S. 94, 116 (1952).\n   Confronting the issue under the Constitution for the\nfirst time in Kedroff, the Court recognized that the\n\u201c[f]reedom to select the clergy, where no improper methods\nof choice are proven,\u201d is \u201cpart of the free exercise of reli-\ngion\u201d protected by the First Amendment against govern-\nment interference. Ibid. At issue in Kedroff was the right\nto use a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City.\nThe Russian Orthodox churches in North America had\nsplit from the Supreme Church Authority in Moscow, out\nof concern that the Authority had become a tool of the\nSoviet Government.        The North American churches\nclaimed that the right to use the cathedral belonged to an\narchbishop elected by them; the Supreme Church Authori-\nty claimed that it belonged instead to an archbishop ap-\npointed by the patriarch in Moscow. New York\u2019s highest\ncourt ruled in favor of the North American churches,\nbased on a state law requiring every Russian Orthodox\nchurch in New York to recognize the determination of the\ngoverning body of the North American churches as author-\nitative. Id., at 96\u201397, 99, n. 3, 107, n. 10.\n   This Court reversed, concluding that the New York law\nviolated the First Amendment. Id., at 107. We explained\nthat the controversy over the right to use the cathedral\nwas \u201cstrictly a matter of ecclesiastical government, the\npower of the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian\nOrthodox Church to appoint the ruling hierarch of the\narchdiocese of North America.\u201d Id., at 115. By \u201cpass[ing]\nthe control of matters strictly ecclesiastical from one\n12   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nchurch authority to another,\u201d the New York law intruded\nthe \u201cpower of the state into the forbidden area of reli-\ngious freedom contrary to the principles of the First Amend-\nment.\u201d Id., at 119. Accordingly, we declared the law\nunconstitutional because it \u201cdirectly prohibit[ed] the free\nexercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church\u2019s choice of its\nhierarchy.\u201d Ibid.\n  This Court reaffirmed these First Amendment princi-\nples in Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States\nand Canada v. Milivojevich, 426 U. S. 696 (1976), a case\ninvolving a dispute over control of the American-Canadian\nDiocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, including its\nproperty and assets. The Church had removed Dionisije\nMilivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese\nbecause of his defiance of the church hierarchy. Following\nhis removal, Dionisije brought a civil action in state court\nchallenging the Church\u2019s decision, and the Illinois Su-\npreme Court \u201cpurported in effect to reinstate Dionisije as\nDiocesan Bishop,\u201d on the ground that the proceedings\nresulting in his removal failed to comply with church laws\nand regulations. Id., at 708.\n  Reversing that judgment, this Court explained that the\nFirst Amendment \u201cpermit[s] hierarchical religious organi-\nzations to establish their own rules and regulations for\ninternal discipline and government, and to create tribu-\nnals for adjudicating disputes over these matters.\u201d Id., at\n724. When ecclesiastical tribunals decide such disputes,\nwe further explained, \u201cthe Constitution requires that civil\ncourts accept their decisions as binding upon them.\u201d Id.,\nat 725. We thus held that by inquiring into whether the\nChurch had followed its own procedures, the State Su-\npreme Court had \u201cunconstitutionally undertaken the\nresolution of quintessentially religious controversies\nwhose resolution the First Amendment commits exclusive-\nly to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals\u201d of the Church.\nId., at 720.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The Courts of Appeals, in contrast, have had\nextensive experience with this issue. Since the passage of\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\net seq., and other employment discrimination laws, the\nCourts of Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence\nof a \u201cministerial exception,\u201d grounded in the First Amend-\nment, that precludes application of such legislation to\nclaims concerning the employment relationship between a\nreligious institution and its ministers.2\n   We agree that there is such a ministerial exception. The\nmembers of a religious group put their faith in the hands\nof their ministers. Requiring a church to accept or retain\nan unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to\ndo so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment deci-\nsion. Such action interferes with the internal governance\nof the church, depriving the church of control over the\nselection of those who will personify its beliefs. By impos-\ning an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free\nExercise Clause, which protects a religious group\u2019s right to\nshape its own faith and mission through its appointments.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See Natal v.

EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nAccording the state the power to determine which individ-\nuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Estab-\nlishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement\nin such ecclesiastical decisions.\n   The EEOC and Perich acknowledge that employment\ndiscrimination laws would be unconstitutional as applied\nto religious groups in certain circumstances. They grant,\nfor example, that it would violate the First Amendment for\ncourts to apply such laws to compel the ordination of\nwomen by the Catholic Church or by an Orthodox Jewish\nseminary. Brief for Federal Respondent 31; Brief for\nRespondent Perich 35\u201336. According to the EEOC and\nPerich, religious organizations could successfully defend\nagainst employment discrimination claims in those circum-\nstances by invoking the constitutional right to freedom\nof association\u2014a right \u201cimplicit\u201d in the First Amendment.\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622\n(1984). The EEOC and Perich thus see no need\u2014and no\nbasis\u2014for a special rule for ministers grounded in the\nReligion Clauses themselves.\n   We find this position untenable. The right to freedom of\nassociation is a right enjoyed by religious and secular\ngroups alike. It follows under the EEOC\u2019s and Perich\u2019s\nview that the First Amendment analysis should be the\nsame, whether the association in question is the Lutheran\nChurch, a labor union, or a social club. See Perich Brief\n31; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. That result is hard to square with\nthe text of the First Amendment itself, which gives spe-\ncial solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. We\ncannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion\nClauses have nothing to say about a religious organiza-\ntion\u2019s freedom to select its own ministers.\n   The EEOC and Perich also contend that our decision in\nEmployment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.\nSmith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), precludes recognition of a\nministerial exception. In Smith, two members of the\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

We held that this did not violate the Free Exercise\nClause, even though the peyote had been ingested for\nsacramental purposes, because the \u201cright of free exercise\ndoes not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply\nwith a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the\nground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that\nhis religion prescribes (or proscribes).\u201d Id., at 879 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n  It is true that the ADA\u2019s prohibition on retaliation, like\nOregon\u2019s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral\nlaw of general applicability. But a church\u2019s selection of its\nministers is unlike an individual\u2019s ingestion of peyote.\nSmith involved government regulation of only outward\nphysical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns\ngovernment interference with an internal church decision\nthat affects the faith and mission of the church itself. See\nid., at 877 (distinguishing the government\u2019s regulation of\n\u201cphysical acts\u201d from its \u201clend[ing] its power to one or\nthe other side in controversies over religious authority or\ndogma\u201d). The contention that Smith forecloses recognition\nof a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses\nhas no merit.\n                             III\n  Having concluded that there is a ministerial exception\ngrounded in the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment,\nwe consider whether the exception applies in this case.\nWe hold that it does.\n  Every Court of Appeals to have considered the question\nhas concluded that the ministerial exception is not limited\nto the head of a religious congregation, and we agree. We\nare reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula for decid-\ning when an employee qualifies as a minister. It is enough\n16   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfor us to conclude, in this our first case involving the\nministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich,\ngiven all the circumstances of her employment.\n   To begin with, Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a\nminister, with a role distinct from that of most of its mem-\nbers. When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it issued\nher a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d according her the title \u201cMinis-\nter of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d App. 42. She was tasked\nwith performing that office \u201caccording to the Word of God\nand the confessional standards of the Evangelical Luther-\nan Church as drawn from the Sacred Scriptures.\u201d Ibid.\nThe congregation prayed that God \u201cbless [her] ministra-\ntions to the glory of His holy name, [and] the building of\nHis church.\u201d Id., at 43. In a supplement to the diploma,\nthe congregation undertook to periodically review Perich\u2019s\n\u201cskills of ministry\u201d and \u201cministerial responsibilities,\u201d and\nto provide for her \u201ccontinuing education as a professional\nperson in the ministry of the Gospel.\u201d Id., at 49.\n   Perich\u2019s title as a minister reflected a significant degree\nof religious training followed by a formal process of com-\nmissioning. To be eligible to become a commissioned\nminister, Perich had to complete eight college-level cours-\nes in subjects including biblical interpretation, church\ndoctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran teacher. She\nalso had to obtain the endorsement of her local Synod\ndistrict by submitting a petition that contained her aca-\ndemic transcripts, letters of recommendation, personal\nstatement, and written answers to various ministry-\nrelated questions. Finally, she had to pass an oral exami-\nnation by a faculty committee at a Lutheran college. It\ntook Perich six years to fulfill these requirements. And\nwhen she eventually did, she was commissioned as a\nminister only upon election by the congregation, which\nrecognized God\u2019s call to her to teach. At that point, her\ncall could be rescinded only upon a supermajority vote of\nthe congregation\u2014a protection designed to allow her to\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

She did so in other ways as well. For example,\nshe claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that\nwas available only to employees earning their compensa-\ntion \u201c \u2018in the exercise of the ministry.\u2019 \u201d App. 220 (\u201cIf you\nare not conducting activities \u2018in the exercise of the minis-\ntry,\u2019 you cannot take advantage of the parsonage or\nhousing allowance exclusion\u201d (quoting Lutheran Church-\nMissouri Synod Brochure on Whether the IRS Considers\nEmployees as a Minister (2007)). In a form she submitted\nto the Synod following her termination, Perich again\nindicated that she regarded herself as a minister at\nHosanna-Tabor, stating: \u201cI feel that God is leading me to\nserve in the teaching ministry . . . . I am anxious to be in\nthe teaching ministry again soon.\u201d App. 53.\n   Perich\u2019s job duties reflected a role in conveying the\nChurch\u2019s message and carrying out its mission. Hosanna-\nTabor expressly charged her with \u201clead[ing] others toward\nChristian maturity\u201d and \u201cteach[ing] faithfully the Word of\nGod, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as\nset forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical\nLutheran Church.\u201d Id., at 48. In fulfilling these responsi-\nbilities, Perich taught her students religion four days a\nweek, and led them in prayer three times a day. Once a\nweek, she took her students to a school-wide chapel ser-\nvice, and\u2014about twice a year\u2014she took her turn leading\nit, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and deliver-\ning a short message based on verses from the Bible. Dur-\ning her last year of teaching, Perich also led her fourth\ngraders in a brief devotional exercise each morning. As a\nsource of religious instruction, Perich performed an im-\nportant role in transmitting the Lutheran faith to the next\ngeneration.\n18   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   In light of these considerations\u2014the formal title given\nPerich by the Church, the substance reflected in that title,\nher own use of that title, and the important religious\nfunctions she performed for the Church\u2014we conclude\nthat Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial\nexception.\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals\ncommitted three errors. First, the Sixth Circuit failed to\nsee any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commis-\nsioned minister. Although such a title, by itself, does not\nautomatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee\nhas been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely\nrelevant, as is the fact that significant religious training\nand a recognized religious mission underlie the description\nof the employee\u2019s position. It was wrong for the Court of\nAppeals\u2014and Perich, who has adopted the court\u2019s view,\nsee Perich Brief 45\u2014to say that an employee\u2019s title does\nnot matter.\n   Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the\nfact that lay teachers at the school performed the same\nreligious duties as Perich. We express no view on whether\nsomeone with Perich\u2019s duties would be covered by the\nministerial exception in the absence of the other consider-\nations we have discussed. But though relevant, it cannot\nbe dispositive that others not formally recognized as min-\nisters by the church perform the same functions\u2014\nparticularly when, as here, they did so only because\ncommissioned ministers were unavailable.\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on\nPerich\u2019s performance of secular duties. It is true that her\nreligious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each work-\nday, and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching\nsecular subjects. The EEOC regards that as conclusive,\ncontending that any ministerial exception \u201cshould be\nlimited to those employees who perform exclusively reli-\ngious functions.\u201d Brief for Federal Respondent 51. We\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncannot accept that view. Indeed, we are unsure whether\nany such employees exist. The heads of congregations\nthemselves often have a mix of duties, including secular\nones such as helping to manage the congregation\u2019s financ-\nes, supervising purely secular personnel, and overseeing\nthe upkeep of facilities.\n   Although the Sixth Circuit did not adopt the extreme\nposition pressed here by the EEOC, it did regard the\nrelative amount of time Perich spent performing religious\nfunctions as largely determinative. The issue before us,\nhowever, is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch.\nThe amount of time an employee spends on particular\nactivities is relevant in assessing that employee\u2019s status,\nbut that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without\nregard to the nature of the religious functions performed\nand the other considerations discussed above.\n   Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of\nthe exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of\nthis employment discrimination suit against her religious\nemployer. The EEOC and Perich originally sought an\norder reinstating Perich to her former position as a called\nteacher. By requiring the Church to accept a minister it\ndid not want, such an order would have plainly violated\nthe Church\u2019s freedom under the Religion Clauses to select\nits own ministers.\n   Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, having abandoned\nthat relief before this Court. See Perich Brief 58. But that\nis immaterial. Perich continues to seek frontpay in lieu of\nreinstatement, backpay, compensatory and punitive dam-\nages, and attorney\u2019s fees. An award of such relief would\noperate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an\nunwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the\nFirst Amendment than an order overturning the termina-\ntion. Such relief would depend on a determination that\nHosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her\nposition, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by\n20   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ministerial exception.3\n   The EEOC and Perich suggest that Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s\nasserted religious reason for firing Perich\u2014that she vio-\nlated the Synod\u2019s commitment to internal dispute resolu-\ntion\u2014was pretextual. That suggestion misses the point of\nthe ministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is\nnot to safeguard a church\u2019s decision to fire a minister only\nwhen it is made for a religious reason. The exception\ninstead ensures that the authority to select and control\nwho will minister to the faithful\u2014a matter \u201cstrictly eccle-\nsiastical,\u201d Kedroff, 344 U. S., at 119\u2014is the church\u2019s\nalone.4\n                             IV\n  The EEOC and Perich foresee a parade of horribles that\nwill follow our recognition of a ministerial exception to\nemployment discrimination suits. According to the EEOC\nand Perich, such an exception could protect religious\norganizations from liability for retaliating against employ-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Perich does not dispute that if the ministerial exception bars her\n\nretaliation claim under the ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim\nunder Michigan law.\n   4 A conflict has arisen in the Courts of Appeals over whether the min-\n\nisterial exception is a jurisdictional bar or a defense on the merits.\nCompare Hollins, 474 F. 3d, at 225 (treating the exception as jurisdic-\ntional); and Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F. 3d 1036, 1038\u2013\n1039 (CA7 2006) (same), with Petruska, 462 F. 3d, at 302 (treating the\nexception as an affirmative defense); Bryce, 289 F. 3d, at 654 (same);\nBollard v. California Province of Soc. of Jesus, 196 F. 3d 940, 951 (CA9\n1999) (same); and Natal, 878 F. 2d, at 1576 (same). We conclude that\nthe exception operates as an affirmative defense to an otherwise\ncognizable claim, not a jurisdictional bar. That is because the issue\npresented by the exception is \u201cwhether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief,\u201d not whether the court has \u201cpower to hear\n[the] case.\u201d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 4\u20135) (internal quotation marks omitted).

What is more,\nthe EEOC contends, the logic of the exception would con-\nfer on religious employers \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d to vio-\nlate employment laws by, for example, hiring children or\naliens not authorized to work in the United States. Brief\nfor Federal Respondent 29.\n   Hosanna-Tabor responds that the ministerial exception\nwould not in any way bar criminal prosecutions for in-\nterfering with law enforcement investigations or other\nproceedings. Nor, according to the Church, would the\nexception bar government enforcement of general laws\nrestricting eligibility for employment, because the excep-\ntion applies only to suits by or on behalf of ministers\nthemselves. Hosanna-Tabor also notes that the ministe-\nrial exception has been around in the lower courts for 40\nyears, see McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553, 558\n(CA5 1972), and has not given rise to the dire consequenc-\nes predicted by the EEOC and Perich.\n   The case before us is an employment discrimination suit\nbrought on behalf of a minister, challenging her church\u2019s\ndecision to fire her. Today we hold only that the ministe-\nrial exception bars such a suit. We express no view on\nwhether the exception bars other types of suits, including\nactions by employees alleging breach of contract or tor-\ntious conduct by their religious employers. There will be\ntime enough to address the applicability of the exception\nto other circumstances if and when they arise.\n                       *     *     *\n  The interest of society in the enforcement of employ-\nment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important.\nBut so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing\nwho will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry\nout their mission.

I write separately to note\nthat, in my view, the Religion Clauses require civil courts\nto apply the ministerial exception and to defer to a reli-\ngious organization\u2019s good-faith understanding of who\nqualifies as its minister. As the Court explains, the Reli-\ngion Clauses guarantee religious organizations autonomy\nin matters of internal governance, including the selection\nof those who will minister the faith. A religious organi-\nzation\u2019s right to choose its ministers would be hollow,\nhowever, if secular courts could second-guess the organiza-\ntion\u2019s sincere determination that a given employee is a\n\u201cminister\u201d under the organization\u2019s theological tenets.\nOur country\u2019s religious landscape includes organizations\nwith different leadership structures and doctrines that\ninfluence their conceptions of ministerial status. The\nquestion whether an employee is a minister is itself reli-\ngious in nature, and the answer will vary widely. Judicial\nattempts to fashion a civil definition of \u201cminister\u201d through\na bright-line test or multi-factor analysis risk disad-\nvantaging those religious groups whose beliefs, practices,\nand membership are outside of the \u201cmainstream\u201d or\nunpalatable to some. Moreover, uncertainty about wheth-\n2   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                AND SCHOOL v.

See Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 336 (1987) (\u201c[I]t is a signifi-\ncant burden on a religious organization to require it, on\npain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activi-\nties a secular court will consider religious. The line is\nhardly a bright one, and an organization might under-\nstandably be concerned that a judge would not understand\nits religious tenets and sense of mission. Fear of potential\nliability might affect the way an organization carried out\nwhat it understood to be its religious mission\u201d (footnote\nomitted)). These are certainly dangers that the First\nAmendment was designed to guard against.\n   The Court thoroughly sets forth the facts that lead to its\nconclusion that Cheryl Perich was one of Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s\nministers, and I agree that these facts amply demonstrate\nPerich\u2019s ministerial role. But the evidence demonstrates\nthat Hosanna-Tabor sincerely considered Perich a minis-\nter. That would be sufficient for me to conclude that Per-\nich\u2019s suit is properly barred by the ministerial exception.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The term \u201cminister\u201d\nis commonly used by many Protestant denominations to\nrefer to members of their clergy, but the term is rarely if\never used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hin-\ndus, or Buddhists.2 In addition, the concept of ordination\nas understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 It is unconventional to refer to many persons who clearly fall with-\n\nin the \u201cministerial\u201d exception, such as Protestant ministers, Catholic\npriests, and Jewish rabbis, as \u201cemployees,\u201d but I use the term in the\nsense in which it is used in the antidiscrimination laws that are often\nimplicated in cases involving the exception. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e(f) (Title VII); \u00a712111(4) (ADA); 29 U. S. C. \u00a7630(f) (ADEA);\n\u00a7206(e) (Equal Pay Act and Fair Labor Standards Act).\n  2 See 9 Oxford English Dictionary 818 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 4(b)) (noting\n\nthe term \u201cminister\u201d used in various phrases \u201capplied as general desig-\nnations for a person officially charged with spiritual functions in the\nChristian Church\u201d); 9 Encyclopedia of Religion 6044\u20136045 (2d ed.\n2005).

EEOC \n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nhas no clear counterpart in some Christian denominations\nand some other religions. Because virtually every religion\nin the world is represented in the population of the United\nStates, it would be a mistake if the term \u201cminister\u201d or the\nconcept of ordination were viewed as central to the im-\nportant issue of religious autonomy that is presented in\ncases like this one. Instead, courts should focus on the\nfunction performed by persons who work for religious\nbodies.\n  The First Amendment protects the freedom of religious\ngroups to engage in certain key religious activities, includ-\ning the conducting of worship services and other religious\nceremonies and rituals, as well as the critical process of\ncommunicating the faith. Accordingly, religious groups\nmust be free to choose the personnel who are essential to\nthe performance of these functions.\n  The \u201cministerial\u201d exception should be tailored to this\npurpose. It should apply to any \u201cemployee\u201d who leads\na religious organization, conducts worship services or im-\nportant religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a\nmessenger or teacher of its faith. If a religious group\nbelieves that the ability of such an employee to perform\nthese key functions has been compromised, then the con-\nstitutional guarantee of religious freedom protects the\ngroup\u2019s right to remove the employee from his or her\nposition.\n                               I\n   Throughout our Nation\u2019s history, religious bodies have\nbeen the preeminent example of private associations that\nhave \u201cact[ed] as critical buffers between the individual and\nthe power of the State.\u201d Roberts v. United States Jaycees,\n468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984). In a case like the one now\nbefore us\u2014where the goal of the civil law in question, the\nelimination of discrimination against persons with disabil-\nities, is so worthy\u2014it is easy to forget that the autonomy\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

To safeguard this crucial autonomy, we have\nlong recognized that the Religion Clauses protect a private\nsphere within which religious bodies are free to govern\nthemselves in accordance with their own beliefs. The\nConstitution guarantees religious bodies \u201cindependence\nfrom secular control or manipulation\u2014in short, power to\ndecide for themselves, free from state interference, mat-\nters of church government as well as those of faith and\ndoctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian\nOrthodox Church in North America, 344 U. S. 94, 116\n(1952).\n   Religious autonomy means that religious authorities\nmust be free to determine who is qualified to serve in\npositions of substantial religious importance. Different\nreligions will have different views on exactly what quali-\nfies as an important religious position, but it is nonethe-\nless possible to identify a general category of \u201cemployees\u201d\nwhose functions are essential to the independence of prac-\ntically all religious groups. These include those who serve\nin positions of leadership, those who perform important\nfunctions in worship services and in the performance of\nreligious ceremonies and rituals, and those who are en-\ntrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the faith\nto the next generation.\n   Applying the protection of the First Amendment to roles\nof religious leadership, worship, ritual, and expression\nfocuses on the objective functions that are important for\nthe autonomy of any religious group, regardless of its\nbeliefs. As we have recognized in a similar context,\n\u201c[f]orcing a group to accept certain members may impair\n[its ability] to express those views, and only those views,\nthat it intends to express.\u201d Boy Scouts of America v.

S.\n872, 882 (1990) (noting that the constitutional interest in\nfreedom of association may be \u201creinforced by Free Exercise\nClause concerns\u201d). As the Court notes, the First Amend-\nment \u201cgives special solicitude to the rights of religious\norganizations,\u201d ante, at 14, but our expressive-association\ncases are nevertheless useful in pointing out what those\nessential rights are. Religious groups are the archetype\nof associations formed for expressive purposes, and their\nfundamental rights surely include the freedom to choose\nwho is qualified to serve as a voice for their faith.\n   When it comes to the expression and inculcation of\nreligious doctrine, there can be no doubt that the messen-\nger matters. Religious teachings cover the gamut from\nmoral conduct to metaphysical truth, and both the content\nand credibility of a religion\u2019s message depend vitally on\nthe character and conduct of its teachers. A religion can-\nnot depend on someone to be an effective advocate for its\nreligious vision if that person\u2019s conduct fails to live up to\nthe religious precepts that he or she espouses. For this\nreason, a religious body\u2019s right to self-governance must\ninclude the ability to select, and to be selective about,\nthose who will serve as the very \u201cembodiment of its mes-\nsage\u201d and \u201cits voice to the faithful.\u201d Petruska v. Gannon\nUniv., 462 F. 3d 294, 306 (CA3 2006).

But while a ministe-\nrial title is undoubtedly relevant in applying the First\nAmendment rule at issue, such a title is neither necessary\nnor sufficient. As previously noted, most faiths do not\nemploy the term \u201cminister,\u201d and some eschew the concept\nof formal ordination.3 And at the opposite end of the spec-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In Islam, for example, \u201cevery Muslim can perform the religious rites,\n\nso there is no class or profession of ordained clergy.

See Rayburn v.\nGeneral Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 772 F. 2d\n1164, 1168 (1985) (noting that the exception\u2019s applicability\n\u201cdoes not depend upon ordination but upon the function of\nthe position\u201d). The Fourth Circuit traced the exception\nback to McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553 (CA5\n1972), which invoked the Religion Clauses to bar a Title\nVII sex-discrimination suit brought by a woman who was\ndescribed by the court as a Salvation Army \u201cminister,\u201d id.,\nat 554, although her actual title was \u201cofficer.\u201d See\nMcClure v. Salvation Army, 323 F. Supp. 1100, 1101 (ND\nGa. 1971). A decade after McClure, the Fifth Circuit made\nclear that formal ordination was not necessary for the\n\u201cministerial\u201d exception to apply. The court held that the\nmembers of the faculty at a Baptist seminary were covered\nby the exception because of their religious function in\nconveying church doctrine, even though some of them\nwere not ordained ministers. See EEOC v. Southwestern\nBaptist Theological Seminary, 651 F. 2d 277 (1981).\n   The functional consensus has held up over time, with\nthe D. C. Circuit recognizing that \u201c[t]he ministerial excep-\ntion has not been limited to members of the clergy.\u201d\nEEOC v. Catholic Univ., 83 F. 3d 455, 461 (1996).

The\nCourt\u2019s opinion today should not be read to upset this\nconsensus.\n                             B\n  The ministerial exception applies to respondent because,\nas the Court notes, she played a substantial role in \u201ccon-\nveying the Church\u2019s message and carrying out its mis-\nsion.\u201d Ante, at 17. She taught religion to her students\nfour days a week and took them to chapel on the fifth day.\nShe led them in daily devotional exercises, and led them in\nprayer three times a day. She also alternated with the\nother teachers in planning and leading worship services at\n8    HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nthe school chapel, choosing liturgies, hymns, and read-\nings, and composing and delivering a message based on\nScripture.\n   It makes no difference that respondent also taught\nsecular subjects. While a purely secular teacher would not\nqualify for the \u201cministerial\u201d exception, the constitutional\nprotection of religious teachers is not somehow diminished\nwhen they take on secular functions in addition to their\nreligious ones. What matters is that respondent played an\nimportant role as an instrument of her church\u2019s religious\nmessage and as a leader of its worship activities. Because\nof these important religious functions, Hosanna-Tabor had\nthe right to decide for itself whether respondent was reli-\ngiously qualified to remain in her office.\n   Hosanna-Tabor discharged respondent because she\nthreatened to file suit against the church in a civil court.\nThis threat contravened the Lutheran doctrine that dis-\nputes among Christians should be resolved internally\nwithout resort to the civil court system and all the legal\nwrangling it entails.5 In Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s view, respond-\nent\u2019s disregard for this doctrine compromised her religious\nfunction, disqualifying her from serving effectively as a\nvoice for the church\u2019s faith. Respondent does not dispute\nthat the Lutheran Church subscribes to a doctrine of\ninternal dispute resolution, but she argues that this was a\nmere pretext for her firing, which was really done for\nnonreligious reasons.\n   For civil courts to engage in the pretext inquiry that\nrespondent and the Solicitor General urge us to sanction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 See The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, Commission on Theol-\n\nogy and Church Relations, 1 Corinthians 6:1\u201311: An Exegetical Study,\np. 10 (Apr. 1991) (stating that instead of suing each other, Christians\nshould seek \u201can amicable settlement of differences by means of a\ndecision by fellow Christians\u201d).

In order to probe the real reason for respondent\u2019s\nfiring, a civil court\u2014and perhaps a jury\u2014would be re-\nquired to make a judgment about church doctrine. The\ncredibility of Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s asserted reason for termi-\nnating respondent\u2019s employment could not be assessed\nwithout taking into account both the importance that the\nLutheran Church attaches to the doctrine of internal\ndispute resolution and the degree to which that tenet\ncompromised respondent\u2019s religious function. If it could be\nshown that this belief is an obscure and minor part of\nLutheran doctrine, it would be much more plausible for\nrespondent to argue that this doctrine was not the real\nreason for her firing. If, on the other hand, the doctrine is\na central and universally known tenet of Lutheranism,\nthen the church\u2019s asserted reason for her discharge would\nseem much more likely to be nonpretextual. But whatever\nthe truth of the matter might be, the mere adjudication of\nsuch questions would pose grave problems for religious\nautonomy: It would require calling witnesses to testify\nabout the importance and priority of the religious doctrine\nin question, with a civil factfinder sitting in ultimate\njudgment of what the accused church really believes,\nand how important that belief is to the church\u2019s overall\nmission.\n   At oral argument, both respondent and the United\nStates acknowledged that a pretext inquiry would some-\ntimes be prohibited by principles of religious autonomy,\nand both conceded that a Roman Catholic priest who is\ndismissed for getting married could not sue the church\nand claim that his dismissal was actually based on a\nground forbidden by the federal antidiscrimination laws.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339, 50. But there is no principled\nbasis for proscribing a pretext inquiry in such a case while\npermitting it in a case like the one now before us. The\n10   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\nRoman Catholic Church\u2019s insistence on clerical celibacy\nmay be much better known than the Lutheran Church\u2019s\ndoctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular famili-\narity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative\nfactor.\n   What matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor\nbelieves that the religious function that respondent per-\nformed made it essential that she abide by the doctrine of\ninternal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no\nposition to second-guess that assessment. This conclusion\nrests not on respondent\u2019s ordination status or her formal\ntitle, but rather on her functional status as the type of\nemployee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss\nin order to exercise the religious liberty that the First\nAmendment guarantees.\n",

Argued October 5, 2011\u2014Decided January 11, 2012\nPetitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is\n  a member congregation of the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod.\n  The Synod classifies its school teachers into two categories: \u201ccalled\u201d\n  and \u201clay.\u201d \u201cCalled\u201d teachers are regarded as having been called to\n  their vocation by God. To be eligible to be considered \u201ccalled,\u201d a\n  teacher must complete certain academic requirements, including a\n  course of theological study. Once called, a teacher receives the formal\n  title \u201cMinister of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d \u201cLay\u201d teachers, by con-\n  trast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lu-\n  theran. Although lay and called teachers at Hosanna-Tabor general-\n  ly performed the same duties, lay teachers were hired only when\n  called teachers were unavailable.\n     After respondent Cheryl Perich completed the required training,\n  Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accept-\n  ed the call and was designated a commissioned minister. In addition\n  to teaching secular subjects, Perich taught a religion class, led her\n  students in daily prayer and devotional exercises, and took her stu-\n  dents to a weekly school-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel\n  service herself about twice a year.\n     Perich developed narcolepsy and began the 2004\u20132005 school year\n  on disability leave. In January 2005, she notified the school principal\n  that she would be able to report to work in February. The principal\n  responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher\n  to fill Perich\u2019s position for the remainder of the school year. The\n  principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to re-\n  turn to the classroom. The congregation subsequently offered to pay\n2      HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                   AND SCHOOL v.

In Febru-\n    ary, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until\n    she received written documentation that she had reported to work.\n    The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be\n    fired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and in-\n    tended to assert her legal rights. In a subsequent letter, the chair-\n    man of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would\n    consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds\n    for termination, the letter cited Perich\u2019s \u201cinsubordination and disrup-\n    tive behavior,\u201d as well as the damage she had done to her \u201cworking\n    relationship\u201d with the school by \u201cthreatening to take legal action.\u201d\n    The congregation voted to rescind Perich\u2019s call, and Hosanna-Tabor\n    sent her a letter of termination.\n       Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n    Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in\n    violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC brought\n    suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in\n    retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened\n    in the litigation. Invoking what is known as the \u201cministerial excep-\n    tion,\u201d Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the First\n    Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relation-\n    ship between a religious institution and one of its ministers. The\n    District Court agreed and granted summary judgment in Hosanna-\n    Tabor\u2019s favor. The Sixth Circuit vacated and remanded. It recog-\n    nized the existence of a ministerial exception rooted in the First\n    Amendment, but concluded that Perich did not qualify as a \u201cminister\u201d\n    under the exception.\nHeld:\n    1.

Pp. 10\u201312.\n      (c) Since the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nand other employment discrimination laws, the Courts of Appeals\nhave uniformly recognized the existence of a \u201cministerial exception,\u201d\ngrounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of such\nlegislation to claims concerning the employment relationship be-\ntween a religious institution and its ministers. The Court agrees that\nthere is such a ministerial exception. Requiring a church to accept or\nretain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do\nso, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such ac-\ntion interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving\nthe church of control over the selection of those who will personify its\nbeliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the\nFree Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group\u2019s right to\nshape its own faith and mission through its appointments. According\nthe state the power to determine which individuals will minister to\nthe faithful also violates the Establishment Clause, which prohibits\ngovernment involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions.\n   The EEOC and Perich contend that religious organizations can de-\nfend against employment discrimination claims by invoking their\nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association. They thus see no\nneed\u2014and no basis\u2014for a special rule for ministers grounded in the\nReligion Clauses themselves. Their position, however, is hard to\nsquare with the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives spe-\ncial solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. The Court\ncannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have\nnothing to say about a religious organization\u2019s freedom to select its\nown ministers.\n   The EEOC and Perich also contend that Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, precludes recogni-\ntion of a ministerial exception. But Smith involved government regu-\nlation of only outward physical acts. The present case, in contrast,\nconcerns government interference with an internal church decision\nthat affects the faith and mission of the church itself. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   2. Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of the minis-\nterial exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of this em-\nployment discrimination suit against her religious employer. Pp. 15\u2013\n21.\n4      HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                   AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n         (a) The ministerial exception is not limited to the head of a reli-\n    gious congregation. The Court, however, does not adopt a rigid for-\n    mula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister. Here, it\n    is enough to conclude that the exception covers Perich, given all the\n    circumstances of her employment. Hosanna-Tabor held her out as a\n    minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its members. That\n    title represented a significant degree of religious training followed by\n    a formal process of commissioning. Perich also held herself out as a\n    minister by, for example, accepting the formal call to religious ser-\n    vice. And her job duties reflected a role in conveying the Church\u2019s\n    message and carrying out its mission: As a source of religious in-\n    struction, Perich played an important part in transmitting the Lu-\n    theran faith.\n       In concluding that Perich was not a minister under the exception,\n    the Sixth Circuit committed three errors. First, it failed to see any\n    relevance in the fact that Perich was a commissioned minister. Alt-\n    hough such a title, by itself, does not automatically ensure coverage,\n    the fact that an employee has been ordained or commissioned as a\n    minister is surely relevant, as is the fact that significant religious\n    training and a recognized religious mission underlie the description\n    of the employee\u2019s position. Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much\n    weight to the fact that lay teachers at the school performed the same\n    religious duties as Perich. Though relevant, it cannot be dispositive\n    that others not formally recognized as ministers by the church per-\n    form the same functions\u2014particularly when, as here, they did so only\n    because commissioned ministers were unavailable. Third, the Sixth\n    Circuit placed too much emphasis on Perich\u2019s performance of secular\n    duties. Although the amount of time an employee spends on particu-\n    lar activities is relevant in assessing that employee\u2019s status, that fac-\n    tor cannot be considered in isolation, without regard to the other con-\n    siderations discussed above. Pp. 15\u201319.\n         (b) Because Perich was a minister for purposes of the exception,\n    this suit must be dismissed. An order reinstating Perich as a called\n    teacher would have plainly violated the Church\u2019s freedom under the\n    Religion Clauses to select its own ministers. Though Perich no longer\n    seeks reinstatement, she continues to seek frontpay, backpay, com-\n    pensatory and punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. An award of\n    such relief would operate as a penalty on the Church for terminating\n    an unwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the First\n    Amendment than an order overturning the termination. Such relief\n    would depend on a determination that Hosanna-Tabor was wrong to\n    have relieved Perich of her position, and it is precisely such a ruling\n    that is barred by the ministerial exception.\n       Any suggestion that Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s asserted religious reason for\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The purpose of the exception is not to safeguard a church\u2019s\n  decision to fire a minister only when it is made for a religious reason.\n  The exception instead ensures that the authority to select and control\n  who will minister to the faithful is the church\u2019s alone. Pp. 19\u201320.\n       (c) Today the Court holds only that the ministerial exception bars\n  an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister,\n  challenging her church\u2019s decision to fire her.

EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  The Synod classifies teachers into two categories:\n\u201ccalled\u201d and \u201clay.\u201d \u201cCalled\u201d teachers are regarded as\nhaving been called to their vocation by God through a\ncongregation. To be eligible to receive a call from a con-\ngregation, a teacher must satisfy certain academic\nrequirements. One way of doing so is by completing a\n\u201ccolloquy\u201d program at a Lutheran college or university. The\nprogram requires candidates to take eight courses of\ntheological study, obtain the endorsement of their local\nSynod district, and pass an oral examination by a faculty\ncommittee. A teacher who meets these requirements may\nbe called by a congregation. Once called, a teacher re-\nceives the formal title \u201cMinister of Religion, Commis-\nsioned.\u201d App. 42, 48. A commissioned minister serves for\nan open-ended term; at Hosanna-Tabor, a call could be\nrescinded only for cause and by a supermajority vote of the\ncongregation.\n  \u201cLay\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d teachers, by contrast, are not re-\nquired to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran.\nAt Hosanna-Tabor, they were appointed by the school\nboard, without a vote of the congregation, to one-year\nrenewable terms. Although teachers at the school general-\nly performed the same duties regardless of whether they\nwere lay or called, lay teachers were hired only when\ncalled teachers were unavailable.\n  Respondent Cheryl Perich was first employed by\nHosanna-Tabor as a lay teacher in 1999. After Perich com-\npleted her colloquy later that school year, Hosanna-Tabor\nasked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the\ncall and received a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d designating her a\ncommissioned minister. Id., at 42.\n  Perich taught kindergarten during her first four years\nat Hosanna-Tabor and fourth grade during the 2003\u20132004\nschool year. She taught math, language arts, social stud-\nies, science, gym, art, and music. She also taught a reli-\ngion class four days a week, led the students in prayer and\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndevotional exercises each day, and attended a weekly\nschool-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel service\nherself about twice a year.\n   Perich became ill in June 2004 with what was eventual-\nly diagnosed as narcolepsy. Symptoms included sudden\nand deep sleeps from which she could not be roused.\nBecause of her illness, Perich began the 2004\u20132005 school\nyear on disability leave. On January 27, 2005, however,\nPerich notified the school principal, Stacey Hoeft, that she\nwould be able to report to work the following month.\nHoeft responded that the school had already contracted\nwith a lay teacher to fill Perich\u2019s position for the remain-\nder of the school year. Hoeft also expressed concern that\nPerich was not yet ready to return to the classroom.\n   On January 30, Hosanna-Tabor held a meeting of its\ncongregation at which school administrators stated that\nPerich was unlikely to be physically capable of returning\nto work that school year or the next. The congregation\nvoted to offer Perich a \u201cpeaceful release\u201d from her call,\nwhereby the congregation would pay a portion of her\nhealth insurance premiums in exchange for her resigna-\ntion as a called teacher. Id., at 178, 186. Perich refused to\nresign and produced a note from her doctor stating that\nshe would be able to return to work on February 22. The\nschool board urged Perich to reconsider, informing her\nthat the school no longer had a position for her, but Perich\nstood by her decision not to resign.\n   On the morning of February 22\u2014the first day she was\nmedically cleared to return to work\u2014Perich presented\nherself at the school. Hoeft asked her to leave but she\nwould not do so until she obtained written documentation\nthat she had reported to work. Later that afternoon, Hoeft\ncalled Perich at home and told her that she would likely be\nfired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an\nattorney and intended to assert her legal rights.\n   Following a school board meeting that evening, board\n4    HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nchairman Scott Salo sent Perich a letter stating that\nHosanna-Tabor was reviewing the process for rescinding\nher call in light of her \u201cregrettable\u201d actions. Id., at 229.\nSalo subsequently followed up with a letter advising\nPerich that the congregation would consider whether to\nrescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds for ter-\nmination, the letter cited Perich\u2019s \u201cinsubordination and\ndisruptive behavior\u201d on February 22, as well as the dam-\nage she had done to her \u201cworking relationship\u201d with the\nschool by \u201cthreatening to take legal action.\u201d Id., at 55.\nThe congregation voted to rescind Perich\u2019s call on April 10,\nand Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination the\nnext day.\n                              B\n  Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Op-\nportunity Commission, alleging that her employment had\nbeen terminated in violation of the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act, 104 Stat. 327, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712101 et seq.\n(1990). The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminat-\ning against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.\n\u00a712112(a). It also prohibits an employer from retaliating\n\u201cagainst any individual because such individual has op-\nposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or\nbecause such individual made a charge, testified, assisted,\nor participated in any manner in an investigation, pro-\nceeding, or hearing under [the ADA].\u201d \u00a712203(a).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The ADA itself provides religious entities with two defenses to\n\nclaims of discrimination that arise under subchapter I of the Act. The\nfirst provides that \u201c[t]his subchapter shall not prohibit a religious\ncorporation, association, educational institution, or society from giving\npreference in employment to individuals of a particular religion to\nperform work connected with the carrying on by such [entity] of its\nactivities.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. III). The second provides that\n\u201c[u]nder this subchapter, a religious organization may require that all\napplicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such\norganization.\u201d \u00a712113(d)(2). The ADA\u2019s prohibition against retaliation,\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleg-\ning that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threat-\nening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened in the\nlitigation, claiming unlawful retaliation under both the\nADA and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights\nAct, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a737.1602(a) (1979). The EEOC\nand Perich sought Perich\u2019s reinstatement to her former\nposition (or frontpay in lieu thereof), along with backpay,\ncompensatory and punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and\nother injunctive relief.\n   Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment. Invok-\ning what is known as the \u201cministerial exception,\u201d the\nChurch argued that the suit was barred by the First\nAmendment because the claims at issue concerned the\nemployment relationship between a religious institution\nand one of its ministers. According to the Church, Perich\nwas a minister, and she had been fired for a religious\nreason\u2014namely, that her threat to sue the Church vio-\nlated the Synod\u2019s belief that Christians should resolve their\ndisputes internally.\n   The District Court agreed that the suit was barred by\nthe ministerial exception and granted summary judgment\nin Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s favor. The court explained that\n\u201cHosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her\nout to the world as such long before this litigation began,\u201d\nand that the \u201cfacts surrounding Perich\u2019s employment in a\nreligious school with a sectarian mission\u201d supported the\nChurch\u2019s characterization. 582 F. Supp. 2d, at 891\u2013892.\nIn light of that determination, the court concluded that it\ncould \u201cinquire no further into her claims of retaliation.\u201d\nId., at 892.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00a712203(a), appears in a different subchapter\u2014subchapter IV. The \n\nEEOC and Perich contend, and Hosanna-Tabor does not dispute, that \n\nthese defenses therefore do not apply to retaliation claims. \n\n6   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nremanded, directing the District Court to proceed to the\nmerits of Perich\u2019s retaliation claims. The Court of Appeals\nrecognized the existence of a ministerial exception barring\ncertain employment discrimination claims against reli-\ngious institutions\u2014an exception \u201crooted in the First\nAmendment\u2019s guarantees of religious freedom.\u201d 597 F. 3d\n769, 777 (2010). The court concluded, however, that\nPerich did not qualify as a \u201cminister\u201d under the exception,\nnoting in particular that her duties as a called teacher\nwere identical to her duties as a lay teacher. Id., at 778\u2013\n781. Judge White concurred. She viewed the question\nwhether Perich qualified as a minister to be closer than\ndid the majority, but agreed that the \u201cfact that the duties\nof the contract teachers are the same as the duties of the\ncalled teachers is telling.\u201d Id., at 782, 784.\n  We granted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   The First Amendment provides, in part, that \u201cCongress\nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d We have said\nthat these two Clauses \u201coften exert conflicting pressures,\u201d\nCutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 719 (2005), and that\nthere can be \u201cinternal tension . . . between the Establish-\nment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,\u201d Tilton v.\nRichardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (plurality opinion).\nNot so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government\nfrom interfering with the decision of a religious group to\nfire one of its ministers.\n                             A\n  Controversy between church and state over religious\noffices is hardly new. In 1215, the issue was addressed in\nthe very first clause of Magna Carta. There, King John\nagreed that \u201cthe English church shall be free, and shall\nhave its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe King in particular accepted the \u201cfreedom of elections,\u201d\na right \u201cthought to be of the greatest necessity and im-\nportance to the English church.\u201d J. Holt, Magna Carta\nApp. IV, p. 317, cl. 1 (1965).\n   That freedom in many cases may have been more the-\noretical than real. See, e.g., W. Warren, Henry II 312\n(1973) (recounting the writ sent by Henry II to the electors\nof a bishopric in Winchester, stating: \u201cI order you to hold a\nfree election, but forbid you to elect anyone but Richard\nmy clerk\u201d). In any event, it did not survive the reign of\nHenry VIII, even in theory. The Act of Supremacy of 1534,\n26 Hen. 8, ch. 1, made the English monarch the supreme\nhead of the Church, and the Act in Restraint of Annates,\n25 Hen. 8, ch. 20, passed that same year, gave him the\nauthority to appoint the Church\u2019s high officials. See G.\nElton, The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commen-\ntary 331\u2013332 (1960). Various Acts of Uniformity, enacted\nsubsequently, tightened further the government\u2019s grip on\nthe exercise of religion. See, e.g., Act of Uniformity, 1559,\n1 Eliz., ch. 2; Act of Uniformity, 1549, 2 & 3 Edw. 6, ch. 1.\nThe Uniformity Act of 1662, for instance, limited service\nas a minister to those who formally assented to prescribed\ntenets and pledged to follow the mode of worship set forth\nin the Book of Common Prayer. Any minister who refused\nto make that pledge was \u201cdeprived of all his Spiritual\nPromotions.\u201d Act of Uniformity, 1662, 14 Car. 2, ch. 4.\n   Seeking to escape the control of the national church, the\nPuritans fled to New England, where they hoped to elect\ntheir own ministers and establish their own modes of\nworship. See T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and\nState in America to the Passage of the First Amendment 3\n(1986); McConnell, The Origins and Historical Under-\nstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev.\n1409, 1422 (1990). William Penn, the Quaker proprietor\nof what would eventually become Pennsylvania and Dela-\nware, also sought independence from the Church of Eng-\n8   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nland. The charter creating the province of Pennsylvania\ncontained no clause establishing a religion. See S. Cobb,\nThe Rise of Religious Liberty in America 440\u2013441 (1970).\n   Colonists in the South, in contrast, brought the Church\nof England with them. But even they sometimes chafed at\nthe control exercised by the Crown and its representatives\nover religious offices. In Virginia, for example, the law\nvested the governor with the power to induct ministers\npresented to him by parish vestries, 2 Hening\u2019s Statutes\nat Large 46 (1642), but the vestries often refused to make\nsuch presentations and instead chose ministers on their\nown. See H. Eckenrode, Separation of Church and State\nin Virginia 13\u201319 (1910). Controversies over the selection\nof ministers also arose in other Colonies with Anglican\nestablishments, including North Carolina. See C. An-\ntieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom from Federal\nEstablishment: Formation and Early History of the First\nAmendment Religion Clauses 10\u201311 (1964). There, the\nroyal governor insisted that the right of presentation lay\nwith the Bishop of London, but the colonial assembly\nenacted laws placing that right in the vestries. Authori-\nties in England intervened, repealing those laws as incon-\nsistent with the rights of the Crown. See id., at 11;\nWeeks, Church and State in North Carolina, Johns Hop-\nkins U. Studies in Hist. & Pol. Sci., 11th Ser., Nos. 5\u20136,\npp. 29\u201336 (1893).\n   It was against this background that the First Amend-\nment was adopted. Familiar with life under the estab-\nlished Church of England, the founding generation sought\nto foreclose the possibility of a national church. See 1\nAnnals of Cong. 730\u2013731 (1789) (noting that the Estab-\nlishment Clause addressed the fear that \u201cone sect might\nobtain a pre-eminence, or two combine together, and\nestablish a religion to which they would compel others to\nconform\u201d (remarks of J. Madison)). By forbidding the\n\u201cestablishment of religion\u201d and guaranteeing the \u201cfree\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The\nEstablishment Clause prevents the Government from\nappointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause pre-\nvents it from interfering with the freedom of religious\ngroups to select their own.\n   This understanding of the Religion Clauses was reflect-\ned in two events involving James Madison, \u201c \u2018the leading\narchitect of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201d\nArizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83, 103 (1968)). The first occurred in\n1806, when John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in the\nUnited States, solicited the Executive\u2019s opinion on who\nshould be appointed to direct the affairs of the Catholic\nChurch in the territory newly acquired by the Louisiana\nPurchase. After consulting with President Jefferson, then-\nSecretary of State Madison responded that the selection\nof church \u201cfunctionaries\u201d was an \u201centirely ecclesiastical\u201d\nmatter left to the Church\u2019s own judgment. Letter from\nJames Madison to Bishop Carroll (Nov. 20, 1806), reprint-\ned in 20 Records of the American Catholic Historical Soci-\nety 63 (1909). The \u201cscrupulous policy of the Constitution\nin guarding against a political interference with religious\naffairs,\u201d Madison explained, prevented the Government\nfrom rendering an opinion on the \u201cselection of ecclesiasti-\ncal individuals.\u201d Id., at 63\u201364.\n   The second episode occurred in 1811, when Madison was\nPresident. Congress had passed a bill incorporating the\nProtestant Episcopal Church in the town of Alexandria in\nwhat was then the District of Columbia. Madison vetoed\nthe bill, on the ground that it \u201cexceeds the rightful author-\nity to which Governments are limited, by the essential\ndistinction between civil and religious functions, and\nviolates, in particular, the article of the Constitution of the\n10   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States, which declares, that \u2018Congress shall make\nno law respecting a religious establishment.\u2019 \u201d 22 Annals\nof Cong. 982\u2013983 (1811). Madison explained:\n     \u201cThe bill enacts into, and establishes by law, sundry\n     rules and proceedings relative purely to the organi-\n     zation and polity of the church incorporated, and\n     comprehending even the election and removal of the\n     Minister of the same; so that no change could be made\n     therein by the particular society, or by the general\n     church of which it is a member, and whose authority\n     it recognises.\u201d Id., at 983 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  Given this understanding of the Religion Clauses\u2014and\nthe absence of government employment regulation gener-\nally\u2014it was some time before questions about government\ninterference with a church\u2019s ability to select its own minis-\nters came before the courts. This Court touched upon the\nissue indirectly, however, in the context of disputes over\nchurch property. Our decisions in that area confirm that\nit is impermissible for the government to contradict a\nchurch\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers.\n  In Watson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88506\"><a href=\"/opinion/88506/watson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1872), the Court con-\nsidered a dispute between antislavery and proslavery\nfactions over who controlled the property of the Walnut\nStreet Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. The\nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian Church had recog-\nnized the antislavery faction, and this Court\u2014applying\nnot the Constitution but a \u201cbroad and sound view of the\nrelations of church and state under our system of laws\u201d\u2014\ndeclined to question that determination.

As we would put it later, our opinion in Watson\n\u201cradiates . . . a spirit of freedom for religious organiza-\ntions, an independence from secular control or manipula-\ntion\u2014in short, power to decide for themselves, free from\nstate interference, matters of church government as well\nas those of faith and doctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas\nCathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America,\n344 U. S. 94, 116 (1952).\n   Confronting the issue under the Constitution for the\nfirst time in Kedroff, the Court recognized that the\n\u201c[f]reedom to select the clergy, where no improper methods\nof choice are proven,\u201d is \u201cpart of the free exercise of reli-\ngion\u201d protected by the First Amendment against govern-\nment interference. Ibid. At issue in Kedroff was the right\nto use a Russian Orthodox cathedral in New York City.\nThe Russian Orthodox churches in North America had\nsplit from the Supreme Church Authority in Moscow, out\nof concern that the Authority had become a tool of the\nSoviet Government.        The North American churches\nclaimed that the right to use the cathedral belonged to an\narchbishop elected by them; the Supreme Church Authori-\nty claimed that it belonged instead to an archbishop ap-\npointed by the patriarch in Moscow. New York\u2019s highest\ncourt ruled in favor of the North American churches,\nbased on a state law requiring every Russian Orthodox\nchurch in New York to recognize the determination of the\ngoverning body of the North American churches as author-\nitative. Id., at 96\u201397, 99, n. 3, 107, n. 10.\n   This Court reversed, concluding that the New York law\nviolated the First Amendment. Id., at 107. We explained\nthat the controversy over the right to use the cathedral\nwas \u201cstrictly a matter of ecclesiastical government, the\npower of the Supreme Church Authority of the Russian\nOrthodox Church to appoint the ruling hierarch of the\narchdiocese of North America.\u201d Id., at 115.

Accordingly, we declared the law\nunconstitutional because it \u201cdirectly prohibit[ed] the free\nexercise of an ecclesiastical right, the Church\u2019s choice of its\nhierarchy.\u201d Ibid.\n  This Court reaffirmed these First Amendment princi-\nples in Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for United States\nand Canada v. Milivojevich, 426 U. S. 696 (1976), a case\ninvolving a dispute over control of the American-Canadian\nDiocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, including its\nproperty and assets. The Church had removed Dionisije\nMilivojevich as bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese\nbecause of his defiance of the church hierarchy. Following\nhis removal, Dionisije brought a civil action in state court\nchallenging the Church\u2019s decision, and the Illinois Su-\npreme Court \u201cpurported in effect to reinstate Dionisije as\nDiocesan Bishop,\u201d on the ground that the proceedings\nresulting in his removal failed to comply with church laws\nand regulations. Id., at 708.\n  Reversing that judgment, this Court explained that the\nFirst Amendment \u201cpermit[s] hierarchical religious organi-\nzations to establish their own rules and regulations for\ninternal discipline and government, and to create tribu-\nnals for adjudicating disputes over these matters.\u201d Id., at\n724. When ecclesiastical tribunals decide such disputes,\nwe further explained, \u201cthe Constitution requires that civil\ncourts accept their decisions as binding upon them.\u201d Id.,\nat 725. We thus held that by inquiring into whether the\nChurch had followed its own procedures, the State Su-\npreme Court had \u201cunconstitutionally undertaken the\nresolution of quintessentially religious controversies\nwhose resolution the First Amendment commits exclusive-\nly to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals\u201d of the Church.\nId., at 720.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The Courts of Appeals, in contrast, have had\nextensive experience with this issue. Since the passage of\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\net seq., and other employment discrimination laws, the\nCourts of Appeals have uniformly recognized the existence\nof a \u201cministerial exception,\u201d grounded in the First Amend-\nment, that precludes application of such legislation to\nclaims concerning the employment relationship between a\nreligious institution and its ministers.2\n   We agree that there is such a ministerial exception. The\nmembers of a religious group put their faith in the hands\nof their ministers. Requiring a church to accept or retain\nan unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to\ndo so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment deci-\nsion. Such action interferes with the internal governance\nof the church, depriving the church of control over the\nselection of those who will personify its beliefs. By impos-\ning an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free\nExercise Clause, which protects a religious group\u2019s right to\nshape its own faith and mission through its appointments.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 See Natal v.

EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nAccording the state the power to determine which individ-\nuals will minister to the faithful also violates the Estab-\nlishment Clause, which prohibits government involvement\nin such ecclesiastical decisions.\n   The EEOC and Perich acknowledge that employment\ndiscrimination laws would be unconstitutional as applied\nto religious groups in certain circumstances. They grant,\nfor example, that it would violate the First Amendment for\ncourts to apply such laws to compel the ordination of\nwomen by the Catholic Church or by an Orthodox Jewish\nseminary. Brief for Federal Respondent 31; Brief for\nRespondent Perich 35\u201336. According to the EEOC and\nPerich, religious organizations could successfully defend\nagainst employment discrimination claims in those circum-\nstances by invoking the constitutional right to freedom\nof association\u2014a right \u201cimplicit\u201d in the First Amendment.\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622\n(1984). The EEOC and Perich thus see no need\u2014and no\nbasis\u2014for a special rule for ministers grounded in the\nReligion Clauses themselves.\n   We find this position untenable. The right to freedom of\nassociation is a right enjoyed by religious and secular\ngroups alike. It follows under the EEOC\u2019s and Perich\u2019s\nview that the First Amendment analysis should be the\nsame, whether the association in question is the Lutheran\nChurch, a labor union, or a social club. See Perich Brief\n31; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. That result is hard to square with\nthe text of the First Amendment itself, which gives spe-\ncial solicitude to the rights of religious organizations. We\ncannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion\nClauses have nothing to say about a religious organiza-\ntion\u2019s freedom to select its own ministers.\n   The EEOC and Perich also contend that our decision in\nEmployment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.\nSmith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), precludes recognition of a\nministerial exception. In Smith, two members of the\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

We held that this did not violate the Free Exercise\nClause, even though the peyote had been ingested for\nsacramental purposes, because the \u201cright of free exercise\ndoes not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply\nwith a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the\nground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that\nhis religion prescribes (or proscribes).\u201d Id., at 879 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n  It is true that the ADA\u2019s prohibition on retaliation, like\nOregon\u2019s prohibition on peyote use, is a valid and neutral\nlaw of general applicability. But a church\u2019s selection of its\nministers is unlike an individual\u2019s ingestion of peyote.\nSmith involved government regulation of only outward\nphysical acts. The present case, in contrast, concerns\ngovernment interference with an internal church decision\nthat affects the faith and mission of the church itself. See\nid., at 877 (distinguishing the government\u2019s regulation of\n\u201cphysical acts\u201d from its \u201clend[ing] its power to one or\nthe other side in controversies over religious authority or\ndogma\u201d). The contention that Smith forecloses recognition\nof a ministerial exception rooted in the Religion Clauses\nhas no merit.\n                             III\n  Having concluded that there is a ministerial exception\ngrounded in the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment,\nwe consider whether the exception applies in this case.\nWe hold that it does.\n  Every Court of Appeals to have considered the question\nhas concluded that the ministerial exception is not limited\nto the head of a religious congregation, and we agree. We\nare reluctant, however, to adopt a rigid formula for decid-\ning when an employee qualifies as a minister. It is enough\n16   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfor us to conclude, in this our first case involving the\nministerial exception, that the exception covers Perich,\ngiven all the circumstances of her employment.\n   To begin with, Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a\nminister, with a role distinct from that of most of its mem-\nbers. When Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it issued\nher a \u201cdiploma of vocation\u201d according her the title \u201cMinis-\nter of Religion, Commissioned.\u201d App. 42. She was tasked\nwith performing that office \u201caccording to the Word of God\nand the confessional standards of the Evangelical Luther-\nan Church as drawn from the Sacred Scriptures.\u201d Ibid.\nThe congregation prayed that God \u201cbless [her] ministra-\ntions to the glory of His holy name, [and] the building of\nHis church.\u201d Id., at 43. In a supplement to the diploma,\nthe congregation undertook to periodically review Perich\u2019s\n\u201cskills of ministry\u201d and \u201cministerial responsibilities,\u201d and\nto provide for her \u201ccontinuing education as a professional\nperson in the ministry of the Gospel.\u201d Id., at 49.\n   Perich\u2019s title as a minister reflected a significant degree\nof religious training followed by a formal process of com-\nmissioning. To be eligible to become a commissioned\nminister, Perich had to complete eight college-level cours-\nes in subjects including biblical interpretation, church\ndoctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran teacher. She\nalso had to obtain the endorsement of her local Synod\ndistrict by submitting a petition that contained her aca-\ndemic transcripts, letters of recommendation, personal\nstatement, and written answers to various ministry-\nrelated questions. Finally, she had to pass an oral exami-\nnation by a faculty committee at a Lutheran college. It\ntook Perich six years to fulfill these requirements. And\nwhen she eventually did, she was commissioned as a\nminister only upon election by the congregation, which\nrecognized God\u2019s call to her to teach. At that point, her\ncall could be rescinded only upon a supermajority vote of\nthe congregation\u2014a protection designed to allow her to\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cpreach the Word of God boldly.\u201d Brief for Lutheran\nChurch-Missouri Synod as Amicus Curiae 15.\n   Perich held herself out as a minister of the Church by\naccepting the formal call to religious service, according to\nits terms. She did so in other ways as well. For example,\nshe claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that\nwas available only to employees earning their compensa-\ntion \u201c \u2018in the exercise of the ministry.\u2019 \u201d App. 220 (\u201cIf you\nare not conducting activities \u2018in the exercise of the minis-\ntry,\u2019 you cannot take advantage of the parsonage or\nhousing allowance exclusion\u201d (quoting Lutheran Church-\nMissouri Synod Brochure on Whether the IRS Considers\nEmployees as a Minister (2007)). In a form she submitted\nto the Synod following her termination, Perich again\nindicated that she regarded herself as a minister at\nHosanna-Tabor, stating: \u201cI feel that God is leading me to\nserve in the teaching ministry . . . . I am anxious to be in\nthe teaching ministry again soon.\u201d App. 53.\n   Perich\u2019s job duties reflected a role in conveying the\nChurch\u2019s message and carrying out its mission. Hosanna-\nTabor expressly charged her with \u201clead[ing] others toward\nChristian maturity\u201d and \u201cteach[ing] faithfully the Word of\nGod, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as\nset forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical\nLutheran Church.\u201d Id., at 48. In fulfilling these responsi-\nbilities, Perich taught her students religion four days a\nweek, and led them in prayer three times a day. Once a\nweek, she took her students to a school-wide chapel ser-\nvice, and\u2014about twice a year\u2014she took her turn leading\nit, choosing the liturgy, selecting the hymns, and deliver-\ning a short message based on verses from the Bible. Dur-\ning her last year of teaching, Perich also led her fourth\ngraders in a brief devotional exercise each morning. As a\nsource of religious instruction, Perich performed an im-\nportant role in transmitting the Lutheran faith to the next\ngeneration.\n18   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   In light of these considerations\u2014the formal title given\nPerich by the Church, the substance reflected in that title,\nher own use of that title, and the important religious\nfunctions she performed for the Church\u2014we conclude\nthat Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial\nexception.\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals\ncommitted three errors. First, the Sixth Circuit failed to\nsee any relevance in the fact that Perich was a commis-\nsioned minister. Although such a title, by itself, does not\nautomatically ensure coverage, the fact that an employee\nhas been ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely\nrelevant, as is the fact that significant religious training\nand a recognized religious mission underlie the description\nof the employee\u2019s position. It was wrong for the Court of\nAppeals\u2014and Perich, who has adopted the court\u2019s view,\nsee Perich Brief 45\u2014to say that an employee\u2019s title does\nnot matter.\n   Second, the Sixth Circuit gave too much weight to the\nfact that lay teachers at the school performed the same\nreligious duties as Perich. We express no view on whether\nsomeone with Perich\u2019s duties would be covered by the\nministerial exception in the absence of the other consider-\nations we have discussed. But though relevant, it cannot\nbe dispositive that others not formally recognized as min-\nisters by the church perform the same functions\u2014\nparticularly when, as here, they did so only because\ncommissioned ministers were unavailable.\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit placed too much emphasis on\nPerich\u2019s performance of secular duties. It is true that her\nreligious duties consumed only 45 minutes of each work-\nday, and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching\nsecular subjects. The EEOC regards that as conclusive,\ncontending that any ministerial exception \u201cshould be\nlimited to those employees who perform exclusively reli-\ngious functions.\u201d Brief for Federal Respondent 51. We\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncannot accept that view. Indeed, we are unsure whether\nany such employees exist. The heads of congregations\nthemselves often have a mix of duties, including secular\nones such as helping to manage the congregation\u2019s financ-\nes, supervising purely secular personnel, and overseeing\nthe upkeep of facilities.\n   Although the Sixth Circuit did not adopt the extreme\nposition pressed here by the EEOC, it did regard the\nrelative amount of time Perich spent performing religious\nfunctions as largely determinative. The issue before us,\nhowever, is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch.\nThe amount of time an employee spends on particular\nactivities is relevant in assessing that employee\u2019s status,\nbut that factor cannot be considered in isolation, without\nregard to the nature of the religious functions performed\nand the other considerations discussed above.\n   Because Perich was a minister within the meaning of\nthe exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of\nthis employment discrimination suit against her religious\nemployer. The EEOC and Perich originally sought an\norder reinstating Perich to her former position as a called\nteacher. By requiring the Church to accept a minister it\ndid not want, such an order would have plainly violated\nthe Church\u2019s freedom under the Religion Clauses to select\nits own ministers.\n   Perich no longer seeks reinstatement, having abandoned\nthat relief before this Court. See Perich Brief 58. But that\nis immaterial. Perich continues to seek frontpay in lieu of\nreinstatement, backpay, compensatory and punitive dam-\nages, and attorney\u2019s fees. An award of such relief would\noperate as a penalty on the Church for terminating an\nunwanted minister, and would be no less prohibited by the\nFirst Amendment than an order overturning the termina-\ntion. Such relief would depend on a determination that\nHosanna-Tabor was wrong to have relieved Perich of her\nposition, and it is precisely such a ruling that is barred by\n20   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ministerial exception.3\n   The EEOC and Perich suggest that Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s\nasserted religious reason for firing Perich\u2014that she vio-\nlated the Synod\u2019s commitment to internal dispute resolu-\ntion\u2014was pretextual. That suggestion misses the point of\nthe ministerial exception. The purpose of the exception is\nnot to safeguard a church\u2019s decision to fire a minister only\nwhen it is made for a religious reason. The exception\ninstead ensures that the authority to select and control\nwho will minister to the faithful\u2014a matter \u201cstrictly eccle-\nsiastical,\u201d Kedroff, 344 U. S., at 119\u2014is the church\u2019s\nalone.4\n                             IV\n  The EEOC and Perich foresee a parade of horribles that\nwill follow our recognition of a ministerial exception to\nemployment discrimination suits. According to the EEOC\nand Perich, such an exception could protect religious\norganizations from liability for retaliating against employ-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Perich does not dispute that if the ministerial exception bars her\n\nretaliation claim under the ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim\nunder Michigan law.\n   4 A conflict has arisen in the Courts of Appeals over whether the min-\n\nisterial exception is a jurisdictional bar or a defense on the merits.\nCompare Hollins, 474 F. 3d, at 225 (treating the exception as jurisdic-\ntional); and Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F. 3d 1036, 1038\u2013\n1039 (CA7 2006) (same), with Petruska, 462 F. 3d, at 302 (treating the\nexception as an affirmative defense); Bryce, 289 F. 3d, at 654 (same);\nBollard v. California Province of Soc. of Jesus, 196 F. 3d 940, 951 (CA9\n1999) (same); and Natal, 878 F. 2d, at 1576 (same). We conclude that\nthe exception operates as an affirmative defense to an otherwise\ncognizable claim, not a jurisdictional bar. That is because the issue\npresented by the exception is \u201cwhether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief,\u201d not whether the court has \u201cpower to hear\n[the] case.\u201d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 4\u20135) (internal quotation marks omitted). District\ncourts have power to consider ADA claims in cases of this sort, and to\ndecide whether the claim can proceed or is instead barred by the\nministerial exception.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

What is more,\nthe EEOC contends, the logic of the exception would con-\nfer on religious employers \u201cunfettered discretion\u201d to vio-\nlate employment laws by, for example, hiring children or\naliens not authorized to work in the United States. Brief\nfor Federal Respondent 29.\n   Hosanna-Tabor responds that the ministerial exception\nwould not in any way bar criminal prosecutions for in-\nterfering with law enforcement investigations or other\nproceedings. Nor, according to the Church, would the\nexception bar government enforcement of general laws\nrestricting eligibility for employment, because the excep-\ntion applies only to suits by or on behalf of ministers\nthemselves. Hosanna-Tabor also notes that the ministe-\nrial exception has been around in the lower courts for 40\nyears, see McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553, 558\n(CA5 1972), and has not given rise to the dire consequenc-\nes predicted by the EEOC and Perich.\n   The case before us is an employment discrimination suit\nbrought on behalf of a minister, challenging her church\u2019s\ndecision to fire her. Today we hold only that the ministe-\nrial exception bars such a suit. We express no view on\nwhether the exception bars other types of suits, including\nactions by employees alleging breach of contract or tor-\ntious conduct by their religious employers. There will be\ntime enough to address the applicability of the exception\nto other circumstances if and when they arise.\n                       *     *     *\n  The interest of society in the enforcement of employ-\nment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important.\nBut so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing\nwho will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry\nout their mission.

I write separately to note\nthat, in my view, the Religion Clauses require civil courts\nto apply the ministerial exception and to defer to a reli-\ngious organization\u2019s good-faith understanding of who\nqualifies as its minister. As the Court explains, the Reli-\ngion Clauses guarantee religious organizations autonomy\nin matters of internal governance, including the selection\nof those who will minister the faith. A religious organi-\nzation\u2019s right to choose its ministers would be hollow,\nhowever, if secular courts could second-guess the organiza-\ntion\u2019s sincere determination that a given employee is a\n\u201cminister\u201d under the organization\u2019s theological tenets.\nOur country\u2019s religious landscape includes organizations\nwith different leadership structures and doctrines that\ninfluence their conceptions of ministerial status. The\nquestion whether an employee is a minister is itself reli-\ngious in nature, and the answer will vary widely. Judicial\nattempts to fashion a civil definition of \u201cminister\u201d through\na bright-line test or multi-factor analysis risk disad-\nvantaging those religious groups whose beliefs, practices,\nand membership are outside of the \u201cmainstream\u201d or\nunpalatable to some.

See Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 336 (1987) (\u201c[I]t is a signifi-\ncant burden on a religious organization to require it, on\npain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activi-\nties a secular court will consider religious. The line is\nhardly a bright one, and an organization might under-\nstandably be concerned that a judge would not understand\nits religious tenets and sense of mission. Fear of potential\nliability might affect the way an organization carried out\nwhat it understood to be its religious mission\u201d (footnote\nomitted)). These are certainly dangers that the First\nAmendment was designed to guard against.\n   The Court thoroughly sets forth the facts that lead to its\nconclusion that Cheryl Perich was one of Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s\nministers, and I agree that these facts amply demonstrate\nPerich\u2019s ministerial role. But the evidence demonstrates\nthat Hosanna-Tabor sincerely considered Perich a minis-\nter. That would be sufficient for me to conclude that Per-\nich\u2019s suit is properly barred by the ministerial exception.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The term \u201cminister\u201d\nis commonly used by many Protestant denominations to\nrefer to members of their clergy, but the term is rarely if\never used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hin-\ndus, or Buddhists.2 In addition, the concept of ordination\nas understood by most Christian churches and by Judaism\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 It is unconventional to refer to many persons who clearly fall with-\n\nin the \u201cministerial\u201d exception, such as Protestant ministers, Catholic\npriests, and Jewish rabbis, as \u201cemployees,\u201d but I use the term in the\nsense in which it is used in the antidiscrimination laws that are often\nimplicated in cases involving the exception. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e(f) (Title VII); \u00a712111(4) (ADA); 29 U. S. C. \u00a7630(f) (ADEA);\n\u00a7206(e) (Equal Pay Act and Fair Labor Standards Act).\n  2 See 9 Oxford English Dictionary 818 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 4(b)) (noting\n\nthe term \u201cminister\u201d used in various phrases \u201capplied as general desig-\nnations for a person officially charged with spiritual functions in the\nChristian Church\u201d); 9 Encyclopedia of Religion 6044\u20136045 (2d ed.\n2005).

EEOC \n\n                  ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nhas no clear counterpart in some Christian denominations\nand some other religions. Because virtually every religion\nin the world is represented in the population of the United\nStates, it would be a mistake if the term \u201cminister\u201d or the\nconcept of ordination were viewed as central to the im-\nportant issue of religious autonomy that is presented in\ncases like this one. Instead, courts should focus on the\nfunction performed by persons who work for religious\nbodies.\n  The First Amendment protects the freedom of religious\ngroups to engage in certain key religious activities, includ-\ning the conducting of worship services and other religious\nceremonies and rituals, as well as the critical process of\ncommunicating the faith. Accordingly, religious groups\nmust be free to choose the personnel who are essential to\nthe performance of these functions.\n  The \u201cministerial\u201d exception should be tailored to this\npurpose. It should apply to any \u201cemployee\u201d who leads\na religious organization, conducts worship services or im-\nportant religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a\nmessenger or teacher of its faith. If a religious group\nbelieves that the ability of such an employee to perform\nthese key functions has been compromised, then the con-\nstitutional guarantee of religious freedom protects the\ngroup\u2019s right to remove the employee from his or her\nposition.\n                               I\n   Throughout our Nation\u2019s history, religious bodies have\nbeen the preeminent example of private associations that\nhave \u201cact[ed] as critical buffers between the individual and\nthe power of the State.\u201d Roberts v. United States Jaycees,\n468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984). In a case like the one now\nbefore us\u2014where the goal of the civil law in question, the\nelimination of discrimination against persons with disabil-\nities, is so worthy\u2014it is easy to forget that the autonomy\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nof religious groups, both here in the United States and\nabroad, has often served as a shield against oppressive\ncivil laws. To safeguard this crucial autonomy, we have\nlong recognized that the Religion Clauses protect a private\nsphere within which religious bodies are free to govern\nthemselves in accordance with their own beliefs. The\nConstitution guarantees religious bodies \u201cindependence\nfrom secular control or manipulation\u2014in short, power to\ndecide for themselves, free from state interference, mat-\nters of church government as well as those of faith and\ndoctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian\nOrthodox Church in North America, 344 U. S. 94, 116\n(1952).\n   Religious autonomy means that religious authorities\nmust be free to determine who is qualified to serve in\npositions of substantial religious importance. Different\nreligions will have different views on exactly what quali-\nfies as an important religious position, but it is nonethe-\nless possible to identify a general category of \u201cemployees\u201d\nwhose functions are essential to the independence of prac-\ntically all religious groups. These include those who serve\nin positions of leadership, those who perform important\nfunctions in worship services and in the performance of\nreligious ceremonies and rituals, and those who are en-\ntrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the faith\nto the next generation.\n   Applying the protection of the First Amendment to roles\nof religious leadership, worship, ritual, and expression\nfocuses on the objective functions that are important for\nthe autonomy of any religious group, regardless of its\nbeliefs. As we have recognized in a similar context,\n\u201c[f]orcing a group to accept certain members may impair\n[its ability] to express those views, and only those views,\nthat it intends to express.\u201d Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,\n530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). That principle applies with\nspecial force with respect to religious groups, whose very\n4   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                AND SCHOOL v.

See Employment\nDiv., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S.\n872, 882 (1990) (noting that the constitutional interest in\nfreedom of association may be \u201creinforced by Free Exercise\nClause concerns\u201d). As the Court notes, the First Amend-\nment \u201cgives special solicitude to the rights of religious\norganizations,\u201d ante, at 14, but our expressive-association\ncases are nevertheless useful in pointing out what those\nessential rights are. Religious groups are the archetype\nof associations formed for expressive purposes, and their\nfundamental rights surely include the freedom to choose\nwho is qualified to serve as a voice for their faith.\n   When it comes to the expression and inculcation of\nreligious doctrine, there can be no doubt that the messen-\nger matters. Religious teachings cover the gamut from\nmoral conduct to metaphysical truth, and both the content\nand credibility of a religion\u2019s message depend vitally on\nthe character and conduct of its teachers. A religion can-\nnot depend on someone to be an effective advocate for its\nreligious vision if that person\u2019s conduct fails to live up to\nthe religious precepts that he or she espouses. For this\nreason, a religious body\u2019s right to self-governance must\ninclude the ability to select, and to be selective about,\nthose who will serve as the very \u201cembodiment of its mes-\nsage\u201d and \u201cits voice to the faithful.\u201d Petruska v. Gannon\nUniv., 462 F. 3d 294, 306 (CA3 2006). A religious body\u2019s\ncontrol over such \u201cemployees\u201d is an essential component of\nits freedom to speak in its own voice, both to its own mem-\nbers and to the outside world.\n   The connection between church governance and the free\ndissemination of religious doctrine has deep roots in our\nlegal tradition:\n    \u201cThe right to organize voluntary religious associations\n    to assist in the expression and dissemination of any\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

But while a ministe-\nrial title is undoubtedly relevant in applying the First\nAmendment rule at issue, such a title is neither necessary\nnor sufficient. As previously noted, most faiths do not\nemploy the term \u201cminister,\u201d and some eschew the concept\nof formal ordination.3 And at the opposite end of the spec-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In Islam, for example, \u201cevery Muslim can perform the religious rites,\n\nso there is no class or profession of ordained clergy.

See Rayburn v.\nGeneral Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 772 F. 2d\n1164, 1168 (1985) (noting that the exception\u2019s applicability\n\u201cdoes not depend upon ordination but upon the function of\nthe position\u201d). The Fourth Circuit traced the exception\nback to McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F. 2d 553 (CA5\n1972), which invoked the Religion Clauses to bar a Title\nVII sex-discrimination suit brought by a woman who was\ndescribed by the court as a Salvation Army \u201cminister,\u201d id.,\nat 554, although her actual title was \u201cofficer.\u201d See\nMcClure v.

A decade after McClure, the Fifth Circuit made\nclear that formal ordination was not necessary for the\n\u201cministerial\u201d exception to apply. The court held that the\nmembers of the faculty at a Baptist seminary were covered\nby the exception because of their religious function in\nconveying church doctrine, even though some of them\nwere not ordained ministers. See EEOC v. Southwestern\nBaptist Theological Seminary, 651 F. 2d 277 (1981).\n   The functional consensus has held up over time, with\nthe D. C. Circuit recognizing that \u201c[t]he ministerial excep-\ntion has not been limited to members of the clergy.\u201d\nEEOC v. Catholic Univ., 83 F. 3d 455, 461 (1996).

The court noted that\n\u201cmembers of the Canon Law Faculty perform the vital\nfunction of instructing those who will in turn interpret,\nimplement, and teach the law governing the Roman Cath-\nolic Church and the administration of its sacraments.\nAlthough Sister McDonough is not a priest, she is a mem-\nber of a religious order who sought a tenured professorship\nin a field that is of fundamental importance to the spiritu-\nal mission of her Church.\u201d Id., at 464.

The\nCourt\u2019s opinion today should not be read to upset this\nconsensus.\n                             B\n  The ministerial exception applies to respondent because,\nas the Court notes, she played a substantial role in \u201ccon-\nveying the Church\u2019s message and carrying out its mis-\nsion.\u201d Ante, at 17. She taught religion to her students\nfour days a week and took them to chapel on the fifth day.\nShe led them in daily devotional exercises, and led them in\nprayer three times a day. She also alternated with the\nother teachers in planning and leading worship services at\n8    HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC \n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\n\nthe school chapel, choosing liturgies, hymns, and read-\nings, and composing and delivering a message based on\nScripture.\n   It makes no difference that respondent also taught\nsecular subjects. While a purely secular teacher would not\nqualify for the \u201cministerial\u201d exception, the constitutional\nprotection of religious teachers is not somehow diminished\nwhen they take on secular functions in addition to their\nreligious ones. What matters is that respondent played an\nimportant role as an instrument of her church\u2019s religious\nmessage and as a leader of its worship activities. Because\nof these important religious functions, Hosanna-Tabor had\nthe right to decide for itself whether respondent was reli-\ngiously qualified to remain in her office.\n   Hosanna-Tabor discharged respondent because she\nthreatened to file suit against the church in a civil court.\nThis threat contravened the Lutheran doctrine that dis-\nputes among Christians should be resolved internally\nwithout resort to the civil court system and all the legal\nwrangling it entails.5 In Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s view, respond-\nent\u2019s disregard for this doctrine compromised her religious\nfunction, disqualifying her from serving effectively as a\nvoice for the church\u2019s faith. Respondent does not dispute\nthat the Lutheran Church subscribes to a doctrine of\ninternal dispute resolution, but she argues that this was a\nmere pretext for her firing, which was really done for\nnonreligious reasons.\n   For civil courts to engage in the pretext inquiry that\nrespondent and the Solicitor General urge us to sanction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 See The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, Commission on Theol-\n\nogy and Church Relations, 1 Corinthians 6:1\u201311: An Exegetical Study,\np. 10 (Apr. 1991) (stating that instead of suing each other, Christians\nshould seek \u201can amicable settlement of differences by means of a\ndecision by fellow Christians\u201d).

In order to probe the real reason for respondent\u2019s\nfiring, a civil court\u2014and perhaps a jury\u2014would be re-\nquired to make a judgment about church doctrine. The\ncredibility of Hosanna-Tabor\u2019s asserted reason for termi-\nnating respondent\u2019s employment could not be assessed\nwithout taking into account both the importance that the\nLutheran Church attaches to the doctrine of internal\ndispute resolution and the degree to which that tenet\ncompromised respondent\u2019s religious function. If it could be\nshown that this belief is an obscure and minor part of\nLutheran doctrine, it would be much more plausible for\nrespondent to argue that this doctrine was not the real\nreason for her firing. If, on the other hand, the doctrine is\na central and universally known tenet of Lutheranism,\nthen the church\u2019s asserted reason for her discharge would\nseem much more likely to be nonpretextual. But whatever\nthe truth of the matter might be, the mere adjudication of\nsuch questions would pose grave problems for religious\nautonomy: It would require calling witnesses to testify\nabout the importance and priority of the religious doctrine\nin question, with a civil factfinder sitting in ultimate\njudgment of what the accused church really believes,\nand how important that belief is to the church\u2019s overall\nmission.\n   At oral argument, both respondent and the United\nStates acknowledged that a pretext inquiry would some-\ntimes be prohibited by principles of religious autonomy,\nand both conceded that a Roman Catholic priest who is\ndismissed for getting married could not sue the church\nand claim that his dismissal was actually based on a\nground forbidden by the federal antidiscrimination laws.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339, 50. But there is no principled\nbasis for proscribing a pretext inquiry in such a case while\npermitting it in a case like the one now before us. The\n10   HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH\n                 AND SCHOOL v. EEOC\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\nRoman Catholic Church\u2019s insistence on clerical celibacy\nmay be much better known than the Lutheran Church\u2019s\ndoctrine of internal dispute resolution, but popular famili-\narity with a religious doctrine cannot be the determinative\nfactor.\n   What matters in the present case is that Hosanna-Tabor\nbelieves that the religious function that respondent per-\nformed made it essential that she abide by the doctrine of\ninternal dispute resolution; and the civil courts are in no\nposition to second-guess that assessment. This conclusion\nrests not on respondent\u2019s ordination status or her formal\ntitle, but rather on her functional status as the type of\nemployee that a church must be free to appoint or dismiss\nin order to exercise the religious liberty that the First\nAmendment guarantees.\n</pre>",
