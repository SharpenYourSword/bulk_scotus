ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 10\u20131195. Argued November 28, 2011\u2014Decided January 18, 2012\nConsumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology\u2014for exam-\n  ple, computerized calls to private homes\u2014prompted Congress to pass\n  the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 47\n  U. S. C. \u00a7227. Congress determined that federal legislation was\n  needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\n  state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act bans cer-\n  tain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regula-\n  tions. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited\n  practices and recover damages on their residents\u2019 behalf, 47 U. S. C.\n  A. \u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these\n  state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,\n  \u00a7227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for viola-\n  tions of the Act or regulations \u201cin an appropriate court of [a] State,\u201d\n  \u201cif [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of\n  court of [that] State.\u201d 47 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n     Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,\n  alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the\n  TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or\n  prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims\u2019s cellular phone without\n  his consent. Mims invoked the court\u2019s \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction,\n  i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims \u201carising under the . . . laws . . .\n  of the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The District Court, affirmed\n  by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint for want of sub-\n  ject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested juris-\n  diction over private actions exclusively in state courts.\nHeld: The TCPA\u2019s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does\n not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction\n2            MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7\u201318.\n       (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the\n    rules of decision, Mims\u2019s TCPA claim, in \u00a71331\u2019s words, plainly\n    \u201caris[es] under\u201d the \u201claws . . . of the United States.\u201d Arrow agrees\n    that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress\n    vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in\n    state courts. In cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law, there is a pre-\n    sumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if \u201cCon-\n    gress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a partic-\n    ular federal claim.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458\u2013459. Arrow\n    acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that \u00a71331 creates no\n    converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,\n    Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces\n    \u00a71331, an earlier, more general prescription.\n       Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that dis-\n    trict courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under \u00a71331 when\n    federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the sub-\n    stantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal\n    courts of their \u00a71331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.\n    Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,\n    the District Court retains \u00a71331 jurisdiction over Mims\u2019s complaint\n    unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-\n    court adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Arrow\u2019s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress\n    eliminated \u00a71331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47\n    U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s language may be state-court oriented, but \u201cthe\n    grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the ju-\n    risdiction is to be exclusive,\u201d United States v. Bank of New York &\n    Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s permissive lan-\n    guage makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports\n    to oust federal courts of their \u00a71331 jurisdiction. The provision does\n    not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action \u201conly\u201d or\n    \u201cexclusively\u201d in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2)\n    (Supp. 2011) vests \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over state-initiated TCPA\n    suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)\u2019s exclusivity prescription\n    \u201creinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s] silence . . .\n    leaves the jurisdictional grant of \u00a71331 untouched. For where other-\n    wise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was exclud-\n    ed expressly.\u201d Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.\n       Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private\n    action \u201cin an appropriate [state] court,\u201d \u00a7227(b)(3), if it did not mean\n    to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have con-\n    current jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as\n    already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  risdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state\n  authorities, see 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simp-\n  ly have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was\n  also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that pri-\n  vate actions may be brought in state court \u201cif otherwise permitted by\n  the laws or rules of court of [the] State,\u201d 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3), Con-\n  gress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to de-\n  cide whether to entertain TCPA claims.\n     Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over\n  \u00a7227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress\u2019 objective of enabling\n  States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded\n  state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 should\n  hold firm against \u201cmere implication flowing from subsequent legisla-\n  tion.\u201d Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424\n  U. S. 800, 808, 809, n. 15. Furthermore, had Congress sought only to\n  fill a gap in the States\u2019 enforcement capabilities, it could have provid-\n  ed that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be\n  subject to the receiving State\u2019s laws. Instead, Congress enacted de-\n  tailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a\n  regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.\n     Arrow\u2019s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA\u2019s\n  sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court\n  jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3) is intend-\n  ed to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if\n  Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to pro-\n  ceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this\n  Court\u2019s judgment on \u00a71331\u2019s compass. Arrow\u2019s arguments that fed-\n  eral courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or\n  that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-\n  court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.\n  Pp. 10\u201318.\n421 Fed.

MIMS, PETITIONER v. ARROW \n\n           FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 18, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns enforcement, through private suits,\nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA\nor Act), 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227. Voluminous consumer com-\nplaints about abuses of telephone technology\u2014for exam-\nple, computerized calls dispatched to private homes\u2014\nprompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress de-\ntermined that federal legislation was needed because\ntelemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\nstate-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act\nbans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)\nto prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes\nStates to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices\nand to recover damages on their residents\u2019 behalf. The\nCommission must be notified of such suits and may inter-\nvene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA\nsuits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.\ndistrict courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by\nprivate parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA\nor of the Commission\u2019s implementing regulations.\n2         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple\nviolations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Ser-\nvices, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced\nan action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked\nthe court\u2019s \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction, i.e., its authority\nto adjudicate claims \u201carising under the . . . laws . . . of\nthe United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The District Court,\naffirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit, dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint for want of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress\u2019 speci-\nfication, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek\nredress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission\u2019s\nregulations thereunder) \u201cin an appropriate court of [a]\nState,\u201d \u201cif [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the\nlaws or rules of court of [that] State.\u201d 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n   The question presented is whether Congress\u2019 provision\nfor private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state\ncourts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long\nrecognized that \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates\nthe cause of action.\u201d American Well Works Co. v. Layne &\nBowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the\nTCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims\nhas brought and supplies the substantive rules that will\ngovern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into\nthe TCPA\u2019s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts\nany barrier to the U. S. district courts\u2019 exercise of the\ngeneral federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed\nsince 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71, 18 Stat. 470; 13D\nC. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a73561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and\nstate courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits\narising under the TCPA.\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings\nrelevant here. \u201cUnrestricted telemarketing,\u201d Congress\ndetermined, \u201ccan be an intrusive invasion of privacy.\u201d\nTCPA, 105 Stat. 2394, note following 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227\n(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In particular, Congress reported, \u201c[m]any consumers\nare outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance\n[telemarketing] calls to their homes.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201c[A]utomated or prerecorded\ntelephone calls\u201d made to private residences, Congress\nfound, were rightly regarded by recipients as \u201can invasion\nof privacy.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAlthough over half the States had enacted statutes re-\nstricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal\nlaw was needed because \u201ctelemarketers [could] evade\n[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.\nNo. 102\u2013178, p. 3 (1991) (\u201c[B]ecause States do not have\njurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have\nexpressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .\u201d).1\n   Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-\ncipally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it\nunlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system\nor an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the\nprior express consent of the called party, to call any emer-\ngency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular\ntelephone, or other service for which the receiver is\ncharged for the call. See 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(A). Sec-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Fed-\n\neral Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to\nregulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the\nStates authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications. See\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 360, 369\u2013370\n(1986).\n4          MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded\nvoice messages to call residential telephone lines with-\nout prior express consent. \u00a7227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act\nproscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax ma-\nchines. \u00a7227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic\ntelephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a\nbusiness\u2019 telephone lines simultaneously. \u00a7227(b)(1)(D).2\n   The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar-\ntificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,\n\u00a7227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from\nthe law\u2019s requirements, \u00a7\u00a7227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also\ndirects the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the\nprivacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly\nthrough the creation of a national \u201cdo not call\u201d system.\n\u00a7227(c).3\n   Congress provided complementary means of enforcing\nthe Act. State Attorneys General may \u201cbring a civil action\non behalf of [State] residents,\u201d if the Attorney General\n\u201chas reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in\na pattern or practice\u201d of violating the TCPA or FCC regu-\nlations thereunder. 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).\n\u201cThe district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive\njurisdiction\u201d over all TCPA actions brought by State At-\ntorneys General. \u00a7227(g)(2).

See\nTruth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111\u2013331, 124 Stat. 3572. This\nlegislation inserted a new subsection (e) into 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227 and\nredesignated the former subsections (e), (f), and (g) as subsections (f),\n(g), and (h), respectively. Ibid.

He sought declaratory\nrelief, a permanent injunction, and damages. Id., at 18\u2013\n19.\n   The District Court held that it lacked subject-matter\njurisdiction over Mims\u2019s TCPA claim. Under Eleventh\nCircuit precedent, the District Court explained, federal-\nquestion jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 was unavail-\nable \u201cbecause Congress vested jurisdiction over [private\nactions under] the TCPA exclusively in state courts.\u201d Civ.\nNo. 09\u201322347 (SD Fla., Apr. 1, 2010), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n4a\u20135a (citing Nicholson v.

Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U. S.\n375, 377 (1994), in the main \u201chave no more right to decline\nthe exercise of jurisdiction which is given, then to usurp\nthat which is not given.\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264\n(1821). Congress granted federal courts general federal-\nquestion jurisdiction in 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71,\n18 Stat. 470.6 As now codified, the law provides: \u201cThe\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil\nactions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of\nthe United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The statute origi-\nnally included an amount-in-controversy requirement, set\nat $500. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71, 18 Stat. 470. Recog-\nnizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims,\nlarge or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980\neliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in\nfederal-question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal\nQuestion Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat.\n2369 (amending 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331). See also H. R. Rep.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Congress had previously granted general federal-question jurisdic-\n\ntion to federal courts, but the grant was short lived. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 464, n. 14 (1974) (describing Midnight Judges\nAct of 1801, \u00a711, 2 Stat. 92, repealed by Act of Mar. 8, 1802, \u00a71, 2 Stat.\n132).\n8           MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 96\u20131461, p. 1 (1980).7 Apart from deletion of the\namount-in-controversy requirement, the general federal-\nquestion provision has remained essentially unchanged\nsince 1875. See 13D Wright & Miller 163.\n    Because federal law creates the right of action and\nprovides the rules of decision, Mims\u2019s TCPA claim, in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s words, plainly \u201caris[es] under\u201d the \u201claws\n. . . of the United States.\u201d As already noted, supra, at 2,\n\u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of\naction.\u201d American Well Works, 241 U. S., at 260. Al-\nthough courts have described this formulation as \u201cmore\nuseful for inclusion than for . . . exclusion,\u201d Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 809, n. 5\n(1986) (quoting T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d 823,\n827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federal-\nly created claim for relief is generally a \u201csufficient con-\ndition for federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d Grable & Sons\nMetal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545\nU. S. 308, 317 (2005).8\n    Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested\nexclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA ac-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 At the time it was repealed, the amount-in-controversy requirement\n\nin federal-question cases had reached $10,000. See Act of July 25,\n1958, 72 Stat. 415. Currently, the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases must exceed $75,000. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\n  8 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices\n\nto ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.\nRutter, 177 U. S. 505 (1900), discussed in R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.\nMeltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System, 784\u2013785 (6th ed. 2009). In Shoshone Mining, we held\nthat a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law\nfor jurisdictional purposes because \u201cthe right of possession\u201d in contro-\nversy could be determined by \u201clocal rules or customs, or state statutes,\u201d\n177 U. S., at 509, or \u201cmay present simply a question of fact,\u201d id., at 510.\nHere, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and\ndesignates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder\nsupply the governing substantive law.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntions in state courts. In cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law,\nwe note, there is a \u201cdeeply rooted presumption in favor of\nconcurrent state court jurisdiction,\u201d rebuttable if \u201cCon-\ngress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction\nover a particular federal claim.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493\nU. S. 455, 458\u2013459 (1990). E.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a71333 (\u201cThe\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of\nthe courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty\nor maritime jurisdiction . . . .\u201d). The presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can\nbe overcome \u201cby an explicit statutory directive, by unmis-\ntakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear\nincompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and feder-\nal interests.\u201d Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453\nU. S. 473, 478 (1981).\n   Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331 creates no converse presumption in favor\nof federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the\nTCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces \u00a71331, an\nearlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n28\u201329; Brief for Respondent 31.\n   Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away\nso easily. As stated earlier, see supra, at 8, when federal\nlaw creates a private right of action and furnishes the\nsubstantive rules of decision, the claim arises under feder-\nal law, and district courts possess federal-question juris-\ndiction under \u00a71331.9 That principle endures unless\nCongress divests federal courts of their \u00a71331 adjudica-\ntory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642 (2002) (Nothing in 47\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Even when a right of action is created by state law, if the claim re-\n\nquires resolution of significant issues of federal law, the case may arise\nunder federal law for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 purposes. See Grable & Sons\nMetal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 312\n(2005).\n10        MIMS v.

That\nmay be, but \u201c[i]t is a general rule that the grant of juris-\ndiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the juris-\ndiction is to be exclusive.\u201d United States v.

S. 463, 479 (1936).\n   Nothing in the permissive language of \u00a7227(b)(3) makes\nstate-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to\noust federal courts of their 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 jurisdiction\nover federal claims. See, e.g., Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at\n643 (\u201c[N]othing in 47 U. S. C. \u00a7252(e)(6) purports to strip\n[\u00a71331] jurisdiction.\u201d). Cf. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v.\nDonnelly, 494 U.

Congress may indeed provide a track for a federal\nclaim exclusive of \u00a71331. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(h)\n(\u201cNo action . . . shall be brought under [\u00a71331] to recover\non any claim arising under [Title II of the Social Security\nAct].\u201d); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 756\u2013757 (1975).\nCongress has done nothing of that sort here, however.\n   Title 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3) does not state that a private\nplaintiff may bring an action under the TCPA \u201conly\u201d in\nstate court, or \u201cexclusively\u201d in state court. The absence of\nsuch a statement contrasts with the Act\u2019s instruction on\nsuits instituted by State Attorneys General. As earlier\nnoted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp.\n2011) vests \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over [such] actions\u201d\nin \u201c[t]he district courts of the United States.\u201d10 Section\n227(g)(2)\u2019s exclusivity prescription \u201creinforce[s] the conclu-\nsion that [47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s] silence . . . leaves the\njurisdictional grant of \u00a71331 untouched. For where oth-\nerwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it\nwas excluded expressly.\u201d Verizon Md., 535 U.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee ErieNet, 156 F. 3d, at 522 (Alito, J., dissenting) (\u201c[47\nU. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011)] reveals that, while\ndrafting the TCPA, Congress knew full well how to grant\nexclusive jurisdiction with mandatory language. The most\nnatural interpretation of Congress\u2019 failure to use similar\nlanguage in [47 U. S. C. \u00a7]227(b)(3) is that Congress did\nnot intend to grant exclusive jurisdiction in that section.\u201d);\nBrill, 427 F. 3d, at 451 (\u201c[47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp.\n2011)] is explicit about exclusivity, while [47 U. S. C.]\n\u00a7227(b)(3) is not; the natural inference is that the state\nforum mentioned in \u00a7227(b)(3) is optional rather than\nmandatory.\u201d).11\n  Arrow urges that Congress would have had no reason to\nprovide for a private action \u201cin an appropriate [state]\ncourt,\u201d \u00a7227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state\nforum exclusive. Had Congress said nothing at all about\nbringing private TCPA claims in state courts, Arrow ob-\nserves, those courts would nevertheless have concurrent\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 For TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General, or\n\n\u201can[other] official or agency designated by a State,\u201d 47 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), Arrow points out, Congress specifically ad-\ndressed venue, service of process, \u00a7227(g)(4), and potential conflicts\nbetween federal and state enforcement efforts, \u00a7227(g)(7). No similar\nprescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7227(b)(3), for this obvious reason:\n  \u201c[As] the general rules governing venue and service of process in the\ndistrict courts are well established, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71391(b); Fed. Rules\nCiv. Proc. 4, 4.1, there was no need for Congress to reiterate them in\nsection 227(b)(3). The fact that venue and service of process are dis-\ncussed in [47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments\nto the general rules in the former section and not the latter. As for the\nconflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g) (Supp.\n2011)] but not [47 U. S. C. \u00a7]227(b)(3), it is hardly surprising that\nCongress would be concerned about agency conflicts in the section of\nthe TCPA dealing with official state enforcement efforts but not in the\nsection governing private lawsuits.\u201d ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc.,\n156 F. 3d 513, 523 (CA3 1998) (Alito, J., dissenting).\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

True enough, but Con-\ngress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement\nactions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g) (Supp.\n2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively\ncompetent in such cases, \u00a7227(g)(2). Congress may simply\nhave wanted to avoid any argument that in private ac-\ntions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General,\n\u201cfederal jurisdiction is exclusive.\u201d Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451\n(emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 494 U. S. 820\n(holding, after 26 years of litigation, that claims under the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 may be resolved in state as well\nas federal courts) and Tafflin, 493 U. S. 455 (holding, after\n20 years of litigation, that claims under RICO may be\nresolved in state as well as federal courts)). Moreover, by\nproviding that private actions may be brought in state\ncourt \u201cif otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court\nof [the] State,\u201d 47 U. S.

See Brief for Respondent\n16 (Congress \u201cle[ft] States free to decide what TCPA\nclaims to allow.\u201d).12\n   Making state-court jurisdiction over \u00a7227(b)(3) claims\nexclusive, Arrow further asserts, \u201cfits hand in glove with\n[Congress\u2019] objective\u201d: enabling States to control telemar-\nketers whose interstate operations evaded state law.

Without\nthe \u201cif otherwise permitted\u201d language, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3), there is\nlittle doubt that state courts would be obliged to hear TCPA claims.\nSee Testa v. Katt, 330 U.

S. 257, 262 (1897)).\n   We are not persuaded, moreover, that Congress sought\nonly to fill a gap in the States\u2019 enforcement capabilities.\nHad Congress so limited its sights, it could have passed\na statute providing that out-of-state telemarketing calls\ndirected into a State would be subject to the laws of the\nreceiving State. Congress did not enact such a law. In-\nstead, it enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive\nprescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime admin-\nistered by a federal agency. See 47 U. S.

They wake us up in the morning; they in-\n     terrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and\n     elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to\n     rip the telephone right out of the wall.\n        .            .          .          .           .\n        \u201cThe substitute bill contains a private right-of-\n     action provision that will make it easier for consumers\n     to recover damages from receiving these computerized\n     calls. The provision would allow consumers to bring\n     an action in State court against any entity that vio-\n     lates the bill. The bill does not, because of constitu-\n     tional constraints, dictate to the States which court in\n     each State shall be the proper venue for such an ac-\n     tion, as this is a matter for State legislators to deter-\n     mine. Nevertheless, it is my hope that States will\n     make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring\n     such actions, preferably in small claims court. . . .\n        \u201cSmall claims court or a similar court would allow\n     the consumer to appear before the court without an\n     attorney. The amount of damages in this legislation\n     is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemar-\n     keter. However, it would defeat the purposes of the\n     bill if the attorneys\u2019 costs to consumers of bringing an\n     action were greater than the potential damages. I\n     thus expect that the States will act reasonably in\n     permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this\n     bill.\u201d 137 Cong.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the views of a single legislator, even a bill\u2019s spon-\nsor, are not controlling. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n\nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980). Second,\nSenator Hollings did not mention federal-court jurisdiction\nor otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3) is intend-\ned to divest federal courts of authority to hear TCPA\nclaims. Hollings no doubt believed that mine-run TCPA\nclaims would be pursued most expeditiously in state\nsmall-claims court.14 But one cannot glean from his\nstatement any expectation that those courts, or state\ncourts generally, would have exclusive jurisdiction over\nprivate actions alleging violations of the Act or of the\nFCC\u2019s implementing regulations. Third, even if we agreed\nwith Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA\nactions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other\nsupporters shared his view, that expectation would not\ncontrol our judgment on 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s compass. Cf.\nYellow Freight, 494 U. S., at 826 (\u201cpersuasive showing\nthat most legislators, judges, and administrators . . .\ninvolved in the enactment, amendment, enforcement, and\ninterpretation of Title VII expected that such litiga-\ntion would be processed exclusively in federal courts\u201d\ndid not overcome presumption of concurrent state-court\njurisdiction).\n   Among its arguments for state-court exclusivity, Arrow\nraises a concern about the impact on federal courts were\nwe to uphold \u00a71331 jurisdiction over private actions under\nthe TCPA. \u201c[G]iven the enormous volume of telecommuni-\ncations presenting potential claims,\u201d Arrow projects, fed-\neral courts could be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 The complaint in this very case, we note, could not have been\n\nbrought in small-claims court. Mims alleged some 12 calls, and sought\ntreble damages ($1,500) for each. See App. 9\u201314; Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.\nThe amount he sought to recover far exceeded the $5,000 ceiling on\nclaims a Florida small-claims court can adjudicate. See Fla.

S. C. \u00a71441.\u201d Id., at 22\u201323. Indeed, Arrow suggests,\ndefendants could use removal as a mechanism to force\nsmall-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than\n\u201cfigh[t] it out\u201d in the \u201cmore expensive federal forum.\u201d Id.,\nat 23.\n   Arrow\u2019s floodgates argument assumes \u201ca shocking de-\ngree of noncompliance\u201d with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and\nseems to us more imaginary than real. The current fed-\neral district court civil filing fee is $350. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71914(a). How likely is it that a party would bring a $500\nclaim in, or remove a $500 claim to, federal court? Lexis\nand Westlaw searches turned up 65 TCPA claims removed\nto federal district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wiscon-\nsin since the Seventh Circuit held, in October 2005, that\nthe Act does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on state\ncourts. All 65 cases were class actions, not individual\ncases removed from small-claims court.15 There were also\n26 private TCPA claims brought initially in federal district\ncourts; of those, 24 were class actions.\n                            IV\n  Nothing in the text, structure, purpose, or legislative\nhistory of the TCPA calls for displacement of the federal-\nquestion jurisdiction U.

Argued November 28, 2011\u2014Decided January 18, 2012\nConsumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology\u2014for exam-\n  ple, computerized calls to private homes\u2014prompted Congress to pass\n  the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 47\n  U. S. C. \u00a7227. Congress determined that federal legislation was\n  needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\n  state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act bans cer-\n  tain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regula-\n  tions. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited\n  practices and recover damages on their residents\u2019 behalf, 47 U. S. C.\n  A. \u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these\n  state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,\n  \u00a7227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for viola-\n  tions of the Act or regulations \u201cin an appropriate court of [a] State,\u201d\n  \u201cif [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of\n  court of [that] State.\u201d 47 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n     Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,\n  alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the\n  TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or\n  prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims\u2019s cellular phone without\n  his consent. Mims invoked the court\u2019s \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction,\n  i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims \u201carising under the . . . laws . . .\n  of the United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The District Court, affirmed\n  by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint for want of sub-\n  ject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested juris-\n  diction over private actions exclusively in state courts.\nHeld: The TCPA\u2019s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does\n not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction\n2            MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7\u201318.\n       (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the\n    rules of decision, Mims\u2019s TCPA claim, in \u00a71331\u2019s words, plainly\n    \u201caris[es] under\u201d the \u201claws . . . of the United States.\u201d Arrow agrees\n    that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress\n    vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in\n    state courts. In cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law, there is a pre-\n    sumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if \u201cCon-\n    gress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a partic-\n    ular federal claim.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458\u2013459. Arrow\n    acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that \u00a71331 creates no\n    converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,\n    Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces\n    \u00a71331, an earlier, more general prescription.\n       Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that dis-\n    trict courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under \u00a71331 when\n    federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the sub-\n    stantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal\n    courts of their \u00a71331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.\n    Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,\n    the District Court retains \u00a71331 jurisdiction over Mims\u2019s complaint\n    unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-\n    court adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Arrow\u2019s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress\n    eliminated \u00a71331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47\n    U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s language may be state-court oriented, but \u201cthe\n    grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the ju-\n    risdiction is to be exclusive,\u201d United States v. Bank of New York &\n    Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s permissive lan-\n    guage makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports\n    to oust federal courts of their \u00a71331 jurisdiction. The provision does\n    not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action \u201conly\u201d or\n    \u201cexclusively\u201d in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2)\n    (Supp. 2011) vests \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over state-initiated TCPA\n    suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)\u2019s exclusivity prescription\n    \u201creinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3)\u2019s] silence . . .\n    leaves the jurisdictional grant of \u00a71331 untouched. For where other-\n    wise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was exclud-\n    ed expressly.\u201d Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.\n       Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private\n    action \u201cin an appropriate [state] court,\u201d \u00a7227(b)(3), if it did not mean\n    to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have con-\n    current jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all.

A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simp-\n  ly have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was\n  also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that pri-\n  vate actions may be brought in state court \u201cif otherwise permitted by\n  the laws or rules of court of [the] State,\u201d 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3), Con-\n  gress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to de-\n  cide whether to entertain TCPA claims.\n     Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over\n  \u00a7227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress\u2019 objective of enabling\n  States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded\n  state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 should\n  hold firm against \u201cmere implication flowing from subsequent legisla-\n  tion.\u201d Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424\n  U. S. 800, 808, 809, n. 15. Furthermore, had Congress sought only to\n  fill a gap in the States\u2019 enforcement capabilities, it could have provid-\n  ed that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be\n  subject to the receiving State\u2019s laws. Instead, Congress enacted de-\n  tailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a\n  regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.\n     Arrow\u2019s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA\u2019s\n  sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court\n  jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3) is intend-\n  ed to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if\n  Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to pro-\n  ceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this\n  Court\u2019s judgment on \u00a71331\u2019s compass. Arrow\u2019s arguments that fed-\n  eral courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or\n  that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-\n  court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.\n  Pp. 10\u201318.\n421 Fed.

S. C. \u00a7227. Voluminous consumer com-\nplaints about abuses of telephone technology\u2014for exam-\nple, computerized calls dispatched to private homes\u2014\nprompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress de-\ntermined that federal legislation was needed because\ntelemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\nstate-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act\nbans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)\nto prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes\nStates to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices\nand to recover damages on their residents\u2019 behalf. The\nCommission must be notified of such suits and may inter-\nvene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA\nsuits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.\ndistrict courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by\nprivate parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA\nor of the Commission\u2019s implementing regulations.\n2         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple\nviolations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Ser-\nvices, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced\nan action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked\nthe court\u2019s \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction, i.e., its authority\nto adjudicate claims \u201carising under the . . . laws . . . of\nthe United States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The District Court,\naffirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit, dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint for want of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress\u2019 speci-\nfication, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek\nredress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission\u2019s\nregulations thereunder) \u201cin an appropriate court of [a]\nState,\u201d \u201cif [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the\nlaws or rules of court of [that] State.\u201d 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n   The question presented is whether Congress\u2019 provision\nfor private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state\ncourts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long\nrecognized that \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates\nthe cause of action.\u201d American Well Works Co. v. Layne &\nBowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the\nTCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims\nhas brought and supplies the substantive rules that will\ngovern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into\nthe TCPA\u2019s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts\nany barrier to the U. S. district courts\u2019 exercise of the\ngeneral federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed\nsince 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71, 18 Stat. 470; 13D\nC. Wright, A. Miller, E.

S. C. \u00a7227\n(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In particular, Congress reported, \u201c[m]any consumers\nare outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance\n[telemarketing] calls to their homes.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201c[A]utomated or prerecorded\ntelephone calls\u201d made to private residences, Congress\nfound, were rightly regarded by recipients as \u201can invasion\nof privacy.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAlthough over half the States had enacted statutes re-\nstricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal\nlaw was needed because \u201ctelemarketers [could] evade\n[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.\nNo. 102\u2013178, p. 3 (1991) (\u201c[B]ecause States do not have\njurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have\nexpressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .\u201d).1\n   Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-\ncipally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it\nunlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system\nor an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the\nprior express consent of the called party, to call any emer-\ngency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular\ntelephone, or other service for which the receiver is\ncharged for the call. See 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(A). Sec-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Fed-\n\neral Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to\nregulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the\nStates authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications. See\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 360, 369\u2013370\n(1986).\n4          MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded\nvoice messages to call residential telephone lines with-\nout prior express consent. \u00a7227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act\nproscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax ma-\nchines. \u00a7227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic\ntelephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a\nbusiness\u2019 telephone lines simultaneously. \u00a7227(b)(1)(D).2\n   The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar-\ntificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,\n\u00a7227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from\nthe law\u2019s requirements, \u00a7\u00a7227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also\ndirects the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the\nprivacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly\nthrough the creation of a national \u201cdo not call\u201d system.\n\u00a7227(c).3\n   Congress provided complementary means of enforcing\nthe Act. State Attorneys General may \u201cbring a civil action\non behalf of [State] residents,\u201d if the Attorney General\n\u201chas reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in\na pattern or practice\u201d of violating the TCPA or FCC regu-\nlations thereunder. 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).\n\u201cThe district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive\njurisdiction\u201d over all TCPA actions brought by State At-\ntorneys General. \u00a7227(g)(2).

See\nTruth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111\u2013331, 124 Stat. 3572. This\nlegislation inserted a new subsection (e) into 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227 and\nredesignated the former subsections (e), (f), and (g) as subsections (f),\n(g), and (h), respectively. Ibid.

Congress granted federal courts general federal-\nquestion jurisdiction in 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71,\n18 Stat. 470.6 As now codified, the law provides: \u201cThe\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil\nactions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of\nthe United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. The statute origi-\nnally included an amount-in-controversy requirement, set\nat $500. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, \u00a71, 18 Stat. 470. Recog-\nnizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims,\nlarge or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980\neliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in\nfederal-question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal\nQuestion Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat.\n2369 (amending 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331). See also H. R. Rep.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Congress had previously granted general federal-question jurisdic-\n\ntion to federal courts, but the grant was short lived. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 464, n. 14 (1974) (describing Midnight Judges\nAct of 1801, \u00a711, 2 Stat. 92, repealed by Act of Mar. 8, 1802, \u00a71, 2 Stat.\n132).\n8           MIMS v.

See 13D Wright & Miller 163.\n    Because federal law creates the right of action and\nprovides the rules of decision, Mims\u2019s TCPA claim, in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s words, plainly \u201caris[es] under\u201d the \u201claws\n. . . of the United States.\u201d As already noted, supra, at 2,\n\u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of\naction.\u201d American Well Works, 241 U.

Eliscu, 339 F. 2d 823,\n827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federal-\nly created claim for relief is generally a \u201csufficient con-\ndition for federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d Grable & Sons\nMetal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545\nU. S. 308, 317 (2005).8\n    Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested\nexclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA ac-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 At the time it was repealed, the amount-in-controversy requirement\n\nin federal-question cases had reached $10,000. See Act of July 25,\n1958, 72 Stat. 415. Currently, the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases must exceed $75,000. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\n  8 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices\n\nto ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.\nRutter, 177 U. S. 505 (1900), discussed in R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.\nMeltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System, 784\u2013785 (6th ed. 2009). In Shoshone Mining, we held\nthat a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law\nfor jurisdictional purposes because \u201cthe right of possession\u201d in contro-\nversy could be determined by \u201clocal rules or customs, or state statutes,\u201d\n177 U. S., at 509, or \u201cmay present simply a question of fact,\u201d id., at 510.\nHere, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and\ndesignates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder\nsupply the governing substantive law.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntions in state courts. In cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law,\nwe note, there is a \u201cdeeply rooted presumption in favor of\nconcurrent state court jurisdiction,\u201d rebuttable if \u201cCon-\ngress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction\nover a particular federal claim.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493\nU. S. 455, 458\u2013459 (1990). E.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a71333 (\u201cThe\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of\nthe courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty\nor maritime jurisdiction . . . .\u201d). The presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can\nbe overcome \u201cby an explicit statutory directive, by unmis-\ntakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear\nincompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and feder-\nal interests.\u201d Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453\nU. S. 473, 478 (1981).\n   Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331 creates no converse presumption in favor\nof federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the\nTCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces \u00a71331, an\nearlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n28\u201329; Brief for Respondent 31.\n   Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away\nso easily. As stated earlier, see supra, at 8, when federal\nlaw creates a private right of action and furnishes the\nsubstantive rules of decision, the claim arises under feder-\nal law, and district courts possess federal-question juris-\ndiction under \u00a71331.9 That principle endures unless\nCongress divests federal courts of their \u00a71331 adjudica-\ntory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv.\nComm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642 (2002) (Nothing in 47\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Even when a right of action is created by state law, if the claim re-\n\nquires resolution of significant issues of federal law, the case may arise\nunder federal law for 28 U.

The absence of\nsuch a statement contrasts with the Act\u2019s instruction on\nsuits instituted by State Attorneys General. As earlier\nnoted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee ErieNet, 156 F. 3d, at 522 (Alito, J., dissenting) (\u201c[47\nU. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011)] reveals that, while\ndrafting the TCPA, Congress knew full well how to grant\nexclusive jurisdiction with mandatory language. The most\nnatural interpretation of Congress\u2019 failure to use similar\nlanguage in [47 U. S. C. \u00a7]227(b)(3) is that Congress did\nnot intend to grant exclusive jurisdiction in that section.\u201d);\nBrill, 427 F. 3d, at 451 (\u201c[47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(2) (Supp.\n2011)] is explicit about exclusivity, while [47 U. S. C.]\n\u00a7227(b)(3) is not; the natural inference is that the state\nforum mentioned in \u00a7227(b)(3) is optional rather than\nmandatory.\u201d).11\n  Arrow urges that Congress would have had no reason to\nprovide for a private action \u201cin an appropriate [state]\ncourt,\u201d \u00a7227(b)(3), if it did not mean to make the state\nforum exclusive. Had Congress said nothing at all about\nbringing private TCPA claims in state courts, Arrow ob-\nserves, those courts would nevertheless have concurrent\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 For TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General, or\n\n\u201can[other] official or agency designated by a State,\u201d 47 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), Arrow points out, Congress specifically ad-\ndressed venue, service of process, \u00a7227(g)(4), and potential conflicts\nbetween federal and state enforcement efforts, \u00a7227(g)(7). No similar\nprescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7227(b)(3), for this obvious reason:\n  \u201c[As] the general rules governing venue and service of process in the\ndistrict courts are well established, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71391(b); Fed. Rules\nCiv. Proc. 4, 4.1, there was no need for Congress to reiterate them in\nsection 227(b)(3). The fact that venue and service of process are dis-\ncussed in [47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments\nto the general rules in the former section and not the latter. As for the\nconflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g) (Supp.\n2011)] but not [47 U. S. C. \u00a7]227(b)(3), it is hardly surprising that\nCongress would be concerned about agency conflicts in the section of\nthe TCPA dealing with official state enforcement efforts but not in the\nsection governing private lawsuits.\u201d ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc.,\n156 F. 3d 513, 523 (CA3 1998) (Alito, J., dissenting).\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

True enough, but Con-\ngress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement\nactions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. \u00a7227(g) (Supp.\n2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively\ncompetent in such cases, \u00a7227(g)(2). Congress may simply\nhave wanted to avoid any argument that in private ac-\ntions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General,\n\u201cfederal jurisdiction is exclusive.\u201d Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451\n(emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 494 U.

Without\nthe \u201cif otherwise permitted\u201d language, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3), there is\nlittle doubt that state courts would be obliged to hear TCPA claims.\nSee Testa v. Katt, 330 U.

Congress did not enact such a law. In-\nstead, it enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive\nprescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime admin-\nistered by a federal agency. See 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227. TCPA\nliability thus depends on violation of a federal statutory\nrequirement or an FCC regulation, \u00a7\u00a7227(b)(3)(A), (c)(5),\nnot on a violation of any state substantive law.\n   The federal interest in regulating telemarketing to\n\u201cprotec[t] the privacy of individuals\u201d while \u201cpermit[ting]\nlegitimate [commercial] practices,\u201d 105 Stat. 2394, note\nfollowing 47 U.

They wake us up in the morning; they in-\n     terrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and\n     elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to\n     rip the telephone right out of the wall.\n        .            .          .          .           .\n        \u201cThe substitute bill contains a private right-of-\n     action provision that will make it easier for consumers\n     to recover damages from receiving these computerized\n     calls. The provision would allow consumers to bring\n     an action in State court against any entity that vio-\n     lates the bill. The bill does not, because of constitu-\n     tional constraints, dictate to the States which court in\n     each State shall be the proper venue for such an ac-\n     tion, as this is a matter for State legislators to deter-\n     mine. Nevertheless, it is my hope that States will\n     make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring\n     such actions, preferably in small claims court. . . .\n        \u201cSmall claims court or a similar court would allow\n     the consumer to appear before the court without an\n     attorney. The amount of damages in this legislation\n     is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemar-\n     keter. However, it would defeat the purposes of the\n     bill if the attorneys\u2019 costs to consumers of bringing an\n     action were greater than the potential damages. I\n     thus expect that the States will act reasonably in\n     permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this\n     bill.\u201d 137 Cong. Rec. 30821\u201330822 (1991).\nThis statement does not bear the weight Arrow would\nplace on it.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nclaims would have no forum in which to sue. \n\n16         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, the views of a single legislator, even a bill\u2019s spon-\nsor, are not controlling. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n\nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980). Second,\nSenator Hollings did not mention federal-court jurisdiction\nor otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. \u00a7227(b)(3) is intend-\ned to divest federal courts of authority to hear TCPA\nclaims. Hollings no doubt believed that mine-run TCPA\nclaims would be pursued most expeditiously in state\nsmall-claims court.14 But one cannot glean from his\nstatement any expectation that those courts, or state\ncourts generally, would have exclusive jurisdiction over\nprivate actions alleging violations of the Act or of the\nFCC\u2019s implementing regulations. Third, even if we agreed\nwith Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA\nactions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other\nsupporters shared his view, that expectation would not\ncontrol our judgment on 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s compass. Cf.\nYellow Freight, 494 U. S., at 826 (\u201cpersuasive showing\nthat most legislators, judges, and administrators . . .\ninvolved in the enactment, amendment, enforcement, and\ninterpretation of Title VII expected that such litiga-\ntion would be processed exclusively in federal courts\u201d\ndid not overcome presumption of concurrent state-court\njurisdiction).\n   Among its arguments for state-court exclusivity, Arrow\nraises a concern about the impact on federal courts were\nwe to uphold \u00a71331 jurisdiction over private actions under\nthe TCPA. \u201c[G]iven the enormous volume of telecommuni-\ncations presenting potential claims,\u201d Arrow projects, fed-\neral courts could be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 The complaint in this very case, we note, could not have been\n\nbrought in small-claims court. Mims alleged some 12 calls, and sought\ntreble damages ($1,500) for each. See App. 9\u201314; Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.\nThe amount he sought to recover far exceeded the $5,000 ceiling on\nclaims a Florida small-claims court can adjudicate. See Fla.

Brief for Respondent 33. \u201cMoreover, if plaintiffs\nare free to bring TCPA claims in federal court under\n\u00a71331, then defendants sued in state court would be equal-\nly free to remove those cases to federal court under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71441.\u201d Id., at 22\u201323. Indeed, Arrow suggests,\ndefendants could use removal as a mechanism to force\nsmall-claims-court plaintiffs to abandon suit rather than\n\u201cfigh[t] it out\u201d in the \u201cmore expensive federal forum.\u201d Id.,\nat 23.\n   Arrow\u2019s floodgates argument assumes \u201ca shocking de-\ngree of noncompliance\u201d with the Act, Reply Brief 11, and\nseems to us more imaginary than real. The current fed-\neral district court civil filing fee is $350. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71914(a). How likely is it that a party would bring a $500\nclaim in, or remove a $500 claim to, federal court? Lexis\nand Westlaw searches turned up 65 TCPA claims removed\nto federal district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wiscon-\nsin since the Seventh Circuit held, in October 2005, that\nthe Act does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on state\ncourts. All 65 cases were class actions, not individual\ncases removed from small-claims court.15 There were also\n26 private TCPA claims brought initially in federal district\ncourts; of those, 24 were class actions.\n                            IV\n  Nothing in the text, structure, purpose, or legislative\nhistory of the TCPA calls for displacement of the federal-\nquestion jurisdiction U.
