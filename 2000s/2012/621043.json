ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 10–1195. Argued November 28, 2011—Decided January 18, 2012\nConsumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-\n  ple, computerized calls to private homes—prompted Congress to pass\n  the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 47\n  U. S. C. §227. Congress determined that federal legislation was\n  needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\n  state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act bans cer-\n  tain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regula-\n  tions. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited\n  practices and recover damages on their residents’ behalf, 47 U. S. C.\n  A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these\n  state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,\n  §227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for viola-\n  tions of the Act or regulations “in an appropriate court of [a] State,”\n  “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of\n  court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n     Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,\n  alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the\n  TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or\n  prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims’s cellular phone without\n  his consent. Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction,\n  i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . .\n  of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court, affirmed\n  by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of sub-\n  ject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested juris-\n  diction over private actions exclusively in state courts.\nHeld: The TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does\n not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction\n2            MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7–18.\n       (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the\n    rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly\n    “aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.” Arrow agrees\n    that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress\n    vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in\n    state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a pre-\n    sumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Con-\n    gress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a partic-\n    ular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458–459. Arrow\n    acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no\n    converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,\n    Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces\n    §1331, an earlier, more general prescription.\n       Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that dis-\n    trict courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when\n    federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the sub-\n    stantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal\n    courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.\n    Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,\n    the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint\n    unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-\n    court adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress\n    eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47\n    U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the\n    grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the ju-\n    risdiction is to be exclusive,” United States v. Bank of New York &\n    Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive lan-\n    guage makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports\n    to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction. The provision does\n    not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or\n    “exclusively” in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2)\n    (Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA\n    suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription\n    “reinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . .\n    leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where other-\n    wise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was exclud-\n    ed expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.\n       Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private\n    action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean\n    to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have con-\n    current jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as\n    already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  risdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state\n  authorities, see 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simp-\n  ly have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was\n  also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that pri-\n  vate actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by\n  the laws or rules of court of [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Con-\n  gress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to de-\n  cide whether to entertain TCPA claims.\n     Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over\n  §227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress’ objective of enabling\n  States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded\n  state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 28 U. S. C. §1331 should\n  hold firm against “mere implication flowing from subsequent legisla-\n  tion.” Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424\n  U. S. 800, 808, 809, n. 15. Furthermore, had Congress sought only to\n  fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities, it could have provid-\n  ed that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be\n  subject to the receiving State’s laws. Instead, Congress enacted de-\n  tailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a\n  regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.\n     Arrow’s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s\n  sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court\n  jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) is intend-\n  ed to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if\n  Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to pro-\n  ceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this\n  Court’s judgment on §1331’s compass. Arrow’s arguments that fed-\n  eral courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or\n  that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-\n  court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.\n  Pp. 10–18.\n421 Fed.

ARROW \n\n           FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 18, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns enforcement, through private suits,\nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA\nor Act), 47 U. S. C. §227. Voluminous consumer com-\nplaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-\nple, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—\nprompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress de-\ntermined that federal legislation was needed because\ntelemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\nstate-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act\nbans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)\nto prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes\nStates to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices\nand to recover damages on their residents’ behalf. The\nCommission must be notified of such suits and may inter-\nvene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA\nsuits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.\ndistrict courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by\nprivate parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA\nor of the Commission’s implementing regulations.\n2         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple\nviolations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Ser-\nvices, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced\nan action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked\nthe court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, i.e., its authority\nto adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of\nthe United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court,\naffirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress’ speci-\nfication, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek\nredress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s\nregulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a]\nState,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the\nlaws or rules of court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C.\n§§227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n   The question presented is whether Congress’ provision\nfor private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state\ncourts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long\nrecognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates\nthe cause of action.” American Well Works Co. v. Layne &\nBowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the\nTCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims\nhas brought and supplies the substantive rules that will\ngovern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into\nthe TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts\nany barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the\ngeneral federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed\nsince 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470; 13D\nC. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and\nstate courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits\narising under the TCPA.\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings\nrelevant here. “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress\ndetermined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”\nTCPA, 105 Stat. 2394, note following 47 U. S. C. §227\n(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers\nare outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance\n[telemarketing] calls to their homes.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[A]utomated or prerecorded\ntelephone calls” made to private residences, Congress\nfound, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion\nof privacy.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAlthough over half the States had enacted statutes re-\nstricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal\nlaw was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade\n[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.\nNo. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have\njurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have\nexpressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).1\n   Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-\ncipally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it\nunlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system\nor an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the\nprior express consent of the called party, to call any emer-\ngency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular\ntelephone, or other service for which the receiver is\ncharged for the call. See 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(1)(A). Sec-\n——————\n  1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Fed-\n\neral Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to\nregulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the\nStates authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications. See\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 360, 369–370\n(1986).\n4          MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded\nvoice messages to call residential telephone lines with-\nout prior express consent. §227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act\nproscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax ma-\nchines. §227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic\ntelephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a\nbusiness’ telephone lines simultaneously. §227(b)(1)(D).2\n   The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar-\ntificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,\n§227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from\nthe law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also\ndirects the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the\nprivacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly\nthrough the creation of a national “do not call” system.\n§227(c).3\n   Congress provided complementary means of enforcing\nthe Act. State Attorneys General may “bring a civil action\non behalf of [State] residents,” if the Attorney General\n“has reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in\na pattern or practice” of violating the TCPA or FCC regu-\nlations thereunder. 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).\n“The district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive\njurisdiction” over all TCPA actions brought by State At-\ntorneys General. §227(g)(2). The Commission may inter-\nvene in such suits. §227(g)(3).4\n——————\n  2 In 2010, Congress amended the statute to prohibit an additional\n\npractice: the manipulation of caller-identification information. See\nTruth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111–331, 124 Stat. 3572. This\nlegislation inserted a new subsection (e) into 47 U. S.

S. C. §1331. The statute origi-\nnally included an amount-in-controversy requirement, set\nat $500. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470. Recog-\nnizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims,\nlarge or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980\neliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in\nfederal-question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal\nQuestion Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat.\n2369 (amending 28 U. S. C. §1331). See also H. R. Rep.\n\n——————\n   6 Congress had previously granted general federal-question jurisdic-\n\ntion to federal courts, but the grant was short lived. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 464, n. 14 (1974) (describing Midnight Judges\nAct of 1801, §11, 2 Stat. 92, repealed by Act of Mar. 8, 1802, §1, 2 Stat.\n132).\n8           MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 96–1461, p. 1 (1980).7 Apart from deletion of the\namount-in-controversy requirement, the general federal-\nquestion provision has remained essentially unchanged\nsince 1875. See 13D Wright & Miller 163.\n    Because federal law creates the right of action and\nprovides the rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in 28\nU. S. C. §1331’s words, plainly “aris[es] under” the “laws\n. . . of the United States.” As already noted, supra, at 2,\n“[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of\naction.” American Well Works, 241 U. S., at 260. Al-\nthough courts have described this formulation as “more\nuseful for inclusion than for . . . exclusion,” Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 809, n. 5\n(1986) (quoting T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d 823,\n827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federal-\nly created claim for relief is generally a “sufficient con-\ndition for federal-question jurisdiction.” Grable & Sons\nMetal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545\nU. S. 308, 317 (2005).8\n    Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested\nexclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA ac-\n——————\n  7 At the time it was repealed, the amount-in-controversy requirement\n\nin federal-question cases had reached $10,000. See Act of July 25,\n1958, 72 Stat. 415. Currently, the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases must exceed $75,000. See 28 U. S. C. §1332.\n  8 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices\n\nto ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.\nRutter, 177 U. S. 505 (1900), discussed in R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.\nMeltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System, 784–785 (6th ed. 2009). In Shoshone Mining, we held\nthat a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law\nfor jurisdictional purposes because “the right of possession” in contro-\nversy could be determined by “local rules or customs, or state statutes,”\n177 U. S., at 509, or “may present simply a question of fact,” id., at 510.\nHere, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and\ndesignates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder\nsupply the governing substantive law.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

In cases “arising under” federal law,\nwe note, there is a “deeply rooted presumption in favor of\nconcurrent state court jurisdiction,” rebuttable if “Con-\ngress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction\nover a particular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493\nU. S. 455, 458–459 (1990). E.g., 28 U. S. C. §1333 (“The\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of\nthe courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty\nor maritime jurisdiction . . . .”). The presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can\nbe overcome “by an explicit statutory directive, by unmis-\ntakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear\nincompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and feder-\nal interests.” Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453\nU. S. 473, 478 (1981).\n   Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28\nU. S. C. §1331 creates no converse presumption in favor\nof federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the\nTCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces §1331, an\nearlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n28–29; Brief for Respondent 31.\n   Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away\nso easily. As stated earlier, see supra, at 8, when federal\nlaw creates a private right of action and furnishes the\nsubstantive rules of decision, the claim arises under feder-\nal law, and district courts possess federal-question juris-\ndiction under §1331.9 That principle endures unless\nCongress divests federal courts of their §1331 adjudica-\ntory authority.

Rev. 1895, 1929–1930 (1998).\nAccordingly, the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction\nover Mims’s complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by\nfair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication. See\nVerizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644; Gonell, supra, at 1929\n(Jurisdiction over private TCPA actions “is proper under\n§1331 unless Congress enacted a partial repeal of §1331 in\nthe TCPA.”).\n                             III\n  Arrow’s arguments do not persuade us that Congress\nhas eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private actions\nunder the TCPA.\n  The language of the TCPA—“A person or entity may, if\notherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a\nState, bring [an action] in an appropriate court of that\nState,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)—Arrow asserts, is uniquely\nstate-court oriented. See Brief for Respondent 13. That\nmay be, but “[i]t is a general rule that the grant of juris-\ndiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the juris-\ndiction is to be exclusive.” United States v. Bank of New\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nYork & Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479 (1936).\n   Nothing in the permissive language of §227(b)(3) makes\nstate-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to\noust federal courts of their 28 U. S. C. §1331 jurisdiction\nover federal claims. See, e.g., Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at\n643 (“[N]othing in 47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6) purports to strip\n[§1331] jurisdiction.”). Cf. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v.\nDonnelly, 494 U.

C.\n§2000e–5(f)(3)—does not “ous[t] state courts of their pre-\nsumptive jurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)). Congress may indeed provide a track for a federal\nclaim exclusive of §1331. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §405(h)\n(“No action . . . shall be brought under [§1331] to recover\non any claim arising under [Title II of the Social Security\nAct].”); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 756–757 (1975).\nCongress has done nothing of that sort here, however.\n   Title 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) does not state that a private\nplaintiff may bring an action under the TCPA “only” in\nstate court, or “exclusively” in state court. The absence of\nsuch a statement contrasts with the Act’s instruction on\nsuits instituted by State Attorneys General. As earlier\nnoted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp.\n2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction over [such] actions”\nin “[t]he district courts of the United States.”10 Section\n227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription “reinforce[s] the conclu-\nsion that [47 U.

For where oth-\nerwise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it\nwas excluded expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee ErieNet, 156 F. 3d, at 522 (Alito, J., dissenting) (“[47\nU. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011)] reveals that, while\ndrafting the TCPA, Congress knew full well how to grant\nexclusive jurisdiction with mandatory language.

No similar\nprescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 47 U. S.

A. §227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C.\n§]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments\nto the general rules in the former section and not the latter. As for the\nconflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.\n2011)] but not [47 U. S.

True enough, but Con-\ngress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement\nactions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.\n2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively\ncompetent in such cases, §227(g)(2). Congress may simply\nhave wanted to avoid any argument that in private ac-\ntions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General,\n“federal jurisdiction is exclusive.” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451\n(emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 494 U.

Moreover, by\nproviding that private actions may be brought in state\ncourt “if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court\nof [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Congress arguably\ngave States leeway they would otherwise lack to “decide\nfor [themselves] whether to entertain claims under the\n[TCPA],” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451.

Third, even if we agreed\nwith Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA\nactions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other\nsupporters shared his view, that expectation would not\ncontrol our judgment on 28 U.

ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 10–1195. Argued November 28, 2011—Decided January 18, 2012\nConsumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-\n  ple, computerized calls to private homes—prompted Congress to pass\n  the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or Act), 47\n  U. S. C. §227. Congress determined that federal legislation was\n  needed because telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\n  state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act bans cer-\n  tain invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) to prescribe implementing regula-\n  tions. It authorizes States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited\n  practices and recover damages on their residents’ behalf, 47 U. S. C.\n  A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these\n  state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,\n  §227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for viola-\n  tions of the Act or regulations “in an appropriate court of [a] State,”\n  “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of\n  court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C. §§227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n     Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,\n  alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the\n  TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or\n  prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims’s cellular phone without\n  his consent. Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction,\n  i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . .\n  of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court, affirmed\n  by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of sub-\n  ject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested juris-\n  diction over private actions exclusively in state courts.\nHeld: The TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does\n not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction\n2            MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7–18.\n       (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the\n    rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly\n    “aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.” Arrow agrees\n    that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress\n    vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in\n    state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a pre-\n    sumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Con-\n    gress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a partic-\n    ular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458–459. Arrow\n    acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no\n    converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,\n    Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces\n    §1331, an earlier, more general prescription.\n       Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that dis-\n    trict courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when\n    federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the sub-\n    stantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal\n    courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.\n    Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642. Accordingly,\n    the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint\n    unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-\n    court adjudication. See id., at 644. Pp. 7–10.\n       (b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress\n    eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title 47\n    U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the\n    grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the ju-\n    risdiction is to be exclusive,” United States v. Bank of New York &\n    Trust Co., 296 U. S. 463, 479. Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive lan-\n    guage makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports\n    to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction. The provision does\n    not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or\n    “exclusively” in state court. In contrast, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2)\n    (Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA\n    suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription\n    “reinforce[s] the conclusion that [47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . .\n    leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where other-\n    wise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was exclud-\n    ed expressly.” Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at 644.\n       Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private\n    action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean\n    to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have con-\n    current jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as\n    already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  risdiction exclusive in TCPA enforcement actions brought by state\n  authorities, see 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simp-\n  ly have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was\n  also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that pri-\n  vate actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by\n  the laws or rules of court of [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Con-\n  gress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to de-\n  cide whether to entertain TCPA claims.\n     Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over\n  §227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress’ objective of enabling\n  States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded\n  state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by 28 U. S. C. §1331 should\n  hold firm against “mere implication flowing from subsequent legisla-\n  tion.” Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424\n  U. S. 800, 808, 809, n. 15. Furthermore, had Congress sought only to\n  fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities, it could have provid-\n  ed that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be\n  subject to the receiving State’s laws. Instead, Congress enacted de-\n  tailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a\n  regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.\n     Arrow’s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s\n  sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court\n  jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) is intend-\n  ed to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if\n  Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to pro-\n  ceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this\n  Court’s judgment on §1331’s compass. Arrow’s arguments that fed-\n  eral courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or\n  that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-\n  court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.\n  Pp. 10–18.\n421 Fed.

ARROW \n\n           FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 18, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns enforcement, through private suits,\nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA\nor Act), 47 U. S. C. §227. Voluminous consumer com-\nplaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-\nple, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—\nprompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress de-\ntermined that federal legislation was needed because\ntelemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping\nstate-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act\nbans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)\nto prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes\nStates to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices\nand to recover damages on their residents’ behalf. The\nCommission must be notified of such suits and may inter-\nvene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA\nsuits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.\ndistrict courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by\nprivate parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA\nor of the Commission’s implementing regulations.\n2         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple\nviolations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Ser-\nvices, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced\nan action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked\nthe court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, i.e., its authority\nto adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of\nthe United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331. The District Court,\naffirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress’ speci-\nfication, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek\nredress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s\nregulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a]\nState,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the\nlaws or rules of court of [that] State.” 47 U. S. C.\n§§227(b)(3), (c)(5).\n   The question presented is whether Congress’ provision\nfor private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state\ncourts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long\nrecognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates\nthe cause of action.” American Well Works Co. v. Layne &\nBowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the\nTCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims\nhas brought and supplies the substantive rules that will\ngovern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into\nthe TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts\nany barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the\ngeneral federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed\nsince 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470; 13D\nC. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and\nstate courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits\narising under the TCPA.\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings\nrelevant here. “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress\ndetermined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”\nTCPA, 105 Stat. 2394, note following 47 U. S. C. §227\n(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers\nare outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance\n[telemarketing] calls to their homes.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[A]utomated or prerecorded\ntelephone calls” made to private residences, Congress\nfound, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion\nof privacy.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAlthough over half the States had enacted statutes re-\nstricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal\nlaw was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade\n[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also S. Rep.\nNo. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have\njurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have\nexpressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).1\n   Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-\ncipally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it\nunlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system\nor an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the\nprior express consent of the called party, to call any emer-\ngency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular\ntelephone, or other service for which the receiver is\ncharged for the call. See 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(1)(A). Sec-\n——————\n  1 In general, the Communications Act of 1934 grants to the Fed-\n\neral Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) authority to\nregulate interstate telephone communications and reserves to the\nStates authority to regulate intrastate telephone communications. See\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 360, 369–370\n(1986).\n4          MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded\nvoice messages to call residential telephone lines with-\nout prior express consent. §227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act\nproscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax ma-\nchines. §227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic\ntelephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a\nbusiness’ telephone lines simultaneously. §227(b)(1)(D).2\n   The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar-\ntificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,\n§227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from\nthe law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also\ndirects the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the\nprivacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly\nthrough the creation of a national “do not call” system.\n§227(c).3\n   Congress provided complementary means of enforcing\nthe Act. State Attorneys General may “bring a civil action\non behalf of [State] residents,” if the Attorney General\n“has reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in\na pattern or practice” of violating the TCPA or FCC regu-\nlations thereunder. 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).\n“The district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive\njurisdiction” over all TCPA actions brought by State At-\ntorneys General. §227(g)(2). The Commission may inter-\nvene in such suits. §227(g)(3).4\n——————\n  2 In 2010, Congress amended the statute to prohibit an additional\n\npractice: the manipulation of caller-identification information. See\nTruth in Caller ID Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111–331, 124 Stat. 3572. This\nlegislation inserted a new subsection (e) into 47 U. S.

Recog-\nnizing the responsibility of federal courts to decide claims,\nlarge or small, arising under federal law, Congress in 1980\neliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement in\nfederal-question (but not diversity) cases. See Federal\nQuestion Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, 94 Stat.\n2369 (amending 28 U. S. C. §1331). See also H. R. Rep.\n\n——————\n   6 Congress had previously granted general federal-question jurisdic-\n\ntion to federal courts, but the grant was short lived. See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U. S. 452, 464, n. 14 (1974) (describing Midnight Judges\nAct of 1801, §11, 2 Stat. 92, repealed by Act of Mar. 8, 1802, §1, 2 Stat.\n132).\n8           MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 96–1461, p. 1 (1980).7 Apart from deletion of the\namount-in-controversy requirement, the general federal-\nquestion provision has remained essentially unchanged\nsince 1875. See 13D Wright & Miller 163.\n    Because federal law creates the right of action and\nprovides the rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in 28\nU. S. C. §1331’s words, plainly “aris[es] under” the “laws\n. . . of the United States.” As already noted, supra, at 2,\n“[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of\naction.” American Well Works, 241 U. S., at 260. Al-\nthough courts have described this formulation as “more\nuseful for inclusion than for . . . exclusion,” Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 809, n. 5\n(1986) (quoting T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F. 2d 823,\n827 (CA2 1964)), there is no serious debate that a federal-\nly created claim for relief is generally a “sufficient con-\ndition for federal-question jurisdiction.” Grable & Sons\nMetal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545\nU. S. 308, 317 (2005).8\n    Arrow agrees that this action arises under federal law,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, but urges that Congress vested\nexclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA ac-\n——————\n  7 At the time it was repealed, the amount-in-controversy requirement\n\nin federal-question cases had reached $10,000. See Act of July 25,\n1958, 72 Stat. 415. Currently, the amount in controversy in diversity\ncases must exceed $75,000. See 28 U. S. C. §1332.\n  8 For a rare exception to the rule that a federal cause of action suffices\n\nto ground federal-question jurisdiction, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.\nRutter, 177 U. S. 505 (1900), discussed in R. Fallon, J. Manning, D.\nMeltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System, 784–785 (6th ed. 2009). In Shoshone Mining, we held\nthat a suit for a federal mining patent did not arise under federal law\nfor jurisdictional purposes because “the right of possession” in contro-\nversy could be determined by “local rules or customs, or state statutes,”\n177 U. S., at 509, or “may present simply a question of fact,” id., at 510.\nHere, by contrast, the TCPA not only creates the claim for relief and\ndesignates the remedy; critically, the Act and regulations thereunder\nsupply the governing substantive law.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

In cases “arising under” federal law,\nwe note, there is a “deeply rooted presumption in favor of\nconcurrent state court jurisdiction,” rebuttable if “Con-\ngress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction\nover a particular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, 493\nU. S. 455, 458–459 (1990). E.g., 28 U. S. C. §1333 (“The\ndistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of\nthe courts of the States, of: (1) Any civil case of admiralty\nor maritime jurisdiction . . . .”). The presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, we have recognized, can\nbe overcome “by an explicit statutory directive, by unmis-\ntakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear\nincompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and feder-\nal interests.” Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453\nU. S. 473, 478 (1981).\n   Arrow readily acknowledges the presumption of con-\ncurrent state-court jurisdiction, but maintains that 28\nU. S. C. §1331 creates no converse presumption in favor\nof federal-court jurisdiction. Instead, Arrow urges, the\nTCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces §1331, an\nearlier, more general prescription. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n28–29; Brief for Respondent 31.\n   Section 1331, our decisions indicate, is not swept away\nso easily. As stated earlier, see supra, at 8, when federal\nlaw creates a private right of action and furnishes the\nsubstantive rules of decision, the claim arises under feder-\nal law, and district courts possess federal-question juris-\ndiction under §1331.9 That principle endures unless\nCongress divests federal courts of their §1331 adjudica-\ntory authority.

Rev. 1895, 1929–1930 (1998).\nAccordingly, the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction\nover Mims’s complaint unless the TCPA, expressly or by\nfair implication, excludes federal-court adjudication. See\nVerizon Md., 535 U.

S. C. §227(b)(3)—Arrow asserts, is uniquely\nstate-court oriented. See Brief for Respondent 13. That\nmay be, but “[i]t is a general rule that the grant of juris-\ndiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the juris-\ndiction is to be exclusive.” United States v.

S. 463, 479 (1936).\n   Nothing in the permissive language of §227(b)(3) makes\nstate-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports to\noust federal courts of their 28 U. S. C. §1331 jurisdiction\nover federal claims. See, e.g., Verizon Md., 535 U. S., at\n643 (“[N]othing in 47 U. S. C. §252(e)(6) purports to strip\n[§1331] jurisdiction.”). Cf.

C.\n§2000e–5(f)(3)—does not “ous[t] state courts of their pre-\nsumptive jurisdiction.” (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)). Congress may indeed provide a track for a federal\nclaim exclusive of §1331. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §405(h)\n(“No action . . . shall be brought under [§1331] to recover\non any claim arising under [Title II of the Social Security\nAct].”); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 756–757 (1975).\nCongress has done nothing of that sort here, however.\n   Title 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3) does not state that a private\nplaintiff may bring an action under the TCPA “only” in\nstate court, or “exclusively” in state court. The absence of\nsuch a statement contrasts with the Act’s instruction on\nsuits instituted by State Attorneys General. As earlier\nnoted, see supra, at 4, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp.\n2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction over [such] actions”\nin “[t]he district courts of the United States.”10 Section\n227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription “reinforce[s] the conclu-\nsion that [47 U.

No similar\nprescriptions appear in the section on private actions, 47 U. S.

A. §227(g)(4) (Supp. 2011)] and not [47 U. S. C.\n§]227(b)(3) simply indicates that Congress wished to make adjustments\nto the general rules in the former section and not the latter. As for the\nconflict provision that appears in section [47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.\n2011)] but not [47 U. S.

True enough, but Con-\ngress had simultaneously provided for TCPA enforcement\nactions by state authorities, 47 U. S. C. A. §227(g) (Supp.\n2011), and had made federal district courts exclusively\ncompetent in such cases, §227(g)(2). Congress may simply\nhave wanted to avoid any argument that in private ac-\ntions, as in actions brought by State Attorneys General,\n“federal jurisdiction is exclusive.” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451\n(emphasis deleted) (citing Yellow Freight, 494 U.

Moreover, by\nproviding that private actions may be brought in state\ncourt “if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court\nof [the] State,” 47 U. S. C. §227(b)(3), Congress arguably\ngave States leeway they would otherwise lack to “decide\nfor [themselves] whether to entertain claims under the\n[TCPA],” Brill, 427 F. 3d, at 451.

Third, even if we agreed\nwith Arrow that Senator Hollings expected private TCPA\nactions to proceed solely in state courts, and even if other\nsupporters shared his view, that expectation would not\ncontrol our judgment on 28 U.

Because\nfederal law gives rise to the claim for relief Mims has\nstated and specifies the substantive rules of decision, the\nEleventh Circuit erred in dismissing Mims’s case for lack\nof subject-matter jurisdiction.\n                        *     * *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/621043/", "sha1": "aa3d0491713ecd7d8be53935938ab488332f6004", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-01-18T07:37:02"}
