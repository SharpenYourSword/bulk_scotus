THOMAS, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA \n\n        DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n          No. 10\u201363. Argued October 4, 2011\u2014January 18, 2012\nPetitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to\n  death in Alabama state court. In 2001, Maples sought postconviction\n  relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32. Maples alleged, among\n  other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys\n  failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth\n  Amendment. His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,\n  Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the\n  New York offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. As required\n  by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer,\n  John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice. Butler made\n  clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement\n  in the case.\n     In 2002, while Maples\u2019 state postconviction petition was pending,\n  Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell. Their new em-\n  ployment disabled them from representing Maples. They did not in-\n  form Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as\n  his counsel. In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial\n  court\u2019s leave to withdraw. No other Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\n  entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise no-\n  tified the court of a change in Maples\u2019 representation. Thus, Munan-\n  ka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples\u2019 listed, and only, at-\n  torneys of record.\n     The trial court denied Maples\u2019 petition in May 2003. Notices of the\n  order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &\n  Cromwell\u2019s address. When those postings were returned, unopened,\n  the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing. Butler also re-\n  ceived a copy of the order, but did not act on it. With no attorney of\n2                           MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    record in fact acting on Maples\u2019 behalf, the 42-day period Maples had\n    to file a notice of appeal ran out.\n       About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent\n    a letter directly to Maples. The letter informed Maples of the missed\n    deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a\n    federal habeas petition. Maples immediately contacted his mother,\n    who called Sullivan & Cromwell. Three Sullivan & Cromwell attor-\n    neys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order,\n    thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. The court denied the\n    motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ\n    of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-\n    time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.\n       Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief. Both the District\n    Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the\n    procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\u2019 failure timely to appeal\n    the state trial court\u2019s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postcon-\n    viction relief.\n    Held: Maples has shown the requisite \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his procedur-\n    al default. Pp. 11\u201322.\n        (a) As a rule, a federal court may not entertain a state prisoner\u2019s\n    habeas claims \u201cwhen (1) \u2018a state court [has] declined to address\n    [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state proce-\n    dural requirement,\u2019 and (2) \u2018the state judgment rests on independent\n    and adequate state procedural grounds.\u2019 \u201d Walker v. Martin, 562\n    U. S. ___, ___. The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if\n    \u201cthe prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in\n    state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of\n    federal law.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750.\n        Cause for a procedural default exists where \u201csomething external to\n    the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,]\n    . . . \u2018impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d\n    Id., at 753. A prisoner\u2019s postconviction attorney\u2019s negligence does not\n    qualify as \u201ccause,\u201d ibid., because the attorney is the prisoner\u2019s agent,\n    and under \u201cwell-settled\u201d agency law, the principal bears the risk of\n    his agent\u2019s negligent conduct, id., at 753\u2013754. Thus, a petitioner is\n    bound by his attorney\u2019s failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot\n    rely on that failure to establish cause. Ibid.\n        A markedly different situation arises, however, when an attorney\n    abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.\n    In such cases, the principal-agent relationship is severed and the at-\n    torney\u2019s acts or omissions \u201ccannot fairly be attributed to [the client].\u201d\n    Id., at 753. Nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own\n    behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact,\n    are not representing him.\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n  Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, is instructive. There, the Court\nfound that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition\ncan be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney\u2019s unprofes-\nsional conduct may sometimes be an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d\njustifying equitable tolling. Id., at ___, ___\u2013___. The Court recog-\nnized that an attorney\u2019s negligence does not provide a basis for tolling\na statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland\u2019s claim that he was aban-\ndoned by his attorney, however, if true, \u201cwould suffice to establish ex-\ntraordinary circumstances beyond his control,\u201d id., at ___ (opinion of\nALITO, J.). Pp. 11\u201315.\n  (b) From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after\ntime ran out for appealing the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition,\nMaples\u2019 sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and\nButler. Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serv-\ning as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period. Pp. 15\u201321.\n     (1) The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented\nMaples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as\na result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the\n42-day period. But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nsevered their agency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial\ncourt\u2019s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey\nthat they remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys,\nnot Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law re-\nquires the clerk to furnish.\n  The State asserts that, after Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s depar-\nture, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as\nMaples\u2019 counsel. At the time of the default, however, those attorneys\nhad not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their\nappearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, and had done nothing to inform the\nAlabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz. Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Pp. 15\u201319.\n     (2) Maples\u2019 only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did\nnot even begin to represent Maples. Butler told Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of en-\nabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive\nrole in the case. Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples\u2019\n\u201cagent in any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d Holland, 560 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of ALITO, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial court\u2019s\norder, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm\nlawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did the State treat But-\nler as Maples\u2019 actual representative. Notably, the Alabama Assistant\nAttorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding\n4                         MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an\n    opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19\u201320.\n          (3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of\n    record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his\n    representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive no-\n    tice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for com-\n    mencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked coun-\n    sel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\n    complying with the State\u2019s procedural rule. Pp. 20\u201321.\n       (c) \u201cThe cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for\n    States\u2019 finality and comity interests while ensuring that \u2018fundamen-\n    tal fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas cor-\n    pus.\u2019 \u201d Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 393. In the unusual circum-\n    stances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness\n    point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Ma-\n    ples\u2019 procedural default. Through no fault of his own, he lacked the\n    assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal peri-\n    od. And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been re-\n    duced to pro se status.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sen-\ntenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.\nAt trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers,\nminimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging\nineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial\ninfirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written\nby two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associ-\nated with the same New York-based large law firm. An\nAlabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved\nthe admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice. As\nunderstood by New York counsel, local counsel would\nfacilitate their appearance, but would undertake no sub-\nstantive involvement in the case.\n  In the summer of 2002, while Maples\u2019 postconviction\npetition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his\nNew York attorneys left the law firm; their new employ-\nment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.\nThey did not inform Maples of their departure and conse-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek\nthe Alabama trial court\u2019s leave to withdraw. Neither they\nnor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able\nto handle Maples\u2019 case.\n  In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples\u2019\npetition. Notices of the court\u2019s order were posted to the\nNew York attorneys at the address of the law firm with\nwhich they had been associated. Those postings were re-\nturned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt-\ned no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact\nacting on Maples\u2019 behalf, the time to appeal ran out.\n  Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,\nthe Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the\nprocedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\u2019 failure\ntimely to appeal the Alabama trial court\u2019s order denying\nhim postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was\nblameless for the default.\n  The sole question this Court has taken up for review is\nwhether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples\u2019 case, there\nis \u201ccause\u201d to excuse the default. Maples maintains that\nthere is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly repre-\nsenting him had abandoned the case without leave of\ncourt, without informing Maples they could no longer\nrepresent him, and without securing any recorded substi-\ntution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Ma-\nples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state\npostconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to\nprotect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just\nsystem would lay the default at Maples\u2019 death-cell door.\nSatisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a.\nGiven his lack of \u201cresources, available time [and] experi-\nence,\u201d Butler told the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he\ncould not \u201cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\u201d Ibid.\nThe Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys accepted Butler\u2019s\nconditions. Id., at 257a. This arrangement between out-\nof-state and local attorneys, it appears, was hardly atypi-\ncal. See Justices Brief 36 (\u201cThe fact is that local counsel\nfor out-of-state attorneys in post-conviction litigation most\noften do nothing other than provide the mechanism for\nforeign attorneys to be admitted.\u201d).\n  With the aid of his pro bono counsel, Maples filed a\npetition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 32.4 Among other claims, Maples\nasserted that his court-appointed attorneys provided con-\nstitutionally ineffective assistance during both guilt and\npenalty phases of his capital trial. App. 29\u2013126. He\nalleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and under-\nfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious\nintoxication defense, did not object to several egregious\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully un-\nderprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State\nresponded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples\u2019\npetition. On December 27, 2001, the trial court denied the\nState\u2019s motion.\n  Some seven months later, in the summer of 2002, both\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 258a. Munanka gained a clerkship\nwith a federal judge; Ingen-Housz accepted a position with\nthe European Commission in Belgium. Ibid.

In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 6.2, Comment, neither attorney sought the\ntrial court\u2019s leave to withdraw, App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.\nCompounding Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s inaction, no\nother Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer entered an appearance\non Maples\u2019 behalf, moved to substitute counsel, or other-\nwise notified the court of any change in Maples\u2019 represen-\ntation. Ibid.\n   Another nine months passed. During this time period,\nno Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys assigned to Maples\u2019\ncase sought admission to the Alabama bar, entered ap-\npearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, or otherwise advised the\nAlabama court that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were no\nlonger Maples\u2019 attorneys. Thus, Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz (along with Butler) remained Maples\u2019 listed, and\nonly, \u201cattorneys of record.\u201d Id., at 223a.\n   There things stood when, in May 2003, the trial court,\nwithout holding a hearing, entered an order denying\nMaples\u2019 Rule 32 petition. App. 146\u2013225.5 The clerk of the\nAlabama trial court mailed copies of the order to Maples\u2019\nthree attorneys of record. He sent Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-\nHousz\u2019s copies to Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s New York ad-\ndress, which the pair had provided upon entering their\nappearances.\n   When those copies arrived at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz had long since departed. The\nnotices, however, were not forwarded to another Sullivan\n& Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom employee sent\nthe unopened envelopes back to the court. \u201cReturned to\nSender\u2014Attempted, Unknown\u201d was stamped on the enve-\nlope addressed to Munanka.

A similar stamp appeared on the envelope\naddressed to Ingen-Housz, along with the handwritten\nnotation \u201cReturn to Sender\u2014Left Firm.\u201d Id., at 7a.\n   Upon receiving back the unopened envelopes he had\nmailed to Munanka and Ingen-Housz, the Alabama court\nclerk took no further action. In particular, the clerk did\nnot contact Munanka or Ingen-Housz at the personal\ntelephone numbers or home addresses they had provided\nin their pro hac vice applications. See Ingen-Housz Veri-\nfied Application for Admission to Practice Under Rule VII,\np. 1; and Munanka Verified Application for Admission to\nPractice Under Rule VII, p. 1, in Maples v. State, No. CC\u2013\n95\u2013842.60 (C. C. Morgan Cty., Ala.). Nor did the clerk\nalert Sullivan & Cromwell or Butler. Butler received his\ncopy of the order, but did not act on it. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 256a. He assumed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwho had been \u201cCC\u2019d\u201d on the order, would take care of filing\nan appeal. Ibid.\n   Meanwhile, the clock ticked on Maples\u2019 appeal. Under\nAlabama\u2019s Rules of Appellate Procedure, Maples had 42\ndays to file a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s May 22,\n2003 order denying Maples\u2019 petition for postconviction\nrelief. Rule 4(a)(1) (2000). No appeal notice was filed, and\nthe time allowed for filing expired on July 7, 2003.\n   A little over a month later, on August 13, 2003, Ala-\nbama Assistant Attorney General Jon Hayden, the attor-\nney representing the State in Maples\u2019 collateral review\nproceedings, sent a letter directly to Maples. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 253a\u2013254a. Hayden\u2019s letter informed Maples of\nthe missed deadline for initiating an appeal within the\nState\u2019s system, and notified him that four weeks remained\nduring which he could file a federal habeas petition. Ibid.\nHayden mailed the letter to Maples only, using his prison\naddress. Ibid. No copy was sent to Maples\u2019 attorneys of\nrecord, or to anyone else acting on Maples\u2019 behalf.

Ibid.\nPrompted by her call, Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys\nMarc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submit-\nted a motion, through Butler, asking the trial court to\nreissue its order denying Maples\u2019 Rule 32 petition, thereby\nrestarting the 42-day appeal period. Id., at 222a.\n   The trial court denied the motion, id., at 222a\u2013225a, not-\ning that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had not withdrawn\nfrom the case and, consequently, were \u201cstill attor-\nneys of record for the petitioner,\u201d id., at 223a. Further-\nmore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and\nBrewer had not \u201cyet been admitted to practice in Ala-\nbama\u201d or \u201centered appearances as attorneys of record.\u201d\nIbid. \u201cHow,\u201d the court asked, \u201ccan a Circuit Clerk in\nDecatur, Alabama know what is going on in a law firm in\nNew York, New York?\u201d Id., at 223a\u2013224a. Declining to\nblame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline,\nthe court said it was \u201cunwilling to enter into subterfuge in\norder to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the peti-\ntioner.\u201d Ibid.\n   Maples next petitioned the Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals for a writ of mandamus, granting him leave to file\nan out-of-time appeal. Rejecting Maples\u2019 plea, the Court of\nCriminal Appeals determined that, although the clerk had\n\u201cassumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of\nMaples\u2019s Rule 32 petition,\u201d the clerk had satisfied that\nobligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at\nthe addresses those attorneys provided. Id., at 234a\u2013235a.\nButler\u2019s receipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to\nnotify all attorneys \u201cin light of their apparent co-counsel\nstatus.\u201d Id., at 235a\u2013236a (quoting Thomas v. Kellett, 489\nSo. 2d 554, 555 (Ala. 1986)). The Alabama Supreme Court\nsummarily affirmed the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 judg-\nment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a, and this Court denied\ncertiorari, Maples v. Alabama, 543 U. S. 1148 (2005).\n10                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Having exhausted his state postconviction remedies,\nMaples sought federal habeas corpus relief. Addressing\nthe ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples\nstated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples\nhad forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed,\npresent the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32)\npetition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal\nfrom the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition. That proce-\ndural default, the State maintained, precluded federal-\ncourt consideration of the claims.6 Maples replied that the\ndefault should be excused, because he missed the appeal\ndeadline \u201cthrough no fault of his own.\u201d App. 262 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  The District Court determined that Maples had default-\ned his ineffective-assistance claims, and that he had not\nshown \u201ccause\u201d sufficient to overcome the default. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 49a\u201355a. The court understood Maples to\nargue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel,\nnot any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama,\nprovided the requisite \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his failure to meet\nAlabama\u2019s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. Id., at 55a. Such an\nargument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this\nCourt, in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), had\nheld that the ineffectiveness of postconviction appellate\ncounsel could not qualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (citing Coleman, 501 U. S., at 751).\n  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Ma-\nples v. Allen, 586 F. 3d 879 (2009) (per curiam). In accord\nwith the District Court, the Court of Appeals\u2019 majority\nheld that Maples defaulted his ineffective-assistance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In opposing Maples\u2019 request for an out-of-time appeal, the State\n\nargued to the Alabama Supreme Court that such an appeal was unwar-\nranted. In that context, the State noted that Maples \u201cmay still present\nhis postconviction claims to [the federal habeas] court.\u201d 35 Record, Doc.\nNo. 55, p. 22, n. 4.

Id., at 895\u2013898. She conclud-\ned that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals had acted\n\u201carbitrarily\u201d in refusing to grant Maples\u2019 request for an\nout-of-time appeal. Id., at 896. In a case involving \u201cindis-\ntinguishable facts,\u201d Judge Barkett noted, the Alabama\nappellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late\nappeal. Ibid. (citing Marshall v. State, 884 So. 2d 898, 899\n(Ala. Crim. App. 2002)). Inconsistent application of the\n42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, \u201crender[ed]\nthe rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal\nreview of Maples\u2019s claims.\u201d 586 F. 3d, at 897. The inter-\nests of justice, she added, required review of Maples\u2019\nclaims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high\nstakes involved, and the absence of any fault on Maples\u2019\npart.

THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1977).\n   Given the single issue on which we granted review, we\nwill assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Ala-\nbama Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 refusal to consider\nMaples\u2019 ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independ-\nent and adequate state procedural ground: namely,\nMaples\u2019 failure to satisfy Alabama\u2019s Rule requiring a\nnotice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial\ncourt\u2019s final order. Accordingly, we confine our considera-\ntion to the question whether Maples has shown cause to\nexcuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.\n   Cause for a procedural default exists where \u201csomething\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him[,] . . . \u2018impeded [his] efforts to comply\nwith the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986);\nemphasis in original). Negligence on the part of a prison-\ner\u2019s postconviction attorney does not qualify as \u201ccause.\u201d\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in\nColeman, because the attorney is the prisoner\u2019s agent, and\nunder \u201cwell-settled principles of agency law,\u201d the principal\nbears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his\nagent. Id., at 753\u2013754. See also Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (\u201cUnder our\nsystem of representative litigation, \u2018each party is deemed\nbound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Link v.\nWabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962))). Thus, when a\npetitioner\u2019s postconviction attorney misses a filing dead-\nline, the petitioner is bound by the oversight and cannot\nrely on it to establish cause. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753\u2013\n754. We do not disturb that general rule.\n   A markedly different situation is presented, however, when\nan attorney abandons his client without notice, and there-\nby occasions the default. Having severed the principal-\nagent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails\nto act, as the client\u2019s representative. See 1 Restatement\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Holland presented two issues:\nfirst, whether the \u00a72244(d) time limitation can be tolled\nfor equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney\u2019s\nunprofessional conduct can ever count as an \u201cextraordi-\nnary circumstance\u201d justifying equitable tolling. 560 U. S.,\nat ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 1, 16\u201317) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.\n   On the second issue, the Court recognized that an at-\ntorney\u2019s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing\ndeadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory\ntime limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___\u2013___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 5\u20136); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327,\n336 (2007). The Holland petitioner, however, urged that\nattorney negligence was not the gravamen of his com-\nplaint. Rather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached\nhimself from any trust relationship with his client: \u201c[My\nlawyer] has abandoned me,\u201d the petitioner complained to\n14                       MAPLES v.

S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20137). Holland\u2019s plea fit the latter\ncategory: He alleged abandonment \u201cevidenced by counsel\u2019s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner\u2019s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id.,\nat ___\u2013___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3\u20134, 20). If\ntrue, JUSTICE ALITO explained, \u201cpetitioner\u2019s allegations\nwould suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances\nbeyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a liti-\ngant cannot be held constructively responsible for the\nconduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent\nin any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).7\n  We agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot\nbe charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who\nhas abandoned him. Nor can a client be faulted for failing\nto act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe\nhis attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.\nWe therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his\nattorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), involved tolling of a federal\n\ntime bar, while Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), concerned\ncause for excusing a procedural default in state court. See Holland, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).

Unknown to\nMaples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his\nattorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from\nthe trial court\u2019s order.\n                             1\n   The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell repre-\nsented Maples throughout his state postconviction pro-\nceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot\nestablish abandonment by counsel continuing through the\nsix weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is\nundisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their\nagency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the\ntwo attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw\nfrom the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell\u2019s employ in the summer of 2002, at\nleast nine months before the Alabama trial court entered\nits order denying Rule 32 relief.

Hornbook agency law establishes that the at-\ntorneys\u2019 departure from Sullivan & Cromwell and their\ncommencement of employment that prevented them from\nrepresenting Maples ended their agency relationship with\nhim.

Regarding this assertion, we\nnote, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submit-\nted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples\u2019\nrequest that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,\nat 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been \u201cin-\nvolved in [Maples\u2019] case since the summer of 2001.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied\nthe State\u2019s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw\ninformed the court, Sullivan & Cromwell \u201clawyers working\non this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]\nevidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &\nCromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit\nsubmitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,\nthat she \u201cha[d] worked on [Maples\u2019] case since October 14,\n2002.\u201d App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy de-\nscribed what their \u201cinvolve[ment]\u201d or \u201cwor[k] on [Maples\u2019]\ncase\u201d entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,\nother than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still\nwith Sullivan & Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in\npreparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw\nidentify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed\non Maples\u2019 case between Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s\ndepartures and the firm\u2019s receipt of the telephone call\nfrom Maples\u2019 mother.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sul-\n\nlivan & Cromwell\u2019s representation of Maples after the default. As\namici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the\nfirm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors\net al. as Amici Curiae 23\u201327. Following the default, the firm\u2019s interest\nin avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples\u2019\nstrongest argument\u2014i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,\n18                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The slim record on activity at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nhowever, does not warrant a remand to determine more\nprecisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Mu-\nnanka and Ingen-Housz. For the facts essential to our\ndecision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the\nSullivan & Cromwell attorneys who later came forward\u2014\nDe Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer\u2014had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\ntheir appearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, and had done noth-\ning to inform the Alabama court that they wished to sub-\nstitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of\nthese attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restate-\nment (Second) \u00a7111 (The \u201cfailure to acquire a qualification\nby the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized\nact . . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act.\u201d).9 What\nthey did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntherefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &\nCromwell did not cede Maples\u2019 representation to a new attorney, who\ncould have made Maples\u2019 abandonment argument plain to the Court of\nAppeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and\noral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast\nresponsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court.\nGiven Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s conflict of interest, Maples\u2019 federal habeas\npetition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evi-\ndence that Maples, prior to the default, ever \u201cviewed himself\u201d as repre-\nsented by \u201cthe firm,\u201d see post, at 4, rather than by his attorneys of\nrecord, Munanka and Ingen-Housz.\n   9 The dissent argues that the Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no\n\nbasis \u201cto infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.\u201d\nPost, at 6\u20137. While that may be true, it is irrelevant. What the attor-\nneys could have inferred is that Maples would not have wanted them to\nfile a notice of appeal on his behalf prior to their admission to practice\nin Alabama, for doing so would be \u201cillegal,\u201d post, at 7 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). See also 1 Restatement (Second) \u00a7111, Comment\nb, quoted supra, at 16. For the critical purpose of filing a notice of\nappeal, then, the other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no authority\nto act for Maples.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeside the point. At the time critical to preserving Maples\u2019\naccess to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwere not Maples\u2019 authorized agents.\n                              2\n   Maples\u2019 only other attorney of record, local counsel\nButler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not\neven begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munan-\nka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel\nonly for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attor-\nneys to appear pro hac vice. Supra, at 5\u20136. Lacking the\nnecessary \u201cresources, available time [and] experience,\u201d\nButler told the two Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he\nwould not \u201cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\u201d Ibid.\nThat the minimal participation he undertook was incon-\nsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, un-\nderscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because\nButler signed on as local counsel.\n   In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other\nthan to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro\nhac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler\u2019s and De\nLeeuw\u2019s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n255a\u2013258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not\n\u201coperat[e] as [Maples\u2019] agent in any meaningful sense of\nthat word.\u201d Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).\nThe first is Butler\u2019s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of\nthe trial court\u2019s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact\nSullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were\ntaking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to\nbelieve that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a\ncopy of the court\u2019s order, see App. 225 (indicating that\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz were CC\u2019d on the order), But-\nler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New York\nfirm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely repre-\nsentative role in the case.\n20                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Notably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples\u2019 actual\nrepresentative. Assistant Attorney General Hayden ad-\ndressed the letter informing Maples of the default directly\nto Maples in prison. See supra, at 8. Hayden sent no copy\nto, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed\nas counsel of record for Maples. Lawyers in Alabama have\nan ethical obligation to refrain from communicating direct-\nly with an opposing party known to be represented by\ncounsel. See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003);\nAla. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all\ndocuments \u201cbe made upon the attorney of record\u201d). In\nwriting directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this\nethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden\nmust have believed that Maples was no longer represented\nby counsel, out-of-state or local.10\n  In sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no\ntime before the missed deadline was Butler serving as\nMaples\u2019 agent \u201cin any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d\nHolland, 560 U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op.,\nat 6).\n                             3\n  Not only was Maples left without any functioning attor-\nney of record, the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz,\nand Butler as his representatives meant that he had no\nright personally to receive notice. See supra, at 16. He in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Itbears note, as well, that the State served its response to Maples\u2019\nRule 32 petition only on Munanka at Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s New York\naddress, not on Butler. App. 26. While the State may not be obligated\nto serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York\nrather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the\nState was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve. Conforming\nthe State\u2019s Rule to common practice, in 2006, the Alabama Supreme\nCourt amended the provision on appearances by out-of-state counsel to\neliminate the requirement that such attorneys associate local counsel\nwhen representing indigent criminal defendants pro bono in postconvic-\ntion proceedings.

Had counsel of record or the State\u2019s\nattorney informed Maples of his plight before the time to\nappeal ran out, he could have filed a notice of appeal\nhimself11 or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys.12\nGiven no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and\nwilling to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\ncomplying with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\n                              C\n   \u201cThe cause and prejudice requirement,\u201d we have said,\n\u201cshows due regard for States\u2019 finality and comity interests\nwhile ensuring that \u2018fundamental fairness [remains] the\ncentral concern of the writ of habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 393 (2004) (quoting Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984)). In the unusual\ncircumstances of this case, principles of agency law and\nfundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There\nwas indeed cause to excuse Maples\u2019 procedural default.\nThrough no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance\nof any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama\nallows for noticing an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of\npostconviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason\nto suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se\nstatus. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circum-\nstances quite beyond his control.

Unbeknownst to peti-\ntioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation\ndue to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortu-\nnate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the\ntwo young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in\nhis state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by\nthese two attorneys of new employment that precluded\nthem from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to\nnotify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to\nwithdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure\nof the firm that they left to monitor the status of petition-\ner\u2019s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of\nthe decision denying petitioner\u2019s request for state post-\nconviction relief was received in that firm\u2019s offices, the\nfailure of the firm\u2019s mail room to route that important\ncommunication to either another member of the firm or to\nthe departed attorneys\u2019 new addresses; (7) the failure of\nthe clerk\u2019s office to take any action when the envelope\ncontaining that notice came back unopened; and (8) local\ncounsel\u2019s very limited conception of the role that he was\nobligated to play in petitioner\u2019s representation. Under\nthese unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner\u2019s\nattorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndonment was a \u201ccause\u201d that is sufficient to overcome pe-\ntitioner\u2019s procedural default.\n   In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel in the case now before us cast blame for what\noccurred on Alabama\u2019s system of providing legal represen-\ntation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral\nproceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3\u20136. But whatever\nmay be said about Alabama\u2019s system, I do not think that\nAlabama\u2019s system had much if anything to do with peti-\ntioner\u2019s misfortune. The quality of petitioner\u2019s representa-\ntion at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet\nthe deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial\nof his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any im-\nportant connection between what happened in this case\nand Alabama\u2019s system for providing representation for\nprisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to\npetition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other\nStates, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to\nrepresent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that\nmost of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.\nId., at 4. Petitioner\u2019s brief states that the Alabama system\nhad \u201ca direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the\nprocedural default at issue,\u201d id., at 3, but a similar combi-\nnation of untoward events could have occurred if petition-\ner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were\nappointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The\nfirm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one\nof the country\u2019s most prestigious and expensive, and I\nhave little doubt that the vast majority of criminal de-\nfendants would think that they had won the lottery if they\nwere given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys\nfrom such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it \u201cseemed as\nthough Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys\nworking at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to rep-\nresent Maples pro bono\u201d).\n   What occurred here was not a predictable consequence\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Court now concludes\nthat Maples has established cause for his procedural\ndefault by reason of abandonment by his attorneys. Be-\ncause I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because\nMaples\u2019 alternative argument fares no better, I would\naffirm the judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers,\nthe principle that errors in state criminal trials should\nbe remedied in state court. As we have long recognized,\nfederal habeas review for state prisoners imposes signifi-\ncant costs on the States, undermining not only their prac-\ntical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,\nsee Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126\u2013127 (1982), but also\nthe primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitu-\ntional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id.,\nat 128. We have further recognized that \u201c[t]hese costs are\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparticularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a\nprocedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitu-\ntional claims in state court.\u201d Coleman v.

In that situation, the prisoner has\n\u201cdeprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\nthose claims in the first instance,\u201d id., at 732, thereby\nleaving the state courts without \u201ca chance to mend their\nown fences and avoid federal intrusion,\u201d Engle, 456 U. S.,\nat 129. For that reason, and because permitting federal-\ncourt review of defaulted claims would \u201cundercu[t] the\nState\u2019s ability to enforce its procedural rules,\u201d ibid., we\nhave held that when a state court has relied on an ade-\nquate and independent state procedural ground in denying\na prisoner\u2019s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain\nfederal habeas relief. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729\u2013730.\n   To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of\ndefaulted claims is not absolute.

S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney\u2019s error\nchargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.\nSee Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no\nright to counsel\u2014as is the case in the postconviction set-\nting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555\n(1987)\u2014the client bears the risk of all attorney errors\nmade in the course of the representation, regardless of the\negregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754\n(\u201c[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney\u2019s error that matters,\nbut that it constitutes a violation of petitioner\u2019s right to\ncounsel, so that the error must be seen as an external\nfactor\u201d).\n                                B\n   In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct\nto conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner\u2019s proce-\ndural default may be excused when it is attributable to\nabandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman\u2019s\nrationale for attributing the attorney\u2019s acts and omissions\nto the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased\nacting as the client\u2019s agent, \u201cwell-settled principles of\nagency law,\u201d 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging\nthe client with his lawyer\u2019s mistakes. The attorney\u2019s\nmistakes may therefore be understood as an \u201cexternal\nfactor,\u201d ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may jus-\ntify excusing the prisoner\u2019s procedural default.\n   I likewise agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion, ante, at 15,\nthat Maples\u2019 two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi\nMunanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples\nby the time the Alabama trial court entered its order\ndenying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court\nobserves, ante, at 15\u201316, without informing Maples or\nseeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw\nfrom Maples\u2019 case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell\u2019s employ and accepted new positions\nthat precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.\n4                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as\nMaples\u2019 agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency\n\u00a7119, Comment b (1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d),\nand thus terminated their authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf, id., \u00a7118. As a result, Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-\nHousz\u2019s failure to take action in response to the trial\ncourt\u2019s order should not be imputed to Maples.\n   It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Ma-\nples was left unrepresented during the relevant window\nbetween the Alabama trial court\u2019s dismissal of his post-\nconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples\u2019\nown allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition,\nMaples alleged that, at the time he sought postconvic-\ntion relief in Alabama trial court, he \u201cwas represented by\nSullivan & Cromwell of New York, New York.\u201d App. 256.\nAlthough the petition went on to identify Munanka and\nIngen-Housz as \u201cthe two Sullivan lawyers handling the\nmatter,\u201d id., at 257, its statement that Maples was \u201crepre-\nsented\u201d by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples\nviewed himself as having retained the services of the firm\nas a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. \u201cWhen a\nclient retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the\npresumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have\nbeen retained.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Govern-\ning Lawyers \u00a731, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly,\nin connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial\ncourt to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan & Cromwell\npartner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating\nthat the firm\u2019s lawyers \u201chandle pro bono cases on an indi-\nvidual basis\u201d and that the lawyers who had appeared in\nMaples\u2019 case had followed that practice, \u201cattempt[ing] not\nto use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. But Maples\u2019 habeas petition is\nthe pleading that initiated the current litigation; and\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsurely the allegations that it contained should be given\npriority over representations made to prior courts.*\n   In any case, even if Maples had no attorney-client rela-\ntionship with the Sullivan & Cromwell firm, Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz were surely not the only Sullivan &\nCromwell lawyers who represented Maples on an individ-\nual basis. De Leeuw\u2019s affidavit acknowledged that he had\n\u201cbeen involved in [Maples\u2019] case since the summer of\n2001,\u201d ibid., roughly a year before Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz left Sullivan & Cromwell, and it further stated that\nafter \u201cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka\u201d learned of the\ncourt\u2019s initial order denying the State\u2019s motion to dismiss\nMaples\u2019 postconviction petition in December 2001, \u201cthe\nlawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared\nfor the evidentiary hearing\u201d Maples had requested, id., at\n258a. Moreover, when Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\nFelice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before\nthe Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to\nextend the deadline, she stated that she had \u201cworked on\n[Maples\u2019] case since October 14, 2002,\u201d App. 231, months\nbefore the procedural default took place.\n   According to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw\u2019s\naffidavit does not make clear how he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court says that the allegations in Maples\u2019 own habeas petition\nare not \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d ante, at 17\u201318, n. 8, because Maples\u2019\nlawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest\nwhen they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the\neffect of Maples\u2019 statement was to implicate Sullivan & Cromwell as a\nfirm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the\nSullivan & Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the\ncase later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been\nconceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples\u2019\ninterest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition\u2019s state-\nment raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is\nwhether the statement was true. And if Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s in-\nvolvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only\nreinforces the truth.\n6                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples\u2019 case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and\nIngen-Housz were among those who prepared for the\nanticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy\u2019s motion does\nnot make clear what her \u201cwor[k]\u201d entailed. But there is\nlittle doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the\nonly attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that\nDe Leeuw was \u201cinvolved\u201d and Duffy \u201cworked\u201d as lawyers\nfor Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).\nDe Leeuw\u2019s distinction between \u201cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr.\nMunanka\u201d and \u201cthe lawyers working on his case for Mr.\nMaples\u201d would have been senseless if the latter category\ndid not extend beyond the two named attorneys.\n   In sum, there is every indication that when the trial\ncourt entered its order dismissing Maples\u2019 postconviction\npetition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented\nby a team of attorneys in Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s New York\noffice. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of\nthese attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\nappearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not\nsought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. See\nante, at 18\u201319. The Court does not, however, explain why\nthese facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples\u2019\nagents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the\ncase that did not require court appearance\u2014which would\ncertainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing\ndeadlines. The Court\u2019s quotation from the Restatement of\nAgency, ante, at 18, that the \u201cfailure to acquire a qualifica-\ntion by the agent without which it is illegal to do an au-\nthorized act . . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act,\u201d 1\nRestatement 2d, \u00a7111, at 290, omits the crucial condition\ncontained at the end of the section: \u201cif thereafter he [the\nagent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts,\nwould not consent to the further exercise of the authority.\u201d\nThere was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer\nthat Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Ala-\nbama court. Though it would have been \u201cillegal\u201d for these\nattorneys to file a notice of appeal without being author-\nized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from\nfirst seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a\nnotice of appeal.\n   It would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurispru-\ndence to disregard all attorney errors committed before\nadmission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap\nto disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed\nbefore the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even\nif these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples\u2019 agents for\npurposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were\nat least his agents for purposes of advising him of the\nimpending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of\ncounsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.\nWhat happened here is simply \u201c[a]ttorney ignorance or\ninadvertence\u201d of the sort that does not furnish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753.\n   But even leaving aside the question of Maples\u2019 \u201cunad-\nmitted\u201d attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell, Maples had a\nfully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance,\nin the person of local counsel, John Butler. There is no\nsupport for the Court\u2019s conclusion that Butler \u201cdid not\neven begin to represent Maples.\u201d Ante, at 19. True, the\naffidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the\nproceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that\nhe had \u201cno substantive involvement\u201d with the case, and\nthat he had \u201cagreed to serve as local counsel only.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of \u201csubstantive in-\nvolvement\u201d in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer\u2019s\nethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a\ndenial of any agency role at all. A local attorney\u2019s \u201cnon-\nsubstantive\u201d involvement would surely include, at a min-\nimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising\n8                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u201csubstantive\u201d counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did\nButler\u2019s explanation for his failure to act when he received\na copy of the trial court\u2019s order sound in abandonment.\nButler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order\nbecause he did not consider Maples to be his client. In-\nstead, based on \u201cpast practice\u201d and the content of the\norder, Butler \u201cassumed\u201d that Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan\n& Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n256a.\n   The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that\n\u201cButler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New\nYork firm\u201d demonstrates Butler\u2019s \u201cdisclaimer of any genu-\ninely representative role.\u201d Ante, at 19. By equating the\nvery attorney error that contributed to Maples\u2019 procedural\ndefault with the absence of an agency relationship, the\nCourt ensures that today\u2019s opinion will serve as a template\nfor future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman\u2019s\nholding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will\nnot furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501\nU. S., at 752\u2013754. The trick will be to allege, not that\ncounsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel\u2019s ineffec-\ntiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely repre-\nsentative agent. No precedent should be so easily circum-\nvented by word games, but the damage is particularly\nacute when the affected precedent is so firmly \u201cgrounded\nin concerns of comity and federalism.\u201d Id., at 730.\n   The Court\u2019s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion\nthat Butler was not Maples\u2019 agent is to point out that a\nprosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him\nof the defaulted appeal. See ante, at 20. The Court rea-\nsons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples\nhad been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate\nwith a represented party would have been a violation of\nethical standards. Ibid. But even if this supposition is\ncorrect, it is hard to understand what it proves. What\nmatters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really\nwas abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler\u2019s conduct\nafter learning about the default further belies any such\ncontention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooper-\nate with Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, filing\npapers as \u201cCounsel for Mr. Maples\u201d or \u201cLocal Counsel for\nPetitioner Cory Maples\u201d in multiple courts in an attempt\nto rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had\nButler reassumed his representational duties after having\nabandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a\nconclusion of abandonment interruptus.\n                               II\n   Maples argues in the alternative that his default should\nbe excused because his right to due process was violated\nwhen the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Mu-\nnanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s copies of the court\u2019s dismissal\norder were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,\nour decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),\nestablishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.\n   We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax\nsale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional\nreasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the prop-\nerty owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It\nis questionable whether that holding has any relevance to\nthe circumstances here, which involved not the institution\nof proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather\nthe issuance of an order in a pending case that was insti-\ntuted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful\nwhether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a\ncourt\u2019s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules cer-\ntainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute require-\nment. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides\nthat \u201c[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]\ndoes not affect the time for appeal or relieve\u2014or authorize\nthe court to relieve\u2014a party for failing to appeal within\n10                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure (4)(a).\u201d And although Federal Rule\nof Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for\nfiling an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not\nreceive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment\nor order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to\nreopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).\n    There is no need to grapple with this question, however,\nbecause Butler received a copy of the trial court\u2019s order.\n\u201cUnder our system of representative litigation, \u2018each party\n. . . is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which\ncan be charged upon [his] attorney.\u2019 \u201d Irwin v. Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (quoting Link\nv. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962)). The notice to\nButler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.\n                         *   *     *\n  One suspects that today\u2019s decision is motivated in large\npart by an understandable sense of frustration with the\nState\u2019s refusal to waive Maples\u2019 procedural default in\nthe interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well\nexplain the Court\u2019s lengthy indictment of Alabama\u2019s gen-\neral procedures for providing representation to capital\ndefendants, ante, at 2\u20134, a portion of the Court\u2019s opinion\nthat is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be\notherwise inexplicable.\n  But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing\nMaples\u2019 procedural default here, it does so whenever a\ndefendant\u2019s procedural default is caused by his attorney.\nThat is simply not the law\u2014and cannot be, if the states\nare to have an orderly system of criminal litigation con-\nducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand\non its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural\ndefault even when counsel is to blame.

Argued October 4, 2011\u2014January 18, 2012\nPetitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to\n  death in Alabama state court. In 2001, Maples sought postconviction\n  relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32. Maples alleged, among\n  other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys\n  failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth\n  Amendment. His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,\n  Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the\n  New York offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. As required\n  by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer,\n  John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice. Butler made\n  clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement\n  in the case.\n     In 2002, while Maples\u2019 state postconviction petition was pending,\n  Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell. Their new em-\n  ployment disabled them from representing Maples. They did not in-\n  form Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as\n  his counsel. In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial\n  court\u2019s leave to withdraw. No other Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\n  entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise no-\n  tified the court of a change in Maples\u2019 representation. Thus, Munan-\n  ka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples\u2019 listed, and only, at-\n  torneys of record.\n     The trial court denied Maples\u2019 petition in May 2003. Notices of the\n  order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &\n  Cromwell\u2019s address. When those postings were returned, unopened,\n  the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing. Butler also re-\n  ceived a copy of the order, but did not act on it. With no attorney of\n2                           MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    record in fact acting on Maples\u2019 behalf, the 42-day period Maples had\n    to file a notice of appeal ran out.\n       About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent\n    a letter directly to Maples. The letter informed Maples of the missed\n    deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a\n    federal habeas petition. Maples immediately contacted his mother,\n    who called Sullivan & Cromwell. Three Sullivan & Cromwell attor-\n    neys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order,\n    thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. The court denied the\n    motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ\n    of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-\n    time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.\n       Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief. Both the District\n    Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the\n    procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\u2019 failure timely to appeal\n    the state trial court\u2019s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postcon-\n    viction relief.\n    Held: Maples has shown the requisite \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his procedur-\n    al default.

There, the Court\nfound that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition\ncan be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney\u2019s unprofes-\nsional conduct may sometimes be an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d\njustifying equitable tolling. Id., at ___, ___\u2013___. The Court recog-\nnized that an attorney\u2019s negligence does not provide a basis for tolling\na statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland\u2019s claim that he was aban-\ndoned by his attorney, however, if true, \u201cwould suffice to establish ex-\ntraordinary circumstances beyond his control,\u201d id., at ___ (opinion of\nALITO, J.). Pp. 11\u201315.\n  (b) From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after\ntime ran out for appealing the trial court\u2019s denial of that petition,\nMaples\u2019 sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and\nButler. Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serv-\ning as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period. Pp. 15\u201321.\n     (1) The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented\nMaples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as\na result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the\n42-day period. But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nsevered their agency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial\ncourt\u2019s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey\nthat they remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys,\nnot Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law re-\nquires the clerk to furnish.\n  The State asserts that, after Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s depar-\nture, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as\nMaples\u2019 counsel. At the time of the default, however, those attorneys\nhad not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their\nappearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, and had done nothing to inform the\nAlabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz. Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Pp. 15\u201319.\n     (2) Maples\u2019 only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did\nnot even begin to represent Maples. Butler told Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of en-\nabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive\nrole in the case. Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples\u2019\n\u201cagent in any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d Holland, 560 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of ALITO, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial court\u2019s\norder, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm\nlawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did the State treat But-\nler as Maples\u2019 actual representative. Notably, the Alabama Assistant\nAttorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding\n4                         MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an\n    opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19\u201320.\n          (3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of\n    record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his\n    representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive no-\n    tice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for com-\n    mencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked coun-\n    sel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\n    complying with the State\u2019s procedural rule.

In the unusual circum-\n    stances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness\n    point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Ma-\n    ples\u2019 procedural default.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sen-\ntenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.\nAt trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers,\nminimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging\nineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial\ninfirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written\nby two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associ-\nated with the same New York-based large law firm. An\nAlabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved\nthe admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice. As\nunderstood by New York counsel, local counsel would\nfacilitate their appearance, but would undertake no sub-\nstantive involvement in the case.\n  In the summer of 2002, while Maples\u2019 postconviction\npetition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his\nNew York attorneys left the law firm; their new employ-\nment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.\nThey did not inform Maples of their departure and conse-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek\nthe Alabama trial court\u2019s leave to withdraw. Neither they\nnor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able\nto handle Maples\u2019 case.\n  In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples\u2019\npetition. Notices of the court\u2019s order were posted to the\nNew York attorneys at the address of the law firm with\nwhich they had been associated. Those postings were re-\nturned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt-\ned no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact\nacting on Maples\u2019 behalf, the time to appeal ran out.\n  Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,\nthe Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the\nprocedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\u2019 failure\ntimely to appeal the Alabama trial court\u2019s order denying\nhim postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was\nblameless for the default.\n  The sole question this Court has taken up for review is\nwhether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples\u2019 case, there\nis \u201ccause\u201d to excuse the default. Maples maintains that\nthere is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly repre-\nsenting him had abandoned the case without leave of\ncourt, without informing Maples they could no longer\nrepresent him, and without securing any recorded substi-\ntution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Ma-\nples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state\npostconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to\nprotect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just\nsystem would lay the default at Maples\u2019 death-cell door.\nSatisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

He\nalleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and under-\nfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious\nintoxication defense, did not object to several egregious\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully un-\nderprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State\nresponded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples\u2019\npetition.

THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Having exhausted his state postconviction remedies,\nMaples sought federal habeas corpus relief. Addressing\nthe ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples\nstated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples\nhad forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed,\npresent the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32)\npetition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal\nfrom the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition. That proce-\ndural default, the State maintained, precluded federal-\ncourt consideration of the claims.6 Maples replied that the\ndefault should be excused, because he missed the appeal\ndeadline \u201cthrough no fault of his own.\u201d App. 262 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  The District Court determined that Maples had default-\ned his ineffective-assistance claims, and that he had not\nshown \u201ccause\u201d sufficient to overcome the default. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 49a\u201355a. The court understood Maples to\nargue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel,\nnot any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama,\nprovided the requisite \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his failure to meet\nAlabama\u2019s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. Id., at 55a. Such an\nargument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this\nCourt, in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), had\nheld that the ineffectiveness of postconviction appellate\ncounsel could not qualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (citing Coleman, 501 U. S., at 751).\n  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Ma-\nples v. Allen, 586 F. 3d 879 (2009) (per curiam). In accord\nwith the District Court, the Court of Appeals\u2019 majority\nheld that Maples defaulted his ineffective-assistance\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In opposing Maples\u2019 request for an out-of-time appeal, the State\n\nargued to the Alabama Supreme Court that such an appeal was unwar-\nranted. In that context, the State noted that Maples \u201cmay still present\nhis postconviction claims to [the federal habeas] court.\u201d 35 Record, Doc.\nNo. 55, p. 22, n. 4.

THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1977).\n   Given the single issue on which we granted review, we\nwill assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Ala-\nbama Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 refusal to consider\nMaples\u2019 ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independ-\nent and adequate state procedural ground: namely,\nMaples\u2019 failure to satisfy Alabama\u2019s Rule requiring a\nnotice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial\ncourt\u2019s final order. Accordingly, we confine our considera-\ntion to the question whether Maples has shown cause to\nexcuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.\n   Cause for a procedural default exists where \u201csomething\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him[,] . . . \u2018impeded [his] efforts to comply\nwith the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986);\nemphasis in original). Negligence on the part of a prison-\ner\u2019s postconviction attorney does not qualify as \u201ccause.\u201d\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in\nColeman, because the attorney is the prisoner\u2019s agent, and\nunder \u201cwell-settled principles of agency law,\u201d the principal\nbears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his\nagent. Id., at 753\u2013754. See also Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (\u201cUnder our\nsystem of representative litigation, \u2018each party is deemed\nbound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Link v.\nWabash R. Co., 370 U.

Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753\u2013\n754. We do not disturb that general rule.\n   A markedly different situation is presented, however, when\nan attorney abandons his client without notice, and there-\nby occasions the default.

Holland presented two issues:\nfirst, whether the \u00a72244(d) time limitation can be tolled\nfor equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney\u2019s\nunprofessional conduct can ever count as an \u201cextraordi-\nnary circumstance\u201d justifying equitable tolling. 560 U. S.,\nat ___, ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 1, 16\u201317) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.\n   On the second issue, the Court recognized that an at-\ntorney\u2019s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing\ndeadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory\ntime limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___\u2013___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 5\u20136); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327,\n336 (2007). The Holland petitioner, however, urged that\nattorney negligence was not the gravamen of his com-\nplaint.

S.,\nat ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 5\u20137). Holland\u2019s plea fit the latter\ncategory: He alleged abandonment \u201cevidenced by counsel\u2019s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner\u2019s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id.,\nat ___\u2013___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3\u20134, 20). If\ntrue, JUSTICE ALITO explained, \u201cpetitioner\u2019s allegations\nwould suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances\nbeyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a liti-\ngant cannot be held constructively responsible for the\nconduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent\nin any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).7\n  We agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot\nbe charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who\nhas abandoned him. Nor can a client be faulted for failing\nto act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe\nhis attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.\nWe therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his\nattorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), involved tolling of a federal\n\ntime bar, while Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), concerned\ncause for excusing a procedural default in state court. See Holland, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).

Unknown to\nMaples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his\nattorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from\nthe trial court\u2019s order.\n                             1\n   The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell repre-\nsented Maples throughout his state postconviction pro-\nceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot\nestablish abandonment by counsel continuing through the\nsix weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial\ncourt\u2019s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is\nundisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their\nagency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the\ntwo attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw\nfrom the case).

Their new employment\u2014Munanka as a law clerk\nfor a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the\nEuropean Commission in Belgium\u2014disabled them from\ncontinuing to represent Maples.

Regarding this assertion, we\nnote, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submit-\nted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples\u2019\nrequest that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,\nat 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been \u201cin-\nvolved in [Maples\u2019] case since the summer of 2001.\u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied\nthe State\u2019s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw\ninformed the court, Sullivan & Cromwell \u201clawyers working\non this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]\nevidentiary hearing.\u201d Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &\nCromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit\nsubmitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,\nthat she \u201cha[d] worked on [Maples\u2019] case since October 14,\n2002.\u201d App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy de-\nscribed what their \u201cinvolve[ment]\u201d or \u201cwor[k] on [Maples\u2019]\ncase\u201d entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,\nother than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still\nwith Sullivan & Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in\npreparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw\nidentify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed\non Maples\u2019 case between Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s\ndepartures and the firm\u2019s receipt of the telephone call\nfrom Maples\u2019 mother.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sul-\n\nlivan & Cromwell\u2019s representation of Maples after the default. As\namici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the\nfirm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors\net al. as Amici Curiae 23\u201327. Following the default, the firm\u2019s interest\nin avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples\u2019\nstrongest argument\u2014i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,\n18                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The slim record on activity at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nhowever, does not warrant a remand to determine more\nprecisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Mu-\nnanka and Ingen-Housz. For the facts essential to our\ndecision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the\nSullivan & Cromwell attorneys who later came forward\u2014\nDe Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer\u2014had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\ntheir appearances on Maples\u2019 behalf, and had done noth-\ning to inform the Alabama court that they wished to sub-\nstitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of\nthese attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restate-\nment (Second) \u00a7111 (The \u201cfailure to acquire a qualification\nby the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized\nact . . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act.\u201d).9 What\nthey did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntherefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &\nCromwell did not cede Maples\u2019 representation to a new attorney, who\ncould have made Maples\u2019 abandonment argument plain to the Court of\nAppeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and\noral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast\nresponsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court.\nGiven Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s conflict of interest, Maples\u2019 federal habeas\npetition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evi-\ndence that Maples, prior to the default, ever \u201cviewed himself\u201d as repre-\nsented by \u201cthe firm,\u201d see post, at 4, rather than by his attorneys of\nrecord, Munanka and Ingen-Housz.\n   9 The dissent argues that the Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no\n\nbasis \u201cto infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.\u201d\nPost, at 6\u20137. While that may be true, it is irrelevant. What the attor-\nneys could have inferred is that Maples would not have wanted them to\nfile a notice of appeal on his behalf prior to their admission to practice\nin Alabama, for doing so would be \u201cillegal,\u201d post, at 7 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). See also 1 Restatement (Second) \u00a7111, Comment\nb, quoted supra, at 16.

At the time critical to preserving Maples\u2019\naccess to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwere not Maples\u2019 authorized agents.\n                              2\n   Maples\u2019 only other attorney of record, local counsel\nButler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not\neven begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munan-\nka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel\nonly for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attor-\nneys to appear pro hac vice. Supra, at 5\u20136. Lacking the\nnecessary \u201cresources, available time [and] experience,\u201d\nButler told the two Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he\nwould not \u201cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\u201d Ibid.\nThat the minimal participation he undertook was incon-\nsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, un-\nderscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because\nButler signed on as local counsel.\n   In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other\nthan to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro\nhac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler\u2019s and De\nLeeuw\u2019s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n255a\u2013258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not\n\u201coperat[e] as [Maples\u2019] agent in any meaningful sense of\nthat word.\u201d Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).\nThe first is Butler\u2019s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of\nthe trial court\u2019s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact\nSullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were\ntaking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to\nbelieve that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a\ncopy of the court\u2019s order, see App. 225 (indicating that\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz were CC\u2019d on the order), But-\nler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New York\nfirm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely repre-\nsentative role in the case.\n20                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Notably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples\u2019 actual\nrepresentative. Assistant Attorney General Hayden ad-\ndressed the letter informing Maples of the default directly\nto Maples in prison. See supra, at 8. Hayden sent no copy\nto, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed\nas counsel of record for Maples. Lawyers in Alabama have\nan ethical obligation to refrain from communicating direct-\nly with an opposing party known to be represented by\ncounsel. See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003);\nAla. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all\ndocuments \u201cbe made upon the attorney of record\u201d). In\nwriting directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this\nethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden\nmust have believed that Maples was no longer represented\nby counsel, out-of-state or local.10\n  In sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no\ntime before the missed deadline was Butler serving as\nMaples\u2019 agent \u201cin any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d\nHolland, 560 U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op.,\nat 6).\n                             3\n  Not only was Maples left without any functioning attor-\nney of record, the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz,\nand Butler as his representatives meant that he had no\nright personally to receive notice. See supra, at 16. He in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Itbears note, as well, that the State served its response to Maples\u2019\nRule 32 petition only on Munanka at Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s New York\naddress, not on Butler. App. 26. While the State may not be obligated\nto serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York\nrather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the\nState was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve. Conforming\nthe State\u2019s Rule to common practice, in 2006, the Alabama Supreme\nCourt amended the provision on appearances by out-of-state counsel to\neliminate the requirement that such attorneys associate local counsel\nwhen representing indigent criminal defendants pro bono in postconvic-\ntion proceedings.

Had counsel of record or the State\u2019s\nattorney informed Maples of his plight before the time to\nappeal ran out, he could have filed a notice of appeal\nhimself11 or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys.12\nGiven no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and\nwilling to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\ncomplying with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\n                              C\n   \u201cThe cause and prejudice requirement,\u201d we have said,\n\u201cshows due regard for States\u2019 finality and comity interests\nwhile ensuring that \u2018fundamental fairness [remains] the\ncentral concern of the writ of habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 393 (2004) (quoting Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984)). In the unusual\ncircumstances of this case, principles of agency law and\nfundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There\nwas indeed cause to excuse Maples\u2019 procedural default.\nThrough no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance\nof any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama\nallows for noticing an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of\npostconviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason\nto suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se\nstatus. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circum-\nstances quite beyond his control.

Unbeknownst to peti-\ntioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation\ndue to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortu-\nnate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the\ntwo young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in\nhis state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by\nthese two attorneys of new employment that precluded\nthem from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to\nnotify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to\nwithdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure\nof the firm that they left to monitor the status of petition-\ner\u2019s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of\nthe decision denying petitioner\u2019s request for state post-\nconviction relief was received in that firm\u2019s offices, the\nfailure of the firm\u2019s mail room to route that important\ncommunication to either another member of the firm or to\nthe departed attorneys\u2019 new addresses; (7) the failure of\nthe clerk\u2019s office to take any action when the envelope\ncontaining that notice came back unopened; and (8) local\ncounsel\u2019s very limited conception of the role that he was\nobligated to play in petitioner\u2019s representation. Under\nthese unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner\u2019s\nattorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-\n2                    MAPLES v.

See Brief for Petitioner 3\u20136. But whatever\nmay be said about Alabama\u2019s system, I do not think that\nAlabama\u2019s system had much if anything to do with peti-\ntioner\u2019s misfortune. The quality of petitioner\u2019s representa-\ntion at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet\nthe deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial\nof his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any im-\nportant connection between what happened in this case\nand Alabama\u2019s system for providing representation for\nprisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to\npetition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other\nStates, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to\nrepresent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that\nmost of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.\nId., at 4. Petitioner\u2019s brief states that the Alabama system\nhad \u201ca direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the\nprocedural default at issue,\u201d id., at 3, but a similar combi-\nnation of untoward events could have occurred if petition-\ner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were\nappointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The\nfirm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one\nof the country\u2019s most prestigious and expensive, and I\nhave little doubt that the vast majority of criminal de-\nfendants would think that they had won the lottery if they\nwere given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys\nfrom such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it \u201cseemed as\nthough Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys\nworking at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to rep-\nresent Maples pro bono\u201d).\n   What occurred here was not a predictable consequence\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Court now concludes\nthat Maples has established cause for his procedural\ndefault by reason of abandonment by his attorneys. Be-\ncause I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because\nMaples\u2019 alternative argument fares no better, I would\naffirm the judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers,\nthe principle that errors in state criminal trials should\nbe remedied in state court. As we have long recognized,\nfederal habeas review for state prisoners imposes signifi-\ncant costs on the States, undermining not only their prac-\ntical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,\nsee Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126\u2013127 (1982), but also\nthe primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitu-\ntional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id.,\nat 128. We have further recognized that \u201c[t]hese costs are\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparticularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a\nprocedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitu-\ntional claims in state court.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 748 (1991). In that situation, the prisoner has\n\u201cdeprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\nthose claims in the first instance,\u201d id., at 732, thereby\nleaving the state courts without \u201ca chance to mend their\nown fences and avoid federal intrusion,\u201d Engle, 456 U. S.,\nat 129. For that reason, and because permitting federal-\ncourt review of defaulted claims would \u201cundercu[t] the\nState\u2019s ability to enforce its procedural rules,\u201d ibid., we\nhave held that when a state court has relied on an ade-\nquate and independent state procedural ground in denying\na prisoner\u2019s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain\nfederal habeas relief. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729\u2013730.\n   To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of\ndefaulted claims is not absolute. A habeas petitioner\u2019s de-\nfault in state court will not bar federal habeas review if\n\u201cthe petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,\u201d\nid., at 748\u2014\u201ccause\u201d constituting \u201csomething external to\nthe petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed\nto him,\u201d that impeded compliance with the State\u2019s proce-\ndural rule, id., at 753. As a general matter, an attorney\u2019s\nmistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard \u201cbecause\nthe attorney is the petitioner\u2019s agent when acting, or\nfailing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the\npetitioner must \u2018bear the risk of attorney error.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(quoting Murray v.

S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney\u2019s error\nchargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.\nSee Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no\nright to counsel\u2014as is the case in the postconviction set-\nting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555\n(1987)\u2014the client bears the risk of all attorney errors\nmade in the course of the representation, regardless of the\negregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754\n(\u201c[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney\u2019s error that matters,\nbut that it constitutes a violation of petitioner\u2019s right to\ncounsel, so that the error must be seen as an external\nfactor\u201d).\n                                B\n   In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct\nto conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner\u2019s proce-\ndural default may be excused when it is attributable to\nabandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman\u2019s\nrationale for attributing the attorney\u2019s acts and omissions\nto the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased\nacting as the client\u2019s agent, \u201cwell-settled principles of\nagency law,\u201d 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging\nthe client with his lawyer\u2019s mistakes. The attorney\u2019s\nmistakes may therefore be understood as an \u201cexternal\nfactor,\u201d ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may jus-\ntify excusing the prisoner\u2019s procedural default.\n   I likewise agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion, ante, at 15,\nthat Maples\u2019 two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi\nMunanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples\nby the time the Alabama trial court entered its order\ndenying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court\nobserves, ante, at 15\u201316, without informing Maples or\nseeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw\nfrom Maples\u2019 case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell\u2019s employ and accepted new positions\nthat precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.\n4                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as\nMaples\u2019 agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency\n\u00a7119, Comment b (1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d),\nand thus terminated their authority to act on Maples\u2019\nbehalf, id., \u00a7118. As a result, Munanka\u2019s and Ingen-\nHousz\u2019s failure to take action in response to the trial\ncourt\u2019s order should not be imputed to Maples.\n   It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Ma-\nples was left unrepresented during the relevant window\nbetween the Alabama trial court\u2019s dismissal of his post-\nconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples\u2019\nown allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition,\nMaples alleged that, at the time he sought postconvic-\ntion relief in Alabama trial court, he \u201cwas represented by\nSullivan & Cromwell of New York, New York.\u201d App. 256.\nAlthough the petition went on to identify Munanka and\nIngen-Housz as \u201cthe two Sullivan lawyers handling the\nmatter,\u201d id., at 257, its statement that Maples was \u201crepre-\nsented\u201d by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples\nviewed himself as having retained the services of the firm\nas a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. \u201cWhen a\nclient retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the\npresumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have\nbeen retained.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Govern-\ning Lawyers \u00a731, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly,\nin connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial\ncourt to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan & Cromwell\npartner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating\nthat the firm\u2019s lawyers \u201chandle pro bono cases on an indi-\nvidual basis\u201d and that the lawyers who had appeared in\nMaples\u2019 case had followed that practice, \u201cattempt[ing] not\nto use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 257a.

Moreover, when Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\nFelice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before\nthe Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to\nextend the deadline, she stated that she had \u201cworked on\n[Maples\u2019] case since October 14, 2002,\u201d App. 231, months\nbefore the procedural default took place.\n   According to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw\u2019s\naffidavit does not make clear how he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court says that the allegations in Maples\u2019 own habeas petition\nare not \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d ante, at 17\u201318, n. 8, because Maples\u2019\nlawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest\nwhen they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the\neffect of Maples\u2019 statement was to implicate Sullivan & Cromwell as a\nfirm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the\nSullivan & Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the\ncase later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been\nconceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples\u2019\ninterest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition\u2019s state-\nment raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is\nwhether the statement was true. And if Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s in-\nvolvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only\nreinforces the truth.\n6                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples\u2019 case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and\nIngen-Housz were among those who prepared for the\nanticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy\u2019s motion does\nnot make clear what her \u201cwor[k]\u201d entailed. But there is\nlittle doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the\nonly attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that\nDe Leeuw was \u201cinvolved\u201d and Duffy \u201cworked\u201d as lawyers\nfor Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).\nDe Leeuw\u2019s distinction between \u201cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr.\nMunanka\u201d and \u201cthe lawyers working on his case for Mr.\nMaples\u201d would have been senseless if the latter category\ndid not extend beyond the two named attorneys.\n   In sum, there is every indication that when the trial\ncourt entered its order dismissing Maples\u2019 postconviction\npetition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented\nby a team of attorneys in Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s New York\noffice. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of\nthese attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\nappearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not\nsought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. See\nante, at 18\u201319. The Court does not, however, explain why\nthese facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples\u2019\nagents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the\ncase that did not require court appearance\u2014which would\ncertainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing\ndeadlines. The Court\u2019s quotation from the Restatement of\nAgency, ante, at 18, that the \u201cfailure to acquire a qualifica-\ntion by the agent without which it is illegal to do an au-\nthorized act . . . terminates the agent\u2019s authority to act,\u201d 1\nRestatement 2d, \u00a7111, at 290, omits the crucial condition\ncontained at the end of the section: \u201cif thereafter he [the\nagent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts,\nwould not consent to the further exercise of the authority.\u201d\nThere was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer\nthat Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Ala-\nbama court. Though it would have been \u201cillegal\u201d for these\nattorneys to file a notice of appeal without being author-\nized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from\nfirst seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a\nnotice of appeal.\n   It would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurispru-\ndence to disregard all attorney errors committed before\nadmission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap\nto disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed\nbefore the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even\nif these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples\u2019 agents for\npurposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were\nat least his agents for purposes of advising him of the\nimpending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of\ncounsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.\nWhat happened here is simply \u201c[a]ttorney ignorance or\ninadvertence\u201d of the sort that does not furnish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753.\n   But even leaving aside the question of Maples\u2019 \u201cunad-\nmitted\u201d attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell, Maples had a\nfully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance,\nin the person of local counsel, John Butler. There is no\nsupport for the Court\u2019s conclusion that Butler \u201cdid not\neven begin to represent Maples.\u201d Ante, at 19. True, the\naffidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the\nproceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that\nhe had \u201cno substantive involvement\u201d with the case, and\nthat he had \u201cagreed to serve as local counsel only.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of \u201csubstantive in-\nvolvement\u201d in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer\u2019s\nethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a\ndenial of any agency role at all. A local attorney\u2019s \u201cnon-\nsubstantive\u201d involvement would surely include, at a min-\nimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising\n8                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u201csubstantive\u201d counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did\nButler\u2019s explanation for his failure to act when he received\na copy of the trial court\u2019s order sound in abandonment.\nButler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order\nbecause he did not consider Maples to be his client. In-\nstead, based on \u201cpast practice\u201d and the content of the\norder, Butler \u201cassumed\u201d that Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan\n& Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n256a.\n   The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that\n\u201cButler\u2019s failure even to place a phone call to the New\nYork firm\u201d demonstrates Butler\u2019s \u201cdisclaimer of any genu-\ninely representative role.\u201d Ante, at 19. By equating the\nvery attorney error that contributed to Maples\u2019 procedural\ndefault with the absence of an agency relationship, the\nCourt ensures that today\u2019s opinion will serve as a template\nfor future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman\u2019s\nholding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will\nnot furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501\nU. S., at 752\u2013754. The trick will be to allege, not that\ncounsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel\u2019s ineffec-\ntiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely repre-\nsentative agent. No precedent should be so easily circum-\nvented by word games, but the damage is particularly\nacute when the affected precedent is so firmly \u201cgrounded\nin concerns of comity and federalism.\u201d Id., at 730.\n   The Court\u2019s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion\nthat Butler was not Maples\u2019 agent is to point out that a\nprosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him\nof the defaulted appeal. See ante, at 20. The Court rea-\nsons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples\nhad been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate\nwith a represented party would have been a violation of\nethical standards. Ibid. But even if this supposition is\ncorrect, it is hard to understand what it proves. What\nmatters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really\nwas abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler\u2019s conduct\nafter learning about the default further belies any such\ncontention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooper-\nate with Maples\u2019 lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, filing\npapers as \u201cCounsel for Mr. Maples\u201d or \u201cLocal Counsel for\nPetitioner Cory Maples\u201d in multiple courts in an attempt\nto rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had\nButler reassumed his representational duties after having\nabandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a\nconclusion of abandonment interruptus.\n                               II\n   Maples argues in the alternative that his default should\nbe excused because his right to due process was violated\nwhen the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Mu-\nnanka\u2019s and Ingen-Housz\u2019s copies of the court\u2019s dismissal\norder were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,\nour decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),\nestablishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.\n   We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax\nsale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional\nreasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the prop-\nerty owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It\nis questionable whether that holding has any relevance to\nthe circumstances here, which involved not the institution\nof proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather\nthe issuance of an order in a pending case that was insti-\ntuted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful\nwhether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a\ncourt\u2019s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules cer-\ntainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute require-\nment. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides\nthat \u201c[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]\ndoes not affect the time for appeal or relieve\u2014or authorize\nthe court to relieve\u2014a party for failing to appeal within\n10                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure (4)(a).\u201d And although Federal Rule\nof Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for\nfiling an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not\nreceive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment\nor order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to\nreopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).\n    There is no need to grapple with this question, however,\nbecause Butler received a copy of the trial court\u2019s order.\n\u201cUnder our system of representative litigation, \u2018each party\n. . . is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which\ncan be charged upon [his] attorney.\u2019 \u201d Irwin v. Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (quoting Link\nv. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962)). The notice to\nButler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.\n                         *   *     *\n  One suspects that today\u2019s decision is motivated in large\npart by an understandable sense of frustration with the\nState\u2019s refusal to waive Maples\u2019 procedural default in\nthe interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well\nexplain the Court\u2019s lengthy indictment of Alabama\u2019s gen-\neral procedures for providing representation to capital\ndefendants, ante, at 2\u20134, a portion of the Court\u2019s opinion\nthat is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be\notherwise inexplicable.\n  But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing\nMaples\u2019 procedural default here, it does so whenever a\ndefendant\u2019s procedural default is caused by his attorney.\nThat is simply not the law\u2014and cannot be, if the states\nare to have an orderly system of criminal litigation con-\nducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand\non its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural\ndefault even when counsel is to blame. Because a faithful\napplication of those precedents leads to the conclusion that\nMaples has not demonstrated cause to excuse his proce-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndural default; and because the reasoning by which the\nCourt justifies the opposite conclusion invites future evis-\nceration of the principle that defendants are responsible\nfor the mistakes of their attorneys; I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
