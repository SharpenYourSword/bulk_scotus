THOMAS, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA \n\n        DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n          No. 10–63. Argued October 4, 2011—January 18, 2012\nPetitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to\n  death in Alabama state court. In 2001, Maples sought postconviction\n  relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32. Maples alleged, among\n  other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys\n  failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth\n  Amendment. His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,\n  Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the\n  New York offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. As required\n  by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer,\n  John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice. Butler made\n  clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement\n  in the case.\n     In 2002, while Maples’ state postconviction petition was pending,\n  Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell. Their new em-\n  ployment disabled them from representing Maples. They did not in-\n  form Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as\n  his counsel. In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial\n  court’s leave to withdraw. No other Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\n  entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise no-\n  tified the court of a change in Maples’ representation. Thus, Munan-\n  ka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples’ listed, and only, at-\n  torneys of record.\n     The trial court denied Maples’ petition in May 2003. Notices of the\n  order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &\n  Cromwell’s address. When those postings were returned, unopened,\n  the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing. Butler also re-\n  ceived a copy of the order, but did not act on it. With no attorney of\n2                           MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    record in fact acting on Maples’ behalf, the 42-day period Maples had\n    to file a notice of appeal ran out.\n       About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent\n    a letter directly to Maples. The letter informed Maples of the missed\n    deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a\n    federal habeas petition. Maples immediately contacted his mother,\n    who called Sullivan & Cromwell. Three Sullivan & Cromwell attor-\n    neys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order,\n    thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. The court denied the\n    motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ\n    of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-\n    time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.\n       Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief. Both the District\n    Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the\n    procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure timely to appeal\n    the state trial court’s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postcon-\n    viction relief.\n    Held: Maples has shown the requisite “cause” to excuse his procedur-\n    al default. Pp. 11–22.\n        (a) As a rule, a federal court may not entertain a state prisoner’s\n    habeas claims “when (1) ‘a state court [has] declined to address\n    [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state proce-\n    dural requirement,’ and (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent\n    and adequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin, 562\n    U. S. ___, ___. The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if\n    “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in\n    state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of\n    federal law.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750.\n        Cause for a procedural default exists where “something external to\n    the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,]\n    . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.’ ”\n    Id., at 753. A prisoner’s postconviction attorney’s negligence does not\n    qualify as “cause,” ibid., because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,\n    and under “well-settled” agency law, the principal bears the risk of\n    his agent’s negligent conduct, id., at 753–754. Thus, a petitioner is\n    bound by his attorney’s failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot\n    rely on that failure to establish cause. Ibid.\n        A markedly different situation arises, however, when an attorney\n    abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.\n    In such cases, the principal-agent relationship is severed and the at-\n    torney’s acts or omissions “cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].”\n    Id., at 753. Nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own\n    behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact,\n    are not representing him.\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n  Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, is instructive. There, the Court\nfound that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition\ncan be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney’s unprofes-\nsional conduct may sometimes be an “extraordinary circumstance”\njustifying equitable tolling. Id., at ___, ___–___. The Court recog-\nnized that an attorney’s negligence does not provide a basis for tolling\na statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland’s claim that he was aban-\ndoned by his attorney, however, if true, “would suffice to establish ex-\ntraordinary circumstances beyond his control,” id., at ___ (opinion of\nALITO, J.). Pp. 11–15.\n  (b) From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after\ntime ran out for appealing the trial court’s denial of that petition,\nMaples’ sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and\nButler. Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serv-\ning as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period. Pp. 15–21.\n     (1) The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented\nMaples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as\na result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the\n42-day period. But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nsevered their agency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial\ncourt’s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey\nthat they remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys,\nnot Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law re-\nquires the clerk to furnish.\n  The State asserts that, after Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s depar-\nture, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as\nMaples’ counsel. At the time of the default, however, those attorneys\nhad not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their\nappearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done nothing to inform the\nAlabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz. Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Pp. 15–19.\n     (2) Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did\nnot even begin to represent Maples. Butler told Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of en-\nabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive\nrole in the case. Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples’\n“agent in any meaningful sense of that word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of ALITO, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial court’s\norder, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm\nlawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did the State treat But-\nler as Maples’ actual representative. Notably, the Alabama Assistant\nAttorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding\n4                         MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an\n    opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19–20.\n          (3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of\n    record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his\n    representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive no-\n    tice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for com-\n    mencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked coun-\n    sel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\n    complying with the State’s procedural rule. Pp. 20–21.\n       (c) “The cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for\n    States’ finality and comity interests while ensuring that ‘fundamen-\n    tal fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas cor-\n    pus.’ ” Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 393. In the unusual circum-\n    stances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness\n    point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Ma-\n    ples’ procedural default. Through no fault of his own, he lacked the\n    assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal peri-\n    od. And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been re-\n    duced to pro se status. Pp. 21–22.\n       (d) The question of prejudice, which neither the District Court nor\n    the Eleventh Circuit reached, remains open for decision on remand.\n    P. 22.\n586 F. 3d 879, reversed and remanded.\n\n  GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sen-\ntenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.\nAt trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers,\nminimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging\nineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial\ninfirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written\nby two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associ-\nated with the same New York-based large law firm. An\nAlabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved\nthe admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice. As\nunderstood by New York counsel, local counsel would\nfacilitate their appearance, but would undertake no sub-\nstantive involvement in the case.\n  In the summer of 2002, while Maples’ postconviction\npetition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his\nNew York attorneys left the law firm; their new employ-\nment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.\nThey did not inform Maples of their departure and conse-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek\nthe Alabama trial court’s leave to withdraw. Neither they\nnor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able\nto handle Maples’ case.\n  In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples’\npetition. Notices of the court’s order were posted to the\nNew York attorneys at the address of the law firm with\nwhich they had been associated. Those postings were re-\nturned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt-\ned no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact\nacting on Maples’ behalf, the time to appeal ran out.\n  Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,\nthe Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the\nprocedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure\ntimely to appeal the Alabama trial court’s order denying\nhim postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was\nblameless for the default.\n  The sole question this Court has taken up for review is\nwhether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples’ case, there\nis “cause” to excuse the default. Maples maintains that\nthere is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly repre-\nsenting him had abandoned the case without leave of\ncourt, without informing Maples they could no longer\nrepresent him, and without securing any recorded substi-\ntution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Ma-\nples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state\npostconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to\nprotect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just\nsystem would lay the default at Maples’ death-cell door.\nSatisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Appointed counsel need only be a member of the\nAlabama bar and have “five years’ prior experience in the\nactive practice of criminal law.” Ala. Code §13A–5–54\n(2006). Experience with capital cases is not required.\nJustices Brief 7–8. Nor does the State provide, or require\nappointed counsel to gain, any capital-case-specific profes-\nsional education or training. ABA Report 129–131; Jus-\ntices Brief 14–16.\n   Appointed counsel in death penalty cases are also un-\ndercompensated. ABA Report 124–129; Justices Brief 12–\n14. Until 1999, the State paid appointed capital defense\nattorneys just “$40.00 per hour for time expended in court\nand $20.00 per hour for time reasonably expended out of\ncourt in the preparation of [the defendant’s] case.” Ala.\nCode §15–12–21(d) (1995). Although death penalty litiga-\ntion is plainly time intensive,1 the State capped at $1,000\nfees recoverable by capital defense attorneys for out-of-\ncourt work. Ibid.2 Even today, court-appointed attorneys\nreceive only $70 per hour. 2011 Ala. Acts no. 2011–678,\npp. 1072–1073, §6.\n——————\n  1 One   study of federal capital trials from 1990 to 1997 found that de-\nfense attorneys spent an average of 1,480 out-of-court hours prepar-\ning a defendant’s case. Subcommittee on Federal Death Penalty Cases,\nCommittee on Defender Services, Judicial Conference of the United\nStates, Federal Death Penalty Cases: Recommendations Concerning the\nCost and Quality of Defense Representation 14 (May 1998).\n   2 In 1999, the State removed the cap on fees for out-of-court work in\n\ncapital cases. Ala. Code §15–12–21(d) (2010 Cum. Supp.). Perhaps not\ncoincidentally, 70% of the inmates on Alabama’s death row in 2006,\nincluding Maples, had been convicted when the $1,000 cap was in\neffect.

THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Nearly alone among the States, Alabama does not guar-\nantee representation to indigent capital defendants in\npostconviction proceedings. ABA Report 111–112, 158–\n160; Justices Brief 33. The State has elected, instead, “to\nrely on the efforts of typically well-funded [out-of-state]\nvolunteers.” Brief in Opposition in Barbour v. Allen, O. T.\n2006, No. 06–10605, p. 23. Thus, as of 2006, 86% of the\nattorneys representing Alabama’s death row inmates in\nstate collateral review proceedings “either worked for the\nEqual Justice Initiative (headed by NYU Law professor\nBryan Stevenson), out-of-state public interest groups like\nthe Innocence Project, or an out-of-state mega-firm.” Brief\nin Opposition 16, n. 4. On occasion, some prisoners sen-\ntenced to death receive no postconviction representation at\nall. See ABA Report 112 (“[A]s of April 2006, approxi-\nmately fifteen of Alabama’s death row inmates in the fi-\nnal rounds of state appeals had no lawyer to represent\nthem.”).\n                            B\n   This system was in place when, in 1997, Alabama\ncharged Maples with two counts of capital murder; the\nvictims, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne Robinson\nII, were Maples’ friends who, on the night of the murders,\nhad been out on the town with him. Maples pleaded not\nguilty, and his case proceeded to trial, where he was rep-\nresented by two court-appointed Alabama attorneys. Only\none of them had earlier served in a capital case. See Tr.\n3081. Neither counsel had previously tried the penalty\nphase of a capital case. Compensation for each lawyer was\ncapped at $1,000 for time spent out-of-court preparing\nMaples’ case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services.\nSee Ala. Code §15–12–21 (1995).\n   Finding Maples guilty on both counts, the jury recom-\nmended that he be sentenced to death.

At the time, Alabama\nrequired out-of-state attorneys to associate local counsel\nwhen seeking admission to practice pro hac vice before an\nAlabama court, regardless of the nature of the proceeding.\nRule Governing Admission to the Ala.

Id., at 257a. This arrangement between out-\nof-state and local attorneys, it appears, was hardly atypi-\ncal. See Justices Brief 36 (“The fact is that local counsel\nfor out-of-state attorneys in post-conviction litigation most\noften do nothing other than provide the mechanism for\nforeign attorneys to be admitted.”).\n  With the aid of his pro bono counsel, Maples filed a\npetition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 32.4 Among other claims, Maples\nasserted that his court-appointed attorneys provided con-\nstitutionally ineffective assistance during both guilt and\npenalty phases of his capital trial. App. 29–126. He\nalleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and under-\nfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious\nintoxication defense, did not object to several egregious\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully un-\nderprepared for the penalty phase of his trial.

Ibid.\n   Another nine months passed. During this time period,\nno Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys assigned to Maples’\ncase sought admission to the Alabama bar, entered ap-\npearances on Maples’ behalf, or otherwise advised the\nAlabama court that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were no\nlonger Maples’ attorneys. Thus, Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz (along with Butler) remained Maples’ listed, and\nonly, “attorneys of record.” Id., at 223a.\n   There things stood when, in May 2003, the trial court,\nwithout holding a hearing, entered an order denying\nMaples’ Rule 32 petition. App. 146–225.5 The clerk of the\nAlabama trial court mailed copies of the order to Maples’\nthree attorneys of record. He sent Munanka’s and Ingen-\nHousz’s copies to Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York ad-\ndress, which the pair had provided upon entering their\nappearances.\n   When those copies arrived at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz had long since departed. The\nnotices, however, were not forwarded to another Sullivan\n& Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom employee sent\nthe unopened envelopes back to the court. “Returned to\nSender—Attempted, Unknown” was stamped on the enve-\nlope addressed to Munanka. App. to Reply to Brief in\n\n——————\n  5 One  of Maples’ attorneys observed, without contradiction, that the\ntrial court’s order was a “word for word copy of the proposed Order that\nthe State had submitted [with] its [December 2001] Motion to Dismiss.”\nId., at 300.\n8                    MAPLES v.

A similar stamp appeared on the envelope\naddressed to Ingen-Housz, along with the handwritten\nnotation “Return to Sender—Left Firm.” Id., at 7a.\n   Upon receiving back the unopened envelopes he had\nmailed to Munanka and Ingen-Housz, the Alabama court\nclerk took no further action. In particular, the clerk did\nnot contact Munanka or Ingen-Housz at the personal\ntelephone numbers or home addresses they had provided\nin their pro hac vice applications. See Ingen-Housz Veri-\nfied Application for Admission to Practice Under Rule VII,\np. 1; and Munanka Verified Application for Admission to\nPractice Under Rule VII, p. 1, in Maples v. State, No. CC–\n95–842.60 (C. C. Morgan Cty., Ala.). Nor did the clerk\nalert Sullivan & Cromwell or Butler. Butler received his\ncopy of the order, but did not act on it. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 256a. He assumed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwho had been “CC’d” on the order, would take care of filing\nan appeal. Ibid.\n   Meanwhile, the clock ticked on Maples’ appeal. Under\nAlabama’s Rules of Appellate Procedure, Maples had 42\ndays to file a notice of appeal from the trial court’s May 22,\n2003 order denying Maples’ petition for postconviction\nrelief. Rule 4(a)(1) (2000). No appeal notice was filed, and\nthe time allowed for filing expired on July 7, 2003.\n   A little over a month later, on August 13, 2003, Ala-\nbama Assistant Attorney General Jon Hayden, the attor-\nney representing the State in Maples’ collateral review\nproceedings, sent a letter directly to Maples. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 253a–254a. Hayden’s letter informed Maples of\nthe missed deadline for initiating an appeal within the\nState’s system, and notified him that four weeks remained\nduring which he could file a federal habeas petition. Ibid.\nHayden mailed the letter to Maples only, using his prison\naddress. Ibid. No copy was sent to Maples’ attorneys of\nrecord, or to anyone else acting on Maples’ behalf.

Id., at 258a. She telephoned Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell to inquire about her son’s case. Ibid.\nPrompted by her call, Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys\nMarc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submit-\nted a motion, through Butler, asking the trial court to\nreissue its order denying Maples’ Rule 32 petition, thereby\nrestarting the 42-day appeal period. Id., at 222a.\n   The trial court denied the motion, id., at 222a–225a, not-\ning that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had not withdrawn\nfrom the case and, consequently, were “still attor-\nneys of record for the petitioner,” id., at 223a. Further-\nmore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and\nBrewer had not “yet been admitted to practice in Ala-\nbama” or “entered appearances as attorneys of record.”\nIbid. “How,” the court asked, “can a Circuit Clerk in\nDecatur, Alabama know what is going on in a law firm in\nNew York, New York?” Id., at 223a–224a. Declining to\nblame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline,\nthe court said it was “unwilling to enter into subterfuge in\norder to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the peti-\ntioner.” Ibid.\n   Maples next petitioned the Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals for a writ of mandamus, granting him leave to file\nan out-of-time appeal. Rejecting Maples’ plea, the Court of\nCriminal Appeals determined that, although the clerk had\n“assumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of\nMaples’s Rule 32 petition,” the clerk had satisfied that\nobligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at\nthe addresses those attorneys provided. Id., at 234a–235a.\nButler’s receipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to\nnotify all attorneys “in light of their apparent co-counsel\nstatus.” Id., at 235a–236a (quoting Thomas v.

THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Having exhausted his state postconviction remedies,\nMaples sought federal habeas corpus relief. Addressing\nthe ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples\nstated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples\nhad forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed,\npresent the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32)\npetition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal\nfrom the trial court’s denial of his petition. That proce-\ndural default, the State maintained, precluded federal-\ncourt consideration of the claims.6 Maples replied that the\ndefault should be excused, because he missed the appeal\ndeadline “through no fault of his own.” App. 262 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  The District Court determined that Maples had default-\ned his ineffective-assistance claims, and that he had not\nshown “cause” sufficient to overcome the default. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 49a–55a. The court understood Maples to\nargue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel,\nnot any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama,\nprovided the requisite “cause” to excuse his failure to meet\nAlabama’s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. Id., at 55a. Such an\nargument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this\nCourt, in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), had\nheld that the ineffectiveness of postconviction appellate\ncounsel could not qualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (citing Coleman, 501 U. S., at 751).\n  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Ma-\nples v. Allen, 586 F. 3d 879 (2009) (per curiam). In accord\nwith the District Court, the Court of Appeals’ majority\nheld that Maples defaulted his ineffective-assistance\n——————\n  6 In opposing Maples’ request for an out-of-time appeal, the State\n\nargued to the Alabama Supreme Court that such an appeal was unwar-\nranted. In that context, the State noted that Maples “may still present\nhis postconviction claims to [the federal habeas] court.” 35 Record, Doc.\nNo. 55, p. 22, n. 4. The State’s current position is in some tension with\nthat observation.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Id., at 895–898. She conclud-\ned that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals had acted\n“arbitrarily” in refusing to grant Maples’ request for an\nout-of-time appeal. Id., at 896. In a case involving “indis-\ntinguishable facts,” Judge Barkett noted, the Alabama\nappellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late\nappeal. Ibid. (citing Marshall v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1693604\"><a href=\"/opinion/1693604/marshall-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 899\n(Ala.

Inconsistent application of the\n42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, “render[ed]\nthe rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal\nreview of Maples’s claims.” 586 F. 3d, at 897. The inter-\nests of justice, she added, required review of Maples’\nclaims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high\nstakes involved, and the absence of any fault on Maples’\npart. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to decide whether the uncommon\nfacts presented here establish cause adequate to excuse\nMaples’ procedural default. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n\n                               A\n\n   As a rule, a state prisoner’s habeas claims may not be\nentertained by a federal court “when (1) ‘a state court\n[has] declined to address [those] claims because the pris-\noner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,’\nand (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent and\nadequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin,\n562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (quoting Coleman,\n501 U. S., at 729–730). The bar to federal review may be\nlifted, however, if “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for\nthe [procedural] default [in state court] and actual preju-\ndice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.” Id.,\nat 750; see Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85\n12                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1977).\n   Given the single issue on which we granted review, we\nwill assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Ala-\nbama Court of Criminal Appeals’ refusal to consider\nMaples’ ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independ-\nent and adequate state procedural ground: namely,\nMaples’ failure to satisfy Alabama’s Rule requiring a\nnotice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial\ncourt’s final order. Accordingly, we confine our considera-\ntion to the question whether Maples has shown cause to\nexcuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.\n   Cause for a procedural default exists where “something\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him[,] . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply\nwith the State’s procedural rule.’ ” Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986);\nemphasis in original). Negligence on the part of a prison-\ner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as “cause.”\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in\nColeman, because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent, and\nunder “well-settled principles of agency law,” the principal\nbears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his\nagent. Id., at 753–754. See also Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (“Under our\nsystem of representative litigation, ‘each party is deemed\nbound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.’ ” (quoting Link v.\nWabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962))). Thus, when a\npetitioner’s postconviction attorney misses a filing dead-\nline, the petitioner is bound by the oversight and cannot\nrely on it to establish cause. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753–\n754. We do not disturb that general rule.\n   A markedly different situation is presented, however, when\nan attorney abandons his client without notice, and there-\nby occasions the default. Having severed the principal-\nagent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails\nto act, as the client’s representative. See 1 Restatement\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

His acts or\nomissions therefore “cannot fairly be attributed to [the\nclient].” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753. See, e.g., Jamison v.\nLockhart, 975 F. 2d 1377, 1380 (CA8 1992) (attorney\nconduct may provide cause to excuse a state procedural\ndefault where, as a result of a conflict of interest, the\nattorney “ceased to be [petitioner’s] agent”); Porter v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1509132\"><a href=\"/opinion/1509132/porter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16–19, 2 S.

Florida, 560 U. S. ___\n(2010), is instructive. That case involved a missed one-\nyear deadline, prescribed by 28 U. S. C. §2244(d), for filing\na federal habeas petition. Holland presented two issues:\nfirst, whether the §2244(d) time limitation can be tolled\nfor equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney’s\nunprofessional conduct can ever count as an “extraordi-\nnary circumstance” justifying equitable tolling. 560 U. S.,\nat ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 1, 16–17) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.\n   On the second issue, the Court recognized that an at-\ntorney’s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing\ndeadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory\ntime limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___–___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 5–6); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327,\n336 (2007). The Holland petitioner, however, urged that\nattorney negligence was not the gravamen of his com-\nplaint. Rather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached\nhimself from any trust relationship with his client: “[My\nlawyer] has abandoned me,” the petitioner complained to\n14                       MAPLES v.

Frank,\n264 F. 3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering a hearing on\nwhether a client’s effective abandonment by his lawyer\nmerited tolling of the one-year deadline for filing a federal\nhabeas petition).\n  In a concurring opinion in Holland, JUSTICE ALITO\nhomed in on the essential difference between a claim of\nattorney error, however egregious, and a claim that an\nattorney had essentially abandoned his client. 560 U. S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 5–7). Holland’s plea fit the latter\ncategory: He alleged abandonment “evidenced by counsel’s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id.,\nat ___–___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3–4, 20). If\ntrue, JUSTICE ALITO explained, “petitioner’s allegations\nwould suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances\nbeyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a liti-\ngant cannot be held constructively responsible for the\nconduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent\nin any meaningful sense of that word.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).7\n  We agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot\nbe charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who\nhas abandoned him. Nor can a client be faulted for failing\nto act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe\nhis attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.\nWe therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his\nattorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the\n——————\n  7 Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), involved tolling of a federal\n\ntime bar, while Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), concerned\ncause for excusing a procedural default in state court. See Holland, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).

Unknown to\nMaples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his\nattorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from\nthe trial court’s order.\n                             1\n   The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell repre-\nsented Maples throughout his state postconviction pro-\nceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot\nestablish abandonment by counsel continuing through the\nsix weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial\ncourt’s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is\nundisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their\nagency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the\ntwo attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw\nfrom the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell’s employ in the summer of 2002, at\nleast nine months before the Alabama trial court entered\nits order denying Rule 32 relief. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n258a. Their new employment—Munanka as a law clerk\nfor a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the\nEuropean Commission in Belgium—disabled them from\ncontinuing to represent Maples. See Code of Conduct for\nJudicial Employees, Canon 4(D)(3) (1999) (prohibiting\njudicial employees from participating in “litigation against\nfederal, state or local government”); Staff Regulations of\nOfficials of the European Commission, Tit.

Hornbook agency law establishes that the at-\ntorneys’ departure from Sullivan & Cromwell and their\ncommencement of employment that prevented them from\nrepresenting Maples ended their agency relationship with\nhim. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency §112 (1957)\n(hereinafter Restatement (Second)) (“[T]he authority of an\nagent terminates if, without knowledge of the principal, he\nacquires adverse interests or if he is otherwise guilty of\na serious breach of loyalty to the principal.”); 2 id., §394,\nComment a (“[T]he agent commits a breach of duty [of\nloyalty] to his principal by acting for another in an under-\ntaking which has a substantial tendency to cause him to\ndisregard his duty to serve his principal with only his\nprincipal’s purposes in mind.”).\n   Furthermore, the two attorneys did not observe Ala-\nbama’s Rule requiring them to seek the trial court’s per-\nmission to withdraw. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2,\nComment. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) §111, Comment b\n(“[I]t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend\nan agent to do an illegal act.”). By failing to seek permis-\nsion to withdraw, Munanka and Ingen-Housz allowed the\ncourt’s records to convey that they represented Maples.\nAs listed attorneys of record, they, not Maples, would be\nthe addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the\nclerk to furnish. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.5 (“Upon\nthe entry of any order in a criminal proceeding made in\nresponse to a motion, . . . the clerk shall, without undue\ndelay, furnish all parties a copy thereof by mail or by other\nappropriate means.”) and 34.4 (“[W]here the defendant is\nrepresented by counsel, service shall be made upon the\nattorney of record.”).\n   Although acknowledging that Munanka and Ingen-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Regarding this assertion, we\nnote, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submit-\nted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples’\nrequest that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,\nat 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been “in-\nvolved in [Maples’] case since the summer of 2001.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied\nthe State’s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw\ninformed the court, Sullivan & Cromwell “lawyers working\non this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]\nevidentiary hearing.” Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &\nCromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit\nsubmitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,\nthat she “ha[d] worked on [Maples’] case since October 14,\n2002.” App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy de-\nscribed what their “involve[ment]” or “wor[k] on [Maples’]\ncase” entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,\nother than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still\nwith Sullivan & Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in\npreparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw\nidentify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed\non Maples’ case between Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s\ndepartures and the firm’s receipt of the telephone call\nfrom Maples’ mother.8\n——————\n   8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sul-\n\nlivan & Cromwell’s representation of Maples after the default. As\namici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the\nfirm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors\net al. as Amici Curiae 23–27. Following the default, the firm’s interest\nin avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples’\nstrongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,\n18                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The slim record on activity at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nhowever, does not warrant a remand to determine more\nprecisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Mu-\nnanka and Ingen-Housz. For the facts essential to our\ndecision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the\nSullivan & Cromwell attorneys who later came forward—\nDe Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer—had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\ntheir appearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done noth-\ning to inform the Alabama court that they wished to sub-\nstitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of\nthese attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restate-\nment (Second) §111 (The “failure to acquire a qualification\nby the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized\nact . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act.”).9 What\nthey did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore\n——————\ntherefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &\nCromwell did not cede Maples’ representation to a new attorney, who\ncould have made Maples’ abandonment argument plain to the Court of\nAppeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and\noral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast\nresponsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court.\nGiven Sullivan & Cromwell’s conflict of interest, Maples’ federal habeas\npetition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evi-\ndence that Maples, prior to the default, ever “viewed himself” as repre-\nsented by “the firm,” see post, at 4, rather than by his attorneys of\nrecord, Munanka and Ingen-Housz.\n   9 The dissent argues that the Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no\n\nbasis “to infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.”\nPost, at 6–7. While that may be true, it is irrelevant. What the attor-\nneys could have inferred is that Maples would not have wanted them to\nfile a notice of appeal on his behalf prior to their admission to practice\nin Alabama, for doing so would be “illegal,” post, at 7 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). See also 1 Restatement (Second) §111, Comment\nb, quoted supra, at 16. For the critical purpose of filing a notice of\nappeal, then, the other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no authority\nto act for Maples.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

At the time critical to preserving Maples’\naccess to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwere not Maples’ authorized agents.\n                              2\n   Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel\nButler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not\neven begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munan-\nka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel\nonly for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attor-\nneys to appear pro hac vice. Supra, at 5–6. Lacking the\nnecessary “resources, available time [and] experience,”\nButler told the two Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he\nwould not “deal with substantive issues in the case.” Ibid.\nThat the minimal participation he undertook was incon-\nsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, un-\nderscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because\nButler signed on as local counsel.\n   In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other\nthan to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro\nhac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler’s and De\nLeeuw’s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n255a–258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not\n“operat[e] as [Maples’] agent in any meaningful sense of\nthat word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).\nThe first is Butler’s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of\nthe trial court’s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact\nSullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were\ntaking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to\nbelieve that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a\ncopy of the court’s order, see App. 225 (indicating that\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz were CC’d on the order), But-\nler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New York\nfirm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely repre-\nsentative role in the case.\n20                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Notably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples’ actual\nrepresentative. Assistant Attorney General Hayden ad-\ndressed the letter informing Maples of the default directly\nto Maples in prison. See supra, at 8. Hayden sent no copy\nto, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed\nas counsel of record for Maples. Lawyers in Alabama have\nan ethical obligation to refrain from communicating direct-\nly with an opposing party known to be represented by\ncounsel. See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003);\nAla. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all\ndocuments “be made upon the attorney of record”). In\nwriting directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this\nethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden\nmust have believed that Maples was no longer represented\nby counsel, out-of-state or local.10\n  In sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no\ntime before the missed deadline was Butler serving as\nMaples’ agent “in any meaningful sense of that word.”\nHolland, 560 U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op.,\nat 6).\n                             3\n  Not only was Maples left without any functioning attor-\nney of record, the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz,\nand Butler as his representatives meant that he had no\nright personally to receive notice. See supra, at 16. He in\n——————\n  10 Itbears note, as well, that the State served its response to Maples’\nRule 32 petition only on Munanka at Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York\naddress, not on Butler. App. 26. While the State may not be obligated\nto serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York\nrather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the\nState was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve. Conforming\nthe State’s Rule to common practice, in 2006, the Alabama Supreme\nCourt amended the provision on appearances by out-of-state counsel to\neliminate the requirement that such attorneys associate local counsel\nwhen representing indigent criminal defendants pro bono in postconvic-\ntion proceedings.

Had counsel of record or the State’s\nattorney informed Maples of his plight before the time to\nappeal ran out, he could have filed a notice of appeal\nhimself11 or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys.12\nGiven no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and\nwilling to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\ncomplying with the State’s procedural rule.\n                              C\n   “The cause and prejudice requirement,” we have said,\n“shows due regard for States’ finality and comity interests\nwhile ensuring that ‘fundamental fairness [remains] the\ncentral concern of the writ of habeas corpus.’ ” Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 393 (2004) (quoting Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984)). In the unusual\ncircumstances of this case, principles of agency law and\nfundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There\nwas indeed cause to excuse Maples’ procedural default.\nThrough no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance\nof any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama\nallows for noticing an appeal from a trial court’s denial of\npostconviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason\nto suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se\nstatus. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circum-\nstances quite beyond his control.

Unbeknownst to peti-\ntioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation\ndue to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortu-\nnate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the\ntwo young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in\nhis state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by\nthese two attorneys of new employment that precluded\nthem from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to\nnotify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to\nwithdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure\nof the firm that they left to monitor the status of petition-\ner’s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of\nthe decision denying petitioner’s request for state post-\nconviction relief was received in that firm’s offices, the\nfailure of the firm’s mail room to route that important\ncommunication to either another member of the firm or to\nthe departed attorneys’ new addresses; (7) the failure of\nthe clerk’s office to take any action when the envelope\ncontaining that notice came back unopened; and (8) local\ncounsel’s very limited conception of the role that he was\nobligated to play in petitioner’s representation. Under\nthese unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner’s\nattorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndonment was a “cause” that is sufficient to overcome pe-\ntitioner’s procedural default.\n   In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner’s\ncounsel in the case now before us cast blame for what\noccurred on Alabama’s system of providing legal represen-\ntation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral\nproceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3–6. But whatever\nmay be said about Alabama’s system, I do not think that\nAlabama’s system had much if anything to do with peti-\ntioner’s misfortune. The quality of petitioner’s representa-\ntion at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet\nthe deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial\nof his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any im-\nportant connection between what happened in this case\nand Alabama’s system for providing representation for\nprisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to\npetition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other\nStates, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to\nrepresent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that\nmost of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.\nId., at 4. Petitioner’s brief states that the Alabama system\nhad “a direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the\nprocedural default at issue,” id., at 3, but a similar combi-\nnation of untoward events could have occurred if petition-\ner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were\nappointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The\nfirm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one\nof the country’s most prestigious and expensive, and I\nhave little doubt that the vast majority of criminal de-\nfendants would think that they had won the lottery if they\nwere given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys\nfrom such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it “seemed as\nthough Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys\nworking at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to rep-\nresent Maples pro bono”).\n   What occurred here was not a predictable consequence\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Court now concludes\nthat Maples has established cause for his procedural\ndefault by reason of abandonment by his attorneys. Be-\ncause I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because\nMaples’ alternative argument fares no better, I would\naffirm the judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers,\nthe principle that errors in state criminal trials should\nbe remedied in state court. As we have long recognized,\nfederal habeas review for state prisoners imposes signifi-\ncant costs on the States, undermining not only their prac-\ntical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,\nsee Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126–127 (1982), but also\nthe primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitu-\ntional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id.,\nat 128. We have further recognized that “[t]hese costs are\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparticularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a\nprocedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitu-\ntional claims in state court.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 748 (1991). In that situation, the prisoner has\n“deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\nthose claims in the first instance,” id., at 732, thereby\nleaving the state courts without “a chance to mend their\nown fences and avoid federal intrusion,” Engle, 456 U. S.,\nat 129. For that reason, and because permitting federal-\ncourt review of defaulted claims would “undercu[t] the\nState’s ability to enforce its procedural rules,” ibid., we\nhave held that when a state court has relied on an ade-\nquate and independent state procedural ground in denying\na prisoner’s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain\nfederal habeas relief. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.\n   To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of\ndefaulted claims is not absolute. A habeas petitioner’s de-\nfault in state court will not bar federal habeas review if\n“the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,”\nid., at 748—“cause” constituting “something external to\nthe petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed\nto him,” that impeded compliance with the State’s proce-\ndural rule, id., at 753. As a general matter, an attorney’s\nmistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard “because\nthe attorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or\nfailing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the\npetitioner must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nSee also Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 633–634,\nand n. 10 (1962).\n   When an attorney’s error occurs at a stage of the pro-\nceedings at which the defendant has a constitutional right\nto effective assistance of counsel, that error may constitute\ncause to excuse a resulting procedural default. A State’s\nfailure in its duty to provide an effective attorney, as\nmeasured by the standard set forth in Strickland v. Wash-\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney’s error\nchargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.\nSee Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no\nright to counsel—as is the case in the postconviction set-\nting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555\n(1987)—the client bears the risk of all attorney errors\nmade in the course of the representation, regardless of the\negregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754\n(“[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters,\nbut that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to\ncounsel, so that the error must be seen as an external\nfactor”).\n                                B\n   In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct\nto conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner’s proce-\ndural default may be excused when it is attributable to\nabandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman’s\nrationale for attributing the attorney’s acts and omissions\nto the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased\nacting as the client’s agent, “well-settled principles of\nagency law,” 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging\nthe client with his lawyer’s mistakes. The attorney’s\nmistakes may therefore be understood as an “external\nfactor,” ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may jus-\ntify excusing the prisoner’s procedural default.\n   I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion, ante, at 15,\nthat Maples’ two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi\nMunanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples\nby the time the Alabama trial court entered its order\ndenying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court\nobserves, ante, at 15–16, without informing Maples or\nseeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw\nfrom Maples’ case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell’s employ and accepted new positions\nthat precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.\n4                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as\nMaples’ agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency\n§119, Comment b (1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d),\nand thus terminated their authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf, id., §118. As a result, Munanka’s and Ingen-\nHousz’s failure to take action in response to the trial\ncourt’s order should not be imputed to Maples.\n   It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Ma-\nples was left unrepresented during the relevant window\nbetween the Alabama trial court’s dismissal of his post-\nconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples’\nown allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition,\nMaples alleged that, at the time he sought postconvic-\ntion relief in Alabama trial court, he “was represented by\nSullivan & Cromwell of New York, New York.” App. 256.\nAlthough the petition went on to identify Munanka and\nIngen-Housz as “the two Sullivan lawyers handling the\nmatter,” id., at 257, its statement that Maples was “repre-\nsented” by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples\nviewed himself as having retained the services of the firm\nas a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. “When a\nclient retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the\npresumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have\nbeen retained.” 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Govern-\ning Lawyers §31, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly,\nin connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial\ncourt to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan & Cromwell\npartner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating\nthat the firm’s lawyers “handle pro bono cases on an indi-\nvidual basis” and that the lawyers who had appeared in\nMaples’ case had followed that practice, “attempt[ing] not\nto use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. But Maples’ habeas petition is\nthe pleading that initiated the current litigation; and\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsurely the allegations that it contained should be given\npriority over representations made to prior courts.*\n   In any case, even if Maples had no attorney-client rela-\ntionship with the Sullivan & Cromwell firm, Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz were surely not the only Sullivan &\nCromwell lawyers who represented Maples on an individ-\nual basis. De Leeuw’s affidavit acknowledged that he had\n“been involved in [Maples’] case since the summer of\n2001,” ibid., roughly a year before Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz left Sullivan & Cromwell, and it further stated that\nafter “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka” learned of the\ncourt’s initial order denying the State’s motion to dismiss\nMaples’ postconviction petition in December 2001, “the\nlawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared\nfor the evidentiary hearing” Maples had requested, id., at\n258a. Moreover, when Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\nFelice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before\nthe Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to\nextend the deadline, she stated that she had “worked on\n[Maples’] case since October 14, 2002,” App. 231, months\nbefore the procedural default took place.\n   According to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw’s\naffidavit does not make clear how he was “involved” in\n——————\n   * The Court says that the allegations in Maples’ own habeas petition\nare not “persuasive evidence,” ante, at 17–18, n. 8, because Maples’\nlawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest\nwhen they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the\neffect of Maples’ statement was to implicate Sullivan & Cromwell as a\nfirm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the\nSullivan & Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the\ncase later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been\nconceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples’\ninterest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition’s state-\nment raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is\nwhether the statement was true. And if Sullivan & Cromwell’s in-\nvolvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only\nreinforces the truth.\n6                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples’ case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and\nIngen-Housz were among those who prepared for the\nanticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy’s motion does\nnot make clear what her “wor[k]” entailed. But there is\nlittle doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the\nonly attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that\nDe Leeuw was “involved” and Duffy “worked” as lawyers\nfor Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).\nDe Leeuw’s distinction between “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr.\nMunanka” and “the lawyers working on his case for Mr.\nMaples” would have been senseless if the latter category\ndid not extend beyond the two named attorneys.\n   In sum, there is every indication that when the trial\ncourt entered its order dismissing Maples’ postconviction\npetition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented\nby a team of attorneys in Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York\noffice. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of\nthese attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\nappearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not\nsought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. See\nante, at 18–19. The Court does not, however, explain why\nthese facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples’\nagents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the\ncase that did not require court appearance—which would\ncertainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing\ndeadlines. The Court’s quotation from the Restatement of\nAgency, ante, at 18, that the “failure to acquire a qualifica-\ntion by the agent without which it is illegal to do an au-\nthorized act . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act,” 1\nRestatement 2d, §111, at 290, omits the crucial condition\ncontained at the end of the section: “if thereafter he [the\nagent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts,\nwould not consent to the further exercise of the authority.”\nThere was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer\nthat Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Ala-\nbama court. Though it would have been “illegal” for these\nattorneys to file a notice of appeal without being author-\nized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from\nfirst seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a\nnotice of appeal.\n   It would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurispru-\ndence to disregard all attorney errors committed before\nadmission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap\nto disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed\nbefore the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even\nif these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples’ agents for\npurposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were\nat least his agents for purposes of advising him of the\nimpending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of\ncounsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.\nWhat happened here is simply “[a]ttorney ignorance or\ninadvertence” of the sort that does not furnish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753.\n   But even leaving aside the question of Maples’ “unad-\nmitted” attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell, Maples had a\nfully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance,\nin the person of local counsel, John Butler. There is no\nsupport for the Court’s conclusion that Butler “did not\neven begin to represent Maples.” Ante, at 19. True, the\naffidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the\nproceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that\nhe had “no substantive involvement” with the case, and\nthat he had “agreed to serve as local counsel only.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of “substantive in-\nvolvement” in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer’s\nethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a\ndenial of any agency role at all. A local attorney’s “non-\nsubstantive” involvement would surely include, at a min-\nimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising\n8                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“substantive” counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did\nButler’s explanation for his failure to act when he received\na copy of the trial court’s order sound in abandonment.\nButler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order\nbecause he did not consider Maples to be his client. In-\nstead, based on “past practice” and the content of the\norder, Butler “assumed” that Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan\n& Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n256a.\n   The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that\n“Butler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New\nYork firm” demonstrates Butler’s “disclaimer of any genu-\ninely representative role.” Ante, at 19. By equating the\nvery attorney error that contributed to Maples’ procedural\ndefault with the absence of an agency relationship, the\nCourt ensures that today’s opinion will serve as a template\nfor future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman’s\nholding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will\nnot furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501\nU. S., at 752–754. The trick will be to allege, not that\ncounsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel’s ineffec-\ntiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely repre-\nsentative agent. No precedent should be so easily circum-\nvented by word games, but the damage is particularly\nacute when the affected precedent is so firmly “grounded\nin concerns of comity and federalism.” Id., at 730.\n   The Court’s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion\nthat Butler was not Maples’ agent is to point out that a\nprosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him\nof the defaulted appeal. See ante, at 20. The Court rea-\nsons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples\nhad been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate\nwith a represented party would have been a violation of\nethical standards. Ibid. But even if this supposition is\ncorrect, it is hard to understand what it proves. What\nmatters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really\nwas abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler’s conduct\nafter learning about the default further belies any such\ncontention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooper-\nate with Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, filing\npapers as “Counsel for Mr. Maples” or “Local Counsel for\nPetitioner Cory Maples” in multiple courts in an attempt\nto rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had\nButler reassumed his representational duties after having\nabandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a\nconclusion of abandonment interruptus.\n                               II\n   Maples argues in the alternative that his default should\nbe excused because his right to due process was violated\nwhen the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Mu-\nnanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s copies of the court’s dismissal\norder were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,\nour decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),\nestablishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.\n   We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax\nsale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional\nreasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the prop-\nerty owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It\nis questionable whether that holding has any relevance to\nthe circumstances here, which involved not the institution\nof proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather\nthe issuance of an order in a pending case that was insti-\ntuted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful\nwhether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a\ncourt’s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules cer-\ntainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute require-\nment. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides\nthat “[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]\ndoes not affect the time for appeal or relieve—or authorize\nthe court to relieve—a party for failing to appeal within\n10                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure (4)(a).” And although Federal Rule\nof Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for\nfiling an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not\nreceive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment\nor order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to\nreopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).\n    There is no need to grapple with this question, however,\nbecause Butler received a copy of the trial court’s order.\n“Under our system of representative litigation, ‘each party\n. . . is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which\ncan be charged upon [his] attorney.’ ” Irwin v. Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (quoting Link\nv. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962)). The notice to\nButler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.\n                         *   *     *\n  One suspects that today’s decision is motivated in large\npart by an understandable sense of frustration with the\nState’s refusal to waive Maples’ procedural default in\nthe interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well\nexplain the Court’s lengthy indictment of Alabama’s gen-\neral procedures for providing representation to capital\ndefendants, ante, at 2–4, a portion of the Court’s opinion\nthat is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be\notherwise inexplicable.\n  But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing\nMaples’ procedural default here, it does so whenever a\ndefendant’s procedural default is caused by his attorney.\nThat is simply not the law—and cannot be, if the states\nare to have an orderly system of criminal litigation con-\nducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand\non its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner’s procedural\ndefault even when counsel is to blame.

Argued October 4, 2011—January 18, 2012\nPetitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to\n  death in Alabama state court. In 2001, Maples sought postconviction\n  relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32. Maples alleged, among\n  other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys\n  failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth\n  Amendment. His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,\n  Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the\n  New York offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. As required\n  by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer,\n  John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice. Butler made\n  clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement\n  in the case.\n     In 2002, while Maples’ state postconviction petition was pending,\n  Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell. Their new em-\n  ployment disabled them from representing Maples. They did not in-\n  form Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as\n  his counsel. In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial\n  court’s leave to withdraw. No other Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\n  entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise no-\n  tified the court of a change in Maples’ representation. Thus, Munan-\n  ka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples’ listed, and only, at-\n  torneys of record.\n     The trial court denied Maples’ petition in May 2003. Notices of the\n  order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &\n  Cromwell’s address. When those postings were returned, unopened,\n  the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing. Butler also re-\n  ceived a copy of the order, but did not act on it. With no attorney of\n2                           MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    record in fact acting on Maples’ behalf, the 42-day period Maples had\n    to file a notice of appeal ran out.\n       About a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent\n    a letter directly to Maples. The letter informed Maples of the missed\n    deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a\n    federal habeas petition. Maples immediately contacted his mother,\n    who called Sullivan & Cromwell. Three Sullivan & Cromwell attor-\n    neys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order,\n    thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period. The court denied the\n    motion. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ\n    of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-\n    time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.\n       Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief. Both the District\n    Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the\n    procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure timely to appeal\n    the state trial court’s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postcon-\n    viction relief.\n    Held: Maples has shown the requisite “cause” to excuse his procedur-\n    al default. Pp. 11–22.\n        (a) As a rule, a federal court may not entertain a state prisoner’s\n    habeas claims “when (1) ‘a state court [has] declined to address\n    [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state proce-\n    dural requirement,’ and (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent\n    and adequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin, 562\n    U. S. ___, ___. The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if\n    “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in\n    state court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of\n    federal law.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750.\n        Cause for a procedural default exists where “something external to\n    the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,]\n    . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.’ ”\n    Id., at 753. A prisoner’s postconviction attorney’s negligence does not\n    qualify as “cause,” ibid., because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,\n    and under “well-settled” agency law, the principal bears the risk of\n    his agent’s negligent conduct, id., at 753–754. Thus, a petitioner is\n    bound by his attorney’s failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot\n    rely on that failure to establish cause. Ibid.\n        A markedly different situation arises, however, when an attorney\n    abandons his client without notice, and thereby occasions the default.\n    In such cases, the principal-agent relationship is severed and the at-\n    torney’s acts or omissions “cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].”\n    Id., at 753. Nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own\n    behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact,\n    are not representing him.\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n  Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, is instructive. There, the Court\nfound that the one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition\ncan be tolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney’s unprofes-\nsional conduct may sometimes be an “extraordinary circumstance”\njustifying equitable tolling. Id., at ___, ___–___. The Court recog-\nnized that an attorney’s negligence does not provide a basis for tolling\na statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland’s claim that he was aban-\ndoned by his attorney, however, if true, “would suffice to establish ex-\ntraordinary circumstances beyond his control,” id., at ___ (opinion of\nALITO, J.). Pp. 11–15.\n  (b) From the time of his initial Rule 32 petition until well after\ntime ran out for appealing the trial court’s denial of that petition,\nMaples’ sole attorneys of record were Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and\nButler. Unknown to Maples, none of those lawyers was in fact serv-\ning as his attorney during the 42-day appeal period. Pp. 15–21.\n     (1) The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell represented\nMaples throughout his state postconviction proceedings, and that, as\na result, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel during the\n42-day period. But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nsevered their agency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial\ncourt’s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey\nthat they remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys,\nnot Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law re-\nquires the clerk to furnish.\n  The State asserts that, after Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s depar-\nture, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as\nMaples’ counsel. At the time of the default, however, those attorneys\nhad not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their\nappearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done nothing to inform the\nAlabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz. Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Pp. 15–19.\n     (2) Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, did\nnot even begin to represent Maples. Butler told Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of en-\nabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive\nrole in the case. Other factors confirm that Butler was not Maples’\n“agent in any meaningful sense of that word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of ALITO, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial court’s\norder, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm\nlawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did the State treat But-\nler as Maples’ actual representative. Notably, the Alabama Assistant\nAttorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding\n4                         MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an\n    opposing party known to be represented by counsel. Pp. 19–20.\n          (3) Not only was Maples left without any functioning attorney of\n    record; the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler as his\n    representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive no-\n    tice. He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for com-\n    mencing an appeal. Given no reason to suspect that he lacked coun-\n    sel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\n    complying with the State’s procedural rule. Pp. 20–21.\n       (c) “The cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for\n    States’ finality and comity interests while ensuring that ‘fundamen-\n    tal fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas cor-\n    pus.’ ” Dretke v. Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 393. In the unusual circum-\n    stances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness\n    point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Ma-\n    ples’ procedural default. Through no fault of his own, he lacked the\n    assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42-day appeal peri-\n    od. And he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been re-\n    duced to pro se status.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sen-\ntenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.\nAt trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers,\nminimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging\nineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial\ninfirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written\nby two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associ-\nated with the same New York-based large law firm. An\nAlabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved\nthe admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice. As\nunderstood by New York counsel, local counsel would\nfacilitate their appearance, but would undertake no sub-\nstantive involvement in the case.\n  In the summer of 2002, while Maples’ postconviction\npetition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his\nNew York attorneys left the law firm; their new employ-\nment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.\nThey did not inform Maples of their departure and conse-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek\nthe Alabama trial court’s leave to withdraw. Neither they\nnor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able\nto handle Maples’ case.\n  In May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples’\npetition. Notices of the court’s order were posted to the\nNew York attorneys at the address of the law firm with\nwhich they had been associated. Those postings were re-\nturned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt-\ned no further mailing. With no attorney of record in fact\nacting on Maples’ behalf, the time to appeal ran out.\n  Thereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas\ncorpus in federal court. The District Court and, in turn,\nthe Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the\nprocedural default in state court, i.e., Maples’ failure\ntimely to appeal the Alabama trial court’s order denying\nhim postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was\nblameless for the default.\n  The sole question this Court has taken up for review is\nwhether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples’ case, there\nis “cause” to excuse the default. Maples maintains that\nthere is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly repre-\nsenting him had abandoned the case without leave of\ncourt, without informing Maples they could no longer\nrepresent him, and without securing any recorded substi-\ntution of counsel. We agree. Abandoned by counsel, Ma-\nples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state\npostconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to\nprotect himself pro se. In these circumstances, no just\nsystem would lay the default at Maples’ death-cell door.\nSatisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we\nreverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment.\n                             I\n                             A\n    Alabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Ala. Code §15–12–21(d) (2010 Cum. Supp.). Perhaps not\ncoincidentally, 70% of the inmates on Alabama’s death row in 2006,\nincluding Maples, had been convicted when the $1,000 cap was in\neffect.

Allen, O. T.\n2006, No. 06–10605, p. 23. Thus, as of 2006, 86% of the\nattorneys representing Alabama’s death row inmates in\nstate collateral review proceedings “either worked for the\nEqual Justice Initiative (headed by NYU Law professor\nBryan Stevenson), out-of-state public interest groups like\nthe Innocence Project, or an out-of-state mega-firm.” Brief\nin Opposition 16, n. 4. On occasion, some prisoners sen-\ntenced to death receive no postconviction representation at\nall. See ABA Report 112 (“[A]s of April 2006, approxi-\nmately fifteen of Alabama’s death row inmates in the fi-\nnal rounds of state appeals had no lawyer to represent\nthem.”).\n                            B\n   This system was in place when, in 1997, Alabama\ncharged Maples with two counts of capital murder; the\nvictims, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne Robinson\nII, were Maples’ friends who, on the night of the murders,\nhad been out on the town with him. Maples pleaded not\nguilty, and his case proceeded to trial, where he was rep-\nresented by two court-appointed Alabama attorneys. Only\none of them had earlier served in a capital case. See Tr.\n3081. Neither counsel had previously tried the penalty\nphase of a capital case. Compensation for each lawyer was\ncapped at $1,000 for time spent out-of-court preparing\nMaples’ case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services.\nSee Ala. Code §15–12–21 (1995).\n   Finding Maples guilty on both counts, the jury recom-\nmended that he be sentenced to death.

At the time, Alabama\nrequired out-of-state attorneys to associate local counsel\nwhen seeking admission to practice pro hac vice before an\nAlabama court, regardless of the nature of the proceeding.\nRule Governing Admission to the Ala. State Bar VII (2000)\n(hereinafter Rule VII).3 The Alabama Rule further pre-\nscribed that the local attorney’s name “appear on all no-\ntices, orders, pleadings, and other documents filed in the\ncause,” and that local counsel “accept joint and several\nresponsibility with the foreign attorney to the client, to\nopposing parties and counsel, and to the court or adminis-\ntrative agency in all matters [relating to the case].”\nRule VII(C).\n   Munanka and Ingen-Housz associated Huntsville, Ala-\nbama attorney John Butler as local counsel.

Id., at 257a. This arrangement between out-\nof-state and local attorneys, it appears, was hardly atypi-\ncal. See Justices Brief 36 (“The fact is that local counsel\nfor out-of-state attorneys in post-conviction litigation most\noften do nothing other than provide the mechanism for\nforeign attorneys to be admitted.”).\n  With the aid of his pro bono counsel, Maples filed a\npetition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 32.4 Among other claims, Maples\nasserted that his court-appointed attorneys provided con-\nstitutionally ineffective assistance during both guilt and\npenalty phases of his capital trial. App. 29–126. He\nalleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and under-\nfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious\nintoxication defense, did not object to several egregious\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully un-\nderprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State\nresponded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples’\npetition. On December 27, 2001, the trial court denied the\nState’s motion.\n  Some seven months later, in the summer of 2002, both\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan & Cromwell.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 258a.

In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 6.2, Comment, neither attorney sought the\ntrial court’s leave to withdraw, App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a.\nCompounding Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s inaction, no\nother Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer entered an appearance\non Maples’ behalf, moved to substitute counsel, or other-\nwise notified the court of any change in Maples’ represen-\ntation. Ibid.\n   Another nine months passed. During this time period,\nno Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys assigned to Maples’\ncase sought admission to the Alabama bar, entered ap-\npearances on Maples’ behalf, or otherwise advised the\nAlabama court that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were no\nlonger Maples’ attorneys. Thus, Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz (along with Butler) remained Maples’ listed, and\nonly, “attorneys of record.” Id., at 223a.\n   There things stood when, in May 2003, the trial court,\nwithout holding a hearing, entered an order denying\nMaples’ Rule 32 petition. App. 146–225.5 The clerk of the\nAlabama trial court mailed copies of the order to Maples’\nthree attorneys of record. He sent Munanka’s and Ingen-\nHousz’s copies to Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York ad-\ndress, which the pair had provided upon entering their\nappearances.\n   When those copies arrived at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz had long since departed. The\nnotices, however, were not forwarded to another Sullivan\n& Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom employee sent\nthe unopened envelopes back to the court. “Returned to\nSender—Attempted, Unknown” was stamped on the enve-\nlope addressed to Munanka. App. to Reply to Brief in\n\n——————\n  5 One  of Maples’ attorneys observed, without contradiction, that the\ntrial court’s order was a “word for word copy of the proposed Order that\nthe State had submitted [with] its [December 2001] Motion to Dismiss.”\nId., at 300.\n8                    MAPLES v.

A similar stamp appeared on the envelope\naddressed to Ingen-Housz, along with the handwritten\nnotation “Return to Sender—Left Firm.” Id., at 7a.\n   Upon receiving back the unopened envelopes he had\nmailed to Munanka and Ingen-Housz, the Alabama court\nclerk took no further action. In particular, the clerk did\nnot contact Munanka or Ingen-Housz at the personal\ntelephone numbers or home addresses they had provided\nin their pro hac vice applications. See Ingen-Housz Veri-\nfied Application for Admission to Practice Under Rule VII,\np. 1; and Munanka Verified Application for Admission to\nPractice Under Rule VII, p. 1, in Maples v. State, No. CC–\n95–842.60 (C. C. Morgan Cty., Ala.). Nor did the clerk\nalert Sullivan & Cromwell or Butler. Butler received his\ncopy of the order, but did not act on it. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 256a. He assumed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwho had been “CC’d” on the order, would take care of filing\nan appeal. Ibid.\n   Meanwhile, the clock ticked on Maples’ appeal. Under\nAlabama’s Rules of Appellate Procedure, Maples had 42\ndays to file a notice of appeal from the trial court’s May 22,\n2003 order denying Maples’ petition for postconviction\nrelief. Rule 4(a)(1) (2000). No appeal notice was filed, and\nthe time allowed for filing expired on July 7, 2003.\n   A little over a month later, on August 13, 2003, Ala-\nbama Assistant Attorney General Jon Hayden, the attor-\nney representing the State in Maples’ collateral review\nproceedings, sent a letter directly to Maples. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 253a–254a. Hayden’s letter informed Maples of\nthe missed deadline for initiating an appeal within the\nState’s system, and notified him that four weeks remained\nduring which he could file a federal habeas petition. Ibid.\nHayden mailed the letter to Maples only, using his prison\naddress. Ibid. No copy was sent to Maples’ attorneys of\nrecord, or to anyone else acting on Maples’ behalf. Ibid.\n   Upon receiving the State’s letter, Maples immediately\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontacted his mother. Id., at 258a. She telephoned Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell to inquire about her son’s case. Ibid.\nPrompted by her call, Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys\nMarc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submit-\nted a motion, through Butler, asking the trial court to\nreissue its order denying Maples’ Rule 32 petition, thereby\nrestarting the 42-day appeal period. Id., at 222a.\n   The trial court denied the motion, id., at 222a–225a, not-\ning that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had not withdrawn\nfrom the case and, consequently, were “still attor-\nneys of record for the petitioner,” id., at 223a. Further-\nmore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and\nBrewer had not “yet been admitted to practice in Ala-\nbama” or “entered appearances as attorneys of record.”\nIbid. “How,” the court asked, “can a Circuit Clerk in\nDecatur, Alabama know what is going on in a law firm in\nNew York, New York?” Id., at 223a–224a. Declining to\nblame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline,\nthe court said it was “unwilling to enter into subterfuge in\norder to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the peti-\ntioner.” Ibid.\n   Maples next petitioned the Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals for a writ of mandamus, granting him leave to file\nan out-of-time appeal. Rejecting Maples’ plea, the Court of\nCriminal Appeals determined that, although the clerk had\n“assumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of\nMaples’s Rule 32 petition,” the clerk had satisfied that\nobligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at\nthe addresses those attorneys provided. Id., at 234a–235a.\nButler’s receipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to\nnotify all attorneys “in light of their apparent co-counsel\nstatus.” Id., at 235a–236a (quoting Thomas v. Kellett, 489\nSo. 2d 554, 555 (Ala. 1986)). The Alabama Supreme Court\nsummarily affirmed the Court of Criminal Appeals’ judg-\nment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a, and this Court denied\ncertiorari, Maples v. Alabama, 543 U.

THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Having exhausted his state postconviction remedies,\nMaples sought federal habeas corpus relief. Addressing\nthe ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples\nstated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples\nhad forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed,\npresent the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32)\npetition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal\nfrom the trial court’s denial of his petition. That proce-\ndural default, the State maintained, precluded federal-\ncourt consideration of the claims.6 Maples replied that the\ndefault should be excused, because he missed the appeal\ndeadline “through no fault of his own.” App. 262 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  The District Court determined that Maples had default-\ned his ineffective-assistance claims, and that he had not\nshown “cause” sufficient to overcome the default. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 49a–55a. The court understood Maples to\nargue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel,\nnot any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama,\nprovided the requisite “cause” to excuse his failure to meet\nAlabama’s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. Id., at 55a. Such an\nargument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this\nCourt, in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), had\nheld that the ineffectiveness of postconviction appellate\ncounsel could not qualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (citing Coleman, 501 U. S., at 751).\n  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Ma-\nples v. Allen, 586 F. 3d 879 (2009) (per curiam).

Id., at 895–898. She conclud-\ned that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals had acted\n“arbitrarily” in refusing to grant Maples’ request for an\nout-of-time appeal. Id., at 896. In a case involving “indis-\ntinguishable facts,” Judge Barkett noted, the Alabama\nappellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late\nappeal. Ibid. (citing Marshall v. State, 884 So. 2d 898, 899\n(Ala. Crim. App. 2002)). Inconsistent application of the\n42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, “render[ed]\nthe rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal\nreview of Maples’s claims.” 586 F. 3d, at 897. The inter-\nests of justice, she added, required review of Maples’\nclaims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high\nstakes involved, and the absence of any fault on Maples’\npart. Ibid.\n  We granted certiorari to decide whether the uncommon\nfacts presented here establish cause adequate to excuse\nMaples’ procedural default. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n\n                               A\n\n   As a rule, a state prisoner’s habeas claims may not be\nentertained by a federal court “when (1) ‘a state court\n[has] declined to address [those] claims because the pris-\noner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,’\nand (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent and\nadequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin,\n562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (quoting Coleman,\n501 U. S., at 729–730). The bar to federal review may be\nlifted, however, if “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for\nthe [procedural] default [in state court] and actual preju-\ndice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.” Id.,\nat 750; see Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85\n12                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1977).\n   Given the single issue on which we granted review, we\nwill assume, for purposes of this decision, that the Ala-\nbama Court of Criminal Appeals’ refusal to consider\nMaples’ ineffective-assistance claims rested on an independ-\nent and adequate state procedural ground: namely,\nMaples’ failure to satisfy Alabama’s Rule requiring a\nnotice of appeal to be filed within 42 days from the trial\ncourt’s final order. Accordingly, we confine our considera-\ntion to the question whether Maples has shown cause to\nexcuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.\n   Cause for a procedural default exists where “something\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him[,] . . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply\nwith the State’s procedural rule.’ ” Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986);\nemphasis in original). Negligence on the part of a prison-\ner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as “cause.”\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 753. That is so, we reasoned in\nColeman, because the attorney is the prisoner’s agent, and\nunder “well-settled principles of agency law,” the principal\nbears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his\nagent. Id., at 753–754. See also Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (“Under our\nsystem of representative litigation, ‘each party is deemed\nbound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.’ ” (quoting Link v.\nWabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962))). Thus, when a\npetitioner’s postconviction attorney misses a filing dead-\nline, the petitioner is bound by the oversight and cannot\nrely on it to establish cause. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753–\n754. We do not disturb that general rule.\n   A markedly different situation is presented, however, when\nan attorney abandons his client without notice, and there-\nby occasions the default. Having severed the principal-\nagent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails\nto act, as the client’s representative. See 1 Restatement\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

His acts or\nomissions therefore “cannot fairly be attributed to [the\nclient].” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753.

Florida, 560 U. S. ___\n(2010), is instructive. That case involved a missed one-\nyear deadline, prescribed by 28 U. S. C. §2244(d), for filing\na federal habeas petition. Holland presented two issues:\nfirst, whether the §2244(d) time limitation can be tolled\nfor equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney’s\nunprofessional conduct can ever count as an “extraordi-\nnary circumstance” justifying equitable tolling. 560 U. S.,\nat ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 1, 16–17) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). We answered yes to both questions.\n   On the second issue, the Court recognized that an at-\ntorney’s negligence, for example, miscalculating a filing\ndeadline, does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory\ntime limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___–___\n(ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 5–6); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327,\n336 (2007).

S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 5–7). Holland’s plea fit the latter\ncategory: He alleged abandonment “evidenced by counsel’s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id.,\nat ___–___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3–4, 20). If\ntrue, JUSTICE ALITO explained, “petitioner’s allegations\nwould suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances\nbeyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a liti-\ngant cannot be held constructively responsible for the\nconduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent\nin any meaningful sense of that word.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).7\n  We agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot\nbe charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who\nhas abandoned him.

Unknown to\nMaples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his\nattorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from\nthe trial court’s order.\n                             1\n   The State contends that Sullivan & Cromwell repre-\nsented Maples throughout his state postconviction pro-\nceedings. Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot\nestablish abandonment by counsel continuing through the\nsix weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial\ncourt’s denial of his Rule 32 petition. We disagree. It is\nundisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their\nagency relationship with Maples long before the default\noccurred. See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the\ntwo attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw\nfrom the case). Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell’s employ in the summer of 2002, at\nleast nine months before the Alabama trial court entered\nits order denying Rule 32 relief. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n258a. Their new employment—Munanka as a law clerk\nfor a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the\nEuropean Commission in Belgium—disabled them from\ncontinuing to represent Maples. See Code of Conduct for\nJudicial Employees, Canon 4(D)(3) (1999) (prohibiting\njudicial employees from participating in “litigation against\nfederal, state or local government”); Staff Regulations of\nOfficials of the European Commission, Tit.

Hornbook agency law establishes that the at-\ntorneys’ departure from Sullivan & Cromwell and their\ncommencement of employment that prevented them from\nrepresenting Maples ended their agency relationship with\nhim. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency §112 (1957)\n(hereinafter Restatement (Second)) (“[T]he authority of an\nagent terminates if, without knowledge of the principal, he\nacquires adverse interests or if he is otherwise guilty of\na serious breach of loyalty to the principal.”); 2 id., §394,\nComment a (“[T]he agent commits a breach of duty [of\nloyalty] to his principal by acting for another in an under-\ntaking which has a substantial tendency to cause him to\ndisregard his duty to serve his principal with only his\nprincipal’s purposes in mind.”).\n   Furthermore, the two attorneys did not observe Ala-\nbama’s Rule requiring them to seek the trial court’s per-\nmission to withdraw. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2,\nComment. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) §111, Comment b\n(“[I]t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend\nan agent to do an illegal act.”). By failing to seek permis-\nsion to withdraw, Munanka and Ingen-Housz allowed the\ncourt’s records to convey that they represented Maples.\nAs listed attorneys of record, they, not Maples, would be\nthe addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the\nclerk to furnish. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.5 (“Upon\nthe entry of any order in a criminal proceeding made in\nresponse to a motion, . . . the clerk shall, without undue\ndelay, furnish all parties a copy thereof by mail or by other\nappropriate means.”) and 34.4 (“[W]here the defendant is\nrepresented by counsel, service shall be made upon the\nattorney of record.”).\n   Although acknowledging that Munanka and Ingen-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Regarding this assertion, we\nnote, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sulli-\nvan & Cromwell attorneys played. In an affidavit submit-\nted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples’\nrequest that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra,\nat 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been “in-\nvolved in [Maples’] case since the summer of 2001.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 257a. After the trial court initially denied\nthe State’s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw\ninformed the court, Sullivan & Cromwell “lawyers working\non this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated]\nevidentiary hearing.” Id., at 258a. Another Sullivan &\nCromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit\nsubmitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003,\nthat she “ha[d] worked on [Maples’] case since October 14,\n2002.” App. 231. But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy de-\nscribed what their “involve[ment]” or “wor[k] on [Maples’]\ncase” entailed. And neither attorney named the lawyers,\nother than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still\nwith Sullivan & Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in\npreparation for the expected hearing. Nor did De Leeuw\nidentify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed\non Maples’ case between Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s\ndepartures and the firm’s receipt of the telephone call\nfrom Maples’ mother.8\n——————\n   8 The unclear state of the record is perhaps not surprising, given Sul-\n\nlivan & Cromwell’s representation of Maples after the default. As\namici for Maples explain, a significant conflict of interest arose for the\nfirm once the crucial deadline passed. Brief for Legal Ethics Professors\net al. as Amici Curiae 23–27. Following the default, the firm’s interest\nin avoiding damage to its own reputation was at odds with Maples’\nstrongest argument—i.e., that his attorneys had abandoned him,\n18                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The slim record on activity at Sullivan & Cromwell,\nhowever, does not warrant a remand to determine more\nprecisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Mu-\nnanka and Ingen-Housz. For the facts essential to our\ndecision are not in doubt. At the time of the default, the\nSullivan & Cromwell attorneys who later came forward—\nDe Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer—had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\ntheir appearances on Maples’ behalf, and had done noth-\ning to inform the Alabama court that they wished to sub-\nstitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. Thus, none of\nthese attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf before his time to appeal expired. Cf. 1 Restate-\nment (Second) §111 (The “failure to acquire a qualification\nby the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized\nact . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act.”).9 What\nthey did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore\n——————\ntherefore he had cause to be relieved from the default. Yet Sullivan &\nCromwell did not cede Maples’ representation to a new attorney, who\ncould have made Maples’ abandonment argument plain to the Court of\nAppeals. Instead, the firm represented Maples through briefing and\noral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, where they attempted to cast\nresponsibility for the mishap on the clerk of the Alabama trial court.\nGiven Sullivan & Cromwell’s conflict of interest, Maples’ federal habeas\npetition, prepared and submitted by the firm, is not persuasive evi-\ndence that Maples, prior to the default, ever “viewed himself” as repre-\nsented by “the firm,” see post, at 4, rather than by his attorneys of\nrecord, Munanka and Ingen-Housz.\n   9 The dissent argues that the Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no\n\nbasis “to infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.”\nPost, at 6–7. While that may be true, it is irrelevant. What the attor-\nneys could have inferred is that Maples would not have wanted them to\nfile a notice of appeal on his behalf prior to their admission to practice\nin Alabama, for doing so would be “illegal,” post, at 7 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). See also 1 Restatement (Second) §111, Comment\nb, quoted supra, at 16. For the critical purpose of filing a notice of\nappeal, then, the other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys had no authority\nto act for Maples.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeside the point. At the time critical to preserving Maples’\naccess to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz,\nwere not Maples’ authorized agents.\n                              2\n   Maples’ only other attorney of record, local counsel\nButler, also left him abandoned. Indeed, Butler did not\neven begin to represent Maples. Butler informed Munan-\nka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel\nonly for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attor-\nneys to appear pro hac vice. Supra, at 5–6. Lacking the\nnecessary “resources, available time [and] experience,”\nButler told the two Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers, he\nwould not “deal with substantive issues in the case.” Ibid.\nThat the minimal participation he undertook was incon-\nsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, un-\nderscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because\nButler signed on as local counsel.\n   In recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other\nthan to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro\nhac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler’s and De\nLeeuw’s statements to that effect. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n255a–258a. Other factors confirm that Butler did not\n“operat[e] as [Maples’] agent in any meaningful sense of\nthat word.” Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).\nThe first is Butler’s own conduct. Upon receiving a copy of\nthe trial court’s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact\nSullivan & Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were\ntaking appropriate action. Although Butler had reason to\nbelieve that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a\ncopy of the court’s order, see App. 225 (indicating that\nMunanka and Ingen-Housz were CC’d on the order), But-\nler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New York\nfirm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely repre-\nsentative role in the case.\n20                       MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Notably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples’ actual\nrepresentative. Assistant Attorney General Hayden ad-\ndressed the letter informing Maples of the default directly\nto Maples in prison. See supra, at 8. Hayden sent no copy\nto, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed\nas counsel of record for Maples. Lawyers in Alabama have\nan ethical obligation to refrain from communicating direct-\nly with an opposing party known to be represented by\ncounsel. See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003);\nAla. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all\ndocuments “be made upon the attorney of record”). In\nwriting directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this\nethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden\nmust have believed that Maples was no longer represented\nby counsel, out-of-state or local.10\n  In sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no\ntime before the missed deadline was Butler serving as\nMaples’ agent “in any meaningful sense of that word.”\nHolland, 560 U. S., at ___ (opinion of ALITO, J.) (slip op.,\nat 6).\n                             3\n  Not only was Maples left without any functioning attor-\nney of record, the very listing of Munanka, Ingen-Housz,\nand Butler as his representatives meant that he had no\nright personally to receive notice. See supra, at 16. He in\n——————\n  10 Itbears note, as well, that the State served its response to Maples’\nRule 32 petition only on Munanka at Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York\naddress, not on Butler. App. 26. While the State may not be obligated\nto serve more than one attorney of record, its selection of New York\nrather than local counsel is some indication that, from the start, the\nState was cognizant of the limited role Butler would serve. Conforming\nthe State’s Rule to common practice, in 2006, the Alabama Supreme\nCourt amended the provision on appearances by out-of-state counsel to\neliminate the requirement that such attorneys associate local counsel\nwhen representing indigent criminal defendants pro bono in postconvic-\ntion proceedings.

Had counsel of record or the State’s\nattorney informed Maples of his plight before the time to\nappeal ran out, he could have filed a notice of appeal\nhimself11 or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys.12\nGiven no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and\nwilling to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from\ncomplying with the State’s procedural rule.\n                              C\n   “The cause and prejudice requirement,” we have said,\n“shows due regard for States’ finality and comity interests\nwhile ensuring that ‘fundamental fairness [remains] the\ncentral concern of the writ of habeas corpus.’ ” Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 393 (2004) (quoting Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984)). In the unusual\ncircumstances of this case, principles of agency law and\nfundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There\nwas indeed cause to excuse Maples’ procedural default.\nThrough no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance\nof any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama\nallows for noticing an appeal from a trial court’s denial of\npostconviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason\nto suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se\nstatus. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circum-\nstances quite beyond his control.

Unbeknownst to peti-\ntioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation\ndue to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortu-\nnate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the\ntwo young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in\nhis state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by\nthese two attorneys of new employment that precluded\nthem from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to\nnotify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to\nwithdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure\nof the firm that they left to monitor the status of petition-\ner’s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of\nthe decision denying petitioner’s request for state post-\nconviction relief was received in that firm’s offices, the\nfailure of the firm’s mail room to route that important\ncommunication to either another member of the firm or to\nthe departed attorneys’ new addresses; (7) the failure of\nthe clerk’s office to take any action when the envelope\ncontaining that notice came back unopened; and (8) local\ncounsel’s very limited conception of the role that he was\nobligated to play in petitioner’s representation. Under\nthese unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner’s\nattorneys effectively abandoned him and that this aban-\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndonment was a “cause” that is sufficient to overcome pe-\ntitioner’s procedural default.\n   In an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner’s\ncounsel in the case now before us cast blame for what\noccurred on Alabama’s system of providing legal represen-\ntation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral\nproceedings. See Brief for Petitioner 3–6. But whatever\nmay be said about Alabama’s system, I do not think that\nAlabama’s system had much if anything to do with peti-\ntioner’s misfortune. The quality of petitioner’s representa-\ntion at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet\nthe deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial\nof his state postconviction petition. Nor do I see any im-\nportant connection between what happened in this case\nand Alabama’s system for providing representation for\nprisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to\npetition the state courts for collateral relief. Unlike other\nStates, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to\nrepresent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that\nmost of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.\nId., at 4. Petitioner’s brief states that the Alabama system\nhad “a direct bearing on the events giving rise . . . to the\nprocedural default at issue,” id., at 3, but a similar combi-\nnation of untoward events could have occurred if petition-\ner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were\nappointed by the court and paid for with state funds. The\nfirm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one\nof the country’s most prestigious and expensive, and I\nhave little doubt that the vast majority of criminal de-\nfendants would think that they had won the lottery if they\nwere given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys\nfrom such a firm. See id., at 9 (stating that it “seemed as\nthough Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys\nworking at an elite New York law firm . . . agreed to rep-\nresent Maples pro bono”).\n   What occurred here was not a predictable consequence\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Court now concludes\nthat Maples has established cause for his procedural\ndefault by reason of abandonment by his attorneys. Be-\ncause I cannot agree with that conclusion, and because\nMaples’ alternative argument fares no better, I would\naffirm the judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Our doctrine of procedural default reflects, and furthers,\nthe principle that errors in state criminal trials should\nbe remedied in state court. As we have long recognized,\nfederal habeas review for state prisoners imposes signifi-\ncant costs on the States, undermining not only their prac-\ntical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,\nsee Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126–127 (1982), but also\nthe primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitu-\ntional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id.,\nat 128. We have further recognized that “[t]hese costs are\n2                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparticularly high . . . when a state prisoner, through a\nprocedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitu-\ntional claims in state court.” Coleman v. Thompson, 501\nU. S. 722, 748 (1991). In that situation, the prisoner has\n“deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\nthose claims in the first instance,” id., at 732, thereby\nleaving the state courts without “a chance to mend their\nown fences and avoid federal intrusion,” Engle, 456 U. S.,\nat 129. For that reason, and because permitting federal-\ncourt review of defaulted claims would “undercu[t] the\nState’s ability to enforce its procedural rules,” ibid., we\nhave held that when a state court has relied on an ade-\nquate and independent state procedural ground in denying\na prisoner’s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain\nfederal habeas relief. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729–730.\n   To be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of\ndefaulted claims is not absolute. A habeas petitioner’s de-\nfault in state court will not bar federal habeas review if\n“the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,”\nid., at 748—“cause” constituting “something external to\nthe petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed\nto him,” that impeded compliance with the State’s proce-\ndural rule, id., at 753. As a general matter, an attorney’s\nmistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard “because\nthe attorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or\nfailing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the\npetitioner must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986)).\nSee also Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 633–634,\nand n. 10 (1962).\n   When an attorney’s error occurs at a stage of the pro-\nceedings at which the defendant has a constitutional right\nto effective assistance of counsel, that error may constitute\ncause to excuse a resulting procedural default.

S. 668 (1984), makes the attorney’s error\nchargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.\nSee Murray, supra, at 488. But when the client has no\nright to counsel—as is the case in the postconviction set-\nting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555\n(1987)—the client bears the risk of all attorney errors\nmade in the course of the representation, regardless of the\negregiousness of the mistake. Coleman, supra, at 754\n(“[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters,\nbut that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to\ncounsel, so that the error must be seen as an external\nfactor”).\n                                B\n   In light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct\nto conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner’s proce-\ndural default may be excused when it is attributable to\nabandonment by his attorney. In such a case, Coleman’s\nrationale for attributing the attorney’s acts and omissions\nto the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased\nacting as the client’s agent, “well-settled principles of\nagency law,” 501 U. S., at 754, no longer support charging\nthe client with his lawyer’s mistakes. The attorney’s\nmistakes may therefore be understood as an “external\nfactor,” ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may jus-\ntify excusing the prisoner’s procedural default.\n   I likewise agree with the Court’s conclusion, ante, at 15,\nthat Maples’ two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi\nMunanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples\nby the time the Alabama trial court entered its order\ndenying his petition for postconviction relief. As the Court\nobserves, ante, at 15–16, without informing Maples or\nseeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw\nfrom Maples’ case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell’s employ and accepted new positions\nthat precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.\n4                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as\nMaples’ agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency\n§119, Comment b (1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d),\nand thus terminated their authority to act on Maples’\nbehalf, id., §118. As a result, Munanka’s and Ingen-\nHousz’s failure to take action in response to the trial\ncourt’s order should not be imputed to Maples.\n   It is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Ma-\nples was left unrepresented during the relevant window\nbetween the Alabama trial court’s dismissal of his post-\nconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for\nfiling a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009). Start with Maples’\nown allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition,\nMaples alleged that, at the time he sought postconvic-\ntion relief in Alabama trial court, he “was represented by\nSullivan & Cromwell of New York, New York.” App. 256.\nAlthough the petition went on to identify Munanka and\nIngen-Housz as “the two Sullivan lawyers handling the\nmatter,” id., at 257, its statement that Maples was “repre-\nsented” by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples\nviewed himself as having retained the services of the firm\nas a whole, a perfectly natural understanding. “When a\nclient retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the\npresumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have\nbeen retained.” 1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Govern-\ning Lawyers §31, Comment f, p. 222 (1998). Admittedly,\nin connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial\ncourt to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan & Cromwell\npartner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating\nthat the firm’s lawyers “handle pro bono cases on an indi-\nvidual basis” and that the lawyers who had appeared in\nMaples’ case had followed that practice, “attempt[ing] not\nto use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 257a. But Maples’ habeas petition is\nthe pleading that initiated the current litigation; and\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsurely the allegations that it contained should be given\npriority over representations made to prior courts.*\n   In any case, even if Maples had no attorney-client rela-\ntionship with the Sullivan & Cromwell firm, Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz were surely not the only Sullivan &\nCromwell lawyers who represented Maples on an individ-\nual basis. De Leeuw’s affidavit acknowledged that he had\n“been involved in [Maples’] case since the summer of\n2001,” ibid., roughly a year before Munanka and Ingen-\nHousz left Sullivan & Cromwell, and it further stated that\nafter “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka” learned of the\ncourt’s initial order denying the State’s motion to dismiss\nMaples’ postconviction petition in December 2001, “the\nlawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared\nfor the evidentiary hearing” Maples had requested, id., at\n258a. Moreover, when Sullivan & Cromwell attorney\nFelice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before\nthe Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to\nextend the deadline, she stated that she had “worked on\n[Maples’] case since October 14, 2002,” App. 231, months\nbefore the procedural default took place.\n   According to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw’s\naffidavit does not make clear how he was “involved” in\n——————\n   * The Court says that the allegations in Maples’ own habeas petition\nare not “persuasive evidence,” ante, at 17–18, n. 8, because Maples’\nlawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest\nwhen they prepared the document. This is a curious point, since the\neffect of Maples’ statement was to implicate Sullivan & Cromwell as a\nfirm in missing the filing deadline. The conflict would have induced the\nSullivan & Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm. To be sure, as the\ncase later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been\nconceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples’\ninterest to say he had no lawyers. But the issue the petition’s state-\nment raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is\nwhether the statement was true. And if Sullivan & Cromwell’s in-\nvolvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only\nreinforces the truth.\n6                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples’ case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and\nIngen-Housz were among those who prepared for the\nanticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy’s motion does\nnot make clear what her “wor[k]” entailed. But there is\nlittle doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the\nonly attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that\nDe Leeuw was “involved” and Duffy “worked” as lawyers\nfor Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).\nDe Leeuw’s distinction between “Ms. Ingen-Housz and Mr.\nMunanka” and “the lawyers working on his case for Mr.\nMaples” would have been senseless if the latter category\ndid not extend beyond the two named attorneys.\n   In sum, there is every indication that when the trial\ncourt entered its order dismissing Maples’ postconviction\npetition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented\nby a team of attorneys in Sullivan & Cromwell’s New York\noffice. The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of\nthese attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been\nadmitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered\nappearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not\nsought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz. See\nante, at 18–19. The Court does not, however, explain why\nthese facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples’\nagents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the\ncase that did not require court appearance—which would\ncertainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing\ndeadlines. The Court’s quotation from the Restatement of\nAgency, ante, at 18, that the “failure to acquire a qualifica-\ntion by the agent without which it is illegal to do an au-\nthorized act . . . terminates the agent’s authority to act,” 1\nRestatement 2d, §111, at 290, omits the crucial condition\ncontained at the end of the section: “if thereafter he [the\nagent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts,\nwould not consent to the further exercise of the authority.”\nThere was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer\nthat Maples no longer wanted them to represent him,\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsimply because they had not yet qualified before the Ala-\nbama court. Though it would have been “illegal” for these\nattorneys to file a notice of appeal without being author-\nized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from\nfirst seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka\nand Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a\nnotice of appeal.\n   It would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurispru-\ndence to disregard all attorney errors committed before\nadmission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap\nto disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed\nbefore the attorney enters an appearance. Moreover, even\nif these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples’ agents for\npurposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were\nat least his agents for purposes of advising him of the\nimpending deadline. His unawareness was the fault of\ncounsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.\nWhat happened here is simply “[a]ttorney ignorance or\ninadvertence” of the sort that does not furnish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default. Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753.\n   But even leaving aside the question of Maples’ “unad-\nmitted” attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell, Maples had a\nfully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance,\nin the person of local counsel, John Butler. There is no\nsupport for the Court’s conclusion that Butler “did not\neven begin to represent Maples.” Ante, at 19. True, the\naffidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the\nproceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that\nhe had “no substantive involvement” with the case, and\nthat he had “agreed to serve as local counsel only.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 255a. But a disclaimer of “substantive in-\nvolvement” in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer’s\nethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a\ndenial of any agency role at all. A local attorney’s “non-\nsubstantive” involvement would surely include, at a min-\nimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising\n8                   MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“substantive” counsel of impending deadlines. Nor did\nButler’s explanation for his failure to act when he received\na copy of the trial court’s order sound in abandonment.\nButler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order\nbecause he did not consider Maples to be his client. In-\nstead, based on “past practice” and the content of the\norder, Butler “assumed” that Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan\n& Cromwell would receive a copy. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n256a.\n   The Court gets this badly wrong when it states that\n“Butler’s failure even to place a phone call to the New\nYork firm” demonstrates Butler’s “disclaimer of any genu-\ninely representative role.” Ante, at 19. By equating the\nvery attorney error that contributed to Maples’ procedural\ndefault with the absence of an agency relationship, the\nCourt ensures that today’s opinion will serve as a template\nfor future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman’s\nholding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will\nnot furnish cause to excuse a procedural default. See 501\nU. S., at 752–754. The trick will be to allege, not that\ncounsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel’s ineffec-\ntiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely repre-\nsentative agent. No precedent should be so easily circum-\nvented by word games, but the damage is particularly\nacute when the affected precedent is so firmly “grounded\nin concerns of comity and federalism.” Id., at 730.\n   The Court’s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion\nthat Butler was not Maples’ agent is to point out that a\nprosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him\nof the defaulted appeal. See ante, at 20. The Court rea-\nsons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples\nhad been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate\nwith a represented party would have been a violation of\nethical standards. Ibid. But even if this supposition is\ncorrect, it is hard to understand what it proves. What\nmatters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really\nwas abandoned. And as it turns out, Butler’s conduct\nafter learning about the default further belies any such\ncontention. Almost immediately, Butler began to cooper-\nate with Maples’ lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell, filing\npapers as “Counsel for Mr. Maples” or “Local Counsel for\nPetitioner Cory Maples” in multiple courts in an attempt\nto rectify the mistake. See App. 229, 230, 236, 238. Had\nButler reassumed his representational duties after having\nabandoned them? Hardly. There is no proper basis for a\nconclusion of abandonment interruptus.\n                               II\n   Maples argues in the alternative that his default should\nbe excused because his right to due process was violated\nwhen the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Mu-\nnanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s copies of the court’s dismissal\norder were returned undeliverable. According to Maples,\nour decision in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220 (2006),\nestablishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.\n   We held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax\nsale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional\nreasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the prop-\nerty owner before selling his property. See id., at 234. It\nis questionable whether that holding has any relevance to\nthe circumstances here, which involved not the institution\nof proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather\nthe issuance of an order in a pending case that was insti-\ntuted by Maples himself. Indeed, I think it doubtful\nwhether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a\ncourt’s order in a pending case. The Federal Rules cer-\ntainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute require-\nment. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides\nthat “[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment]\ndoes not affect the time for appeal or relieve—or authorize\nthe court to relieve—a party for failing to appeal within\n10                    MAPLES v. THOMAS\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure (4)(a).” And although Federal Rule\nof Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for\nfiling an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not\nreceive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment\nor order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to\nreopen must be filed. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).\n    There is no need to grapple with this question, however,\nbecause Butler received a copy of the trial court’s order.\n“Under our system of representative litigation, ‘each party\n. . . is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which\ncan be charged upon [his] attorney.’ ” Irwin v. Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (quoting Link\nv. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962)). The notice to\nButler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.\n                         *   *     *\n  One suspects that today’s decision is motivated in large\npart by an understandable sense of frustration with the\nState’s refusal to waive Maples’ procedural default in\nthe interest of fairness. Indeed, that frustration may well\nexplain the Court’s lengthy indictment of Alabama’s gen-\neral procedures for providing representation to capital\ndefendants, ante, at 2–4, a portion of the Court’s opinion\nthat is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be\notherwise inexplicable.\n  But if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing\nMaples’ procedural default here, it does so whenever a\ndefendant’s procedural default is caused by his attorney.\nThat is simply not the law—and cannot be, if the states\nare to have an orderly system of criminal litigation con-\nducted by counsel. Our precedents allow a State to stand\non its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner’s procedural\ndefault even when counsel is to blame.
