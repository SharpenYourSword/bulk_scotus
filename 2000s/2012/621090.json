Argued October 5, 2011\u2014Decided January 18, 2012\r\nThe Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\r\n  (Berne), which took effect in 1886, is the principal accord governing\r\n  international copyright relations. Berne\u2019s 164 member states agree\r\n  to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat au-\r\n  thors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.\r\n  Of central importance in this case, Article 18 of Berne requires coun-\r\n  tries to protect the works of other member states unless the works\u2019\r\n  copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is\r\n  claimed or the country of origin. A different system of transnational\r\n  copyright protection long prevailed in this country. Throughout most\r\n  of the 20th century, the only foreign authors eligible for Copyright\r\n  Act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights\r\n  to American authors and whose works were printed in the United\r\n  States. Despite Article 18, when the United States joined Berne in\r\n  1989, it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the U. S. public\r\n  domain, many of them works never protected here. In 1994, howev-\r\n  er, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property\r\n  Rights mandated implementation of Berne\u2019s first 21 articles, on pain\r\n  of enforcement by the World Trade Organization.\r\n     In response, Congress applied the term of protection available to\r\n  U. S. works to preexisting works from Berne member countries. Sec-\r\n  tion 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) grants copy-\r\n  right protection to works protected in their country of origin, but\r\n  lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The\r\n  United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the\r\n  time of publication; the United States did not protect sound record-\r\n  ings fixed before 1972; or the author had not complied with certain\r\n2                          GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    U. S. statutory formalities. Works encompassed by \u00a7514 are granted\r\n    the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States main-\r\n    tained copyright relations with the author\u2019s country or removed for-\r\n    malities incompatible with Berne. As a consequence of the barriers\r\n    to U. S. copyright protection prior to \u00a7514\u2019s enactment, foreign works\r\n    \u201crestored\u201d to protection by the measure had entered the public do-\r\n    main in this country. To cushion the impact of their placement in\r\n    protected status, \u00a7514 provides ameliorating accommodations for\r\n    parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was\r\n    enacted.\r\n      Petitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and\r\n    others who formerly enjoyed free access to works \u00a7514 removed from\r\n    the public domain. They maintain that Congress, in passing \u00a7514,\r\n    exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed\r\n    First Amendment limitations. The District Court granted the Attor-\r\n    ney General\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Affirming in part, the\r\n    Tenth Circuit agreed that Congress had not offended the Copyright\r\n    Clause, but concluded that \u00a7514 required further First Amendment\r\n    inspection in light of Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186. On remand,\r\n    the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the\r\n    First Amendment claim, holding that \u00a7514\u2019s constriction of the public\r\n    domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests. The\r\n    Tenth Circuit reversed, ruling that \u00a7514 was narrowly tailored to fit\r\n    the important government aim of protecting U. S. copyright holders\u2019\r\n    interests abroad.\r\nHeld:\r\n    1. Section 514 does not exceed Congress\u2019 authority under the Copy-\r\n right Clause. Pp. 13\u201323.\r\n       (a) The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application\r\n of copyright protection to works in the public domain. Eldred is\r\n largely dispositive of petitioners\u2019 claim that the Clause\u2019s confinement\r\n of a copyright\u2019s lifespan to a \u201climited Tim[e]\u201d prevents the removal of\r\n works from the public domain. In Eldred, the Court upheld the Cop-\r\n yright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended, by 20 years, the\r\n terms of existing copyrights. The text of the Copyright Clause, the\r\n Court observed, contains no \u201ccommand that a time prescription, once\r\n set, becomes forever \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018inalterable,\u2019 \u201d and the Court declined to\r\n infer any such command. 537 U. S., at 199. The construction peti-\r\n tioners tender here is similarly infirm. The terms afforded works re-\r\n stored by \u00a7514 are no less \u201climited\u201d than those the CTEA lengthened.\r\n Nor had the \u201climited Tim[e]\u201d already passed for the works at issue\r\n here\u2014many of them works formerly denied any U. S. copyright pro-\r\n tection\u2014for a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end. Pe-\r\n titioners also urge that the Government\u2019s position would allow Con-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ngress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive\r\n\u201climited\u201d terms as prior terms expire. But as in Eldred, such hypo-\r\nthetical misbehavior is far afield from this case. In aligning the\r\nUnited States with other nations bound by Berne, Congress can hard-\r\nly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual\r\ncopyright regime. Pp. 13\u201315.\r\n   (b) Historical practice corroborates the Court\u2019s reading of the Copy-\r\nright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected\r\nworks. In the Copyright Act of 1790, the First Congress protected\r\nworks that had been freely reproducible under State copyright laws.\r\nSubsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the\r\nCopyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works. Several\r\nprivate bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inven-\r\ntions previously in the public domain. Congress has also passed gen-\r\nerally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works\r\nand inventions that had lost protection. Pp. 15\u201319.\r\n   (c) Petitioners also argue that \u00a7514 fails to \u201cpromote the Progress of\r\nScience\u201d as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright\r\nClause. Specifically, they claim that because \u00a7514 affects only works\r\nalready created, it cannot meet the Clause\u2019s objective. The creation\r\nof new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote\r\n\u201cScience,\u201d i.e., knowledge and learning. In Eldred, this Court rejected\r\na nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not de-\r\nmand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to\r\ninduce new works. Rather the Clause \u201cempowers Congress to deter-\r\nmine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body\u2019s\r\njudgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.\u201d 537 U. S., at 222.\r\nNothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, con-\r\nfines the \u201cProgress of Science\u201d exclusively to \u201cincentives for creation.\u201d\r\nHistorical evidence, congressional practice, and this Court\u2019s deci-\r\nsions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing\r\nworks is an appropriate means to promote science. Pp. 20\u201322.\r\n   (d) Considered against this backdrop, \u00a7514 falls comfortably within\r\nCongress\u2019 Copyright Clause authority. Congress had reason to be-\r\nlieve that a well-functioning international copyright system would\r\nencourage the dissemination of existing and future works. And tes-\r\ntimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would ex-\r\npand the foreign markets available to U. S. authors and invigorate\r\nprotection against piracy of U. S. works abroad, thus benefitting cop-\r\nyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment\r\nin the creative process. This Court has no warrant to reject Congress\u2019\r\nrational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve\r\nthe objectives of the Copyright Clause. Pp. 22\u201323.\r\n   2. The First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration author-\r\n4                           GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    ized by \u00a7514. Pp. 23\u201332.\r\n         (a) The pathmarking Eldred decision is again instructive. There,\r\n    the Court held that the CTEA\u2019s enlargement of a copyright\u2019s duration\r\n    did not offend the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of expression guaran-\r\n    tee. Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent\r\n    and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed\r\n    that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit\r\n    on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an\r\n    \u201cengine of free expression.\u201d 537 U. S., at 219. The \u201ctraditional con-\r\n    tours\u201d of copyright protection, i.e., the \u201cidea/expression dichotomy\u201d\r\n    and the \u201cfair use\u201d defense, moreover, serve as \u201cbuilt-in First Amend-\r\n    ment accommodations.\u201d Ibid. Given the speech-protective purposes\r\n    and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the\r\n    heightened review sought in Eldred. The Court reaches the same\r\n    conclusion here. Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression\r\n    distinction and the fair use defense. Moreover, Congress adopted\r\n    measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an inter-\r\n    national copyright regime. Pp. 23\u201326.\r\n         (b) Petitioners claim that First Amendment interests of a higher\r\n    order are at stake because they\u2014unlike their Eldred counterparts\u2014\r\n    enjoyed \u201cvested rights\u201d in works that had already entered the public\r\n    domain. Their contentions depend on an argument already consid-\r\n    ered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public\r\n    domain largely untouchable by Congress. Nothing in the historical\r\n    record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Court\u2019s jurispru-\r\n    dence warrants exceptional First Amendment solicitude for copy-\r\n    righted works that were once in the public domain. Congress has\r\n    several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of\r\n    works as well as works previously in the public domain. Section 514,\r\n    moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.\r\n    The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must\r\n    pay for their desired use of the author\u2019s expression, or else limit their\r\n    exploitation to \u201cfair use\u201d of those works. By fully implementing\r\n    Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most\r\n    other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.\r\n    Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would\r\n    have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when\r\n    those works were created and first published.

ERIC H.\r\n   HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\r\n                               [January 18, 2012]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and\r\nArtistic Works (Berne Convention or Berne), which took\r\neffect in 1886, is the principal accord governing interna-\r\ntional copyright relations. Latecomer to the international\r\ncopyright regime launched by Berne, the United States\r\njoined the Convention in 1989. To perfect U. S. implemen-\r\ntation of Berne, and as part of our response to the Uru-\r\nguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, Congress,\r\nin 1994, gave works enjoying copyright protection abroad\r\nthe same full term of protection available to U. S. works.\r\nCongress did so in \u00a7514 of the Uruguay Round Agree-\r\nments Act (URAA), which grants copyright protection to\r\npreexisting works of Berne member countries, protected in\r\ntheir country of origin, but lacking protection in the United\r\nStates for any of three reasons: The United States did\r\nnot protect works from the country of origin at the time of\r\npublication; the United States did not protect sound record-\r\nings fixed before 1972; or the author had failed to comply\r\nwith U. S. statutory formalities (formalities Congress no\r\nlonger requires as prerequisites to copyright protection).\r\n   The URAA accords no protection to a foreign work after\r\n2                    GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nits full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into\r\nthe public domain, whether under the laws of the country\r\nof origin or of this country. Works encompassed by \u00a7514\r\nare granted the protection they would have enjoyed had\r\nthe United States maintained copyright relations with the\r\nauthor\u2019s country or removed formalities incompatible with\r\nBerne. Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the\r\nprotection they lacked in years prior to \u00a7514\u2019s enactment.\r\nThey therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than\r\ndo their U. S. counterparts. As a consequence of the barri-\r\ners to U. S. copyright protection prior to the enactment of\r\n\u00a7514, foreign works \u201crestored\u201d to protection by the meas-\r\nure had entered the public domain in this country. To\r\ncushion the impact of their placement in protected status,\r\nCongress included in \u00a7514 ameliorating accommodations\r\nfor parties who had exploited affected works before the\r\nURAA was enacted.\r\n   Petitioners include orchestra conductors, musicians, pub-\r\nlishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to\r\nworks \u00a7514 removed from the public domain. They main-\r\ntain that the Constitution\u2019s Copyright and Patent Clause,\r\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, and First Amendment both decree the\r\ninvalidity of \u00a7514. Under those prescriptions of our high-\r\nest law, petitioners assert, a work that has entered the\r\npublic domain, for whatever reason, must forever remain\r\nthere.\r\n   In accord with the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, we\r\nconclude that \u00a7514 does not transgress constitutional\r\nlimitations on Congress\u2019 authority. Neither the Copyright\r\nand Patent Clause nor the First Amendment, we hold,\r\nmakes the public domain, in any and all cases, a territory\r\nthat works may never exit.\r\n                          I\r\n                          A\r\n  Members of the Berne Union agree to treat authors from\r\nother member countries as well as they treat their own.\r\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

Each country, moreover, must afford at least\r\nthe minimum level of protection specified by Berne. The\r\ncopyright term must span the author\u2019s lifetime, plus at\r\nleast 50 additional years, whether or not the author has\r\ncomplied with a member state\u2019s legal formalities. Art.\r\n5(2), 7(1). And, as relevant here, a work must be protected\r\nabroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the\r\ncountry where protection is claimed or the country of\r\norigin. Art. 18(1)\u2013(2).1\r\n  A different system of transnational copyright protection\r\nlong prevailed in this country. Until 1891, foreign works\r\nwere categorically excluded from Copyright Act protection.\r\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the only eligible\r\nforeign authors were those whose countries granted recip-\r\nrocal rights to U.

The Uruguay round of\r\nmultilateral trade negotiations produced the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) and the Agreement on Trade-Related\r\nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).7 The\r\nUnited States joined both.

In this\r\nregard, U. S. negotiators reported that widespread perception of U. S.\r\nnoncompliance was undermining our leverage in copyright negotia-\r\ntions.

The most notable required an author to register\r\nher work, renew that registration, and affix to published copies notice\r\nof copyrighted status. The formalities drew criticism as a trap for the\r\nunwary. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer \u00a77.01[A], p. 7\u20138; Doyle, Cary, McCannon,\r\n& Ringer, Notice of Copyright, Study No. 7, p. 46 (1957), reprinted in\r\n1 Studies on Copyright 229, 272 (1963).\r\n   In 1976, Congress eliminated the registration renewal requirement\r\nfor future works. Copyright Act of 1976, \u00a7302, 408, 90 Stat. 2572, 2580.\r\nIn 1988, it repealed the mandatory notice prerequisite. BCIA \u00a77, 102\r\nStat. 2857. And in 1992, Congress made renewal automatic for works\r\nstill in their first term of protection. Copyright Amendments Act of\r\n1992, 106 Stat. 264\u2013266. The Copyright Act retains, however, incen-\r\ntives for authors to register their works and provide notice of the works\u2019\r\ncopyrighted status. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7405(b) (precluding actual and\r\nstatutory damages against \u201cinnocent infringers\u201d of a work that lacked\r\nnotice of copyrighted status); \u00a7411(a) (requiring registration of U. S.\r\n\u201cwork[s],\u201d but not foreign works, before an owner may sue for infringe-\r\nment). The revisions successively made accord with Berne Convention\r\nArticle 5(2), which proscribes application of copyright formalities to\r\nforeign authors. Berne, however, affords domestic authors no escape\r\nfrom domestic formalities. See Art. 5(3) (protection within country of\r\norigin is a matter of domestic law).\r\n10                        GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexpiration of a full copyright term\u2014either in the United\r\nStates or the country of origin\u2014receive no further protec-\r\ntion under \u00a7514.

Prospectively, restoration places foreign\r\nworks on an equal footing with their U. S. counterparts;\r\nassuming a foreign and domestic author died the same\r\nday, their works will enter the public domain simultane-\r\nously. See \u00a7302(a) (copyrights generally expire 70 years\r\nafter the author\u2019s death). Restored works, however, re-\r\nceive no compensatory time for the period of exclusivity\r\nthey would have enjoyed before \u00a7514\u2019s enactment, had\r\nthey been protected at the outset in the United States.\r\nTheir total term, therefore, falls short of that available to\r\nsimilarly situated U. S. works.\r\n   The URAA\u2019s disturbance of the public domain hardly\r\nescaped Congress\u2019 attention. Section 514 imposed no\r\nliability for any use of foreign works occurring before\r\nrestoration. In addition, anyone remained free to copy and\r\nuse restored works for one year following \u00a7514\u2019s enact-\r\nment. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7104A(h)(2)(A).

Each work in\r\nthe public domain because of lack of national eligibility or subject-\r\nmatter protection, and many that failed to comply with formalities,\r\nnever enjoyed U.

See\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(4)(A). After restoration, the reliance party is limited to her\r\nprevious uses. A performer of a restored work, for example, cannot,\r\npost-restoration, venture to sell copies of the script.

Deferring to Congress\u2019\r\npredictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs,\r\nthe appellate court held that \u00a7514 survived First Amend-\r\nment scrutiny. Specifically, the court determined that the\r\nlaw was narrowly tailored to fit the important government\r\naim of protecting U. S. copyright holders\u2019 interests abroad.\r\n609 F. 3d 1076 (2010).\r\n   We granted certiorari to consider petitioners\u2019 challenge\r\nto \u00a7514 under both the Copyright Clause and the First\r\nAmendment, 562 U. S. ___ (2011), and now affirm.\r\n                               II\r\n   We first address petitioners\u2019 argument that Congress\r\nlacked authority, under the Copyright Clause, to enact\r\n\u00a7514. The Constitution states that \u201cCongress shall have\r\nPower . . . [t]o promote the Progress of Science . . . by\r\nsecuring for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive\r\nRight to their . . . Writings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. Petitioners\r\nfind in this grant of authority an impenetrable barrier to\r\nthe extension of copyright protection to authors whose\r\nwritings, for whatever reason, are in the public domain.\r\nWe see no such barrier in the text of the Copyright Clause,\r\nhistorical practice, or our precedents.\r\n                             A\r\n  The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude appli-\r\ncation of copyright protection to works in the public do-\r\nmain.

HOLDER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n259, 266 (2007). Petitioners\u2019 contrary argument relies\r\nprimarily on the Constitution\u2019s confinement of a copy-\r\nright\u2019s lifespan to a \u201climited Tim[e].\u201d \u201cRemoving works\r\nfrom the public domain,\u201d they contend, \u201cviolates the \u2018lim-\r\nited [t]imes\u2019 restriction by turning a fixed and predictable\r\nperiod into one that can be reset or resurrected at any\r\ntime, even after it expires.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 22.\r\n   Our decision in Eldred is largely dispositive of petition-\r\ners\u2019 limited-time argument. There we addressed the\r\nquestion whether Congress violated the Copyright Clause\r\nwhen it extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copy-\r\nrights. 537 U. S., at 192\u2013193 (upholding Copyright Term\r\nExtension Act (CTEA)). Ruling that Congress acted with-\r\nin constitutional bounds, we declined to infer from the text\r\nof the Copyright Clause \u201cthe command that a time pre-\r\nscription, once set, becomes forever \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018inalterable.\u2019 \u201d\r\nId., at 199. \u201cThe word \u2018limited,\u2019 \u201d we observed, \u201cdoes not\r\nconvey a meaning so constricted.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the term\r\nis best understood to mean \u201cconfine[d] within certain\r\nbounds,\u201d \u201crestrain[ed],\u201d or \u201ccircumscribed.\u201d Ibid. (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The construction petitioners\r\ntender closely resembles the definition rejected in Eldred\r\nand is similarly infirm.\r\n   The terms afforded works restored by \u00a7514 are no less\r\n\u201climited\u201d than those the CTEA lengthened. In light of\r\nEldred, petitioners do not here contend that the term\r\nCongress has granted U. S. authors\u2014their lifetimes, plus\r\n70 years\u2014is unlimited. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7302(a). Nor do\r\npetitioners explain why terms of the same duration, as\r\napplied to foreign works, are not equally \u201ccircumscribed\u201d\r\nand \u201cconfined.\u201d See Eldred, 537 U. S., at 199. Indeed, as\r\nearlier noted, see supra, at 2, 10, the copyrights of restored\r\nforeign works typically last for fewer years than those of\r\ntheir domestic counterparts.\r\n   The difference, petitioners say, is that the limited time\r\nhad already passed for works in the public domain. What\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)               15\r\n\r\n                       Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nwas that limited term for foreign works once excluded\r\nfrom U. S. copyright protection? Exactly \u201czero,\u201d petition-\r\ners respond. Brief for Petitioners 22 (works in question\r\n\u201creceived a specific term of protection . . . sometimes ex-\r\npressly set to zero\u201d; \u201cat the end of that period,\u201d they \u201cen-\r\ntered the public domain\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (by \u201crefusing\r\nto provide any protection for a work,\u201d Congress \u201cset[s] the\r\nterm at zero,\u201d and thereby \u201ctell[s] us when the end has\r\ncome\u201d). We find scant sense in this argument, for surely a\r\n\u201climited time\u201d of exclusivity must begin before it may\r\nend.16\r\n   Carried to its logical conclusion, petitioners persist, the\r\nGovernment\u2019s position would allow Congress to institute a\r\nsecond \u201climited\u201d term after the first expires, a third after\r\nthat, and so on. Thus, as long as Congress legislated in\r\ninstallments, perpetual copyright terms would be achieva-\r\nble. As in Eldred, the hypothetical legislative misbehavior\r\npetitioners posit is far afield from the case before us. See\r\n537 U. S., at 198\u2013200, 209\u2013210. In aligning the United\r\nStates with other nations bound by the Berne Convention,\r\nand thereby according equitable treatment to once dis-\r\nfavored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged\r\nwith a design to move stealthily toward a regime of per-\r\npetual copyrights.\r\n                             B\r\n  Historical practice corroborates our reading of the Copy-\r\nright Clause to permit full U. S. compliance with Berne.\r\nUndoubtedly, federal copyright legislation generally has\r\nnot affected works in the public domain. Section 514\u2019s\r\ndisturbance of that domain, petitioners argue, distin-\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  16 Cf.3 Nimmer \u00a79A.02[A][2], at 9A\u201311, n. 28 (\u201c[I]t stretches the\r\nlanguage of the Berne Convention past the breaking point to posit\r\nthat following \u2018expiry of the zero term\u2019 the . . . work need not be\r\nresurrected.\u201d).\r\n16                       GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nguishes their suit from Eldred\u2019s. In adopting the CTEA,\r\npetitioners note, Congress acted in accord with \u201can unbro-\r\nken congressional practice\u201d of granting pre-expiration\r\nterm extensions, 537 U. S., at 200. No comparable prac-\r\ntice, they maintain, supports \u00a7514.\r\n   On occasion, however, Congress has seen fit to protect\r\nworks once freely available. Notably, the Copyright Act of\r\n1790 granted protection to many works previously in the\r\npublic domain. Act of May 31, 1790 (1790 Act), \u00a71, 1 Stat.\r\n124 (covering \u201cany map, chart, book, or books already\r\nprinted within these United States\u201d). Before the Act\r\nlaunched a uniform national system, three States provided\r\nno statutory copyright protection at all.17 Of those that\r\ndid afford some protection, seven failed to protect maps;18\r\neight did not cover previously published books;19 and all\r\nten denied protection to works that failed to comply with\r\nformalities.20 The First Congress, it thus appears, did not\r\nview the public domain as inviolate. As we have recog-\r\nnized, the \u201cconstruction placed upon the Constitution by\r\n[the drafters of] the first [copyright] act of 1790 and the\r\nact of 1802 . . . men who were contemporary with [the\r\nConstitution\u2019s] formation, many of whom were members of\r\nthe convention which framed it, is of itself entitled to very\r\ngreat weight.\u201d Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v.

S. 53, 57 (1884).21\r\n   Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not un-\r\nderstood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for\r\nexisting works. Several private bills restored the copy-\r\nrights of works that previously had been in the public\r\ndomain. See Act of Feb. 19, 1849 (Corson Act), ch. 57, 9\r\nStat. 763; Act of June 23, 1874 (Helmuth Act), ch. 534, 18\r\nStat. 618; Act of Feb. 17, 1898 (Jones Act), ch. 29, 30 Stat.\r\n1396. These bills were unchallenged in court.\r\n   Analogous patent statutes, however, were upheld in\r\nlitigation.22 In 1808, Congress passed a private bill restor-\r\ning patent protection to Oliver Evans\u2019 flour mill. When\r\nEvans sued for infringement, first Chief Justice Marshall\r\nin the Circuit Court, Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872 (No.\r\n4,564) (Va. 1813), and then Justice Bushrod Washington\r\nfor this Court, Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815),\r\nupheld the restored patent\u2019s validity. After the patent\u2019s\r\nexpiration, the Court said, \u201ca general right to use [Evans\u2019]\r\ndiscovery was not so vested in the public\u201d as to allow the\r\ndefendant to continue using the machinery, which he had\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   21 The parties debate the extent to which the First Congress removed\r\n\r\nworks from the public domain. We have held, however, that at least\r\nsome works protected by the 1790 Act previously lacked protection. In\r\nWheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591 (1834), the Court ruled that before enact-\r\nment of the 1790 Act, common-law copyright protection expired upon\r\nfirst publication. Id., at 657, 663. Thus published works covered by the\r\n1790 Act previously would have been in the public domain unless\r\nprotected by state statute. Had the founding generation perceived the\r\nconstitutional boundary petitioners advance today, the First Congress\r\ncould have designed a prospective scheme that left the public domain\r\nundisturbed.

(\u201cI\r\nnever have entertained any doubt of the constitutional\r\nauthority of congress\u201d to \u201cgive a patent for an invention,\r\nwhich . . . was in public use and enjoyed by the community\r\nat the time of the passage of the act.\u201d).\r\n   This Court again upheld Congress\u2019 restoration of an\r\ninvention to protected status in McClurg v. Kingsland, 1\r\nHow. 202 (1843). There we enforced an 1839 amendment\r\nthat recognized a patent on an invention despite its prior\r\nuse by the inventor\u2019s employer. Absent such dispensation,\r\nthe employer\u2019s use would have rendered the invention\r\nunpatentable, and therefore open to exploitation without\r\nthe inventor\u2019s leave. Id., at 206\u2013209.\r\n   Congress has also passed generally applicable legisla-\r\ntion granting patents and copyrights to inventions and\r\nworks that had lost protection. An 1832 statute author-\r\nized a new patent for any inventor whose failure, \u201cby\r\ninadvertence, accident, or mistake,\u201d to comply with statu-\r\ntory formalities rendered the original patent \u201cinvalid or\r\ninoperative.\u201d Act of July 3, \u00a73, 4 Stat. 559. An 1893\r\nmeasure similarly allowed authors who had not timely\r\ndeposited their work to receive \u201call the rights and privileg-\r\nes\u201d the Copyright Act affords, if they made the required\r\ndeposit by March 1, 1893. Act of Mar. 3, ch. 215, 27 Stat.\r\n743.23 And in 1919 and 1941, Congress authorized the\r\nPresident to issue proclamations granting protection to\r\nforeign works that had fallen into the public domain dur-\r\ning World Wars I and II. See Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  23 Section 514 is in line with these measures; like them, it accords\r\nprotection to works that had lapsed into the public domain because of\r\nfailure to comply with U.

But as we explained in\r\nEldred, this passage did not speak to the constitutional\r\nlimits on Congress\u2019 copyright and patent authority. Ra-\r\nther, it \u201caddressed an invention\u2019s very eligibility for patent\r\nprotection.\u201d 537 U.

To do so, we\r\nfirst recapitulate the relevant part of our pathmarking\r\ndecision in Eldred. The petitioners in Eldred, like those\r\nhere, argued that Congress had violated not only the\r\n\u201climited Times\u201d prescription of the Copyright Clause. In\r\naddition, and independently, the Eldred petitioners\r\ncharged, Congress had offended the First Amendment\u2019s\r\nfreedom of expression guarantee. The CTEA\u2019s 20-year\r\nenlargement of a copyright\u2019s duration, we held in Eldred,\r\noffended neither provision.\r\n   Concerning the First Amendment, we recognized that\r\nsome restriction on expression is the inherent and in-\r\ntended effect of every grant of copyright. Noting that the\r\n\u201cCopyright Clause and the First Amendment were adopted\r\nclose in time,\u201d 537 U. S., at 219, we observed that the\r\nFramers regarded copyright protection not simply as a\r\nlimit on the manner in which expressive works may be\r\nused. They also saw copyright as an \u201cengine of free ex-\r\npression[:] By establishing a marketable right to the use of\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  28 The dissent suggests that the \u201cutilitarian view of copyrigh[t]\u201d em-\r\n\r\nbraced by Jefferson, Madison, and our case law sets us apart from\r\ncontinental Europe and inhibits us from harmonizing our copyright\r\nlaws with those of countries in the civil-law tradition.

First Amendment inter-\r\nests of a higher order are at stake here, petitioners say,\r\nbecause they\u2014unlike their counterparts in Eldred\u2014\r\nenjoyed \u201cvested rights\u201d in works that had already entered\r\nthe public domain. The limited rights they retain under\r\ncopyright law\u2019s \u201cbuilt-in safeguards\u201d are, in their view, no\r\nsubstitute for the unlimited use they enjoyed before \u00a7514\u2019s\r\nenactment. Nor, petitioners urge, does \u00a7514\u2019s \u201cunprece-\r\ndented\u201d foray into the public domain possess the historical\r\npedigree that supported the term extension at issue in\r\nEldred. Brief for Petitioners 42\u201343.\r\n  However spun, these contentions depend on an argu-\r\nment we considered and rejected above, namely, that the\r\nConstitution renders the public domain largely untouch-\r\nable by Congress. Petitioners here attempt to achieve\r\nunder the banner of the First Amendment what they could\r\nnot win under the Copyright Clause: On their view of the\r\nCopyright Clause, the public domain is inviolable; as they\r\nread the First Amendment, the public domain is policed\r\nthrough heightened judicial scrutiny of Congress\u2019 means\r\nand ends. As we have already shown, see supra, at 13\u201319,\r\nthe text of the Copyright Clause and the historical record\r\nscarcely establish that \u201conce a work enters the public\r\ndomain,\u201d Congress cannot permit anyone\u2014\u201cnot even the\r\ncreator\u2014[to] copyright it,\u201d 501 F. 3d, at 1184.

See also id., at 1194 (\u201c[O]nce the works\r\nat issue became free for anyone to copy, [petitioners] had\r\nvested First Amendment interests in the expressions,\r\n[thus] \u00a7514\u2019s interference with [petitioners\u2019] rights is\r\nsubject to First Amendment scrutiny.\u201d).

However attractive this bright-\r\nline rule might be, it is not a rule rooted in the constitutional text or\r\nhistory. Nor can it fairly be gleaned from our case law. The dissent\r\ncites three decisions to document its assertion that \u201cthis Court has\r\nassumed the particular importance of public domain material in rough-\r\nly analogous circumstances.\u201d Post, at 15. The dictum in Graham v.\r\nJohn Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 (1966), noted earlier, did\r\nnot treat the public domain as a constitutional limit\u2014certainly not\r\nunder the rubric of the First Amendment. See supra, at 19. The other\r\ntwo decisions the dissent cites considered whether the federal Patent\r\nAct preempted a state trade-secret law, Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron\r\nCorp., 416 U. S. 470, 479\u2013484 (1974), and whether the freedom of the\r\npress shielded reporters from liability for publishing material drawn\r\nfrom public court documents, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S.\r\n469, 495\u2013497 (1975). Neither decision remotely ascribed constitutional\r\nsignificance to a work\u2019s public domain status.\r\n28                      GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmight sound exactly backwards: Rights typically vest at\r\nthe outset of copyright protection, in an author or\r\nrightholder. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(a) (\u201cCopyright in a\r\nwork protected . . . vests initially in the author . . . .\u201d).\r\nOnce the term of protection ends, the works do not revest\r\nin any rightholder. Instead, the works simply lapse into\r\nthe public domain. See, e.g., Berne, Art. 18(1), 828\r\nU. N. T. S., at 251 (\u201cThis Convention shall apply to all\r\nworks which . . . have not yet fallen into the public do-\r\nmain . . . .\u201d). Anyone has free access to the public domain,\r\nbut no one, after the copyright term has expired, acquires\r\nownership rights in the once-protected works.\r\n   Congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect\r\ncategories of works once outside the law\u2019s compass. For\r\nexample, Congress broke new ground when it extended\r\ncopyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar.\r\n3, \u00a713, 26 Stat. 1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of\r\nAug. 18, 11 Stat. 138; to photographs and photographic\r\nnegatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, \u00a71, 13 Stat. 540; to mo-\r\ntion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, 37 Stat. 488; to fixed\r\nsound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat.\r\n391; and to architectural works in 1990, Architectural\r\nWorks Copyright Protection Act, 104 Stat. 5133. And on\r\nseveral occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected\r\nworks previously in the public domain, hence freely usable\r\nby the public. See supra, at 15\u201319. If Congress could\r\ngrant protection to these works without hazarding height-\r\nened First Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech\r\nprinciple disarms it from protecting works prematurely\r\ncast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the\r\nBerne Convention? 33\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  33 It was the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause\u2014not the First\r\n\r\nAmendment\u2014that Congress apparently perceived to be a potential\r\ncheck on its authority to protect works then freely available to the\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners protest that fair use and\r\nthe idea/expression dichotomy \u201care plainly inadequate to\r\nprotect the speech and expression rights that Section 514\r\ntook from petitioners, or . . . the public\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe\r\nunrestricted right to perform, copy, teach and distribute\r\nthe entire work, for any reason.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 46\u2013\r\n47. \u201cPlaying a few bars of a Shostakovich symphony,\u201d\r\npetitioners observe, \u201cis no substitute for performing the\r\nentire work.\u201d Id., at 47.34\r\n   But Congress has not put petitioners in this bind. The\r\nquestion here, as in Eldred, is whether would-be users\r\nmust pay for their desired use of the author\u2019s expression,\r\nor else limit their exploitation to \u201cfair use\u201d of that work.\r\nProkofiev\u2019s Peter and the Wolf could once be performed\r\nfree of charge; after \u00a7514 the right to perform it must be\r\nobtained in the marketplace. This is the same market-\r\nplace, of course, that exists for the music of Prokofiev\u2019s\r\nU. S. contemporaries: works of Copland and Bernstein, for\r\nexample, that enjoy copyright protection, but nevertheless\r\nappear regularly in the programs of U. S. concertgoers.\r\n   Before we joined Berne, domestic works and some for-\r\neign works were protected under U. S. statutes and bilat-\r\neral international agreements, while other foreign works\r\nwere available at an artificially low (because royalty-free)\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\npublic. See URAA Joint Hearing 3 (statement of Rep. Hughes); id., at\r\n121 (app. to statement of Lehman, Commerce Dept.); id., at 141 (state-\r\nment of Shapiro, USTR); id., at 145 (statement of Christopher Schroe-\r\nder, DOJ). The reliance-party protections supplied by \u00a7514, see supra,\r\nat 10\u201311, were meant to address such concerns. See URAA Joint\r\nHearing 148\u2013149 (prepared statement of Schroeder).\r\n  34 Because Shostakovich was a pre-1973 Russian composer, his works\r\n\r\nwere not protected in the United States. See U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nCircular No. 38A: The International Copyright Relations of the United\r\nStates 9, 11, n. 2 (2010) (copyright relations between the Soviet Union\r\nand the United States date to 1973).\r\n30                        GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncost. By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that\r\nmost works, whether foreign or domestic, would be gov-\r\nerned by the same legal regime. The phenomenon to\r\nwhich Congress responded is not new: Distortions of the\r\nsame order occurred with greater frequency\u2014and to the\r\ndetriment of both foreign and domestic authors\u2014when,\r\nbefore 1891, foreign works were excluded entirely from\r\nU. S. copyright protection. See Kampelman, The United\r\nStates and International Copyright, 41 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 406,\r\n413 (1947) (\u201cAmerican readers were less inclined to read\r\nthe novels of Cooper or Hawthorne for a dollar when they\r\ncould buy a novel of Scott or Dickens for a quarter.\u201d).\r\nSection 514 continued the trend toward a harmonized\r\ncopyright regime by placing foreign works in the position\r\nthey would have occupied if the current regime had been\r\nin effect when those works were created and first pub-\r\nlished. Authors once deprived of protection are spared the\r\ncontinuing effects of that initial deprivation; \u00a7514 gives\r\nthem nothing more than the benefit of their labors during\r\nwhatever time remains before the normal copyright term\r\nexpires.35\r\n   Unlike petitioners, the dissent makes much of the so-\r\ncalled \u201corphan works\u201d problem. See post, at 11\u201314, 23\u201324.\r\nWe readily acknowledge the difficulties would-be users of\r\ncopyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating\r\ncopyright owners. See generally U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nReport on Orphan Works 21\u201340 (2006). But as the dissent\r\nconcedes, see post, at 13, this difficulty is hardly peculiar\r\nto works restored under \u00a7514. It similarly afflicts, for\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  35 Persistently deploring \u201c \u2018restored copyright\u2019 protection [because it]\r\n\r\nremoves material from the public domain,\u201d post, at 14, the dissent does\r\nnot pause to consider when and why the material came to be lodged in\r\nthat domain.

Despite\r\n\u201clongstanding efforts,\u201d see Authors Guild, 770 F. Supp. 2d,\r\nat 678 (quoting statement of Marybeth Peters), Congress\r\nhas not yet passed ameliorative orphan-works legislation\r\nof the sort enacted by other Berne members, see, e.g.,\r\nCanada Copyright Act, R. S. C., 1985, c. C\u201342, \u00a777 (au-\r\nthorizing Copyright Board to license use of orphan works\r\nby persons unable, after making reasonable efforts, to\r\nlocate the copyright owner). Heretofore, no one has sug-\r\ngested that the orphan-works issue should be addressed\r\nthrough our implementation of Berne, rather than\r\nthrough overarching legislation of the sort proposed in\r\nCongress and cited by the dissent. See post, at 23\u201324;\r\nU. S. Copyright Office, Legal Issues in Mass Digitization\r\n25\u201329 (2011) (discussing recent legislative efforts).

HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nfor the enactment of such legislation. But resistance to\r\nBerne\u2019s prescriptions surely is not a necessary or proper\r\nresponse to the pervasive question, what should Congress\r\ndo about orphan works.\r\n                             IV\r\n   Congress determined that U. S. interests were best\r\nserved by our full participation in the dominant system of\r\ninternational copyright protection. Those interests in-\r\nclude ensuring exemplary compliance with our interna-\r\ntional obligations, securing greater protection for U. S.\r\nauthors abroad, and remedying unequal treatment of\r\nforeign authors. The judgment \u00a7514 expresses lies well\r\nwithin the ken of the political branches. It is our obliga-\r\ntion, of course, to determine whether the action Congress\r\ntook, wise or not, encounters any constitutional shoal. For\r\nthe reasons stated, we are satisfied it does not.

At the same time, the stat\u00ad\r\nute inhibits the dissemination of those works, foreign\r\nworks published abroad after 1923, of which there are\r\nmany millions, including films, works of art, innumerable\r\nphotographs, and, of course, books\u2014books that (in the\r\nabsence of the statute) would assume their rightful places\r\nin computer-accessible databases, spreading knowledge\r\nthroughout the world. See infra, at 10\u201313. In my view,\r\nthe Copyright Clause does not authorize Congress to enact\r\nthis statute. And I consequently dissent.\r\n                                I\r\n   The possibility of eliciting new production is, and always\r\nhas been, an essential precondition for American copyright\r\nprotection. The Constitution\u2019s words, \u201cexclusive Right,\u201d\r\n\u201climited Times,\u201d \u201cProgress of Science,\u201d viewed through the\r\nlens of history underscore the legal significance of what\r\nthe Court in Eldred referred to as the \u201ceconomic philoso\u00ad\r\nphy behind the Copyright Clause.\u201d 537 U. S., at 212, n. 18\r\n(brackets omitted). That philosophy understands copy\u00ad\r\nright\u2019s grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as\r\nprivate benefits that are conferred for a public reason\u2014to\r\nelicit new creation.\r\n   Yet, as the Founders recognized, monopoly is a two\u00ad\r\nedged sword. On the one hand, it can encourage produc\u00ad\r\ntion of new works. In the absence of copyright protection,\r\nanyone might freely copy the products of an author\u2019s\r\ncreative labor, appropriating the benefits without incur\u00ad\r\nring the nonrepeatable costs of creation, thereby deterring\r\nauthors from exerting themselves in the first place. On\r\nthe other hand, copyright tends to restrict the dissemina\u00ad\r\ntion (and use) of works once produced either because the\r\nabsence of competition translates directly into higher\r\nconsumer prices or because the need to secure copying\r\npermission sometimes imposes administrative costs that\r\nmake it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work\r\nto find its owner and strike a bargain.

Consequently, the original\r\nBritish copyright statute, the Constitution\u2019s Framers, and\r\nour case law all have recognized copyright\u2019s resulting\r\nand necessary call for balance.\r\n   At the time the Framers wrote the Constitution, they\r\nwere well aware of Britain\u2019s 18th-century copyright stat\u00ad\r\nute, the Statute of Anne, 8 Anne, ch. 19 (1710), and they\r\nwere aware of the legal struggles that produced it. That\r\nstatute sought in part to control, and to limit, preexisting\r\nmonopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result\r\nof the Crown\u2019s having previously granted special privileg\u00ad\r\nes to royal favorites. The Crown, for example, had char\u00ad\r\ntered the Stationers\u2019 Company, permitting it to regulate\r\nand to censor works on the government\u2019s behalf. The\r\nStationers had thereby acquired control over the disposi\u00ad\r\ntion of copies of published works, from which emerged\r\nthe Stationers\u2019 copyright\u2014a right conferred on company\r\nmembers, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpe\u00ad\r\ntuity.

At first, in their attempts to minimize their losses,\r\nthe booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual com\u00ad\r\nmon-law copyright in their works deriving from their\r\nnatural rights as creators. But the House of Lords ulti\u00ad\r\nmately held in Donaldson v. Beckett, 1 Eng. Rep. 837\r\n(1774), that the Statute of Anne had transformed any such\r\nperpetual common-law copyright into a copyright of a\r\nlimited term designed to serve the public interest.

Thomas Jefferson, for\r\nexample, initially expressed great uncertainty as to\r\nwhether the Constitution should authorize the grant of\r\ncopyrights and patents at all, writing that \u201cthe benefit\r\neven of limited monopolies is too doubtful\u201d to warrant\r\nanything other than their \u201csuppression.\u201d Letter from\r\nThomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\r\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J.

Patterson 158\u2013179, 183\u2013192. Premised on the\r\nidea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to\r\nthe fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legend\u00ad\r\nary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed \u201c \u2018to every cow\r\nher calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.\u2019 \u201d A.\r\nBirrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copy\u00ad\r\nright in Books 42 (1899). That view, though perhaps\r\nreflected in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 30, runs contrary\r\nto the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of\r\nour own Constitution\u2019s Copyright Clause.

In Mazer,\r\nfor example, the Court refers to copyright as embodying\r\nthe view that \u201cencouragement of individual effort by per-\r\nsonal gain is the best way to advance public welfare\r\nthrough the talents of authors and inventors.\u201d 347 U. S.,\r\nat 219 (emphasis added). In Twentieth Century Music\r\nCorp. v. Aiken, 422 U.

And in Sony Corp. of Amer-\r\nica v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.

No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).\r\nAnd they went on to say:\r\n    \u201cCongress must consider . . . two questions: First, how\r\n    much will the legislation stimulate the producer and\r\n    so benefit the public; and, second, how much will the\r\n    monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The\r\n    granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper\r\n    terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the pub\u00ad\r\n    lic that outweighs the evils of the temporary monop\u00ad\r\n    oly.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   The upshot is that text, history, and precedent demon\u00ad\r\nstrate that the Copyright Clause places great value on the\r\npower of copyright to elicit new production. Congress in\r\nparticular cases may determine that copyright\u2019s ability to\r\ndo so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administra\u00ad\r\ntive costs, and restrictions on dissemination. And when it\r\ndoes so, we must respect its judgment. See Eldred, 537\r\n8                    GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nU. S., at 222. But does the Clause empower Congress to\r\nenact a statute that withdraws works from the public\r\ndomain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing\r\nso seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those\r\nwho need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural pur-\r\nposes\u2014all without providing any additional incentive for\r\nthe production of new material? That is the question\r\nbefore us. And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no.\r\nCongress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any\r\nplausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible\r\nlimits.\r\n                              II\r\n   The Act before us says that it \u201crestores\u201d American copy\u00ad\r\nright to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not\r\npreviously enjoy American copyright protection. These\r\nworks had fallen into America\u2019s public domain, but as of\r\nthe \u201crestoration\u201d date, they had not yet fallen into the pub\u00ad\r\nlic domain of the foreign country where they originated.\r\n   The statute covers works originating almost anywhere\r\noutside the United States. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7104A(h)(3)\r\n(setting out eligibility criteria); U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nCircular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the\r\nUnited States (2010). The relevant set of works consists\r\nprimarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain,\r\nor at some point lost, American copyright protection be\u00ad\r\ncause (1) the author failed to comply with applicable\r\nAmerican copyright formalities (such as notice or renew\u00ad\r\nal), or (2) the nation in which they were first published\r\nthen lacked copyright relations with the United States, or\r\n(3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15,\r\n1972. \u00a7104A(h)(6)(C). A work must also satisfy other\r\ntechnical requirements: It must have had a rightholder\r\nwho was a national or resident of an eligible country on\r\nthe day it was created; and it cannot have been published\r\nin the United States within 30 days of its first publication.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(6)(D). The Act grants these works a copyright\r\nthat expires at the time it would have expired had the\r\nauthor obtained a full American copyright term starting\r\nfrom the date on which the work was first published (in\r\nthe foreign country). \u00a7104A(a)(1)(B).\r\n   The Act mainly applies to works first published abroad\r\nbetween 1923 and 1989. It does not apply significantly to\r\nearlier works because any work published before 1921\r\nwould have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had\r\nit received a full American copyright term, while works\r\npublished between 1921 and 1923 obtained a \u201crestored\u201d\r\ncopyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copy\u00ad\r\nright Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two\r\nyears at most. See Tit. I, \u00a7101, 90 Stat. 2574 (extending\r\nthe copyright term of works still under copyright in 1977\r\nto 75 years); 17 U. S. C. \u00a7304(b) (extending the copyright\r\nterm of works still under copyright in 1998 to 95 years). It\r\nhas less impact on more recent works because in 1989\r\nthe United States became a Berne member, abolished the\r\ncopyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided\r\nprospective copyright protection throughout the Berne\r\nUnion. See R. Schechter & J. Thomas, Intellectual Prop\u00ad\r\nerty: The Law of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks 75\u2013\r\n77 (2003); \u00a77, 102 Stat. 2857\u20132858 (codified as amended at\r\n17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7401\u2013406).\r\n   Despite these temporal limitations, the Act covers vast\r\nnumbers of works. The first category includes works\r\npublished in countries that had copyright relations with\r\nthe United States during this time period, such as most of\r\nWestern Europe and Latin America, Australia, and Japan,\r\nsee Circular No. 38A, supra, at 2\u201310, whose authors did\r\nnot satisfy American copyright formalities, perhaps be\u00ad\r\ncause the author, who may not have sought an American\r\ncopyright, published the book abroad without proper\r\nAmerican notice, or perhaps because the author obtained a\r\nvalid American copyright but failed to renew it.\r\n10                   GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   The second category (works that entered the public\r\ndomain due to a lack of copyright relations) includes,\r\namong others, all works published in Russia and other\r\ncountries of the former Soviet Union before May 1973\r\n(when the U. S. S. R. joined the Universal Copyright Con\u00ad\r\nvention (UCC)), all works published in the People\u2019s Repub\u00ad\r\nlic of China before March 1992 (when bilateral copyright\r\nrelations between the People\u2019s Republic and the United\r\nStates were first established), all South Korean works\r\npublished before October 1987 (when South Korea joined\r\nthe UCC), and all Egyptian and Turkish works published\r\nbefore March 1989 (when the United States joined Berne).\r\nSee id., at 2\u201310, and 11, nn. 2, 5, 6.\r\n   The third category covers all sound recordings from\r\neligible foreign countries published after February 15,\r\n1972. The practical significance of federal copyright resto\u00ad\r\nration to this category of works is less clear, since these\r\nworks received, and continued to receive, copyright protec\u00ad\r\ntion under state law. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7301(c).\r\n   Apparently there are no precise figures about the num\u00ad\r\nber of works the Act affects, but in 1996 the then-Register\r\nof Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, thought that they \u201cproba\u00ad\r\nbly number in the millions.\u201d The Year in Review: Accom\u00ad\r\nplishments and Objectives of the U.

See \u00a7104A(h)(2)(A)\r\n(setting \u201crestoration\u201d dates). It then restricts the dissemi\u00ad\r\nnation of those works in two ways.\r\n  First, \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders can now charge fees\r\nfor works that consumers previously used for free. The\r\nprice of a score of Shostakovich\u2019s Preludes and Fugues Op.\r\n87, for example, has risen by a multiple of seven. Brief for\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

And, as the\r\nCourt recognizes, an orchestra that once could perform\r\n\u201cPeter and the Wolf . . . free of charge\u201d will now have to\r\nbuy the \u201cright to perform it . . . in the marketplace.\u201d Ante,\r\nat 29. But for the case of certain \u201cderivative\u201d works,\r\n\u00a7104A(d)(3), the \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, like other\r\ncopyright holders, can charge what the market will bear.\r\nIf a school orchestra or other nonprofit organization can\u00ad\r\nnot afford the new charges, so be it. They will have to do\r\nwithout\u2014aggravating the already serious problem of\r\ncultural education in the United States. See Brief for\r\nConductors Guild et al. as Amici Curiae 4\u20135, 7\u20138 (describ\u00ad\r\ning the inability of many orchestras to pay for the rental of\r\nsheet music covered by \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d).\r\n   Second, and at least as important, the statute creates\r\nadministrative costs, such as the costs of determining\r\nwhether a work is the subject of a \u201crestored copyright,\u201d\r\nsearching for a \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, and negotiat\u00ad\r\ning a fee. Congress has tried to ease the administrative\r\nburden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating\r\nprices for those whom the statute calls \u201creliance part[ies],\u201d\r\nnamely those who previously had used such works when\r\nthey were freely available in the public domain.\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(4). But Congress has done nothing to ease the\r\nadministrative burden of securing permission from copy\u00ad\r\nright owners that is placed upon those who want to use a\r\nwork that they did not previously use, and this is a partic\u00ad\r\nular problem when it comes to \u201corphan works\u201d\u2014older and\r\nmore obscure works with minimal commercial value that\r\nhave copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to\r\ntrack down. Unusually high administrative costs threaten\r\nto limit severely the distribution and use of those works\u2014\r\nworks which, despite their characteristic lack of economic\r\nvalue, can prove culturally invaluable.\r\n   There are millions of such works. For example, accord\u00ad\r\ning to European Union figures, there are 13 million or\u00ad\r\n12                   GOLAN v.

Consider the questions that\r\nany such individual, group, or institution usually must\r\nanswer: Is the work eligible for restoration under the\r\nstatute? If so, who now holds the copyright\u2014the author?\r\nan heir? a publisher? an association? a long-lost cousin?\r\nWhom must we contact? What is the address? Suppose\r\nno one answers? How do we conduct a negotiation?\r\n   To find answers to these, and similar questions, costs\r\nmoney. The cost to the University of Michigan and the\r\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services, for example, to\r\ndetermine the copyright status of books contained in the\r\nHathiTrust Digital Library that were published in the\r\nUnited States from 1923 to 1963 will exceed $1 million.\r\nBrief for American Library Assn. et al. as Amici Curiae 15.\r\n   It is consequently not surprising to learn that the Los\r\nAngeles Public Library has been unable to make its collec\u00ad\r\ntion of Mexican folk music publicly available because of\r\nproblems locating copyright owners, that a Jewish cultural\r\norganization has abandoned similar efforts to make avail\u00ad\r\nable Jewish cultural music and other materials, or that\r\nfilm preservers, museums, universities, scholars, database\r\ncompilers, and others report that the administrative costs\r\nassociated with trying to locate foreign copyright owners\r\nhave forced them to curtail their cultural, scholarly, or\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

They will tempt some potential\r\nusers to \u201csteal\u201d or \u201cpirate\u201d works rather than do without.\r\nAnd piracy often begets piracy, breeding the destructive\r\nhabit of taking copyrighted works without paying for\r\nthem, even where payment is possible. Such habits\r\nignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation\r\nof new works, while reflecting a false belief that new\r\ncreation appears by magic without thought or hope of\r\ncompensation.\r\n                          B\r\n  I recognize that ordinary copyright protection also\r\ncomes accompanied with dissemination-restricting royalty\r\ncharges and administrative costs. But here the re\u00ad\r\n14                  GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstrictions work special harm. For one thing, the foreign\r\nlocation of restored works means higher than ordinary\r\nadministrative costs. For another, the statute\u2019s technical\r\nrequirements make it very difficult to establish whether a\r\nwork has had its copyright restored by the statute. Gard,\r\nIn the Trenches with \u00a7104A: An Evaluation of the Parties\u2019\r\nArguments in Golan v. Holder as It Heads to the Supreme\r\nCourt, 64 Vand. L. Rev.

In doing so, it reverses\r\nthe payment expectations of those who used, or intended\r\nto use, works that they thought belonged to them. Were\r\nCongress to act similarly with respect to well-established\r\nproperty rights, the problem would be obvious. This stat\u00ad\r\nute analogously restricts, and thereby diminishes, Ameri\u00ad\r\ncans\u2019 preexisting freedom to use formerly public domain\r\nmaterial in their expressive activities.\r\n   Thus, while the majority correctly observes that the\r\ndissemination-restricting harms of copyright normally\r\npresent problems appropriate for legislation to resolve,\r\nante, at 31\u201332, the question is whether the Copyright\r\nClause permits Congress seriously to exacerbate such a\r\nproblem by taking works out of the public domain without\r\na countervailing benefit. This question is appropriate for\r\njudicial resolution. Indeed, unlike Eldred where the Court\r\nhad to decide a complicated line-drawing question\u2014when\r\nis a copyright term too long?\u2014here an easily administra\u00ad\r\nble standard is available\u2014a standard that would require\r\nworks that have already fallen into the public domain to\r\nstay there.\r\n   The several, just mentioned features of the present\r\nstatute are important, for they distinguish it from other\r\ncopyright laws. By removing material from the public\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

In practical terms, members of the\r\npublic might well have decided what to say, as well as\r\nwhen and how to say it, in part by reviewing with a view\r\nto repeating, expression that they reasonably believed\r\nwas, or would be, freely available. Given these speech\r\nimplications, it is not surprising that Congress has long\r\nsought to protect public domain material when revising\r\nthe copyright laws. See infra, at 19 (listing instances).\r\nAnd this Court has assumed the particular importance of\r\npublic domain material in roughly analogous circumstanc\u00ad\r\nes. See Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 (\u201cCongress may not au\u00ad\r\nthorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove\r\nexistent knowledge from the public domain\u201d); Kewanee Oil\r\nCo. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 484 (1974) (trade secret\r\nprotection is not incompatible with \u201cpolicy that matter\r\nonce in the public domain must remain in the public do\u00ad\r\nmain\u201d); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.

Twentieth Century Fox\r\nFilm Corp., 539 U. S. 23, 33 (2003) (\u201cThe right to copy . . .\r\nonce a copyright has expired . . . passes to the public\u201d\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n   Moreover, whereas forward-looking copyright laws tend\r\nto benefit those whose identities are not yet known (the\r\nwriter who has not yet written a book, the musician who\r\nhas not yet composed a song), when a copyright law is\r\nprimarily backward looking the risk is greater that Con\u00ad\r\ngress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense\r\nof badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to\r\nargue and present their case to Congress. In Eldred, I\r\nthought this problem was severe. See generally 537 U. S.,\r\nat 243\u2013266 (dissenting opinion). And in light of the fact\r\nthat Congress, with one minor exception, heard testimony\r\nonly from the representatives of existing copyright hold\u00ad\r\n16                   GOLAN v.

Ante, at 27. But such con\u00ad\r\nsiderations do not exhaust potential First Amendment\r\nproblems. Cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 8) (finding First Amendment prob\u00ad\r\nlem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from\r\nusing publicly available prescriber-identifying information\r\nin their marketing efforts in part because it \u201cdisfavor[ed]\r\nspecific speakers\u201d); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.\r\nFCC, 512 U.

And that is enough. For present\r\npurposes, I need not decide whether the harms to that\r\ninterest show a violation of the First Amendment. I need\r\nonly point to the importance of interpreting the Constitu\u00ad\r\ntion as a single document\u2014a document that we should not\r\nread as setting the Copyright Clause and the First\r\nAmendment at cross-purposes. Nor need I advocate the\r\napplication here of strict or specially heightened review. I\r\nneed only find that the First Amendment interest is im\u00ad\r\nportant enough to require courts to scrutinize with some\r\ncare the reasons claimed to justify the Act in order to\r\ndetermine whether they constitute reasonable copyright\u00ad\r\nrelated justifications for the serious harms, including\r\nspeech-related harms, which the Act seems likely to\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The statute\r\ngrants its \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d only to works already\r\nproduced. It provides no monetary incentive to produce\r\nanything new. Unlike other American copyright statutes\r\nfrom the time of the Founders onwards, including the\r\nstatute at issue in Eldred, it lacks any significant copy\u00ad\r\nright-related quid pro quo.\r\n   The majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by refer\u00ad\r\nring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests\r\nthat Congress may provide new or increased protection\r\nboth to newly created and to previously created, works.\r\nAnte, at 16, 18; Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 124 (con\u00ad\r\nferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as\r\nold); Act of July 3, 1832, \u00a73, 4 Stat. 559 (authorizing new\r\npatents for past and future inventors who inadvertently\r\nfailed to comply with applicable statutory formalities);\r\nMcClurg v.

I do not dispute that copyright power. Insofar as such\r\na statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly\r\ncreated material, it embodies copyright\u2019s traditional justi\u00ad\r\nfication\u2014eliciting new production. And I do not doubt\r\nthat Congress may then also include existing works within\r\nthe scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and\r\nadministrative reasons. See Eldred, 537 U.

The statute before us, however, does not directly\r\nelicit any new production. Compare id., at 204\u2013208; (ma\u00ad\r\njority opinion) (noting that statute\u2019s extended term would\r\napply to newly created material, and finding that the\r\ndetermination of the likelihood of its eliciting new produc\u00ad\r\ntion in practice was a matter for Congress to determine),\r\nwith id., at 243\u2013267 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (expressing\r\nthe view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the\r\nstatute would elicit new material).

It\r\nconsists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation pre\u00ad\r\nventing the withdrawal of works from the public domain.\r\nSee, e.g., Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988,\r\n\u00a712, 102 Stat. 2860 (the Act \u201cdoes not provide copyright\r\nprotection for any work that is in the public domain in the\r\nUnited States\u201d); Copyright Act of 1976, Tit.

First, it\r\nargues that the Clause does not require the \u201ccreation of at\r\nleast one new work,\u201d ante, at 20, but may instead \u201cpromote\r\nthe Progress of Science\u201d in other ways. And it specifically\r\nmentions the \u201cdissemination of existing and future works\u201d\r\nas determinative here. Ante, at 20\u201323, and n. 25. The\r\nindustry experts to whom the majority refers argue that\r\n20                   GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncopyright protection of already existing works can help,\r\nsay, music publishers or film distributers raise prices,\r\nproduce extra profits and consequently lead them to pub\u00ad\r\nlish or distribute works they might otherwise have ig\u00ad\r\nnored. But ordinarily a copyright\u2014since it is a monopoly\r\non copying\u2014restricts dissemination of a work once pro\u00ad\r\nduced compared to a competitive market. And simply\r\nmaking the industry richer does not mean that the indus\u00ad\r\ntry, when it makes an ordinary forward-looking economic\r\ncalculus, will distribute works not previously distributed.\r\nThe industry experts might mean that temporary extra\r\nprofits will lead them to invest in the development of a\r\nmarket, say, by advertising. But this kind of argument,\r\nwhich can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods,\r\nranging from kiwi fruit to Swedish furniture, has little\r\nif anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial\r\ncreation, which is the special concern of copyright protec\u00ad\r\ntion. See supra, at 2\u20133.\r\n   Moreover, the argument proves too much. It is the kind\r\nof argument that the Stationers\u2019 Company might well\r\nhave made and which the British Parliament rejected. Cf.\r\nPatterson 154\u2013155 (describing failed booksellers\u2019 bill\r\nseeking protection from foreign competition through an\r\nextension of the copyright term). It is the kind of argu\u00ad\r\nment that could justify a legislature\u2019s withdrawing from\r\nthe public domain the works, say, of Hawthorne or of Swift\r\nor for that matter the King James Bible in order to en\u00ad\r\ncourage further publication of those works; and, it could\r\neven more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser\r\nknown early works, perhaps those of the Venerable Bede.\r\nThe Court has not, to my knowledge, previously accepted\r\nsuch a rationale\u2014a rationale well removed from the spe\u00ad\r\ncial economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeat\u00ad\r\nable costs of the initial creation of a \u201cWriting.\u201d Supra, at\r\n2. And I fear that doing so would read the Copyright\r\nClause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

(With one minor exception only those\r\nrepresentatives appeared, see generally Joint Hearing; the\r\nCopyright Office did not testify, id., at 239.) Rather, they\r\nfocused on the Berne Convention itself. By that time,\r\nCongress had already protected all new works of Berne\r\nmembers. But it had not provided additional protection to\r\npreexisting foreign works that were then in the American\r\npublic domain. Industry witnesses testified that with\u00ad\r\ndrawing such works from the American public domain\r\nwould permit foreign copyright owners to charge American\r\nconsumers more for their products; and that, as a result,\r\nthe United States would be able to persuade foreign coun\u00ad\r\ntries to allow American holders of preexisting copyrights\r\nto charge foreign customers more money for their prod\u00ad\r\nucts. See id., at 241 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive\r\nDirector and General Counsel, International Intellectual\r\nProperty Alliance) (\u201c[F]ailure to [comply with Article 18]\r\nwill . . . undermine the ability of the United States to press\r\nother countries to implement the same sort of protection in\r\ntheir implementing legislation currently pending in many\r\nlegislatures around the globe\u201d); id., at 253 (statement of\r\nMatt Gerson, Vice President for Congressional Affairs,\r\nMotion Picture Assn. of America) (similar). See also id., at\r\n85 (statement of Xavier Becerra, House Judiciary Commit\u00ad\r\ntee member) (\u201c[R]etroactivity . . . is probably the best way\r\nto ensure that some of our older American works, any\u00ad\r\nthing from Motown, to \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 to \u2018The Hardy Boys\u2019 get\r\nthe protection in some of these emerging foreign markets.\r\nIt is important to ensure that countries no longer use our\r\nU. S. law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copy\u00ad\r\nright protections to some of our own works\u201d). But see\r\nid., at 272\u2013279 (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman\r\nof the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of\r\n22                   GOLAN v.

(testifying against restoration on grounds\r\nsimilar to those set out, supra, at 10\u201313).\r\n   This argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an ar\u00ad\r\ngument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to\r\nobtain more money from the sales of existing products. It\r\nis not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to\r\npromote or to protect the creative process.\r\n   Third, the majority points out that the statute \u201cgives\r\n[authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors\r\nduring whatever time remains before the normal copyright\r\nterm expires.\u201d Ante, at 30. But insofar as it suggests that\r\ncopyright should in general help authors obtain greater\r\nmonetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests\r\nupon primarily European, but not American, copyright\r\nconcepts. See supra, at 5\u20136.\r\n   Fourth, the majority argues that this statutory provi\u00ad\r\nsion is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obliga\u00ad\r\ntions. Ante, at 4\u20138. The Treaty, in Article 18, says that\r\nthe \u201cConvention shall apply to all works which, at the\r\nmoment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of\r\nthe United States] have not yet fallen into the public\r\ndomain in the country of origin through the expiry of the\r\nterm of protection.\u201d Berne Convention for the Protection\r\nof Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept. 9, 1886, as\r\nrevised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221,\r\n251. The majority and Government say that this means\r\nwe must protect the foreign works at issue here. And\r\nsince the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides\r\nincentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to\r\nspeculate, for argument\u2019s sake, that the statute might\r\nindirectly encourage production of new works by making\r\nthe United States\u2019 place in the international copyright\r\nregime more secure.\r\n   Still, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the\r\nstatute. For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Govern\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s own making. The United States obtained the\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           23\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nbenefits of Berne for many years despite its failure to\r\nenact a statute implementing Article 18. But in 1994, the\r\nUnited States and other nations signed the Agreement on\r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,\r\nwhich enabled signatories to use World Trade Organiza\u00ad\r\ntion dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about\r\nother members\u2019 Berne Convention violations. And at that\r\ntime the Government, although it successfully secured\r\nreservations protecting other special features of American\r\ncopyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation\r\npermitting the United States to keep some or all restored\r\nworks in the American public domain. Indeed, it made no\r\neffort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly\r\nauthorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Arti\u00ad\r\ncle\u2019s retroactivity principle. See Art. 18(3), ibid. (\u201cThe\r\napplication of [the retroactivity] principle shall be subject\r\nto any provisions contained in special conventions to that\r\neffect existing or to be concluded between countries of the\r\nUnion\u201d (emphasis added)); Gervais, Golan v. Holder: A\r\nLook at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Conven\u00ad\r\ntion, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 147, 151\u2013152 (2011); Gard,\r\n64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc, at 206.\r\n   For another thing, the Convention does not require\r\nCongress to enact a statute that causes so much damage\r\nto public domain material. Article 18(3) also states that\r\n\u201cthe respective countries shall determine, each in so far as\r\nit is concerned, the conditions of application of this princi-\r\nple.\u201d 18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added). Congress\r\ncould have alleviated many of the costs that the statute\r\nimposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory\r\nlicensing, requiring \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders to provide\r\nnecessary administrative information as a condition of\r\nprotection, or insisting upon \u201creasonable royalties.\u201d Cf.\r\nS. 2913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that\r\nwould have limited judicial remedies against users of\r\norphan works); H. R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008)\r\n24                    GOLAN v.

Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of\r\nGovernment should have tried to follow the Convention\r\nand in particular its provisions offering compliance flexi\u00ad\r\nbility. The fact that the statute has significant First\r\nAmendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that\r\nAmendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less\r\nrestrictive, alternative possibilities. Doing so here, reveals\r\nthat neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of\r\nless-restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention\r\nitself provides. And that fact means that the Convention\r\ncannot provide the statute with a constitutionally suffi\u00ad\r\ncient justification that is otherwise lacking.\r\n                              III\r\n   The fact that, by withdrawing material from the public\r\ndomain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow\r\nof information is sufficient, when combined with the other\r\nfeatures of the statute that I have discussed, to convince\r\nme that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of\r\nthe First Amendment, does not authorize Congress to\r\nenact this statute.\r\n   I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\r\nconclusion.\r\n",

Argued October 5, 2011\u2014Decided January 18, 2012\r\nThe Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\r\n  (Berne), which took effect in 1886, is the principal accord governing\r\n  international copyright relations. Berne\u2019s 164 member states agree\r\n  to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat au-\r\n  thors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.\r\n  Of central importance in this case, Article 18 of Berne requires coun-\r\n  tries to protect the works of other member states unless the works\u2019\r\n  copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is\r\n  claimed or the country of origin. A different system of transnational\r\n  copyright protection long prevailed in this country. Throughout most\r\n  of the 20th century, the only foreign authors eligible for Copyright\r\n  Act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights\r\n  to American authors and whose works were printed in the United\r\n  States. Despite Article 18, when the United States joined Berne in\r\n  1989, it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the U. S. public\r\n  domain, many of them works never protected here. In 1994, howev-\r\n  er, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property\r\n  Rights mandated implementation of Berne\u2019s first 21 articles, on pain\r\n  of enforcement by the World Trade Organization.\r\n     In response, Congress applied the term of protection available to\r\n  U. S. works to preexisting works from Berne member countries. Sec-\r\n  tion 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) grants copy-\r\n  right protection to works protected in their country of origin, but\r\n  lacking protection in the United States for any of three reasons: The\r\n  United States did not protect works from the country of origin at the\r\n  time of publication; the United States did not protect sound record-\r\n  ings fixed before 1972; or the author had not complied with certain\r\n2                          GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    U. S. statutory formalities. Works encompassed by \u00a7514 are granted\r\n    the protection they would have enjoyed had the United States main-\r\n    tained copyright relations with the author\u2019s country or removed for-\r\n    malities incompatible with Berne. As a consequence of the barriers\r\n    to U. S. copyright protection prior to \u00a7514\u2019s enactment, foreign works\r\n    \u201crestored\u201d to protection by the measure had entered the public do-\r\n    main in this country. To cushion the impact of their placement in\r\n    protected status, \u00a7514 provides ameliorating accommodations for\r\n    parties who had exploited affected works before the URAA was\r\n    enacted.\r\n      Petitioners are orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and\r\n    others who formerly enjoyed free access to works \u00a7514 removed from\r\n    the public domain. They maintain that Congress, in passing \u00a7514,\r\n    exceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and transgressed\r\n    First Amendment limitations. The District Court granted the Attor-\r\n    ney General\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Affirming in part, the\r\n    Tenth Circuit agreed that Congress had not offended the Copyright\r\n    Clause, but concluded that \u00a7514 required further First Amendment\r\n    inspection in light of Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186. On remand,\r\n    the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the\r\n    First Amendment claim, holding that \u00a7514\u2019s constriction of the public\r\n    domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests. The\r\n    Tenth Circuit reversed, ruling that \u00a7514 was narrowly tailored to fit\r\n    the important government aim of protecting U. S. copyright holders\u2019\r\n    interests abroad.\r\nHeld:\r\n    1. Section 514 does not exceed Congress\u2019 authority under the Copy-\r\n right Clause. Pp. 13\u201323.\r\n       (a) The text of the Copyright Clause does not exclude application\r\n of copyright protection to works in the public domain. Eldred is\r\n largely dispositive of petitioners\u2019 claim that the Clause\u2019s confinement\r\n of a copyright\u2019s lifespan to a \u201climited Tim[e]\u201d prevents the removal of\r\n works from the public domain. In Eldred, the Court upheld the Cop-\r\n yright Term Extension Act (CTEA), which extended, by 20 years, the\r\n terms of existing copyrights. The text of the Copyright Clause, the\r\n Court observed, contains no \u201ccommand that a time prescription, once\r\n set, becomes forever \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018inalterable,\u2019 \u201d and the Court declined to\r\n infer any such command. 537 U. S., at 199. The construction peti-\r\n tioners tender here is similarly infirm. The terms afforded works re-\r\n stored by \u00a7514 are no less \u201climited\u201d than those the CTEA lengthened.\r\n Nor had the \u201climited Tim[e]\u201d already passed for the works at issue\r\n here\u2014many of them works formerly denied any U. S. copyright pro-\r\n tection\u2014for a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end. Pe-\r\n titioners also urge that the Government\u2019s position would allow Con-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ngress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive\r\n\u201climited\u201d terms as prior terms expire. But as in Eldred, such hypo-\r\nthetical misbehavior is far afield from this case. In aligning the\r\nUnited States with other nations bound by Berne, Congress can hard-\r\nly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual\r\ncopyright regime. Pp. 13\u201315.\r\n   (b) Historical practice corroborates the Court\u2019s reading of the Copy-\r\nright Clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected\r\nworks. In the Copyright Act of 1790, the First Congress protected\r\nworks that had been freely reproducible under State copyright laws.\r\nSubsequent actions confirm that Congress has not understood the\r\nCopyright Clause to preclude protection for existing works. Several\r\nprivate bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inven-\r\ntions previously in the public domain. Congress has also passed gen-\r\nerally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works\r\nand inventions that had lost protection. Pp. 15\u201319.\r\n   (c) Petitioners also argue that \u00a7514 fails to \u201cpromote the Progress of\r\nScience\u201d as contemplated by the initial words of the Copyright\r\nClause. Specifically, they claim that because \u00a7514 affects only works\r\nalready created, it cannot meet the Clause\u2019s objective. The creation\r\nof new works, however, is not the sole way Congress may promote\r\n\u201cScience,\u201d i.e., knowledge and learning. In Eldred, this Court rejected\r\na nearly identical argument, concluding that the Clause does not de-\r\nmand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, operate to\r\ninduce new works. Rather the Clause \u201cempowers Congress to deter-\r\nmine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body\u2019s\r\njudgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.\u201d 537 U. S., at 222.\r\nNothing in the text or history of the Copyright Clause, moreover, con-\r\nfines the \u201cProgress of Science\u201d exclusively to \u201cincentives for creation.\u201d\r\nHistorical evidence, congressional practice, and this Court\u2019s deci-\r\nsions, in fact, suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing\r\nworks is an appropriate means to promote science. Pp. 20\u201322.\r\n   (d) Considered against this backdrop, \u00a7514 falls comfortably within\r\nCongress\u2019 Copyright Clause authority. Congress had reason to be-\r\nlieve that a well-functioning international copyright system would\r\nencourage the dissemination of existing and future works. And tes-\r\ntimony informed Congress that full compliance with Berne would ex-\r\npand the foreign markets available to U. S. authors and invigorate\r\nprotection against piracy of U. S. works abroad, thus benefitting cop-\r\nyright-intensive industries stateside and inducing greater investment\r\nin the creative process. This Court has no warrant to reject Congress\u2019\r\nrational judgment that exemplary adherence to Berne would serve\r\nthe objectives of the Copyright Clause. Pp. 22\u201323.\r\n   2.

Pp. 23\u201332.\r\n         (a) The pathmarking Eldred decision is again instructive. There,\r\n    the Court held that the CTEA\u2019s enlargement of a copyright\u2019s duration\r\n    did not offend the First Amendment\u2019s freedom of expression guaran-\r\n    tee. Recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent\r\n    and intended effect of every grant of copyright, the Court observed\r\n    that the Framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit\r\n    on the manner in which expressive works may be used, but also as an\r\n    \u201cengine of free expression.\u201d 537 U. S., at 219. The \u201ctraditional con-\r\n    tours\u201d of copyright protection, i.e., the \u201cidea/expression dichotomy\u201d\r\n    and the \u201cfair use\u201d defense, moreover, serve as \u201cbuilt-in First Amend-\r\n    ment accommodations.\u201d Ibid. Given the speech-protective purposes\r\n    and safeguards embraced by copyright law, there was no call for the\r\n    heightened review sought in Eldred. The Court reaches the same\r\n    conclusion here. Section 514 leaves undisturbed the idea/expression\r\n    distinction and the fair use defense. Moreover, Congress adopted\r\n    measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an inter-\r\n    national copyright regime. Pp. 23\u201326.\r\n         (b) Petitioners claim that First Amendment interests of a higher\r\n    order are at stake because they\u2014unlike their Eldred counterparts\u2014\r\n    enjoyed \u201cvested rights\u201d in works that had already entered the public\r\n    domain. Their contentions depend on an argument already consid-\r\n    ered and rejected, namely, that the Constitution renders the public\r\n    domain largely untouchable by Congress. Nothing in the historical\r\n    record, subsequent congressional practice, or this Court\u2019s jurispru-\r\n    dence warrants exceptional First Amendment solicitude for copy-\r\n    righted works that were once in the public domain. Congress has\r\n    several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of\r\n    works as well as works previously in the public domain. Section 514,\r\n    moreover, does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.\r\n    The question is whether would-be users of certain foreign works must\r\n    pay for their desired use of the author\u2019s expression, or else limit their\r\n    exploitation to \u201cfair use\u201d of those works. By fully implementing\r\n    Berne, Congress ensured that these works, like domestic and most\r\n    other foreign works, would be governed by the same legal regime.\r\n    Section 514 simply placed foreign works in the position they would\r\n    have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when\r\n    those works were created and first published.

ERIC H.\r\n   HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\r\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\r\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\r\n                               [January 18, 2012]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and\r\nArtistic Works (Berne Convention or Berne), which took\r\neffect in 1886, is the principal accord governing interna-\r\ntional copyright relations. Latecomer to the international\r\ncopyright regime launched by Berne, the United States\r\njoined the Convention in 1989. To perfect U. S. implemen-\r\ntation of Berne, and as part of our response to the Uru-\r\nguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, Congress,\r\nin 1994, gave works enjoying copyright protection abroad\r\nthe same full term of protection available to U. S. works.\r\nCongress did so in \u00a7514 of the Uruguay Round Agree-\r\nments Act (URAA), which grants copyright protection to\r\npreexisting works of Berne member countries, protected in\r\ntheir country of origin, but lacking protection in the United\r\nStates for any of three reasons: The United States did\r\nnot protect works from the country of origin at the time of\r\npublication; the United States did not protect sound record-\r\nings fixed before 1972; or the author had failed to comply\r\nwith U. S. statutory formalities (formalities Congress no\r\nlonger requires as prerequisites to copyright protection).\r\n   The URAA accords no protection to a foreign work after\r\n2                    GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nits full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into\r\nthe public domain, whether under the laws of the country\r\nof origin or of this country. Works encompassed by \u00a7514\r\nare granted the protection they would have enjoyed had\r\nthe United States maintained copyright relations with the\r\nauthor\u2019s country or removed formalities incompatible with\r\nBerne. Foreign authors, however, gain no credit for the\r\nprotection they lacked in years prior to \u00a7514\u2019s enactment.\r\nThey therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than\r\ndo their U. S. counterparts. As a consequence of the barri-\r\ners to U. S. copyright protection prior to the enactment of\r\n\u00a7514, foreign works \u201crestored\u201d to protection by the meas-\r\nure had entered the public domain in this country. To\r\ncushion the impact of their placement in protected status,\r\nCongress included in \u00a7514 ameliorating accommodations\r\nfor parties who had exploited affected works before the\r\nURAA was enacted.\r\n   Petitioners include orchestra conductors, musicians, pub-\r\nlishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to\r\nworks \u00a7514 removed from the public domain. They main-\r\ntain that the Constitution\u2019s Copyright and Patent Clause,\r\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, and First Amendment both decree the\r\ninvalidity of \u00a7514. Under those prescriptions of our high-\r\nest law, petitioners assert, a work that has entered the\r\npublic domain, for whatever reason, must forever remain\r\nthere.\r\n   In accord with the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, we\r\nconclude that \u00a7514 does not transgress constitutional\r\nlimitations on Congress\u2019 authority. Neither the Copyright\r\nand Patent Clause nor the First Amendment, we hold,\r\nmakes the public domain, in any and all cases, a territory\r\nthat works may never exit.\r\n                          I\r\n                          A\r\n  Members of the Berne Union agree to treat authors from\r\nother member countries as well as they treat their own.\r\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

N. T. S. 221, 225,\r\n231\u2013233. Nationals of a member country, as well as any\r\nauthor who publishes in one of Berne\u2019s 164 member states,\r\nthus enjoy copyright protection in nations across the globe.\r\nArt. 2(6), 3. Each country, moreover, must afford at least\r\nthe minimum level of protection specified by Berne. The\r\ncopyright term must span the author\u2019s lifetime, plus at\r\nleast 50 additional years, whether or not the author has\r\ncomplied with a member state\u2019s legal formalities. Art.\r\n5(2), 7(1). And, as relevant here, a work must be protected\r\nabroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the\r\ncountry where protection is claimed or the country of\r\norigin. Art. 18(1)\u2013(2).1\r\n  A different system of transnational copyright protection\r\nlong prevailed in this country. Until 1891, foreign works\r\nwere categorically excluded from Copyright Act protection.\r\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the only eligible\r\nforeign authors were those whose countries granted recip-\r\nrocal rights to U.

In the absence of such provisions,\r\nthe respective countries shall determine, each in so far as it is con-\r\ncerned, the conditions of application of this principle.\r\n   \u201c(4) The preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new\r\naccessions to the Union and to cases in which protection is extended by\r\nthe application of Article 7 or by the abandonment of reservations.\u201d\r\n828 U.

Rev. 749, 750\r\n(2003).2 For domestic and foreign authors alike, protection\r\nhinged on compliance with notice, registration, and re-\r\nnewal formalities.\r\n  The United States became party to Berne\u2019s multilateral,\r\nformality-free copyright regime in 1989. Initially, Con-\r\ngress adopted a \u201cminimalist approach\u201d to compliance with\r\nthe Convention. H. R. Rep. No. 100\u2013609, p. 7 (1988) (here-\r\ninafter BCIA House Report).

The specter of WTO en-\r\nforcement proceedings bolstered the credibility of our\r\ntrading partners\u2019 threats to challenge the United States\r\nfor inadequate compliance with Article 18. See URAA\r\nJoint Hearing 137 (statement of Shapiro, USTR) (\u201cIt is\r\nlikely that other WTO members would challenge the\r\ncurrent U.

In this\r\nregard, U. S. negotiators reported that widespread perception of U. S.\r\nnoncompliance was undermining our leverage in copyright negotia-\r\ntions. Unimpeachable adherence to Berne, Congress was told, would\r\nhelp ensure enhanced foreign protection, and hence profitable dissemi-\r\nnation, for existing and future U. S. works. See id., at 120 (app. to\r\nstatement of Lehman, Commerce Dept.)

The most notable required an author to register\r\nher work, renew that registration, and affix to published copies notice\r\nof copyrighted status. The formalities drew criticism as a trap for the\r\nunwary. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer \u00a77.01[A], p. 7\u20138; Doyle, Cary, McCannon,\r\n& Ringer, Notice of Copyright, Study No. 7, p. 46 (1957), reprinted in\r\n1 Studies on Copyright 229, 272 (1963).\r\n   In 1976, Congress eliminated the registration renewal requirement\r\nfor future works. Copyright Act of 1976, \u00a7302, 408, 90 Stat. 2572, 2580.\r\nIn 1988, it repealed the mandatory notice prerequisite. BCIA \u00a77, 102\r\nStat. 2857. And in 1992, Congress made renewal automatic for works\r\nstill in their first term of protection. Copyright Amendments Act of\r\n1992, 106 Stat. 264\u2013266. The Copyright Act retains, however, incen-\r\ntives for authors to register their works and provide notice of the works\u2019\r\ncopyrighted status. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7405(b) (precluding actual and\r\nstatutory damages against \u201cinnocent infringers\u201d of a work that lacked\r\nnotice of copyrighted status); \u00a7411(a) (requiring registration of U. S.\r\n\u201cwork[s],\u201d but not foreign works, before an owner may sue for infringe-\r\nment). The revisions successively made accord with Berne Convention\r\nArticle 5(2), which proscribes application of copyright formalities to\r\nforeign authors. Berne, however, affords domestic authors no escape\r\nfrom domestic formalities. See Art. 5(3) (protection within country of\r\norigin is a matter of domestic law).\r\n10                        GOLAN v.

Prospectively, restoration places foreign\r\nworks on an equal footing with their U. S. counterparts;\r\nassuming a foreign and domestic author died the same\r\nday, their works will enter the public domain simultane-\r\nously. See \u00a7302(a) (copyrights generally expire 70 years\r\nafter the author\u2019s death). Restored works, however, re-\r\nceive no compensatory time for the period of exclusivity\r\nthey would have enjoyed before \u00a7514\u2019s enactment, had\r\nthey been protected at the outset in the United States.\r\nTheir total term, therefore, falls short of that available to\r\nsimilarly situated U. S. works.\r\n   The URAA\u2019s disturbance of the public domain hardly\r\nescaped Congress\u2019 attention. Section 514 imposed no\r\nliability for any use of foreign works occurring before\r\nrestoration. In addition, anyone remained free to copy and\r\nuse restored works for one year following \u00a7514\u2019s enact-\r\nment. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7104A(h)(2)(A).

N. T. S., at 251.\r\n   13 Restoration is a misnomer insofar as it implies that all works\r\n\r\nprotected under \u00a7104A previously enjoyed protection. Each work in\r\nthe public domain because of lack of national eligibility or subject-\r\nmatter protection, and many that failed to comply with formalities,\r\nnever enjoyed U. S. copyright protection.           See, e.g., 3 Nimmer\r\n\u00a79A.04[A][1][b][iii], at 9A\u201326, and n. 29.4.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

See \u00a7104A(h)(3)\u2013(4).14 Reliance parties\r\nmay continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of\r\nthe restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce\u2014\r\neither by filing with the U. S. Copyright Office within two\r\nyears of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance\r\nparty. \u00a7104A(c), (d)(2)(A)(i), and (B)(i). After that, reli-\r\nance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a\r\ngrace period of one year. \u00a7104A(d)(2)(A)(ii), and (B)(ii).\r\nFinally, anyone who, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, creat-\r\ned a \u201cderivative work\u201d based on a restored work may\r\nindefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the\r\ncopyright holder of \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d to be set by\r\na district judge if the parties cannot agree. \u00a7104A(d)(3).\r\n                             B\r\n  In 2001, petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging \u00a7514.\r\nThey maintain that Congress, when it passed the URAA,\r\nexceeded its authority under the Copyright Clause and\r\ntransgressed First Amendment limitations.15 The District\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  14 A reliance party must have used the work in a manner that would\r\n\r\nconstitute infringement had a valid copyright been in effect. See\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(4)(A). After restoration, the reliance party is limited to her\r\nprevious uses. A performer of a restored work, for example, cannot,\r\npost-restoration, venture to sell copies of the script.

Deferring to Congress\u2019\r\npredictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs,\r\nthe appellate court held that \u00a7514 survived First Amend-\r\nment scrutiny. Specifically, the court determined that the\r\nlaw was narrowly tailored to fit the important government\r\naim of protecting U. S. copyright holders\u2019 interests abroad.\r\n609 F. 3d 1076 (2010).\r\n   We granted certiorari to consider petitioners\u2019 challenge\r\nto \u00a7514 under both the Copyright Clause and the First\r\nAmendment, 562 U.

HOLDER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n259, 266 (2007). Petitioners\u2019 contrary argument relies\r\nprimarily on the Constitution\u2019s confinement of a copy-\r\nright\u2019s lifespan to a \u201climited Tim[e].\u201d \u201cRemoving works\r\nfrom the public domain,\u201d they contend, \u201cviolates the \u2018lim-\r\nited [t]imes\u2019 restriction by turning a fixed and predictable\r\nperiod into one that can be reset or resurrected at any\r\ntime, even after it expires.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 22.\r\n   Our decision in Eldred is largely dispositive of petition-\r\ners\u2019 limited-time argument. There we addressed the\r\nquestion whether Congress violated the Copyright Clause\r\nwhen it extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copy-\r\nrights. 537 U. S., at 192\u2013193 (upholding Copyright Term\r\nExtension Act (CTEA)). Ruling that Congress acted with-\r\nin constitutional bounds, we declined to infer from the text\r\nof the Copyright Clause \u201cthe command that a time pre-\r\nscription, once set, becomes forever \u2018fixed\u2019 or \u2018inalterable.\u2019 \u201d\r\nId., at 199. \u201cThe word \u2018limited,\u2019 \u201d we observed, \u201cdoes not\r\nconvey a meaning so constricted.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the term\r\nis best understood to mean \u201cconfine[d] within certain\r\nbounds,\u201d \u201crestrain[ed],\u201d or \u201ccircumscribed.\u201d Ibid. (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The construction petitioners\r\ntender closely resembles the definition rejected in Eldred\r\nand is similarly infirm.\r\n   The terms afforded works restored by \u00a7514 are no less\r\n\u201climited\u201d than those the CTEA lengthened. In light of\r\nEldred, petitioners do not here contend that the term\r\nCongress has granted U. S. authors\u2014their lifetimes, plus\r\n70 years\u2014is unlimited. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7302(a). Nor do\r\npetitioners explain why terms of the same duration, as\r\napplied to foreign works, are not equally \u201ccircumscribed\u201d\r\nand \u201cconfined.\u201d See Eldred, 537 U. S., at 199. Indeed, as\r\nearlier noted, see supra, at 2, 10, the copyrights of restored\r\nforeign works typically last for fewer years than those of\r\ntheir domestic counterparts.\r\n   The difference, petitioners say, is that the limited time\r\nhad already passed for works in the public domain.

S. copyright protection? Exactly \u201czero,\u201d petition-\r\ners respond. Brief for Petitioners 22 (works in question\r\n\u201creceived a specific term of protection . . . sometimes ex-\r\npressly set to zero\u201d; \u201cat the end of that period,\u201d they \u201cen-\r\ntered the public domain\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (by \u201crefusing\r\nto provide any protection for a work,\u201d Congress \u201cset[s] the\r\nterm at zero,\u201d and thereby \u201ctell[s] us when the end has\r\ncome\u201d). We find scant sense in this argument, for surely a\r\n\u201climited time\u201d of exclusivity must begin before it may\r\nend.16\r\n   Carried to its logical conclusion, petitioners persist, the\r\nGovernment\u2019s position would allow Congress to institute a\r\nsecond \u201climited\u201d term after the first expires, a third after\r\nthat, and so on. Thus, as long as Congress legislated in\r\ninstallments, perpetual copyright terms would be achieva-\r\nble. As in Eldred, the hypothetical legislative misbehavior\r\npetitioners posit is far afield from the case before us. See\r\n537 U. S., at 198\u2013200, 209\u2013210. In aligning the United\r\nStates with other nations bound by the Berne Convention,\r\nand thereby according equitable treatment to once dis-\r\nfavored foreign authors, Congress can hardly be charged\r\nwith a design to move stealthily toward a regime of per-\r\npetual copyrights.\r\n                             B\r\n  Historical practice corroborates our reading of the Copy-\r\nright Clause to permit full U. S. compliance with Berne.\r\nUndoubtedly, federal copyright legislation generally has\r\nnot affected works in the public domain.

No comparable prac-\r\ntice, they maintain, supports \u00a7514.\r\n   On occasion, however, Congress has seen fit to protect\r\nworks once freely available.

Before the Act\r\nlaunched a uniform national system, three States provided\r\nno statutory copyright protection at all.17 Of those that\r\ndid afford some protection, seven failed to protect maps;18\r\neight did not cover previously published books;19 and all\r\nten denied protection to works that failed to comply with\r\nformalities.20 The First Congress, it thus appears, did not\r\nview the public domain as inviolate.

S. 53, 57 (1884).21\r\n   Subsequent actions confirm that Congress has not un-\r\nderstood the Copyright Clause to preclude protection for\r\nexisting works. Several private bills restored the copy-\r\nrights of works that previously had been in the public\r\ndomain. See Act of Feb. 19, 1849 (Corson Act), ch. 57, 9\r\nStat. 763; Act of June 23, 1874 (Helmuth Act), ch. 534, 18\r\nStat. 618; Act of Feb. 17, 1898 (Jones Act), ch. 29, 30 Stat.\r\n1396. These bills were unchallenged in court.\r\n   Analogous patent statutes, however, were upheld in\r\nlitigation.22 In 1808, Congress passed a private bill restor-\r\ning patent protection to Oliver Evans\u2019 flour mill. When\r\nEvans sued for infringement, first Chief Justice Marshall\r\nin the Circuit Court, Evans v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Jordan, 9 Cranch 199 (1815),\r\nupheld the restored patent\u2019s validity. After the patent\u2019s\r\nexpiration, the Court said, \u201ca general right to use [Evans\u2019]\r\ndiscovery was not so vested in the public\u201d as to allow the\r\ndefendant to continue using the machinery, which he had\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   21 The parties debate the extent to which the First Congress removed\r\n\r\nworks from the public domain. We have held, however, that at least\r\nsome works protected by the 1790 Act previously lacked protection. In\r\nWheaton v. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1834), the Court ruled that before enact-\r\nment of the 1790 Act, common-law copyright protection expired upon\r\nfirst publication. Id., at 657, 663. Thus published works covered by the\r\n1790 Act previously would have been in the public domain unless\r\nprotected by state statute. Had the founding generation perceived the\r\nconstitutional boundary petitioners advance today, the First Congress\r\ncould have designed a prospective scheme that left the public domain\r\nundisturbed.

There we enforced an 1839 amendment\r\nthat recognized a patent on an invention despite its prior\r\nuse by the inventor\u2019s employer. Absent such dispensation,\r\nthe employer\u2019s use would have rendered the invention\r\nunpatentable, and therefore open to exploitation without\r\nthe inventor\u2019s leave. Id., at 206\u2013209.\r\n   Congress has also passed generally applicable legisla-\r\ntion granting patents and copyrights to inventions and\r\nworks that had lost protection. An 1832 statute author-\r\nized a new patent for any inventor whose failure, \u201cby\r\ninadvertence, accident, or mistake,\u201d to comply with statu-\r\ntory formalities rendered the original patent \u201cinvalid or\r\ninoperative.\u201d Act of July 3, \u00a73, 4 Stat. 559. An 1893\r\nmeasure similarly allowed authors who had not timely\r\ndeposited their work to receive \u201call the rights and privileg-\r\nes\u201d the Copyright Act affords, if they made the required\r\ndeposit by March 1, 1893. Act of Mar. 3, ch. 215, 27 Stat.\r\n743.23 And in 1919 and 1941, Congress authorized the\r\nPresident to issue proclamations granting protection to\r\nforeign works that had fallen into the public domain dur-\r\ning World Wars I and II. See Act of Dec. 18, 1919, ch. 11,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  23 Section 514 is in line with these measures; like them, it accords\r\nprotection to works that had lapsed into the public domain because of\r\nfailure to comply with U.

But as we explained in\r\nEldred, this passage did not speak to the constitutional\r\nlimits on Congress\u2019 copyright and patent authority. Ra-\r\nther, it \u201caddressed an invention\u2019s very eligibility for patent\r\nprotection.\u201d 537 U. S., at 202, n. 7.\r\n   Installing a federal copyright system and ameliorating\r\nthe interruptions of global war, it is true, presented Con-\r\ngress with extraordinary situations. Yet the TRIPS ac-\r\ncord, leading the United States to comply in full measure\r\nwith Berne, was also a signal event. See supra, at 7\u20138; cf.\r\nEldred, 537 U. S., at 259, 264\u2013265 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\r\n(acknowledging importance of international uniformity\r\nadvanced by U. S. efforts to conform to the Berne Conven-\r\ntion).

Even so, the\r\nremedy sheltered creations that, absent congressional action, would\r\nhave been open to free exploitation. Such action, according to petition-\r\ners\u2019 dominant argument, see supra, at 13\u201314, is ever and always\r\nimpermissible.

Perhaps counterintui-\r\ntively for the contemporary reader, Congress\u2019 copyright\r\nauthority is tied to the progress of science; its patent\r\nauthority, to the progress of the useful arts.

And those permissible ends,\r\nwe held, extended beyond the creation of new works. See\r\nid., at 205\u2013206 (rejecting the notion that \u201c \u2018the only way to\r\npromote the progress of science [is] to provide incentives\r\nto create new works\u2019 \u201d (quoting Perlmutter, Participation in\r\nthe International Copyright System as a Means to Pro-\r\nmote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, 36 Loyola\r\n(LA) L.

Evidence from the found-\r\ning, moreover, suggests that inducing dissemination\u2014as\r\nopposed to creation\u2014was viewed as an appropriate means\r\nto promote science.

To do so, we\r\nfirst recapitulate the relevant part of our pathmarking\r\ndecision in Eldred. The petitioners in Eldred, like those\r\nhere, argued that Congress had violated not only the\r\n\u201climited Times\u201d prescription of the Copyright Clause. In\r\naddition, and independently, the Eldred petitioners\r\ncharged, Congress had offended the First Amendment\u2019s\r\nfreedom of expression guarantee. The CTEA\u2019s 20-year\r\nenlargement of a copyright\u2019s duration, we held in Eldred,\r\noffended neither provision.\r\n   Concerning the First Amendment, we recognized that\r\nsome restriction on expression is the inherent and in-\r\ntended effect of every grant of copyright. Noting that the\r\n\u201cCopyright Clause and the First Amendment were adopted\r\nclose in time,\u201d 537 U. S., at 219, we observed that the\r\nFramers regarded copyright protection not simply as a\r\nlimit on the manner in which expressive works may be\r\nused. They also saw copyright as an \u201cengine of free ex-\r\npression[:] By establishing a marketable right to the use of\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  28 The dissent suggests that the \u201cutilitarian view of copyrigh[t]\u201d em-\r\n\r\nbraced by Jefferson, Madison, and our case law sets us apart from\r\ncontinental Europe and inhibits us from harmonizing our copyright\r\nlaws with those of countries in the civil-law tradition.

First Amendment inter-\r\nests of a higher order are at stake here, petitioners say,\r\nbecause they\u2014unlike their counterparts in Eldred\u2014\r\nenjoyed \u201cvested rights\u201d in works that had already entered\r\nthe public domain. The limited rights they retain under\r\ncopyright law\u2019s \u201cbuilt-in safeguards\u201d are, in their view, no\r\nsubstitute for the unlimited use they enjoyed before \u00a7514\u2019s\r\nenactment. Nor, petitioners urge, does \u00a7514\u2019s \u201cunprece-\r\ndented\u201d foray into the public domain possess the historical\r\npedigree that supported the term extension at issue in\r\nEldred. Brief for Petitioners 42\u201343.\r\n  However spun, these contentions depend on an argu-\r\nment we considered and rejected above, namely, that the\r\nConstitution renders the public domain largely untouch-\r\nable by Congress. Petitioners here attempt to achieve\r\nunder the banner of the First Amendment what they could\r\nnot win under the Copyright Clause: On their view of the\r\nCopyright Clause, the public domain is inviolable; as they\r\nread the First Amendment, the public domain is policed\r\nthrough heightened judicial scrutiny of Congress\u2019 means\r\nand ends. As we have already shown, see supra, at 13\u201319,\r\nthe text of the Copyright Clause and the historical record\r\nscarcely establish that \u201conce a work enters the public\r\ndomain,\u201d Congress cannot permit anyone\u2014\u201cnot even the\r\ncreator\u2014[to] copyright it,\u201d 501 F. 3d, at 1184.

See also id., at 1194 (\u201c[O]nce the works\r\nat issue became free for anyone to copy, [petitioners] had\r\nvested First Amendment interests in the expressions,\r\n[thus] \u00a7514\u2019s interference with [petitioners\u2019] rights is\r\nsubject to First Amendment scrutiny.\u201d). As petitioners put\r\nit in this Court, Congress impermissibly revoked their\r\nright to exploit foreign works that \u201cbelonged to them\u201d once\r\nthe works were in the public domain.

However attractive this bright-\r\nline rule might be, it is not a rule rooted in the constitutional text or\r\nhistory. Nor can it fairly be gleaned from our case law. The dissent\r\ncites three decisions to document its assertion that \u201cthis Court has\r\nassumed the particular importance of public domain material in rough-\r\nly analogous circumstances.\u201d Post, at 15. The dictum in Graham v.\r\nJohn Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 (1966), noted earlier, did\r\nnot treat the public domain as a constitutional limit\u2014certainly not\r\nunder the rubric of the First Amendment. See supra, at 19. The other\r\ntwo decisions the dissent cites considered whether the federal Patent\r\nAct preempted a state trade-secret law, Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron\r\nCorp., 416 U. S. 470, 479\u2013484 (1974), and whether the freedom of the\r\npress shielded reporters from liability for publishing material drawn\r\nfrom public court documents, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S.\r\n469, 495\u2013497 (1975). Neither decision remotely ascribed constitutional\r\nsignificance to a work\u2019s public domain status.\r\n28                      GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nmight sound exactly backwards: Rights typically vest at\r\nthe outset of copyright protection, in an author or\r\nrightholder. See, e.g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7201(a) (\u201cCopyright in a\r\nwork protected . . . vests initially in the author . . . .\u201d).\r\nOnce the term of protection ends, the works do not revest\r\nin any rightholder. Instead, the works simply lapse into\r\nthe public domain. See, e.g., Berne, Art. 18(1), 828\r\nU. N. T. S., at 251 (\u201cThis Convention shall apply to all\r\nworks which . . . have not yet fallen into the public do-\r\nmain . . . .\u201d). Anyone has free access to the public domain,\r\nbut no one, after the copyright term has expired, acquires\r\nownership rights in the once-protected works.\r\n   Congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect\r\ncategories of works once outside the law\u2019s compass. For\r\nexample, Congress broke new ground when it extended\r\ncopyright protection to foreign works in 1891, Act of Mar.\r\n3, \u00a713, 26 Stat. 1110; to dramatic works in 1856, Act of\r\nAug. 18, 11 Stat. 138; to photographs and photographic\r\nnegatives in 1865, Act of Mar. 3, \u00a71, 13 Stat. 540; to mo-\r\ntion pictures in 1912, Act of Aug. 24, 37 Stat. 488; to fixed\r\nsound recordings in 1972, Act of Oct. 15, 1971, 85 Stat.\r\n391; and to architectural works in 1990, Architectural\r\nWorks Copyright Protection Act, 104 Stat. 5133. And on\r\nseveral occasions, as recounted above, Congress protected\r\nworks previously in the public domain, hence freely usable\r\nby the public. See supra, at 15\u201319. If Congress could\r\ngrant protection to these works without hazarding height-\r\nened First Amendment scrutiny, then what free speech\r\nprinciple disarms it from protecting works prematurely\r\ncast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the\r\nBerne Convention? 33\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  33 It was the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause\u2014not the First\r\n\r\nAmendment\u2014that Congress apparently perceived to be a potential\r\ncheck on its authority to protect works then freely available to the\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners protest that fair use and\r\nthe idea/expression dichotomy \u201care plainly inadequate to\r\nprotect the speech and expression rights that Section 514\r\ntook from petitioners, or . . . the public\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe\r\nunrestricted right to perform, copy, teach and distribute\r\nthe entire work, for any reason.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 46\u2013\r\n47. \u201cPlaying a few bars of a Shostakovich symphony,\u201d\r\npetitioners observe, \u201cis no substitute for performing the\r\nentire work.\u201d Id., at 47.34\r\n   But Congress has not put petitioners in this bind. The\r\nquestion here, as in Eldred, is whether would-be users\r\nmust pay for their desired use of the author\u2019s expression,\r\nor else limit their exploitation to \u201cfair use\u201d of that work.\r\nProkofiev\u2019s Peter and the Wolf could once be performed\r\nfree of charge; after \u00a7514 the right to perform it must be\r\nobtained in the marketplace. This is the same market-\r\nplace, of course, that exists for the music of Prokofiev\u2019s\r\nU. S. contemporaries: works of Copland and Bernstein, for\r\nexample, that enjoy copyright protection, but nevertheless\r\nappear regularly in the programs of U. S. concertgoers.\r\n   Before we joined Berne, domestic works and some for-\r\neign works were protected under U. S. statutes and bilat-\r\neral international agreements, while other foreign works\r\nwere available at an artificially low (because royalty-free)\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\npublic. See URAA Joint Hearing 3 (statement of Rep. Hughes); id., at\r\n121 (app. to statement of Lehman, Commerce Dept.); id., at 141 (state-\r\nment of Shapiro, USTR); id., at 145 (statement of Christopher Schroe-\r\nder, DOJ). The reliance-party protections supplied by \u00a7514, see supra,\r\nat 10\u201311, were meant to address such concerns. See URAA Joint\r\nHearing 148\u2013149 (prepared statement of Schroeder).\r\n  34 Because Shostakovich was a pre-1973 Russian composer, his works\r\n\r\nwere not protected in the United States. See U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nCircular No. 38A: The International Copyright Relations of the United\r\nStates 9, 11, n. 2 (2010) (copyright relations between the Soviet Union\r\nand the United States date to 1973).\r\n30                        GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncost. By fully implementing Berne, Congress ensured that\r\nmost works, whether foreign or domestic, would be gov-\r\nerned by the same legal regime. The phenomenon to\r\nwhich Congress responded is not new: Distortions of the\r\nsame order occurred with greater frequency\u2014and to the\r\ndetriment of both foreign and domestic authors\u2014when,\r\nbefore 1891, foreign works were excluded entirely from\r\nU. S. copyright protection. See Kampelman, The United\r\nStates and International Copyright, 41 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 406,\r\n413 (1947) (\u201cAmerican readers were less inclined to read\r\nthe novels of Cooper or Hawthorne for a dollar when they\r\ncould buy a novel of Scott or Dickens for a quarter.\u201d).\r\nSection 514 continued the trend toward a harmonized\r\ncopyright regime by placing foreign works in the position\r\nthey would have occupied if the current regime had been\r\nin effect when those works were created and first pub-\r\nlished. Authors once deprived of protection are spared the\r\ncontinuing effects of that initial deprivation; \u00a7514 gives\r\nthem nothing more than the benefit of their labors during\r\nwhatever time remains before the normal copyright term\r\nexpires.35\r\n   Unlike petitioners, the dissent makes much of the so-\r\ncalled \u201corphan works\u201d problem. See post, at 11\u201314, 23\u201324.\r\nWe readily acknowledge the difficulties would-be users of\r\ncopyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating\r\ncopyright owners. See generally U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nReport on Orphan Works 21\u201340 (2006). But as the dissent\r\nconcedes, see post, at 13, this difficulty is hardly peculiar\r\nto works restored under \u00a7514. It similarly afflicts, for\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  35 Persistently deploring \u201c \u2018restored copyright\u2019 protection [because it]\r\n\r\nremoves material from the public domain,\u201d post, at 14, the dissent does\r\nnot pause to consider when and why the material came to be lodged in\r\nthat domain. Most of the works affected by \u00a7514 got there after a term\r\nof zero or a term cut short by failure to observe U. S. formalities. See\r\nsupra, at 9.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Heretofore, no one has sug-\r\ngested that the orphan-works issue should be addressed\r\nthrough our implementation of Berne, rather than\r\nthrough overarching legislation of the sort proposed in\r\nCongress and cited by the dissent.

HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nworks that have already been created and already are in\r\nthe American public domain. At the same time, the stat\u00ad\r\nute inhibits the dissemination of those works, foreign\r\nworks published abroad after 1923, of which there are\r\nmany millions, including films, works of art, innumerable\r\nphotographs, and, of course, books\u2014books that (in the\r\nabsence of the statute) would assume their rightful places\r\nin computer-accessible databases, spreading knowledge\r\nthroughout the world. See infra, at 10\u201313. In my view,\r\nthe Copyright Clause does not authorize Congress to enact\r\nthis statute. And I consequently dissent.\r\n                                I\r\n   The possibility of eliciting new production is, and always\r\nhas been, an essential precondition for American copyright\r\nprotection. The Constitution\u2019s words, \u201cexclusive Right,\u201d\r\n\u201climited Times,\u201d \u201cProgress of Science,\u201d viewed through the\r\nlens of history underscore the legal significance of what\r\nthe Court in Eldred referred to as the \u201ceconomic philoso\u00ad\r\nphy behind the Copyright Clause.\u201d 537 U. S., at 212, n. 18\r\n(brackets omitted). That philosophy understands copy\u00ad\r\nright\u2019s grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as\r\nprivate benefits that are conferred for a public reason\u2014to\r\nelicit new creation.\r\n   Yet, as the Founders recognized, monopoly is a two\u00ad\r\nedged sword. On the one hand, it can encourage produc\u00ad\r\ntion of new works. In the absence of copyright protection,\r\nanyone might freely copy the products of an author\u2019s\r\ncreative labor, appropriating the benefits without incur\u00ad\r\nring the nonrepeatable costs of creation, thereby deterring\r\nauthors from exerting themselves in the first place. On\r\nthe other hand, copyright tends to restrict the dissemina\u00ad\r\ntion (and use) of works once produced either because the\r\nabsence of competition translates directly into higher\r\nconsumer prices or because the need to secure copying\r\npermission sometimes imposes administrative costs that\r\nmake it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work\r\nto find its owner and strike a bargain.

The Crown, for example, had char\u00ad\r\ntered the Stationers\u2019 Company, permitting it to regulate\r\nand to censor works on the government\u2019s behalf. The\r\nStationers had thereby acquired control over the disposi\u00ad\r\ntion of copies of published works, from which emerged\r\nthe Stationers\u2019 copyright\u2014a right conferred on company\r\nmembers, not authors, that was deemed to exist in perpe\u00ad\r\ntuity.

L. J. 1247, 1250\u20131256 (2010).\r\n   To prevent the continuation of the booksellers\u2019 monopoly\r\nand to encourage authors to write new books, Parliament\r\nenacted the Statute of Anne. It bore the title: \u201cAn Act for\r\nthe Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of\r\nprinted Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Cop\u00ad\r\nies, during the Times therein mentioned.\u201d And it granted\r\nauthors (not publishers) and their assignees the \u201csole\r\nRight and Liberty of printing\u201d their works for limited\r\nperiods of time in order to encourage them \u201cto compose and\r\nwrite useful Books.\u201d 8 Anne, ch. 19, \u00a71 (emphasis added).\r\nAs one historian has put it, \u201c[t]he central plank of the . . .\r\nAct was . . . a cultural quid pro quo.

L. J. 106, 108\r\n(2003). At first, in their attempts to minimize their losses,\r\nthe booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual com\u00ad\r\nmon-law copyright in their works deriving from their\r\nnatural rights as creators. But the House of Lords ulti\u00ad\r\nmately held in Donaldson v. Beckett, 1 Eng. Rep. 837\r\n(1774), that the Statute of Anne had transformed any such\r\nperpetual common-law copyright into a copyright of a\r\nlimited term designed to serve the public interest. Patter\u00ad\r\nson 15\u201316, 153, 158\u2013179; Deazley, supra, at 114\u2013126.\r\n   Many early colonial copyright statutes, patterned after\r\nthe Statute of Anne, also stated that copyright\u2019s objective\r\nwas to encourage authors to produce new works and\r\nthereby improve learning.

Copyright Office,\r\nCopyright Enactments, Bulletin No. 3, pp. 1, 6, 10, 11, 17,\r\n19 (rev. 1963) (statutes of Connecticut, New Jersey, Penn\u00ad\r\nsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York); Wal\u00ad\r\nterscheid 74\u201375; Bracha, The Adventures of the Statute of\r\nAnne in the Land of Unlimited Possibilities: The Life of a\r\nLegal Transplant, 25 Berkeley Tech.

Thomas Jefferson, for\r\nexample, initially expressed great uncertainty as to\r\nwhether the Constitution should authorize the grant of\r\ncopyrights and patents at all, writing that \u201cthe benefit\r\neven of limited monopolies is too doubtful\u201d to warrant\r\nanything other than their \u201csuppression.\u201d Letter from\r\nThomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\r\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 443 (J.

Looney ed.\r\n2009) (emphasis added).\r\n   This utilitarian view of copyrights and patents, em\u00ad\r\nbraced by Jefferson and Madison, stands in contrast to the\r\n\u201cnatural rights\u201d view underlying much of continental\r\nEuropean copyright law\u2014a view that the English\r\nbooksellers promoted in an effort to limit their losses\r\nfollowing the enactment of the Statute of Anne and that in\r\npart motivated the enactment of some of the colonial\r\nstatutes. Patterson 158\u2013179, 183\u2013192. Premised on the\r\nidea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to\r\nthe fruits of his labor, it mythically stems from a legend\u00ad\r\nary 6th-century statement of King Diarmed \u201c \u2018to every cow\r\nher calf, and accordingly to every book its copy.\u2019 \u201d A.\r\nBirrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copy\u00ad\r\nright in Books 42 (1899). That view, though perhaps\r\nreflected in the Court\u2019s opinion, ante, at 30, runs contrary\r\nto the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of\r\nour own Constitution\u2019s Copyright Clause. See S.

Stewart, International Copyright\r\nand Neighbouring Rights 6\u20137 (2d ed. 1989) (describing the\r\nEuropean system of droit d\u2019auteur).\r\n    This utilitarian understanding of the Copyright Clause\r\nhas long been reflected in the Court\u2019s case law. In Mazer,\r\nfor example, the Court refers to copyright as embodying\r\nthe view that \u201cencouragement of individual effort by per-\r\nsonal gain is the best way to advance public welfare\r\nthrough the talents of authors and inventors.\u201d 347 U. S.,\r\nat 219 (emphasis added). In Twentieth Century Music\r\nCorp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151 (1975), the Court says that\r\nunderlying copyright is the understanding that \u201c[c]reative\r\nwork is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private moti-\r\nvation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad\r\npublic availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\u201d\r\nId., at 156 (emphasis added). And in Sony Corp. of Amer-\r\nica v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), the\r\nCourt, speaking of both copyrights and patents, points out\r\nthat the \u201cmonopoly privileges that Congress may author\u00ad\r\nize are . . . [not] primarily designed to provide a special\r\nprivate benefit. Rather, the limited grant is a means by\r\nwhich an important public purpose may be achieved. It is\r\nintended to motivate the creative activity of authors . . . by\r\nthe provision of a special reward.\u201d Id., at 429 (emphasis\r\nadded); see also, e.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas\r\nCity, 383 U.

They are \u2018to promote the progress of science\r\n    and the useful arts.\u2019 . . . [The Clause says] nothing . . .\r\n    about any desire or purpose to secure to the author or\r\n    inventor his \u2018natural right to his property.\u2019 \u201d H. R.\r\n    Rep. No. 1494, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2.\r\nSimilarly, the congressional authors of the landmark 1909\r\nCopyright Act wrote:\r\n    \u201cThe Constitution . . . provides that Congress shall\r\n    have the power to grant [copyrights] . . . [n]ot primari\u00ad\r\n    ly for the benefit of the author, . . . but because the\r\n    policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body\r\n    of people, in that it will stimulate writing and inven-\r\n    tion, to give some bonus to authors and inventors.\u201d\r\n    H. R. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1909).\r\nAnd they went on to say:\r\n    \u201cCongress must consider . . . two questions: First, how\r\n    much will the legislation stimulate the producer and\r\n    so benefit the public; and, second, how much will the\r\n    monopoly granted be detrimental to the public? The\r\n    granting of such exclusive rights, under the proper\r\n    terms and conditions, confers a benefit upon the pub\u00ad\r\n    lic that outweighs the evils of the temporary monop\u00ad\r\n    oly.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   The upshot is that text, history, and precedent demon\u00ad\r\nstrate that the Copyright Clause places great value on the\r\npower of copyright to elicit new production. Congress in\r\nparticular cases may determine that copyright\u2019s ability to\r\ndo so outweighs any concomitant high prices, administra\u00ad\r\ntive costs, and restrictions on dissemination. And when it\r\ndoes so, we must respect its judgment. See Eldred, 537\r\n8                    GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nU. S., at 222. But does the Clause empower Congress to\r\nenact a statute that withdraws works from the public\r\ndomain, brings about higher prices and costs, and in doing\r\nso seriously restricts dissemination, particularly to those\r\nwho need it for scholarly, educational, or cultural pur-\r\nposes\u2014all without providing any additional incentive for\r\nthe production of new material? That is the question\r\nbefore us. And, as I have said, I believe the answer is no.\r\nCongress in this statute has exceeded what are, under any\r\nplausible reading of the Copyright Clause, its permissible\r\nlimits.\r\n                              II\r\n   The Act before us says that it \u201crestores\u201d American copy\u00ad\r\nright to a set of works, which, for the most part, did not\r\npreviously enjoy American copyright protection. These\r\nworks had fallen into America\u2019s public domain, but as of\r\nthe \u201crestoration\u201d date, they had not yet fallen into the pub\u00ad\r\nlic domain of the foreign country where they originated.\r\n   The statute covers works originating almost anywhere\r\noutside the United States. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7104A(h)(3)\r\n(setting out eligibility criteria); U. S. Copyright Office,\r\nCircular No. 38A: International Copyright Relations of the\r\nUnited States (2010). The relevant set of works consists\r\nprimarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain,\r\nor at some point lost, American copyright protection be\u00ad\r\ncause (1) the author failed to comply with applicable\r\nAmerican copyright formalities (such as notice or renew\u00ad\r\nal), or (2) the nation in which they were first published\r\nthen lacked copyright relations with the United States, or\r\n(3) they are sound recordings fixed before February 15,\r\n1972. \u00a7104A(h)(6)(C). A work must also satisfy other\r\ntechnical requirements: It must have had a rightholder\r\nwho was a national or resident of an eligible country on\r\nthe day it was created; and it cannot have been published\r\nin the United States within 30 days of its first publication.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(6)(D). The Act grants these works a copyright\r\nthat expires at the time it would have expired had the\r\nauthor obtained a full American copyright term starting\r\nfrom the date on which the work was first published (in\r\nthe foreign country). \u00a7104A(a)(1)(B).\r\n   The Act mainly applies to works first published abroad\r\nbetween 1923 and 1989. It does not apply significantly to\r\nearlier works because any work published before 1921\r\nwould have fallen into the public domain before 1977 had\r\nit received a full American copyright term, while works\r\npublished between 1921 and 1923 obtained a \u201crestored\u201d\r\ncopyright that expired before the 1998 Sonny Bono Copy\u00ad\r\nright Term Extension Act, and so could have lasted two\r\nyears at most. See Tit. I, \u00a7101, 90 Stat. 2574 (extending\r\nthe copyright term of works still under copyright in 1977\r\nto 75 years); 17 U. S. C. \u00a7304(b) (extending the copyright\r\nterm of works still under copyright in 1998 to 95 years). It\r\nhas less impact on more recent works because in 1989\r\nthe United States became a Berne member, abolished the\r\ncopyright notice requirement, and thenceforth provided\r\nprospective copyright protection throughout the Berne\r\nUnion. See R. Schechter & J. Thomas, Intellectual Prop\u00ad\r\nerty: The Law of Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks 75\u2013\r\n77 (2003); \u00a77, 102 Stat. 2857\u20132858 (codified as amended at\r\n17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7401\u2013406).\r\n   Despite these temporal limitations, the Act covers vast\r\nnumbers of works. The first category includes works\r\npublished in countries that had copyright relations with\r\nthe United States during this time period, such as most of\r\nWestern Europe and Latin America, Australia, and Japan,\r\nsee Circular No. 38A, supra, at 2\u201310, whose authors did\r\nnot satisfy American copyright formalities, perhaps be\u00ad\r\ncause the author, who may not have sought an American\r\ncopyright, published the book abroad without proper\r\nAmerican notice, or perhaps because the author obtained a\r\nvalid American copyright but failed to renew it.\r\n10                   GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   The second category (works that entered the public\r\ndomain due to a lack of copyright relations) includes,\r\namong others, all works published in Russia and other\r\ncountries of the former Soviet Union before May 1973\r\n(when the U. S. S. R. joined the Universal Copyright Con\u00ad\r\nvention (UCC)), all works published in the People\u2019s Repub\u00ad\r\nlic of China before March 1992 (when bilateral copyright\r\nrelations between the People\u2019s Republic and the United\r\nStates were first established), all South Korean works\r\npublished before October 1987 (when South Korea joined\r\nthe UCC), and all Egyptian and Turkish works published\r\nbefore March 1989 (when the United States joined Berne).\r\nSee id., at 2\u201310, and 11, nn. 2, 5, 6.\r\n   The third category covers all sound recordings from\r\neligible foreign countries published after February 15,\r\n1972. The practical significance of federal copyright resto\u00ad\r\nration to this category of works is less clear, since these\r\nworks received, and continued to receive, copyright protec\u00ad\r\ntion under state law. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7301(c).\r\n   Apparently there are no precise figures about the num\u00ad\r\nber of works the Act affects, but in 1996 the then-Register\r\nof Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, thought that they \u201cproba\u00ad\r\nbly number in the millions.\u201d The Year in Review: Accom\u00ad\r\nplishments and Objectives of the U.

See \u00a7104A(h)(2)(A)\r\n(setting \u201crestoration\u201d dates). It then restricts the dissemi\u00ad\r\nnation of those works in two ways.\r\n  First, \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders can now charge fees\r\nfor works that consumers previously used for free. The\r\nprice of a score of Shostakovich\u2019s Preludes and Fugues Op.\r\n87, for example, has risen by a multiple of seven. Brief for\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

And, as the\r\nCourt recognizes, an orchestra that once could perform\r\n\u201cPeter and the Wolf . . . free of charge\u201d will now have to\r\nbuy the \u201cright to perform it . . . in the marketplace.\u201d Ante,\r\nat 29. But for the case of certain \u201cderivative\u201d works,\r\n\u00a7104A(d)(3), the \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, like other\r\ncopyright holders, can charge what the market will bear.\r\nIf a school orchestra or other nonprofit organization can\u00ad\r\nnot afford the new charges, so be it. They will have to do\r\nwithout\u2014aggravating the already serious problem of\r\ncultural education in the United States. See Brief for\r\nConductors Guild et al. as Amici Curiae 4\u20135, 7\u20138 (describ\u00ad\r\ning the inability of many orchestras to pay for the rental of\r\nsheet music covered by \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d).\r\n   Second, and at least as important, the statute creates\r\nadministrative costs, such as the costs of determining\r\nwhether a work is the subject of a \u201crestored copyright,\u201d\r\nsearching for a \u201crestored copyright\u201d holder, and negotiat\u00ad\r\ning a fee. Congress has tried to ease the administrative\r\nburden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating\r\nprices for those whom the statute calls \u201creliance part[ies],\u201d\r\nnamely those who previously had used such works when\r\nthey were freely available in the public domain.\r\n\u00a7104A(h)(4). But Congress has done nothing to ease the\r\nadministrative burden of securing permission from copy\u00ad\r\nright owners that is placed upon those who want to use a\r\nwork that they did not previously use, and this is a partic\u00ad\r\nular problem when it comes to \u201corphan works\u201d\u2014older and\r\nmore obscure works with minimal commercial value that\r\nhave copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to\r\ntrack down. Unusually high administrative costs threaten\r\nto limit severely the distribution and use of those works\u2014\r\nworks which, despite their characteristic lack of economic\r\nvalue, can prove culturally invaluable.\r\n   There are millions of such works. For example, accord\u00ad\r\ning to European Union figures, there are 13 million or\u00ad\r\n12                   GOLAN v.

They will tempt some potential\r\nusers to \u201csteal\u201d or \u201cpirate\u201d works rather than do without.\r\nAnd piracy often begets piracy, breeding the destructive\r\nhabit of taking copyrighted works without paying for\r\nthem, even where payment is possible. Such habits\r\nignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation\r\nof new works, while reflecting a false belief that new\r\ncreation appears by magic without thought or hope of\r\ncompensation.\r\n                          B\r\n  I recognize that ordinary copyright protection also\r\ncomes accompanied with dissemination-restricting royalty\r\ncharges and administrative costs.

For one thing, the foreign\r\nlocation of restored works means higher than ordinary\r\nadministrative costs. For another, the statute\u2019s technical\r\nrequirements make it very difficult to establish whether a\r\nwork has had its copyright restored by the statute. Gard,\r\nIn the Trenches with \u00a7104A: An Evaluation of the Parties\u2019\r\nArguments in Golan v. Holder as It Heads to the Supreme\r\nCourt, 64 Vand. L. Rev.

In doing so, it reverses\r\nthe payment expectations of those who used, or intended\r\nto use, works that they thought belonged to them. Were\r\nCongress to act similarly with respect to well-established\r\nproperty rights, the problem would be obvious. This stat\u00ad\r\nute analogously restricts, and thereby diminishes, Ameri\u00ad\r\ncans\u2019 preexisting freedom to use formerly public domain\r\nmaterial in their expressive activities.\r\n   Thus, while the majority correctly observes that the\r\ndissemination-restricting harms of copyright normally\r\npresent problems appropriate for legislation to resolve,\r\nante, at 31\u201332, the question is whether the Copyright\r\nClause permits Congress seriously to exacerbate such a\r\nproblem by taking works out of the public domain without\r\na countervailing benefit. This question is appropriate for\r\njudicial resolution. Indeed, unlike Eldred where the Court\r\nhad to decide a complicated line-drawing question\u2014when\r\nis a copyright term too long?\u2014here an easily administra\u00ad\r\nble standard is available\u2014a standard that would require\r\nworks that have already fallen into the public domain to\r\nstay there.\r\n   The several, just mentioned features of the present\r\nstatute are important, for they distinguish it from other\r\ncopyright laws. By removing material from the public\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndomain, the statute, in literal terms, \u201cabridges\u201d a preexist\u00ad\r\ning freedom to speak. In practical terms, members of the\r\npublic might well have decided what to say, as well as\r\nwhen and how to say it, in part by reviewing with a view\r\nto repeating, expression that they reasonably believed\r\nwas, or would be, freely available. Given these speech\r\nimplications, it is not surprising that Congress has long\r\nsought to protect public domain material when revising\r\nthe copyright laws. See infra, at 19 (listing instances).\r\nAnd this Court has assumed the particular importance of\r\npublic domain material in roughly analogous circumstanc\u00ad\r\nes. See Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 (\u201cCongress may not au\u00ad\r\nthorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove\r\nexistent knowledge from the public domain\u201d); Kewanee Oil\r\nCo. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 484 (1974) (trade secret\r\nprotection is not incompatible with \u201cpolicy that matter\r\nonce in the public domain must remain in the public do\u00ad\r\nmain\u201d); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,\r\n496 (1975) (First Amendment prohibits sanctioning press\r\nfor publishing material disclosed in public court docu\u00ad\r\nments); see also Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox\r\nFilm Corp., 539 U. S. 23, 33 (2003) (\u201cThe right to copy . . .\r\nonce a copyright has expired . . . passes to the public\u201d\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n   Moreover, whereas forward-looking copyright laws tend\r\nto benefit those whose identities are not yet known (the\r\nwriter who has not yet written a book, the musician who\r\nhas not yet composed a song), when a copyright law is\r\nprimarily backward looking the risk is greater that Con\u00ad\r\ngress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense\r\nof badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to\r\nargue and present their case to Congress. In Eldred, I\r\nthought this problem was severe. See generally 537 U. S.,\r\nat 243\u2013266 (dissenting opinion). And in light of the fact\r\nthat Congress, with one minor exception, heard testimony\r\nonly from the representatives of existing copyright hold\u00ad\r\n16                   GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ners, who hoped that passage of the statute would enable\r\nthem to benefit from reciprocal treatment of American\r\nauthors abroad, infra, at 21, I cannot say that even here\r\nthe problem, while much diminished, was nonexistent.\r\n   I agree with the majority that, in doing so, this statute\r\ndoes not discriminate among speakers based on their\r\nviewpoints or subject matter. Ante, at 27. But such con\u00ad\r\nsiderations do not exhaust potential First Amendment\r\nproblems. Cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 8) (finding First Amendment prob\u00ad\r\nlem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from\r\nusing publicly available prescriber-identifying information\r\nin their marketing efforts in part because it \u201cdisfavor[ed]\r\nspecific speakers\u201d); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.\r\nFCC, 512 U. S. 622, 659 (1994) (\u201cRegulations that discrim\u00ad\r\ninate among media, or among different speakers within a\r\nsingle medium, often present serious First Amendment\r\nconcerns\u201d).\r\n   Taken together, these speech-related harms (e.g., re\u00ad\r\nstricting use of previously available material; reversing\r\npayment expectations; rewarding rent-seekers at the\r\npublic\u2019s expense) at least show the presence of a First\r\nAmendment interest. And that is enough. For present\r\npurposes, I need not decide whether the harms to that\r\ninterest show a violation of the First Amendment. I need\r\nonly point to the importance of interpreting the Constitu\u00ad\r\ntion as a single document\u2014a document that we should not\r\nread as setting the Copyright Clause and the First\r\nAmendment at cross-purposes. Nor need I advocate the\r\napplication here of strict or specially heightened review. I\r\nneed only find that the First Amendment interest is im\u00ad\r\nportant enough to require courts to scrutinize with some\r\ncare the reasons claimed to justify the Act in order to\r\ndetermine whether they constitute reasonable copyright\u00ad\r\nrelated justifications for the serious harms, including\r\nspeech-related harms, which the Act seems likely to\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The statute\r\ngrants its \u201crestored copyright[s]\u201d only to works already\r\nproduced. It provides no monetary incentive to produce\r\nanything new. Unlike other American copyright statutes\r\nfrom the time of the Founders onwards, including the\r\nstatute at issue in Eldred, it lacks any significant copy\u00ad\r\nright-related quid pro quo.\r\n   The majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by refer\u00ad\r\nring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests\r\nthat Congress may provide new or increased protection\r\nboth to newly created and to previously created, works.\r\nAnte, at 16, 18; Act of May 31, 1790, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 124 (con\u00ad\r\nferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as\r\nold); Act of July 3, 1832, \u00a73, 4 Stat. 559 (authorizing new\r\npatents for past and future inventors who inadvertently\r\nfailed to comply with applicable statutory formalities);\r\nMcClurg v.

I do not dispute that copyright power. Insofar as such\r\na statute does the former, i.e., extends protection to newly\r\ncreated material, it embodies copyright\u2019s traditional justi\u00ad\r\nfication\u2014eliciting new production. And I do not doubt\r\nthat Congress may then also include existing works within\r\nthe scope of, say, increased protection for equitable and\r\nadministrative reasons. See Eldred, 537 U. S. at 204,\r\n18                    GOLAN v.

The statute before us, however, does not directly\r\nelicit any new production. Compare id., at 204\u2013208; (ma\u00ad\r\njority opinion) (noting that statute\u2019s extended term would\r\napply to newly created material, and finding that the\r\ndetermination of the likelihood of its eliciting new produc\u00ad\r\ntion in practice was a matter for Congress to determine),\r\nwith id., at 243\u2013267 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (expressing\r\nthe view that there is little likelihood, in practice, that the\r\nstatute would elicit new material).

It\r\nconsists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation pre\u00ad\r\nventing the withdrawal of works from the public domain.\r\nSee, e.g., Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988,\r\n\u00a712, 102 Stat. 2860 (the Act \u201cdoes not provide copyright\r\nprotection for any work that is in the public domain in the\r\nUnited States\u201d); Copyright Act of 1976, Tit.

First, it\r\nargues that the Clause does not require the \u201ccreation of at\r\nleast one new work,\u201d ante, at 20, but may instead \u201cpromote\r\nthe Progress of Science\u201d in other ways. And it specifically\r\nmentions the \u201cdissemination of existing and future works\u201d\r\nas determinative here. Ante, at 20\u201323, and n. 25. The\r\nindustry experts to whom the majority refers argue that\r\n20                   GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncopyright protection of already existing works can help,\r\nsay, music publishers or film distributers raise prices,\r\nproduce extra profits and consequently lead them to pub\u00ad\r\nlish or distribute works they might otherwise have ig\u00ad\r\nnored. But ordinarily a copyright\u2014since it is a monopoly\r\non copying\u2014restricts dissemination of a work once pro\u00ad\r\nduced compared to a competitive market. And simply\r\nmaking the industry richer does not mean that the indus\u00ad\r\ntry, when it makes an ordinary forward-looking economic\r\ncalculus, will distribute works not previously distributed.\r\nThe industry experts might mean that temporary extra\r\nprofits will lead them to invest in the development of a\r\nmarket, say, by advertising. But this kind of argument,\r\nwhich can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods,\r\nranging from kiwi fruit to Swedish furniture, has little\r\nif anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial\r\ncreation, which is the special concern of copyright protec\u00ad\r\ntion. See supra, at 2\u20133.\r\n   Moreover, the argument proves too much. It is the kind\r\nof argument that the Stationers\u2019 Company might well\r\nhave made and which the British Parliament rejected. Cf.\r\nPatterson 154\u2013155 (describing failed booksellers\u2019 bill\r\nseeking protection from foreign competition through an\r\nextension of the copyright term). It is the kind of argu\u00ad\r\nment that could justify a legislature\u2019s withdrawing from\r\nthe public domain the works, say, of Hawthorne or of Swift\r\nor for that matter the King James Bible in order to en\u00ad\r\ncourage further publication of those works; and, it could\r\neven more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser\r\nknown early works, perhaps those of the Venerable Bede.\r\nThe Court has not, to my knowledge, previously accepted\r\nsuch a rationale\u2014a rationale well removed from the spe\u00ad\r\ncial economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeat\u00ad\r\nable costs of the initial creation of a \u201cWriting.\u201d Supra, at\r\n2. And I fear that doing so would read the Copyright\r\nClause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

(With one minor exception only those\r\nrepresentatives appeared, see generally Joint Hearing; the\r\nCopyright Office did not testify, id., at 239.) Rather, they\r\nfocused on the Berne Convention itself. By that time,\r\nCongress had already protected all new works of Berne\r\nmembers. But it had not provided additional protection to\r\npreexisting foreign works that were then in the American\r\npublic domain. Industry witnesses testified that with\u00ad\r\ndrawing such works from the American public domain\r\nwould permit foreign copyright owners to charge American\r\nconsumers more for their products; and that, as a result,\r\nthe United States would be able to persuade foreign coun\u00ad\r\ntries to allow American holders of preexisting copyrights\r\nto charge foreign customers more money for their prod\u00ad\r\nucts. See id., at 241 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive\r\nDirector and General Counsel, International Intellectual\r\nProperty Alliance) (\u201c[F]ailure to [comply with Article 18]\r\nwill . . . undermine the ability of the United States to press\r\nother countries to implement the same sort of protection in\r\ntheir implementing legislation currently pending in many\r\nlegislatures around the globe\u201d); id., at 253 (statement of\r\nMatt Gerson, Vice President for Congressional Affairs,\r\nMotion Picture Assn. of America) (similar). See also id., at\r\n85 (statement of Xavier Becerra, House Judiciary Commit\u00ad\r\ntee member) (\u201c[R]etroactivity . . . is probably the best way\r\nto ensure that some of our older American works, any\u00ad\r\nthing from Motown, to \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 to \u2018The Hardy Boys\u2019 get\r\nthe protection in some of these emerging foreign markets.\r\nIt is important to ensure that countries no longer use our\r\nU. S. law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copy\u00ad\r\nright protections to some of our own works\u201d). But see\r\nid., at 272\u2013279 (statement of Larry Urbanski, Chairman\r\nof the Fairness in Copyright Coalition and President of\r\n22                   GOLAN v.

(testifying against restoration on grounds\r\nsimilar to those set out, supra, at 10\u201313).\r\n   This argument, whatever its intrinsic merits, is an ar\u00ad\r\ngument that directly concerns a private benefit: how to\r\nobtain more money from the sales of existing products. It\r\nis not an argument about a public benefit, such as how to\r\npromote or to protect the creative process.\r\n   Third, the majority points out that the statute \u201cgives\r\n[authors] nothing more than the benefit of their labors\r\nduring whatever time remains before the normal copyright\r\nterm expires.\u201d Ante, at 30. But insofar as it suggests that\r\ncopyright should in general help authors obtain greater\r\nmonetary rewards than needed to elicit new works, it rests\r\nupon primarily European, but not American, copyright\r\nconcepts. See supra, at 5\u20136.\r\n   Fourth, the majority argues that this statutory provi\u00ad\r\nsion is necessary to fulfill our Berne Convention obliga\u00ad\r\ntions. Ante, at 4\u20138. The Treaty, in Article 18, says that\r\nthe \u201cConvention shall apply to all works which, at the\r\nmoment of its coming into force [i.e., 1989 in the case of\r\nthe United States] have not yet fallen into the public\r\ndomain in the country of origin through the expiry of the\r\nterm of protection.\u201d Berne Convention for the Protection\r\nof Literary and Artistic Works, Art. 18(1), Sept. 9, 1886, as\r\nrevised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, 828 U. N. T. S. 221,\r\n251. The majority and Government say that this means\r\nwe must protect the foreign works at issue here. And\r\nsince the Berne Convention, taken as a whole, provides\r\nincentives for the creation of new works, I am willing to\r\nspeculate, for argument\u2019s sake, that the statute might\r\nindirectly encourage production of new works by making\r\nthe United States\u2019 place in the international copyright\r\nregime more secure.\r\n   Still, I cannot find this argument sufficient to save the\r\nstatute. For one thing, this is a dilemma of the Govern\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s own making. The United States obtained the\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

But in 1994, the\r\nUnited States and other nations signed the Agreement on\r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,\r\nwhich enabled signatories to use World Trade Organiza\u00ad\r\ntion dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about\r\nother members\u2019 Berne Convention violations. And at that\r\ntime the Government, although it successfully secured\r\nreservations protecting other special features of American\r\ncopyright law, made no effort to secure a reservation\r\npermitting the United States to keep some or all restored\r\nworks in the American public domain. Indeed, it made no\r\neffort to do so despite the fact that Article 18 explicitly\r\nauthorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the Arti\u00ad\r\ncle\u2019s retroactivity principle. See Art. 18(3), ibid. (\u201cThe\r\napplication of [the retroactivity] principle shall be subject\r\nto any provisions contained in special conventions to that\r\neffect existing or to be concluded between countries of the\r\nUnion\u201d (emphasis added)); Gervais, Golan v. Holder: A\r\nLook at the Constraints Imposed by the Berne Conven\u00ad\r\ntion, 64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 147, 151\u2013152 (2011); Gard,\r\n64 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc, at 206.\r\n   For another thing, the Convention does not require\r\nCongress to enact a statute that causes so much damage\r\nto public domain material. Article 18(3) also states that\r\n\u201cthe respective countries shall determine, each in so far as\r\nit is concerned, the conditions of application of this princi-\r\nple.\u201d 18 U. N. T. S., at 251 (emphasis added). Congress\r\ncould have alleviated many of the costs that the statute\r\nimposes by, for example, creating forms of compulsory\r\nlicensing, requiring \u201crestored copyright\u201d holders to provide\r\nnecessary administrative information as a condition of\r\nprotection, or insisting upon \u201creasonable royalties.\u201d Cf.\r\nS. 2913, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008) (legislation that\r\nwould have limited judicial remedies against users of\r\norphan works); H. R. 5889, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008)\r\n24                    GOLAN v. HOLDER\r\n\r\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n(House version of same); American Society of Compos-\r\ners, Authors and Publishers, http://www.ascap.com/\r\nlicensing/termsdefined.aspx (society of music copyright\r\nowners offering blanket licenses that give users the unlim\u00ad\r\nited right to perform any of its members\u2019 songs for a fixed\r\nfee, thus reducing negotiation and enforcement costs).\r\n   To say this is not to criticize the Convention or our\r\njoining it. Rather, it is to argue that the other branches of\r\nGovernment should have tried to follow the Convention\r\nand in particular its provisions offering compliance flexi\u00ad\r\nbility. The fact that the statute has significant First\r\nAmendment costs is relevant in this respect, for that\r\nAmendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less\r\nrestrictive, alternative possibilities. Doing so here, reveals\r\nthat neither Congress nor the Executive took advantage of\r\nless-restrictive methods of compliance that the Convention\r\nitself provides. And that fact means that the Convention\r\ncannot provide the statute with a constitutionally suffi\u00ad\r\ncient justification that is otherwise lacking.\r\n                              III\r\n   The fact that, by withdrawing material from the public\r\ndomain, the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow\r\nof information is sufficient, when combined with the other\r\nfeatures of the statute that I have discussed, to convince\r\nme that the Copyright Clause, interpreted in the light of\r\nthe First Amendment, does not authorize Congress to\r\nenact this statute.\r\n   I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\r\nconclusion.\r\n</pre>",
