That\ngrowth required the State to redraw its electoral districts\nfor the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the\nState House of Representatives, in order to comply with\nthe Constitution\u2019s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia\nv. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2 (2003). The State also\nhad to create new districts for the four additional congres-\n2                           PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nsional seats it received.\n   Texas is a \u201ccovered jurisdiction\u201d under Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. See 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends\nall changes to a covered jurisdiction\u2019s election procedures,\nincluding district lines, until those changes are submitted\nto and approved by a three-judge United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney Gen-\neral. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 198 (2009). This process,\nknown as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction\nto demonstrate that its proposed change \u201cneither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.\u201d \u00a71973c(a).\nThis Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map\ncannot be used to conduct an election until it has been\nprecleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652\n(1991).\n   The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas\nsubmitted them to the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance\nprocess remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its\nbid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the\ncoming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs\u2014appellees\nhere\u2014brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State\u2019s\nnewly enacted plans violate the United States Constitu-\ntion and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,\ninter alia, that Texas\u2019 enacted plans discriminate against\nLatinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting\nstrength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and\nAfrican-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas\u2019\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section\n            2 prohibits \u201cany State or political subdivision\u201d from impos-\ning any electoral practice \u201cwhich results in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d 42 U.

A three-judge panel of the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72284. That court\nheard argument and held a trial with respect to the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution\nof the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch\nv. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283\u2013285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   As Texas\u2019 2012 primaries approached, it became increas-\ningly likely that the State\u2019s newly enacted plans would not\nreceive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And\nthe State\u2019s old district lines could not be used, because\npopulation growth had rendered them inconsistent with\nthe Constitution\u2019s one-person, one-vote requirement. It\nthus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim\nplans for the State\u2019s 2012 primaries and elections. See\nConnor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414\u2013415 (1977). After\nreceiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive\nhearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court\nunanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but\nJudge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional\nand State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the\ninterim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were\nunnecessarily inconsistent with the State\u2019s enacted plans.\nThis Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdic-\ntion. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n   Redistricting is \u201cprimarily the duty and responsibility\nof the State.\u201d Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).\nThe failure of a State\u2019s newly enacted plan to gain pre-\nclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by\nitself, require a court to take up the state legislature\u2019s task.\nThat is because, in most circumstances, the State\u2019s last\nenacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan\nreceives preclearance. But if an intervening event\u2014most\ncommonly, as here, a census\u2014renders the current plan\nunusable, a court must undertake the \u201cunwelcome obliga-\n4                      PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntion\u201d of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at 415.\nEven then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient\nstructure to the court\u2019s endeavor. Where shifts in a\nState\u2019s population have been relatively small, a court may\nneed to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the\nState\u2019s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.\n   But here the scale of Texas\u2019 population growth appears\nto require sweeping changes to the State\u2019s current dis-\ntricts. In areas where population shifts are so large that\nno semblance of the existing plan\u2019s district lines can be\nused, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an\ninterim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in\nadding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no\nsuggestion as to where those new districts should be\nplaced. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of\ndefining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistrict-\ning ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have\nbeen weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the\nexercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915\u2013916 (1995); White v. Weiser,\n412 U. S. 783, 795\u2013796 (1973). Thus, if the old state dis-\ntricts were the only source to which a district court could\nlook, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judg-\nments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.\n   To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise stand-\nardless decisions, a district court should take guidance\nfrom the State\u2019s recently enacted plan in drafting an\ninterim plan. That plan reflects the State\u2019s policy judg-\nments on where to place new districts and how to shift\nexisting ones in response to massive population growth.\nThis Court has observed before that \u201cfaced with the neces-\nsity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a\ngeneral rule, should be guided by the legislative policies\nunderlying\u201d a state plan\u2014even one that was itself unen-\nforceable\u2014\u201cto the extent those policies do not lead to\nviolations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nAbrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 79 (1997) (holding that\nthe District Court properly declined to defer to a pre-\ncleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For\nexample, in White, supra, an equal population challenge,\nthis Court reversed a District Court\u2019s choice of interim\nplan, and required the District Court to choose a plan\nmore closely resembling an enacted state plan, even\nthough the state plan itself had been held to violate the\none-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v.\nSeamon, although the state plan as a whole had been\ndenied \u00a75 preclearance, this Court directed a District\nCourt to \u201cdefer to the legislative judgments the [state]\nplans reflect,\u201d insofar as they involved districts found to\nmeet the preclearance standard. 456 U. S. 37, 40\u201341\n(1982) (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403\nU. S. 124, 160\u2013161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).\n   Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented\nif it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that\nthe plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it\nreflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an\ninterim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a\nstarting point for the district court. It provides important\nguidance that helps ensure that the district court appro-\npriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that\ncomply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act,\nwithout displacing legitimate state policy judgments with\nthe court\u2019s own preferences.\n   A district court making such use of a State\u2019s plan must,\nof course, take care not to incorporate into the interim\nplan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams,\nsupra, at 85\u201386; White, supra, at 797. Where a State\u2019s\nplan faces challenges under the Constitution or \u00a72 of the\nVoting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by\nthat plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are\nshown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plain-\ntiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must\n6                     PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nnormally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on\nthe merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20\n(2008). There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat\nthe policies behind a State\u2019s redistricting legislation\nshould not also have to meet that standard. And because\nthe local district court\u2014here, the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas\u2014will ultimately decide the\nmerits of claims under \u00a72 and the Constitution, it is well\nequipped to apply that familiar standard.\n   The calculus with respect to \u00a75 challenges is somewhat\ndifferent. Where a State has sought preclearance in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, \u00a75 allows only\nthat court to determine whether the state plan complies\nwith \u00a75. Consistent with that design, we have made clear\nthat other district courts may not address the merits of \u00a75\nchallenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,\n385 (1971). The local district court drafting an interim\nplan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits\nof the preclearance proceedings. The court should pre-\nsume neither that a State\u2019s effort to preclear its plan will\nsucceed nor that it will fail.\n   The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance\nis satisfied by taking guidance from a State\u2019s policy judg-\nments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that\nstand a reasonable probability of failing to gain \u00a75 pre-\nclearance. And by \u201creasonable probability\u201d this Court\nmeans in this context that the \u00a75 challenge is not insub-\nstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not\ndeprived of important guidance provided by a state plan\ndue to \u00a75 challenges that have no reasonable probability of\nsuccess but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative\nof those responsible for the preclearance determination.\nAnd the reasonable probability standard adequately bal-\nances the unique preclearance scheme with the State\u2019s\nsovereignty and a district court\u2019s need for policy guidance\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nin constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted\nthe \u201cserious constitutional questions\u201d raised by \u00a75\u2019s intru-\nsion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at\n204. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if \u00a75\nrequired a district court to wholly ignore the State\u2019s poli-\ncies in drawing maps that will govern a State\u2019s elections,\nwithout any reason to believe those state policies are\nunlawful.\n  Appellees, however, contend that \u00a75 demands exactly\nthat. In their view, this Court\u2019s precedents require district\ncourts to ignore any state plan that has not received \u00a75\npreclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely\nhold only that a district court may not adopt an unpre-\ncleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County,\n519 U. S. 9 (1996); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130\n(1981). They say nothing about whether a district court\nmay take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in\nsuch a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in\nUpham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the\nunobjectionable aspects of a State\u2019s plan even though that\nplan had already been denied preclearance.\n  In this case, the District Court stated that it had\n\u201cgiv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the\nLegislature\u2019s enacted map as possible.\u201d 1 App. 182. At\nthe same time, however, the court said that it was re-\nquired to draw an \u201cindependent map\u201d following \u201cneutral\nprinciples that advance the interest of the collective public\ngood.\u201d Id., at 169\u2013170. In the court\u2019s view, it \u201cwas not\nrequired to give any deference to the Legislature\u2019s enacted\nplan,\u201d and it instead applied principles that it determined\n\u201cplace the interests of the citizens of Texas first.\u201d Id., at\n171. To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission\nto draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution\nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept\nof \u201cthe collective public good\u201d for the Texas Legislature\u2019s\ndetermination of which policies serve \u201cthe interests of the\n8                         PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\ncitizens of Texas,\u201d the court erred.\n   In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map \u201cwith-\nout regard to political considerations,\u201d the District Court\nrelied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001\nU. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)\n(per curiam), summarily aff\u2019d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1\nApp. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted\nstate plan to which the District Court could turn. Without\nthe benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly\nlegislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was per-\nhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own\nnotion of the public good. Because the District Court here\nhad the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the\ncourt had neither the need nor the license to cast aside\nthat vital aid.\n   Some specific aspects of the District Court\u2019s plans seem\nto pay adequate attention to the State\u2019s policies, others do\nnot, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For exam-\nple, in drawing State House districts in North and East\nTexas, the District Court closely followed the State\u2019s poli-\ncies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25\u201326. Although Texas\u2019\nentire State House plan is challenged in the \u00a75 proceed-\nings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the\ndistrict lines in North and East Texas have a discrimina-\ntory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court\nwas thus correct to take guidance from the State\u2019s plan in\ndrawing the interim map for those regions. But the court\nthen altered those districts to achieve de minimis popula-\ntion variations\u2014even though there was no claim that the\npopulation variations in those districts were unlawful.\nId., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in\nthis respect in the State\u2019s plan, the District Court had no\nbasis to modify that plan.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher\n\nstandard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting\nprecincts (called \u201cvoter tabulation districts\u201d in Texas) in\ndrawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102\u2013103. That\nchoice alone prevented the District Court from following\nthe lead of Texas\u2019 enacted plan\u2014which freely splits pre-\ncincts\u2014in many areas where there were no legal chal-\nlenges to the plan\u2019s details. See id., at 102\u2013103, 116, n. 24.\nThe District Court was apparently motivated by a well-\nintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of\nreconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court\u2019s\ninterim plan could be implemented in time for the upcom-\ning election. Id., at 90, 102\u2013103, 109. But the State\u2019s plan\naccepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accom-\nplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting\nprecincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n\u00a742.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the\nburden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so\nis otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court\nto ignore the State\u2019s decision. Of course, in this case it\nmay well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light\nof the exigencies caused by the impending election.\n   The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily\nignored the State\u2019s plans in drawing certain individual\ndistricts. For example, the District Court drew an interim\nDistrict 77 that resembles neither the State\u2019s newly enact-\ned plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010\ncensus. The court said that it did so in response to alleged\nconstitutional violations. 1 App. 174\u2013175. But the court\ndid not say that those allegations were plausible, much\nless likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a\nfinding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmaps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this\nCourt has also explained that those \u201cstricter standard[s]\u201d are not\ntriggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a\nState\u2019s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42\u2013\n43 (1982) (per curiam).\n10                    PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nreasonable probability of failing to gain \u00a75 preclearance,\nsee supra, at 6. Without such a determination, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no basis for drawing a district that does\nnot resemble any legislatively enacted plan.\n   The court\u2019s approach in drawing other districts was\nunclear. The interim plan\u2019s Congressional District 33, for\nexample, disregards aspects of the State\u2019s plan that ap-\npear to be subject to strong challenges in the \u00a75 proceed-\ning. See 3 id., at 600\u2013601; 5 id., at 12\u201314. That much\nseems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with\nthe path the District Court followed from there. The\ncourt\u2019s order suggests that it may have intentionally\ndrawn District 33 as a \u201cminority coalition opportunity\ndistrict\u201d in which the court expected two different minority\ngroups to band together to form an electoral majority.\n1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this\npoint\u2014some portions suggest that the court deliberately\ndesigned such a district, other parts suggest that it drew\nthe district solely as a response to population growth in\nthe area. Compare id., at 146\u2013147 (\u201cBecause much of the\ngrowth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex\nwas attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was\ndrawn as a minority coalition opportunity district\u201d), with\nid., at 144 (\u201cThe Court has nowhere expressly sought to\nincrease the performance of any opportunity district above\nbenchmark\u201d). If the District Court did set out to create a\nminority coalition district, rather than drawing a district\nthat simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for\ndoing so. Cf. Bartlett v.

That\ngrowth required the State to redraw its electoral districts\nfor the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the\nState House of Representatives, in order to comply with\nthe Constitution\u2019s one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia\nv. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n. 2 (2003). The State also\nhad to create new districts for the four additional congres-\n2                           PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nsional seats it received.\n   Texas is a \u201ccovered jurisdiction\u201d under Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965. See 79 Stat. 439, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973c(a); 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2011). Section 5 suspends\nall changes to a covered jurisdiction\u2019s election procedures,\nincluding district lines, until those changes are submitted\nto and approved by a three-judge United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, or the Attorney Gen-\neral. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 198 (2009). This process,\nknown as preclearance, requires the covered jurisdiction\nto demonstrate that its proposed change \u201cneither has the\npurpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.\u201d \u00a71973c(a).\nThis Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map\ncannot be used to conduct an election until it has been\nprecleared. See, e.g., Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652\n(1991).\n   The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas\nsubmitted them to the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance\nprocess remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its\nbid for summary judgment, and a trial is scheduled in the\ncoming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs\u2014appellees\nhere\u2014brought suit in Texas, claiming that the State\u2019s\nnewly enacted plans violate the United States Constitu-\ntion and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act.1 Appellees alleged,\ninter alia, that Texas\u2019 enacted plans discriminate against\nLatinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting\nstrength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and\nAfrican-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas\u2019\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section\n            2 prohibits \u201cany State or political subdivision\u201d from impos-\ning any electoral practice \u201cwhich results in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d 42 U.

A three-judge panel of the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas was convened. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72284. That court\nheard argument and held a trial with respect to the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims, but withheld judgment pending resolution\nof the preclearance process in the D. C. court. Cf. Branch\nv. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 283\u2013285 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring).\n   As Texas\u2019 2012 primaries approached, it became increas-\ningly likely that the State\u2019s newly enacted plans would not\nreceive preclearance in time for the 2012 elections. And\nthe State\u2019s old district lines could not be used, because\npopulation growth had rendered them inconsistent with\nthe Constitution\u2019s one-person, one-vote requirement. It\nthus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim\nplans for the State\u2019s 2012 primaries and elections. See\nConnor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 414\u2013415 (1977). After\nreceiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive\nhearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court\nunanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but\nJudge Smith dissented with respect to the congressional\nand State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the\ninterim plans pending an appeal, arguing that they were\nunnecessarily inconsistent with the State\u2019s enacted plans.\nThis Court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdic-\ntion. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n   Redistricting is \u201cprimarily the duty and responsibility\nof the State.\u201d Chapman v. Meier, 420 U. S. 1, 27 (1975).\nThe failure of a State\u2019s newly enacted plan to gain pre-\nclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by\nitself, require a court to take up the state legislature\u2019s task.\nThat is because, in most circumstances, the State\u2019s last\nenacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan\nreceives preclearance. But if an intervening event\u2014most\ncommonly, as here, a census\u2014renders the current plan\nunusable, a court must undertake the \u201cunwelcome obliga-\n4                      PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntion\u201d of creating an interim plan. Connor, supra, at 415.\nEven then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient\nstructure to the court\u2019s endeavor. Where shifts in a\nState\u2019s population have been relatively small, a court may\nneed to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the\nState\u2019s existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.\n   But here the scale of Texas\u2019 population growth appears\nto require sweeping changes to the State\u2019s current dis-\ntricts. In areas where population shifts are so large that\nno semblance of the existing plan\u2019s district lines can be\nused, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an\ninterim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in\nadding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no\nsuggestion as to where those new districts should be\nplaced. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of\ndefining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistrict-\ning ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have\nbeen weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the\nexercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915\u2013916 (1995); White v. Weiser,\n412 U. S. 783, 795\u2013796 (1973). Thus, if the old state dis-\ntricts were the only source to which a district court could\nlook, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judg-\nments for which courts are, at best, ill suited.\n   To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise stand-\nardless decisions, a district court should take guidance\nfrom the State\u2019s recently enacted plan in drafting an\ninterim plan. That plan reflects the State\u2019s policy judg-\nments on where to place new districts and how to shift\nexisting ones in response to massive population growth.\nThis Court has observed before that \u201cfaced with the neces-\nsity of drawing district lines by judicial order, a court, as a\ngeneral rule, should be guided by the legislative policies\nunderlying\u201d a state plan\u2014even one that was itself unen-\nforceable\u2014\u201cto the extent those policies do not lead to\nviolations of the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nAbrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 79 (1997) (holding that\nthe District Court properly declined to defer to a pre-\ncleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For\nexample, in White, supra, an equal population challenge,\nthis Court reversed a District Court\u2019s choice of interim\nplan, and required the District Court to choose a plan\nmore closely resembling an enacted state plan, even\nthough the state plan itself had been held to violate the\none-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham v.\nSeamon, although the state plan as a whole had been\ndenied \u00a75 preclearance, this Court directed a District\nCourt to \u201cdefer to the legislative judgments the [state]\nplans reflect,\u201d insofar as they involved districts found to\nmeet the preclearance standard. 456 U. S. 37, 40\u201341\n(1982) (per curiam). See also Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403\nU. S. 124, 160\u2013161 (1971) (equal protection challenge).\n   Section 5 prevents a state plan from being implemented\nif it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that\nthe plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it\nreflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an\ninterim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a\nstarting point for the district court. It provides important\nguidance that helps ensure that the district court appro-\npriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that\ncomply with the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act,\nwithout displacing legitimate state policy judgments with\nthe court\u2019s own preferences.\n   A district court making such use of a State\u2019s plan must,\nof course, take care not to incorporate into the interim\nplan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams,\nsupra, at 85\u201386; White, supra, at 797. Where a State\u2019s\nplan faces challenges under the Constitution or \u00a72 of the\nVoting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by\nthat plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are\nshown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plain-\ntiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must\n6                     PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nnormally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on\nthe merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20\n(2008). There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat\nthe policies behind a State\u2019s redistricting legislation\nshould not also have to meet that standard. And because\nthe local district court\u2014here, the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas\u2014will ultimately decide the\nmerits of claims under \u00a72 and the Constitution, it is well\nequipped to apply that familiar standard.\n   The calculus with respect to \u00a75 challenges is somewhat\ndifferent. Where a State has sought preclearance in the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, \u00a75 allows only\nthat court to determine whether the state plan complies\nwith \u00a75. Consistent with that design, we have made clear\nthat other district courts may not address the merits of \u00a75\nchallenges. See, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,\n385 (1971). The local district court drafting an interim\nplan must therefore be careful not to prejudge the merits\nof the preclearance proceedings. The court should pre-\nsume neither that a State\u2019s effort to preclear its plan will\nsucceed nor that it will fail.\n   The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance\nis satisfied by taking guidance from a State\u2019s policy judg-\nments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that\nstand a reasonable probability of failing to gain \u00a75 pre-\nclearance. And by \u201creasonable probability\u201d this Court\nmeans in this context that the \u00a75 challenge is not insub-\nstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not\ndeprived of important guidance provided by a state plan\ndue to \u00a75 challenges that have no reasonable probability of\nsuccess but still respects the jurisdiction and prerogative\nof those responsible for the preclearance determination.\nAnd the reasonable probability standard adequately bal-\nances the unique preclearance scheme with the State\u2019s\nsovereignty and a district court\u2019s need for policy guidance\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nin constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted\nthe \u201cserious constitutional questions\u201d raised by \u00a75\u2019s intru-\nsion on state sovereignty. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at\n204. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if \u00a75\nrequired a district court to wholly ignore the State\u2019s poli-\ncies in drawing maps that will govern a State\u2019s elections,\nwithout any reason to believe those state policies are\nunlawful.\n  Appellees, however, contend that \u00a75 demands exactly\nthat. In their view, this Court\u2019s precedents require district\ncourts to ignore any state plan that has not received \u00a75\npreclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely\nhold only that a district court may not adopt an unpre-\ncleared plan as its own. See Lopez v. Monterey County,\n519 U. S. 9 (1996); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130\n(1981). They say nothing about whether a district court\nmay take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in\nsuch a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in\nUpham this Court ordered a District Court to defer to the\nunobjectionable aspects of a State\u2019s plan even though that\nplan had already been denied preclearance.\n  In this case, the District Court stated that it had\n\u201cgiv[en] effect to as much of the policy judgments in the\nLegislature\u2019s enacted map as possible.\u201d 1 App. 182. At\nthe same time, however, the court said that it was re-\nquired to draw an \u201cindependent map\u201d following \u201cneutral\nprinciples that advance the interest of the collective public\ngood.\u201d Id., at 169\u2013170. In the court\u2019s view, it \u201cwas not\nrequired to give any deference to the Legislature\u2019s enacted\nplan,\u201d and it instead applied principles that it determined\n\u201cplace the interests of the citizens of Texas first.\u201d Id., at\n171. To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission\nto draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution\nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept\nof \u201cthe collective public good\u201d for the Texas Legislature\u2019s\ndetermination of which policies serve \u201cthe interests of the\n8                         PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\ncitizens of Texas,\u201d the court erred.\n   In proclaiming its ability to draw an interim map \u201cwith-\nout regard to political considerations,\u201d the District Court\nrelied heavily on Balderas v. Texas, No. 6:01cv158, 2001\nU. S. Dist. LEXIS 25740 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001)\n(per curiam), summarily aff\u2019d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002). 1\nApp. 182. But in Balderas there was no recently enacted\nstate plan to which the District Court could turn. Without\nthe benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly\nlegislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was per-\nhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own\nnotion of the public good. Because the District Court here\nhad the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the\ncourt had neither the need nor the license to cast aside\nthat vital aid.\n   Some specific aspects of the District Court\u2019s plans seem\nto pay adequate attention to the State\u2019s policies, others do\nnot, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For exam-\nple, in drawing State House districts in North and East\nTexas, the District Court closely followed the State\u2019s poli-\ncies. See 1 App. 173; 5 id., at 25\u201326. Although Texas\u2019\nentire State House plan is challenged in the \u00a75 proceed-\nings, there is apparently no serious allegation that the\ndistrict lines in North and East Texas have a discrimina-\ntory intent or effect. 1 id., at 187, n. 4. The District Court\nwas thus correct to take guidance from the State\u2019s plan in\ndrawing the interim map for those regions. But the court\nthen altered those districts to achieve de minimis popula-\ntion variations\u2014even though there was no claim that the\npopulation variations in those districts were unlawful.\nId., at 171, and n. 8. In the absence of any legal flaw in\nthis respect in the State\u2019s plan, the District Court had no\nbasis to modify that plan.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher\n\nstandard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting\nprecincts (called \u201cvoter tabulation districts\u201d in Texas) in\ndrawing the interim plans. Id., at 90, 102\u2013103. That\nchoice alone prevented the District Court from following\nthe lead of Texas\u2019 enacted plan\u2014which freely splits pre-\ncincts\u2014in many areas where there were no legal chal-\nlenges to the plan\u2019s details. See id., at 102\u2013103, 116, n. 24.\nThe District Court was apparently motivated by a well-\nintentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of\nreconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court\u2019s\ninterim plan could be implemented in time for the upcom-\ning election. Id., at 90, 102\u2013103, 109. But the State\u2019s plan\naccepted the costs of splitting precincts in order to accom-\nplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting\nprecincts when redistricting. See Tex. Elec. Code Ann.\n\u00a742.032 (West 2010). If a State has chosen to accept the\nburden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so\nis otherwise lawful, there is no warrant for a district court\nto ignore the State\u2019s decision. Of course, in this case it\nmay well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light\nof the exigencies caused by the impending election.\n   The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily\nignored the State\u2019s plans in drawing certain individual\ndistricts. For example, the District Court drew an interim\nDistrict 77 that resembles neither the State\u2019s newly enact-\ned plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the 2010\ncensus. The court said that it did so in response to alleged\nconstitutional violations. 1 App. 174\u2013175. But the court\ndid not say that those allegations were plausible, much\nless likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a\nfinding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmaps. See, e.g., Abrams v. Johnson, 521 U. S. 74, 98 (1997). But this\nCourt has also explained that those \u201cstricter standard[s]\u201d are not\ntriggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a\nState\u2019s map into an interim map. Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 42\u2013\n43 (1982) (per curiam).\n10                    PERRY v.

Without such a determination, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no basis for drawing a district that does\nnot resemble any legislatively enacted plan.\n   The court\u2019s approach in drawing other districts was\nunclear. The interim plan\u2019s Congressional District 33, for\nexample, disregards aspects of the State\u2019s plan that ap-\npear to be subject to strong challenges in the \u00a75 proceed-\ning. See 3 id., at 600\u2013601; 5 id., at 12\u201314. That much\nseems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with\nthe path the District Court followed from there. The\ncourt\u2019s order suggests that it may have intentionally\ndrawn District 33 as a \u201cminority coalition opportunity\ndistrict\u201d in which the court expected two different minority\ngroups to band together to form an electoral majority.\n1 id., at 147. The order is somewhat ambiguous on this\npoint\u2014some portions suggest that the court deliberately\ndesigned such a district, other parts suggest that it drew\nthe district solely as a response to population growth in\nthe area. Compare id., at 146\u2013147 (\u201cBecause much of the\ngrowth that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex\nwas attributable to minorities, the new district 33 was\ndrawn as a minority coalition opportunity district\u201d), with\nid., at 144 (\u201cThe Court has nowhere expressly sought to\nincrease the performance of any opportunity district above\nbenchmark\u201d). If the District Court did set out to create a\nminority coalition district, rather than drawing a district\nthat simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for\ndoing so. Cf. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13\u201315\n(2009) (plurality opinion).\n   Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas followed the appropriate stand-\nards in drawing interim maps for the 2012 Texas elec-\ntions, the orders implementing those maps are vacated,\nand the cases are remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n              Cite as: 565 U.

In my view, Texas\u2019 failure to timely obtain\n\u00a75 preclearance of its new plans is no obstacle to their\nimplementation, because, as I have previously explained,\n\u00a75 is unconstitutional. See Northwest Austin Municipal\nUtil. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 212 (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent-\ning in part). Although Texas\u2019 new plans are being chal-\n2                     PERRY v. PEREZ\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlenged on the grounds that they violate the Federal Con-\nstitution and \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act, they have not\nyet been found to violate any law. Accordingly, Texas\u2019\nduly enacted redistricting plans should govern the upcom-\ning elections. I would therefore vacate the interim orders\nand remand for the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Texas to consider appellees\u2019 constitu-\ntional and \u00a72 challenges in the ordinary course.\n</pre>",
