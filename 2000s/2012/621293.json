Argued November 9, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012\nThe Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U. S. C. §601 et seq., regu-\n  lates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure the\n  safety of meat and the humane handling of animals. The Depart-\n  ment of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),\n  which administers the FMIA, has issued extensive regulations to\n  govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of\n  slaughterhouses’ operations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq.\n  The FSIS inspection procedure begins with an “ante-mortem” inspec-\n  tion of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse. If, at that inspec-\n  tion, a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly\n  severe disease or condition, it must be classified as “U. S. Con-\n  demned” and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food\n  is produced. §§309.3, 311.1 et seq. Nonambulatory animals that are\n  not condemned are classified as “U. S. Suspect.” §309.2(b). They are\n  set apart, specially monitored, and “slaughtered separately from oth-\n  er livestock.” §309.2(n). Following slaughter, an inspector decides at\n  a “post-mortem” examination which parts, if any, of the suspect ani-\n  mal’s carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts.\n  310, 311. FSIS regulations additionally prescribe methods for han-\n  dling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process, 9\n  CFR pt. 313, including specific provisions for the humane treatment\n  of nonambulatory animals, 9 CFR 313.2(d).\n     The FMIA’s preemption clause, §678, precludes states from impos-\n  ing requirements that are “within the scope” of the FMIA, relate to\n  slaughterhouse “premises, facilities and operations,” and are “in ad-\n  dition to, or different than those made under” the FMIA. In 2008,\n  California amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse\n2                 NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    shall “buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal”; “process, butch-\n    er, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human\n    consumption”; or “hold a nonambulatory animal without taking im-\n    mediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.” §§599f(a)–(c).\n    Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA), a trade association rep-\n    resenting meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of\n    §599f against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the FMIA\n    preempts application of the state law. The District Court agreed, and\n    granted the NMA a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit re-\n    versed, holding that §599f is not preempted because it regulates only\n    “the kind of animal that may be slaughtered,” not the inspection or\n    slaughtering process itself.\nHeld: The FMIA expressly preempts §599f’s application against federal-\n ly inspected swine slaughterhouses. Pp. 6−14.\n    (a) The FMIA’s preemption clause sweeps widely, and so blocks the\n applications of §599f challenged here. The clause prevents a State\n from imposing any additional or different―even if nonconflict-\n ing―requirements that fall within the FMIA’s scope and concern\n slaughterhouse facilities or operations. Section 599f imposes addi-\n tional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses: Where\n under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in\n handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse\n must take another. For example, when a pig becomes injured and\n thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse,\n §599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” the pig without\n immediately euthanizing it; and §599f(b) prohibits the slaughter-\n house from “process[ing]” or “butcher[ing]” the animal to make food.\n By contrast, the FMIA and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to\n hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory animal that has not\n been condemned, and to process and butcher such an animal’s meat,\n subject to an FSIS official’s approval at post-mortem inspection. Sim-\n ilarly, when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, §599f(a)\n prohibits a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or “buy[ing]” the pig.\n But the FMIA and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to\n purchase nonambulatory pigs. See 21 U. S. C. §644; 9 CFR\n §325.20(c). And the FSIS inspection regime clearly contemplates\n that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals. So §599f\n substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the FMIA prescribes.\n    Respondent Humane Society argues that §599f(a)’s ban on pur-\n chasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would\n not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse\n premises. But the record does not disclose whether §599f(a) ever ap-\n plies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application\n of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse’s operations. Moreover,\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow\n  that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIA’s\n  preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse “premises, fa-\n  cilities and operations.” And while the Humane Society is correct\n  that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activ-\n  ities, §599f’s sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must\n  handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises. Its effect is to make\n  sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the pro-\n  duction process. It is therefore preempted by the FMIA. Pp. 6−10.\n     (b) Also rejected is the broad argument that §599f’s challenged pro-\n  visions fall outside the FMIA’s scope because they exclude a class of\n  animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only\n  to “animals that are going to be turned into meat.” In fact, the FMIA\n  regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be\n  turned into meat. For example, the Act’s implementing regulations\n  exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g.,\n  swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR §309.5(a). The argument that §599f’s\n  exclusion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to ensure\n  the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunder-\n  stands the FMIA’s scope. The FMIA addresses not just food safety,\n  but humane treatment, as well. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §§603, 610(b).\n  Pp. 11−14.\n599 F. 3d 1093, reversed and remanded.\n\n  KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 565 U.

S. C. §601 et seq., regulates the inspection, handling,\nand slaughter of livestock for human consumption. We\nconsider here whether the FMIA expressly preempts a\nCalifornia law dictating what slaughterhouses must do\nwith pigs that cannot walk, known in the trade as nonam-\nbulatory pigs. We hold that the FMIA forecloses the chal-\nlenged applications of the state statute.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The FMIA regulates a broad range of activities at\nslaughterhouses to ensure both the safety of meat and the\nhumane handling of animals.1 First enacted in 1906, after\n——————\n  1 The FMIA applies to all slaughterhouses producing meat for in-\n\nterstate and foreign commerce. See 21 U. S. C. §§601(h), 603(a). The\nFMIA also regulates slaughterhouses serving an exclusively intrastate\nmarket in any State that does not administer an inspection system\nwith “requirements at least equal to those” of the Act. §661(c)(1).\nBecause California has chosen not to adopt such an inspection program,\n2              NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v.

Totten, 248 U. S. 1,\n4–5 (1918). And since amended in 1978, see 92 Stat. 1069,\nthe FMIA requires all slaughterhouses to comply with the\nstandards for humane handling and slaughter of animals\nset out in the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958,\n(HMSA), 72 Stat. 862, 7 U. S. C. §1901 et seq., which\noriginally applied only to slaughterhouses selling meat to\nthe Federal Government.\n  The Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and In-\nspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility for administer-\ning the FMIA to promote its dual goals of safe meat and\nhumane slaughter. Over the years, the FSIS has issued\nextensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals\nand meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses’\noperations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq. (2011).\nThe FSIS employs about 9,000 inspectors, veterinarians,\nand investigators to implement its inspection regime and\nenforce its humane-handling requirements. See Hearings\non 2012 Appropriations before the Subcommittee on Agri-\nculture of the House Committee on Appropriations, 112th\nCong., 1st Sess., pt. 1B, p. 921 (2011). In fiscal year 2010,\nthose personnel examined about 147 million head of live-\nstock and carried out more than 126,000 “humane han-\ndling verification procedures.” Id., at 942–943.\n  The FSIS’s inspection procedure begins with an “ante-\nmortem” examination of each animal brought to a slaugh-\nterhouse.

If, at the other end of the spectrum, the inspec-\ntor sees that an animal is dead or dying, comatose, suffer-\ning from a high fever, or afflicted with a serious disease or\ncondition, he designates the animal as “U. S. Condemned.”\nSee §309.3; §311.1 et seq. (listing diseases requiring con-\ndemnation). A condemned animal (if not already dead)\nmust be killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where\nfood is produced, and no part of its carcass may be sold for\nhuman consumption. See §309.13(a); 21 U. S. C. §610(c).\n  The inspector also has an intermediate option: If he\ndetermines that an animal has a less severe condition—or\nmerely suspects the animal of having a disease meriting\ncondemnation—he classifies the animal as “U. S. Suspect.”\nSee 9 CFR §309.2. That category includes all nonambula-\ntory animals not found to require condemnation.2 See\n§309.2(b). Suspect livestock must be “set apart,” specially\nmonitored, and (if not reclassified because of a change in\ncondition) “slaughtered separately from other livestock.”\n§309.2(n). Following slaughter, an inspector decides at\na “post-mortem” examination which parts, if any, of the\nsuspect animal’s carcass may be processed into food for\nhumans. See 9 CFR pts. 310, 311.\n  The regulations implementing the FMIA additionally\nprescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all\nstages of the slaughtering process. Those rules apply from\nthe moment a truck carrying livestock “enters, or is in line\nto enter,” a slaughterhouse’s premises. Humane Handling\nand Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I)\n(rev. Aug. 15, 2011). And they include specific provisions\nfor the humane treatment of animals that cannot walk.\n——————\n  2 The FSIS’s regulations define “non-ambulatory disabled livestock”\n\nas “livestock that cannot rise from a recumbent position or that cannot\nwalk, including, but not limited to, those with broken appendages,\nsevered tendons or ligaments, nerve paralysis, fractured vertebral\ncolumn, or metabolic conditions.” §309.2(b).\n4               NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 9 CFR §313.2(d). Under the regulations, slaughter-\nhouse employees may not drag conscious, nonambulatory\nanimals, see §313.2(d)(2), and may move them only with\n“equipment suitable for such purposes,” §313.2(d)(3).\nSimilarly, employees must place nonambulatory animals,\nas well as other sick and disabled livestock, in covered\npens sufficient to protect the animals from “adverse cli-\nmatic conditions.” See §313.2(d)(1); §313.1(c).\n  The FMIA contains an express preemption provision, at\nissue here, addressing state laws on these and similar\nmatters. That provision’s first sentence reads:\n     “Requirements within the scope of this [Act] with re-\n     spect to premises, facilities and operations of any es-\n     tablishment at which inspection is provided under . . .\n     this [Act] which are in addition to, or different than\n     those made under this [Act] may not be imposed by\n     any State.” 21 U.

S. history in order to prevent\nconsumption of meat from diseased animals. Of greater\nrelevance here, the video also prompted the California\nlegislature to strengthen a pre-existing statute governing\nthe treatment of nonambulatory animals and to apply that\nstatute to slaughterhouses regulated under the FMIA.\nSee National Meat Assn. v. Brown, 599 F. 3d 1093, 1096\n——————\n  3 The preemption provision also includes a saving clause, which states\n\nthat the Act “shall not preclude any State . . . from making require-\nment[s] or taking other action, consistent with this [Act], with respect\nto any other matters regulated under this [Act].” 21 U.

See §599f(h).\n   Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA) is a trade\nassociation representing meatpackers and processors, in-\ncluding operators of swine slaughterhouses. It sued to\nenjoin the enforcement of §599f against those slaughter-\nhouses, principally on the ground that the FMIA preempts\napplication of the state law.4 The District Court granted\nthe NMA’s motion for a preliminary injunction, reasoning\nthat §599f is expressly preempted because it requires\nswine “to be handled in a manner other than that pre-\nscribed by the FMIA” and its regulations. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 36a. But the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit vacated the injunction. According to that\ncourt, the FMIA does not expressly preempt §599f because\nthe state law regulates only “the kind of animal that may\nbe slaughtered,” and not the inspection or slaughtering\nprocess itself. 599 F. 3d, at 1098.\n   We granted certiorari, 564 U.

And at every turn §599f\nimposes additional or different requirements on swine\nslaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambula-\ntory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act\nand regulations do not. In essence, California’s statute\nsubstitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FSIS\nuses. Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take\none course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig,\nunder state law the slaughterhouse must take another.\n  Consider first what the two statutes tell a slaughter-\nhouse to do when (as not infrequently occurs) a pig be-\ncomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after\ndelivery to the slaughterhouse.5 Section 599f(c) prohibits\nthe slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” such an animal “with-\nout taking immediate action to humanely euthanize” it.\nAnd §599f(b) provides that no part of the animal’s carcass\nmay be “process[ed]” or “butcher[ed]” to make food. By\ncontrast, under the FMIA and its regulations, a slaugh-\nterhouse may hold (without euthanizing) any nonambula-\ntory pig that has not been condemned. See supra, at 3.\nAnd the slaughterhouse may process or butcher such an\n——————\n  5 The percentage of pigs becoming nonambulatory after delivery var-\n\nies by slaughterhouse from 0.1 percent to over 1 percent. See McGlone,\nFatigued Pigs: The Final Link, Pork Magazine 14 (Mar. 2006). About\n100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see\nDept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock\nSlaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between\n100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

See ibid.\nThe State’s proscriptions thus exceed the FMIA’s. To be\nsure, nothing in the federal Act requires what the state\nlaw forbids (or forbids what the state law requires); Cali-\nfornia is right to note that “[t]he FMIA does not mandate\nthat ‘U. S. Suspect’ [nonambulatory] animals . . . be placed\ninto the human food production process.” Brief for State\nRespondents 31. But that is irrelevant, because the\nFMIA’s preemption clause covers not just conflicting, but\nalso different or additional state requirements. It there-\nfore precludes California’s effort in §§599f(b) and (c) to im-\npose new rules, beyond any the FSIS has chosen to adopt,\non what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that be-\ncomes nonambulatory during the production process.\n  Similarly, consider how the state and federal laws ad-\ndress what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is non-\nambulatory at the time of delivery, usually because of\nharsh transportation conditions.6 Section 599f(a) of the\nCalifornia law bars a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or\n“buy[ing]” such a pig, thus obligating the slaughterhouse\nto refuse delivery of the animal.7 But that directive, too,\ndeviates from any imposed by federal law. A regulation\nissued under the FMIA specifically authorizes slaughter-\nhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals (including\nnonambulatory swine), by exempting them from a general\nprohibition on such purchases. See 9 CFR §325.20(c).\n——————\n  6 According to one estimate, almost half of one percent of the pigs\n\nslaughtered annually in the United States become nonambulatory\nduring the trip from farm to slaughterhouse. See National Pork Board,\nTransport Quality Assurance Handbook 25 (Version 4, 2010). About\nhalf that many die during transport. See ibid.\n  7 Section 599f(a) also bans “sell[ing]” nonambulatory animals. But\n\nbecause slaughterhouses (unlike other entities referenced in the provi-\nsion) do not typically sell live animals, that prohibition is not at issue in\nthis case. The statute’s distinct ban on selling meat from nonambula-\ntory animals that have been slaughtered is discussed infra, at 9–10.\n8             NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses\nwill in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonambula-\ntory swine. Recall that the FMIA’s regulations provide for\nthe inspection of all pigs at delivery, see supra, at 2—in\nthe case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck,\nsee Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS\nDirective 6900.2, ch. II(I). They further instruct slaugh-\nterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs\nlabeled “condemned,” and to slaughter separately those\nmarked “suspect.” See supra, at 3. In short, federal law\nestablishes rules for handling and slaughtering nonam-\nbulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than\nordering them returned to sender. So §599f(a) and the\nFMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse con-\nfronted with a delivery truck containing nonambula-\ntory swine. The former says “do not receive or buy them”;\nthe latter does not.\n   The Humane Society counters that at least §599f(a)’s\nban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemp-\ntion because that provision applies no matter when or\nwhere a purchase takes place. The argument proceeds in\nthree steps: (1) §599f(a)’s ban covers purchases of non-\nambulatory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the\nslaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the\nState may regulate such offsite purchases because they do\nnot involve a slaughterhouse’s “premises, facilities and\noperations,” which is a condition of preemption under the\nFMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just be-\ncause a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to\noccur at delivery, on its own property. See Brief for Non-\nState Respondents 43–45.\n   But this argument fails on two grounds. First, its pre-\nliminary steps have no foundation in the record. Until a\nstray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50,\nneither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed\nthe NMA’s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndelivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem in-\nspection). See Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 18; Brief for Non-\nState Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16,\nn. 5. Nor had the parties presented evidence that a signif-\nicant number of pigs become nonambulatory before ship-\nment, when any offsite purchases would occur. The record\ntherefore does not disclose whether §599f(a)’s ban on\npurchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate,\nmuch less how an application of that kind would affect\na slaughterhouse’s operations. And because that is so,\nwe have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would\npreempt it. Second, even assuming that a State could\nregulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the\nHumane Society’s argument would not follow. The FMIA’s\npreemption clause expressly focuses on “premises, facili-\nties and operations”—at bottom, the slaughtering and\nprocessing of animals at a given location. So the distinc-\ntion between a slaughterhouse’s site-based activities and\nits more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Hu-\nmane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should\nstrain to avoid. It is instead a fundamental feature of the\nFMIA’s preemption clause.\n   For that reason, the Humane Society’s stronger argu-\nment concerns California’s effort to regulate the last stage\nof a slaughterhouse’s business—the ban in §599f(b) on\n“sell[ing] meat or products of nonambulatory animals for\nhuman consumption.” The Government acknowledges\nthat the FMIA’s preemption clause does not usually fore-\nclose “state regulation of the commercial sales activities of\nslaughterhouses.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 17. And the Humane Society asserts, in line with\nthat general rule, that §599f(b)’s ban on sales does not\nregulate a slaughterhouse’s “operations” because it kicks\nin only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaugh-\ntered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act\n“is not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually\n10            NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsold.” Brief for Non-State Respondents 45. At most, the\nHumane Society claims, §599f(b)’s ban on sales offers\nan “incentiv[e]” to a slaughterhouse to take nonambulatory\npigs out of the meat production process. Id., at 46. And\nCalifornia may so “motivate[]” an operational choice with-\nout running afoul of the FMIA’s preemption provision.\nIbid. (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.\n431, 443 (2005)).\n   But this argument mistakes how the prohibition on\nsales operates within §599f as a whole. The sales ban is\na criminal proscription calculated to help implement and\nenforce each of the section’s other regulations—its prohibi-\ntion of receipt and purchase, its bar on butchering and\nprocessing, and its mandate of immediate euthanasia.\nThe idea—and the inevitable effect—of the provision is to\nmake sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory\npigs from the production process (or keep them out of the\nprocess from the beginning) by criminalizing the sale of\ntheir meat. That, we think, is something more than an\n“incentive” or “motivat[or]”; the sales ban instead func-\ntions as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their\noperations in the exact way the remainder of §599f man-\ndates. And indeed, if the sales ban were to avoid the\nFMIA’s preemption clause, then any State could impose\nany regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as\na ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the\nState disapproved. That would make a mockery of the\nFMIA’s preemption provision. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v.\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246,\n255 (2004) (stating that it “would make no sense” to allow\nstate regulations to escape preemption because they ad-\ndressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a fed-\nerally regulated product). Like the rest of §599f, the sales\nban regulates how slaughterhouses must deal with non-\nambulatory pigs on their premises. The FMIA therefore\npreempts it for all the same reasons.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  California’s and the Humane Society’s broadest argu-\nment against preemption maintains that all of §599f ’s\nchallenged provisions fall outside the “scope” of the FMIA\nbecause they exclude a class of animals from the slaugh-\ntering process. See 21 U. S. C. §678 (preempting certain\nrequirements “within the scope of this [Act]”). According\nto this view, the Act (and the FSIS’s authority under it)\nextends only to “animals that are going to be turned into\nmeat,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28—or to use another phrase,\nanimals that will “be slaughtered . . . for purposes of\nhuman food production,” Brief for State Respondents 19\n(emphasis deleted). Section 599f avoids the scope of the\nAct, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambu-\nlatory pigs from the slaughtering process.8 The Ninth\nCircuit accepted this argument, analogizing §599f to state\nlaws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of\nhorses for human consumption. 599 F. 3d, at 1098 (dis-\ncussing Cavel Int’l., Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F. 3d 551 (CA7\n2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de\nC.V. v. Curry, 476 F. 3d 326 (CA5 2007)). According to the\nCourt of Appeals, “states are free to decide which animals\nmay be turned into meat.” 599 F. 3d, at 1098, 1099.\n  We think not. The FMIA’s scope includes not only\n“animals that are going to be turned into meat,” but ani-\n\n——————\n  8 California’sbrief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the “op-\nerations” language of the FMIA’s preemption clause (although the State\nappeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument). In this version of\nthe claim, California contends that the “operations” of a slaughterhouse\nare only those “of federal concern,” and that excluding a class of ani-\nmals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such opera-\ntions. Brief for State Respondents 20, n. 9; see also id., at 20–21. We\nsee no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of\nanimals does not implicate “operations of federal concern” and saying\nthat it does not fall within the scope of the Act. Accordingly, our\nanswer to both forms of the argument is the same.\n12            NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmals on a slaughterhouse’s premises that will never suffer\nthat fate. The Act’s implementing regulations themselves\nexclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering\nprocess. Swine with hog cholera, for example, are disqual-\nified, see 9 CFR §309.5(a); so too are swine and other\nlivestock “affected with anthrax,” §309.7(a). Indeed, the\nfederal regulations prohibit the slaughter of any nonam-\nbulatory cattle for human consumption. See §309.3(e). As\nthese examples demonstrate, one vital function of the Act\nand its regulations is to ensure that some kinds of live-\nstock delivered to a slaughterhouse’s gates will not be\nturned into meat. Under federal law, nonambulatory pigs\nare not among those excluded animals. But that is to\nsay only that §599f ’s requirements differ from those of\nthe FMIA—not that §599f ’s requirements fall outside the\nFMIA’s scope.\n   Nor are respondents right to suggest that §599f ’s exclu-\nsion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to\nensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than the\nsafety of meat. See, e.g., Brief for State Respondents 29;\nBrief for Non-State Respondents 39–40. That view mis-\nunderstands the authority—and indeed responsibility—\nthat the FMIA gives to federal officials. Since 1978, when\nCongress incorporated the HMSA’s standards, the FMIA\nhas required slaughterhouses to follow prescribed methods\nof humane handling, so as to minimize animals’ pain and\nsuffering. See 21 U. S. C. §§603(b), 610(b); supra, at 2–4.\nA violation of those standards is a crime, see §676, and the\nSecretary of Agriculture can suspend inspections at—and\nthus effectively shut down—a slaughterhouse that dis-\nobeys them, see §§603(b), 610(c). To implement the Act’s\nhumane-handling provisions, the FSIS has issued detailed\nregulations, see 9 CFR pt. 313, including some specifically\naddressing animals that cannot walk, see §§313.2(d),\n313.1(c). Those rules, as earlier noted, apply throughout\nthe time an animal is on a slaughterhouse’s premises,\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the moment a delivery truck pulls up to the gate.\nSee supra, at 3–4. So the FMIA addresses not just food\nsafety, but humane treatment as well. Even California\nconceded at oral argument that the FSIS could issue\nregulations under the FMIA, similar to §599f, mandating\nthe euthanasia of nonambulatory swine.9 See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 46–47. If that is so—and it is, because of the FSIS’s\nauthority over humane-handling methods—then §599f ’s\nrequirements must fall within the FMIA’s scope.\n  The Circuit decisions upholding state bans on slaughter-\ning horses, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, do not de-\nmand any different conclusion. We express no view on\nthose decisions, except to say that the laws sustained\nthere differ from §599f in a significant respect. A ban on\nbutchering horses for human consumption works at a\nremove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most\ndirectly governs. When such a ban is in effect, no horses\nwill be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaugh-\nterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase\nin the first instance. But §599f does not and cannot work\nin that way. As earlier noted, many nonambulatory pigs\nbecome disabled either in transit to or after arrival at a\nslaughterhouse. See supra, at 6–9, and nn. 5–6. So even\nwith §599f in effect, a swine slaughterhouse will encounter\nnonambulatory pigs. In that circumstance, §599f tells the\nslaughterhouse what to do with those animals. Unlike a\nhorse slaughtering ban, the statute thus reaches into the\nslaughterhouse’s facilities and affects its daily activities.\nAnd in so doing, the California law runs smack into the\nFMIA’s regulations. So whatever might be said of other\nbans on slaughter, §599f imposes requirements within—\n\n——————\n  9 Indeed, the FSIS recently solicited comment on a rulemaking peti-\ntion that would require all nonambulatory disabled livestock, including\nswine, to be humanely euthanized. See 76 Fed. Reg. 6572 (2011). The\nFSIS has taken no further action on that petition.\n14               NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand indeed at the very heart of—the FMIA’s scope.10\n                            IV\n  The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses’ handling and\ntreatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their\ndelivery through the end of the meat production process.\nCalifornia’s §599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at\nthe same time, in the same place—except by imposing\ndifferent requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts\nsuch a state law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit, and remand this case for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  10 We   finally reject California’s argument, see Brief for State Re-\nspondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA’s preemption provision\nrenders its saving clause insignificant. That clause provides that\nStates may regulate slaughterhouses as to “other matters,” not ad-\ndressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are\n“consistent with” the FMIA. 21 U. S. C. §678. So, for example, the\nGovernment acknowledges that state laws of general application\n(workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to\nslaughterhouses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Moreover, because the\nFMIA’s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing\nonly “addition[al]” or “different” requirements, §678, States may exact\ncivil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also\nviolates the FMIA. See §678; cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, 544\nU. S. 431, 447 (2005) (holding that a preemption clause barring state\nlaws “in addition to or different” from a federal Act does not interfere\nwith an “equivalent” state provision). Although the FMIA preempts\nmuch state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for\nthe States to regulate.\n</pre>", "id": 621293, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/01/23/National_Meat_Assn._v._Harris.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 9, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012\nThe Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U. S. C. §601 et seq., regu-\n  lates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure the\n  safety of meat and the humane handling of animals. The Depart-\n  ment of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS),\n  which administers the FMIA, has issued extensive regulations to\n  govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of\n  slaughterhouses’ operations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq.\n  The FSIS inspection procedure begins with an “ante-mortem” inspec-\n  tion of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse. If, at that inspec-\n  tion, a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly\n  severe disease or condition, it must be classified as “U. S. Con-\n  demned” and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food\n  is produced. §§309.3, 311.1 et seq. Nonambulatory animals that are\n  not condemned are classified as “U. S. Suspect.” §309.2(b). They are\n  set apart, specially monitored, and “slaughtered separately from oth-\n  er livestock.” §309.2(n). Following slaughter, an inspector decides at\n  a “post-mortem” examination which parts, if any, of the suspect ani-\n  mal’s carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts.\n  310, 311. FSIS regulations additionally prescribe methods for han-\n  dling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process, 9\n  CFR pt. 313, including specific provisions for the humane treatment\n  of nonambulatory animals, 9 CFR 313.2(d).\n     The FMIA’s preemption clause, §678, precludes states from impos-\n  ing requirements that are “within the scope” of the FMIA, relate to\n  slaughterhouse “premises, facilities and operations,” and are “in ad-\n  dition to, or different than those made under” the FMIA. In 2008,\n  California amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse\n2                 NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    shall “buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal”; “process, butch-\n    er, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human\n    consumption”; or “hold a nonambulatory animal without taking im-\n    mediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.” §§599f(a)–(c).\n    Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA), a trade association rep-\n    resenting meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of\n    §599f against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the FMIA\n    preempts application of the state law. The District Court agreed, and\n    granted the NMA a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit re-\n    versed, holding that §599f is not preempted because it regulates only\n    “the kind of animal that may be slaughtered,” not the inspection or\n    slaughtering process itself.\nHeld: The FMIA expressly preempts §599f’s application against federal-\n ly inspected swine slaughterhouses. Pp. 6−14.\n    (a) The FMIA’s preemption clause sweeps widely, and so blocks the\n applications of §599f challenged here. The clause prevents a State\n from imposing any additional or different―even if nonconflict-\n ing―requirements that fall within the FMIA’s scope and concern\n slaughterhouse facilities or operations. Section 599f imposes addi-\n tional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses: Where\n under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in\n handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse\n must take another. For example, when a pig becomes injured and\n thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse,\n §599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” the pig without\n immediately euthanizing it; and §599f(b) prohibits the slaughter-\n house from “process[ing]” or “butcher[ing]” the animal to make food.\n By contrast, the FMIA and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to\n hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory animal that has not\n been condemned, and to process and butcher such an animal’s meat,\n subject to an FSIS official’s approval at post-mortem inspection. Sim-\n ilarly, when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, §599f(a)\n prohibits a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or “buy[ing]” the pig.\n But the FMIA and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to\n purchase nonambulatory pigs. See 21 U. S. C. §644; 9 CFR\n §325.20(c). And the FSIS inspection regime clearly contemplates\n that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals. So §599f\n substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the FMIA prescribes.\n    Respondent Humane Society argues that §599f(a)’s ban on pur-\n chasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would\n not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse\n premises. But the record does not disclose whether §599f(a) ever ap-\n plies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application\n of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse’s operations. Moreover,\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow\n  that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIA’s\n  preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse “premises, fa-\n  cilities and operations.” And while the Humane Society is correct\n  that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activ-\n  ities, §599f’s sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must\n  handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises. Its effect is to make\n  sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the pro-\n  duction process. It is therefore preempted by the FMIA. Pp. 6−10.\n     (b) Also rejected is the broad argument that §599f’s challenged pro-\n  visions fall outside the FMIA’s scope because they exclude a class of\n  animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only\n  to “animals that are going to be turned into meat.” In fact, the FMIA\n  regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be\n  turned into meat. For example, the Act’s implementing regulations\n  exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g.,\n  swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR §309.5(a). The argument that §599f’s\n  exclusion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to ensure\n  the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunder-\n  stands the FMIA’s scope. The FMIA addresses not just food safety,\n  but humane treatment, as well. See, e.g., 21 U. S.

We\nconsider here whether the FMIA expressly preempts a\nCalifornia law dictating what slaughterhouses must do\nwith pigs that cannot walk, known in the trade as nonam-\nbulatory pigs.

See 21 U. S. C. §§601(h), 603(a). The\nFMIA also regulates slaughterhouses serving an exclusively intrastate\nmarket in any State that does not administer an inspection system\nwith “requirements at least equal to those” of the Act. §661(c)(1).\nBecause California has chosen not to adopt such an inspection program,\n2              NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v.

And since amended in 1978, see 92 Stat. 1069,\nthe FMIA requires all slaughterhouses to comply with the\nstandards for humane handling and slaughter of animals\nset out in the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958,\n(HMSA), 72 Stat. 862, 7 U.

C. §1901 et seq., which\noriginally applied only to slaughterhouses selling meat to\nthe Federal Government.\n  The Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and In-\nspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility for administer-\ning the FMIA to promote its dual goals of safe meat and\nhumane slaughter. Over the years, the FSIS has issued\nextensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals\nand meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses’\noperations and facilities. See 9 CFR §300.1 et seq. (2011).\nThe FSIS employs about 9,000 inspectors, veterinarians,\nand investigators to implement its inspection regime and\nenforce its humane-handling requirements.

S. Condemned.”\nSee §309.3; §311.1 et seq. (listing diseases requiring con-\ndemnation). A condemned animal (if not already dead)\nmust be killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where\nfood is produced, and no part of its carcass may be sold for\nhuman consumption. See §309.13(a); 21 U. S. C. §610(c).\n  The inspector also has an intermediate option: If he\ndetermines that an animal has a less severe condition—or\nmerely suspects the animal of having a disease meriting\ncondemnation—he classifies the animal as “U. S. Suspect.”\nSee 9 CFR §309.2. That category includes all nonambula-\ntory animals not found to require condemnation.2 See\n§309.2(b). Suspect livestock must be “set apart,” specially\nmonitored, and (if not reclassified because of a change in\ncondition) “slaughtered separately from other livestock.”\n§309.2(n).

Under the regulations, slaughter-\nhouse employees may not drag conscious, nonambulatory\nanimals, see §313.2(d)(2), and may move them only with\n“equipment suitable for such purposes,” §313.2(d)(3).\nSimilarly, employees must place nonambulatory animals,\nas well as other sick and disabled livestock, in covered\npens sufficient to protect the animals from “adverse cli-\nmatic conditions.” See §313.2(d)(1); §313.1(c).\n  The FMIA contains an express preemption provision, at\nissue here, addressing state laws on these and similar\nmatters. That provision’s first sentence reads:\n     “Requirements within the scope of this [Act] with re-\n     spect to premises, facilities and operations of any es-\n     tablishment at which inspection is provided under . . .\n     this [Act] which are in addition to, or different than\n     those made under this [Act] may not be imposed by\n     any State.” 21 U.

And at every turn §599f\nimposes additional or different requirements on swine\nslaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambula-\ntory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act\nand regulations do not. In essence, California’s statute\nsubstitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FSIS\nuses. Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take\none course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig,\nunder state law the slaughterhouse must take another.\n  Consider first what the two statutes tell a slaughter-\nhouse to do when (as not infrequently occurs) a pig be-\ncomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after\ndelivery to the slaughterhouse.5 Section 599f(c) prohibits\nthe slaughterhouse from “hold[ing]” such an animal “with-\nout taking immediate action to humanely euthanize” it.\nAnd §599f(b) provides that no part of the animal’s carcass\nmay be “process[ed]” or “butcher[ed]” to make food. By\ncontrast, under the FMIA and its regulations, a slaugh-\nterhouse may hold (without euthanizing) any nonambula-\ntory pig that has not been condemned.

About\n100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see\nDept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock\nSlaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between\n100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

See ibid.\nThe State’s proscriptions thus exceed the FMIA’s. To be\nsure, nothing in the federal Act requires what the state\nlaw forbids (or forbids what the state law requires); Cali-\nfornia is right to note that “[t]he FMIA does not mandate\nthat ‘U. S. Suspect’ [nonambulatory] animals . . . be placed\ninto the human food production process.” Brief for State\nRespondents 31. But that is irrelevant, because the\nFMIA’s preemption clause covers not just conflicting, but\nalso different or additional state requirements. It there-\nfore precludes California’s effort in §§599f(b) and (c) to im-\npose new rules, beyond any the FSIS has chosen to adopt,\non what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that be-\ncomes nonambulatory during the production process.\n  Similarly, consider how the state and federal laws ad-\ndress what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is non-\nambulatory at the time of delivery, usually because of\nharsh transportation conditions.6 Section 599f(a) of the\nCalifornia law bars a slaughterhouse from “receiv[ing]” or\n“buy[ing]” such a pig, thus obligating the slaughterhouse\nto refuse delivery of the animal.7 But that directive, too,\ndeviates from any imposed by federal law. A regulation\nissued under the FMIA specifically authorizes slaughter-\nhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals (including\nnonambulatory swine), by exempting them from a general\nprohibition on such purchases. See 9 CFR §325.20(c).\n——————\n  6 According to one estimate, almost half of one percent of the pigs\n\nslaughtered annually in the United States become nonambulatory\nduring the trip from farm to slaughterhouse. See National Pork Board,\nTransport Quality Assurance Handbook 25 (Version 4, 2010). About\nhalf that many die during transport. See ibid.\n  7 Section 599f(a) also bans “sell[ing]” nonambulatory animals. But\n\nbecause slaughterhouses (unlike other entities referenced in the provi-\nsion) do not typically sell live animals, that prohibition is not at issue in\nthis case. The statute’s distinct ban on selling meat from nonambula-\ntory animals that have been slaughtered is discussed infra, at 9–10.\n8             NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses\nwill in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonambula-\ntory swine. Recall that the FMIA’s regulations provide for\nthe inspection of all pigs at delivery, see supra, at 2—in\nthe case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck,\nsee Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS\nDirective 6900.2, ch. II(I). They further instruct slaugh-\nterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs\nlabeled “condemned,” and to slaughter separately those\nmarked “suspect.” See supra, at 3. In short, federal law\nestablishes rules for handling and slaughtering nonam-\nbulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than\nordering them returned to sender. So §599f(a) and the\nFMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse con-\nfronted with a delivery truck containing nonambula-\ntory swine. The former says “do not receive or buy them”;\nthe latter does not.\n   The Humane Society counters that at least §599f(a)’s\nban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemp-\ntion because that provision applies no matter when or\nwhere a purchase takes place. The argument proceeds in\nthree steps: (1) §599f(a)’s ban covers purchases of non-\nambulatory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the\nslaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the\nState may regulate such offsite purchases because they do\nnot involve a slaughterhouse’s “premises, facilities and\noperations,” which is a condition of preemption under the\nFMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just be-\ncause a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to\noccur at delivery, on its own property. See Brief for Non-\nState Respondents 43–45.\n   But this argument fails on two grounds. First, its pre-\nliminary steps have no foundation in the record. Until a\nstray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50,\nneither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed\nthe NMA’s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndelivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem in-\nspection). See Brief for Petitioner 46, n. 18; Brief for Non-\nState Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16,\nn. 5. Nor had the parties presented evidence that a signif-\nicant number of pigs become nonambulatory before ship-\nment, when any offsite purchases would occur. The record\ntherefore does not disclose whether §599f(a)’s ban on\npurchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate,\nmuch less how an application of that kind would affect\na slaughterhouse’s operations. And because that is so,\nwe have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would\npreempt it. Second, even assuming that a State could\nregulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the\nHumane Society’s argument would not follow. The FMIA’s\npreemption clause expressly focuses on “premises, facili-\nties and operations”—at bottom, the slaughtering and\nprocessing of animals at a given location. So the distinc-\ntion between a slaughterhouse’s site-based activities and\nits more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Hu-\nmane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should\nstrain to avoid. It is instead a fundamental feature of the\nFMIA’s preemption clause.\n   For that reason, the Humane Society’s stronger argu-\nment concerns California’s effort to regulate the last stage\nof a slaughterhouse’s business—the ban in §599f(b) on\n“sell[ing] meat or products of nonambulatory animals for\nhuman consumption.” The Government acknowledges\nthat the FMIA’s preemption clause does not usually fore-\nclose “state regulation of the commercial sales activities of\nslaughterhouses.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 17. And the Humane Society asserts, in line with\nthat general rule, that §599f(b)’s ban on sales does not\nregulate a slaughterhouse’s “operations” because it kicks\nin only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaugh-\ntered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act\n“is not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually\n10            NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsold.” Brief for Non-State Respondents 45. At most, the\nHumane Society claims, §599f(b)’s ban on sales offers\nan “incentiv[e]” to a slaughterhouse to take nonambulatory\npigs out of the meat production process. Id., at 46. And\nCalifornia may so “motivate[]” an operational choice with-\nout running afoul of the FMIA’s preemption provision.\nIbid. (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.\n431, 443 (2005)).\n   But this argument mistakes how the prohibition on\nsales operates within §599f as a whole. The sales ban is\na criminal proscription calculated to help implement and\nenforce each of the section’s other regulations—its prohibi-\ntion of receipt and purchase, its bar on butchering and\nprocessing, and its mandate of immediate euthanasia.\nThe idea—and the inevitable effect—of the provision is to\nmake sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory\npigs from the production process (or keep them out of the\nprocess from the beginning) by criminalizing the sale of\ntheir meat. That, we think, is something more than an\n“incentive” or “motivat[or]”; the sales ban instead func-\ntions as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their\noperations in the exact way the remainder of §599f man-\ndates. And indeed, if the sales ban were to avoid the\nFMIA’s preemption clause, then any State could impose\nany regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as\na ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the\nState disapproved. That would make a mockery of the\nFMIA’s preemption provision. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v.\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246,\n255 (2004) (stating that it “would make no sense” to allow\nstate regulations to escape preemption because they ad-\ndressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a fed-\nerally regulated product). Like the rest of §599f, the sales\nban regulates how slaughterhouses must deal with non-\nambulatory pigs on their premises. The FMIA therefore\npreempts it for all the same reasons.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  California’s and the Humane Society’s broadest argu-\nment against preemption maintains that all of §599f ’s\nchallenged provisions fall outside the “scope” of the FMIA\nbecause they exclude a class of animals from the slaugh-\ntering process. See 21 U. S. C. §678 (preempting certain\nrequirements “within the scope of this [Act]”). According\nto this view, the Act (and the FSIS’s authority under it)\nextends only to “animals that are going to be turned into\nmeat,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 28—or to use another phrase,\nanimals that will “be slaughtered . . . for purposes of\nhuman food production,” Brief for State Respondents 19\n(emphasis deleted). Section 599f avoids the scope of the\nAct, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambu-\nlatory pigs from the slaughtering process.8 The Ninth\nCircuit accepted this argument, analogizing §599f to state\nlaws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of\nhorses for human consumption. 599 F. 3d, at 1098 (dis-\ncussing Cavel Int’l., Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F. 3d 551 (CA7\n2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de\nC.V. v. Curry, 476 F. 3d 326 (CA5 2007)). According to the\nCourt of Appeals, “states are free to decide which animals\nmay be turned into meat.” 599 F. 3d, at 1098, 1099.\n  We think not. The FMIA’s scope includes not only\n“animals that are going to be turned into meat,” but ani-\n\n——————\n  8 California’sbrief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the “op-\nerations” language of the FMIA’s preemption clause (although the State\nappeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument). In this version of\nthe claim, California contends that the “operations” of a slaughterhouse\nare only those “of federal concern,” and that excluding a class of ani-\nmals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such opera-\ntions. Brief for State Respondents 20, n. 9; see also id., at 20–21. We\nsee no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of\nanimals does not implicate “operations of federal concern” and saying\nthat it does not fall within the scope of the Act. Accordingly, our\nanswer to both forms of the argument is the same.\n12            NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmals on a slaughterhouse’s premises that will never suffer\nthat fate. The Act’s implementing regulations themselves\nexclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering\nprocess. Swine with hog cholera, for example, are disqual-\nified, see 9 CFR §309.5(a); so too are swine and other\nlivestock “affected with anthrax,” §309.7(a). Indeed, the\nfederal regulations prohibit the slaughter of any nonam-\nbulatory cattle for human consumption. See §309.3(e). As\nthese examples demonstrate, one vital function of the Act\nand its regulations is to ensure that some kinds of live-\nstock delivered to a slaughterhouse’s gates will not be\nturned into meat. Under federal law, nonambulatory pigs\nare not among those excluded animals. But that is to\nsay only that §599f ’s requirements differ from those of\nthe FMIA—not that §599f ’s requirements fall outside the\nFMIA’s scope.\n   Nor are respondents right to suggest that §599f ’s exclu-\nsion avoids the FMIA’s scope because it is designed to\nensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than the\nsafety of meat. See, e.g., Brief for State Respondents 29;\nBrief for Non-State Respondents 39–40. That view mis-\nunderstands the authority—and indeed responsibility—\nthat the FMIA gives to federal officials. Since 1978, when\nCongress incorporated the HMSA’s standards, the FMIA\nhas required slaughterhouses to follow prescribed methods\nof humane handling, so as to minimize animals’ pain and\nsuffering. See 21 U. S. C. §§603(b), 610(b); supra, at 2–4.\nA violation of those standards is a crime, see §676, and the\nSecretary of Agriculture can suspend inspections at—and\nthus effectively shut down—a slaughterhouse that dis-\nobeys them, see §§603(b), 610(c). To implement the Act’s\nhumane-handling provisions, the FSIS has issued detailed\nregulations, see 9 CFR pt. 313, including some specifically\naddressing animals that cannot walk, see §§313.2(d),\n313.1(c). Those rules, as earlier noted, apply throughout\nthe time an animal is on a slaughterhouse’s premises,\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the moment a delivery truck pulls up to the gate.\nSee supra, at 3–4. So the FMIA addresses not just food\nsafety, but humane treatment as well. Even California\nconceded at oral argument that the FSIS could issue\nregulations under the FMIA, similar to §599f, mandating\nthe euthanasia of nonambulatory swine.9 See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 46–47. If that is so—and it is, because of the FSIS’s\nauthority over humane-handling methods—then §599f ’s\nrequirements must fall within the FMIA’s scope.\n  The Circuit decisions upholding state bans on slaughter-\ning horses, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, do not de-\nmand any different conclusion. We express no view on\nthose decisions, except to say that the laws sustained\nthere differ from §599f in a significant respect. A ban on\nbutchering horses for human consumption works at a\nremove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most\ndirectly governs. When such a ban is in effect, no horses\nwill be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaugh-\nterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase\nin the first instance. But §599f does not and cannot work\nin that way. As earlier noted, many nonambulatory pigs\nbecome disabled either in transit to or after arrival at a\nslaughterhouse. See supra, at 6–9, and nn. 5–6. So even\nwith §599f in effect, a swine slaughterhouse will encounter\nnonambulatory pigs. In that circumstance, §599f tells the\nslaughterhouse what to do with those animals. Unlike a\nhorse slaughtering ban, the statute thus reaches into the\nslaughterhouse’s facilities and affects its daily activities.\nAnd in so doing, the California law runs smack into the\nFMIA’s regulations. So whatever might be said of other\nbans on slaughter, §599f imposes requirements within—\n\n——————\n  9 Indeed, the FSIS recently solicited comment on a rulemaking peti-\ntion that would require all nonambulatory disabled livestock, including\nswine, to be humanely euthanized. See 76 Fed. Reg. 6572 (2011). The\nFSIS has taken no further action on that petition.\n14               NATIONAL MEAT ASSN. v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand indeed at the very heart of—the FMIA’s scope.10\n                            IV\n  The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses’ handling and\ntreatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their\ndelivery through the end of the meat production process.\nCalifornia’s §599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at\nthe same time, in the same place—except by imposing\ndifferent requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts\nsuch a state law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit, and remand this case for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  10 We   finally reject California’s argument, see Brief for State Re-\nspondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA’s preemption provision\nrenders its saving clause insignificant. That clause provides that\nStates may regulate slaughterhouses as to “other matters,” not ad-\ndressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are\n“consistent with” the FMIA. 21 U. S. C. §678. So, for example, the\nGovernment acknowledges that state laws of general application\n(workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to\nslaughterhouses. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. Moreover, because the\nFMIA’s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing\nonly “addition[al]” or “different” requirements, §678, States may exact\ncivil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also\nviolates the FMIA. See §678; cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, 544\nU. S. 431, 447 (2005) (holding that a preemption clause barring state\nlaws “in addition to or different” from a federal Act does not interfere\nwith an “equivalent” state provision). Although the FMIA preempts\nmuch state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for\nthe States to regulate.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/621293/", "sha1": "32f0b300f6bcac09bc5f015609df2d8a351b568a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-01-23T07:18:37"}
