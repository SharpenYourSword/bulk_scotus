UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–6549. Argued October 3, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012\nThe federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Act) re-\n  quires convicted sex offenders to provide state governments with, and\n  to update, information, e.g., names and current addresses, for state\n  and federal sex offender registries. It is a crime if a person who is\n  “required to register under [the Act]” and who “travels in interstate\n  . . . commerce” knowingly “fails to register or update a registration.”\n  18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The Act defines “sex offender” to include offend-\n  ers who were convicted before the Act’s effective date, 42 U. S. C.\n  §16911(1), and says that “the Attorney General shall have the au-\n  thority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements”\n  to pre-Act offenders, §16913(d). The Act, which seeks to make more\n  uniform and effective a patchwork of pre-Act federal and 50 state reg-\n  istration systems, became law in July 2006. In February 2007, the\n  Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the\n  Act applies to all pre-Act offenders. He has since promulgated fur-\n  ther rules, regulations, and specifications.\n      Petitioner Reynolds, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in\n  2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updat-\n  ing the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania. He was\n  indicted for failing to meet the Act’s registration requirements be-\n  tween September 16 and October 16, 2007. He moved to dismiss the\n  indictment on the ground that the Act was not applicable to pre-Act\n  offenders during that time, arguing that the Attorney General’s Feb-\n  ruary 2007 Interim Rule was invalid because it violated the Constitu-\n  tion’s “nondelegation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure\n  Act’s notice and comment requirements. The District Court rejected\n  on the merits of Reynolds’ legal attack on the Interim Rule, but the\n  Third Circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits,\n2                    REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concluding that the Act’s registration requirements applied to pre-Act\n    offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General.\n    Thus, it found, the Interim Rule’s validity made no legal difference in\n    the outcome.\nHeld: The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the\n Attorney General validly specifies that the Act’s registration provi-\n sions apply to them. Pp. 6–13.\n    (a) This conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the Act’s\n text, which consists of four statements. Statement One says that “[a]\n sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.”\n Statement Two says that, generally, the offender must initially regis-\n ter before completing his “sentence of imprisonment.” Statement\n Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within\n three business days of any change of “name, residence, employment,\n or student status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney General\n shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the require-\n ments . . . to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of” the Act.\n §16913. Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First. It\n deals specifically with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of the First State-\n ment’s broad general class (all sex offenders) and thus should control\n the Act’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v. United\n States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. Also, by giving the Attorney General au-\n thority to specify the Act’s “applicability,” not its “nonapplicability,”\n the Fourth Statement is more naturally read to confer authority to\n apply the Act, not authority to make exceptions. This reading effi-\n ciently resolves what may have been Congress’ concern about the\n practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a\n large number of pre-Act offenders, which could have been expensive\n and might not have proved feasible to do immediately. It might have\n thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for differ-\n ent categories of pre-Act offenders. And it could have concluded that\n it was efficient and desirable to ask the Justice Department, charged\n with responsibility for implementation, to examine pre-Act offender\n problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly. This read-\n ing also takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by\n related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic criminal\n law principles. The Second Statement, e.g., requires a sex offender to\n register before completing his prison term, but says nothing about\n when a pre-Act offender who has left prison is to register. An Attor-\n ney General ruling could diminish such uncertainties, helping to\n eliminate the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law\n must seek to avoid. Pp. 6–9.\n    (b) The Government’s three principal contrary arguments—that\n the Court’s reading conflicts with the Act’s purpose of establishing a\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  national registration system that includes pre-Act offenders; that the\n  Court’s reading could lead to an absurdly long implementation delay;\n  and that the Act should be read to apply the requirements immedi-\n  ately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders to avoid the possibility\n  that the Attorney General, who has, but is not required to use, “the\n  authority to specify” requirements, might take no action—are unper-\n  suasive. Some lower courts have read the Attorney General’s author-\n  ity to apply only to pre-Act sex offenders who are unable to comply\n  with the statute’s “initial registration” requirements, but that is not\n  what the Act says. Pp. 9–13.\n     (c) Because the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to pre-\n  Act offenders until the Attorney General so specifies, the question\n  whether the Attorney General’s Interim Rule is a valid specification\n  matters in this case.

UNITED \n\n                   STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 23, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification\nAct (Act), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006\ned. and Supp. III), requires those convicted of certain sex\ncrimes to provide state governments with (and to update)\ninformation, such as names and current addresses, for\ninclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.\n§§16912(a), 16913–16914, 16919(a) (2006 ed.). The Act\nmakes it a crime for a person who is “required to regis-\nter” under the Act and who “travels in interstate or foreign\ncommerce” knowingly to “fai[l] to register or update a reg-\nistration . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The question be-\nfore us concerns the date on which this federal registra-\ntion requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders\nconvicted before the Act became law.\n   The Act defines the term “sex offender” as including\nthese pre-Act offenders. 42 U. S. C. §16911(1); see Carr v.\nUnited States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7). It\nsays that “[a] sex offender shall register.” §16913(a). And\nit further says that “[t]he Attorney General shall have the\nauthority to specify the applicability of the [registration]\n2               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the\nenactment of this chapter . . . .” §16913(d) (emphasis\nadded). In our view, these provisions, read together, mean\nthat the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to\npre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that\nthey do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determina-\ntion that, in effect, holds the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The new federal Act reflects Congress’ awareness that\npre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of fed-\neral and 50 individual state registration systems. See\n73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make those\nsystems more uniform and effective. It does so by repeal-\ning several earlier federal laws that also (but less effec-\ntively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive\nregistration-system standards; by making federal funding\ncontingent on States’ bringing their systems into compli-\nance with those standards; by requiring both state and\nfederal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions\n(and to keep registration information current); and by\ncreating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who\nviolate the Act’s registration requirements. 18 U. S. C.\n§2250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U. S. C. §§16911(10),\n16913–16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration re-\nquirements); §16925 (federal funding); §129, 120 Stat. 600\n(repeal of earlier laws).\n   The Act’s criminal penalty applies to “[w]ho[m]ever . . .\nis required to register under [the Act].” 18 U. S. C.\n§2250(a). It says that such a person (a federal sex offender\nor a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate\ncommerce) must not knowingly fail “to register or update\na registration as required by [the Act].” Ibid.

S. C. §16913 (emphasis\n    added).\n4               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe new Act became law on July 27, 2006.\n   On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General promulgat-\ned an Interim Rule specifying that “[t]he requirements of\n[the Act] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders\nconvicted of the offense for which registration is required\nprior to the enactment of that Act.” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897\n(codified at 28 CFR §72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney\nGeneral promulgated further rules, regulations, and speci-\nfications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (2008); 75 Fed. Reg.\n81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case\nfocuses upon the applicability of the Act’s registration\nrequirements to pre-Act offenders during the period be-\ntween (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and\n(2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated\na valid rule specifying the registration requirements’ ap-\nplicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if\nthe February 28 specification was invalid).\n                               B\n  Billy Joe Reynolds, the petitioner, is a pre-Act offender.\nHe was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October\n2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in\nJuly 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender;\nbut he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without\nupdating his Missouri registration information (as Mis-\nsouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylva-\nnia. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with,\nbetween September 16 and October 16, 2007, having\n“knowingly failed to register and update a registration as\nrequired by [the Act].” App. 13; see 18 U. S. C. §2250(a).\nIn the Government’s view, Reynolds’ failure to update his\naddress information when he moved to Pennsylvania\nviolated the requirement that a “sex offender” update\nregistration information within “3 business days after\neach change of . . . residence.” 42 U. S. C. §16913(c).\n  Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nground that in September and October 2007 the Act’s reg-\nistration requirements had not yet become applicable to\npre-Act offenders. He conceded that the Act had become\nlaw earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that\nthe Attorney General had already (in February 2007)\npromulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act’s\nregistration requirements were applicable to pre-Act\noffenders. But he claimed that the Interim Rule was\ninvalid because it violated both the Constitution’s “nondel-\negation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act’s\n(APA) requirement for “good cause” to promulgate a rule\nwithout “notice and comment” (as the Attorney General\nhad done). See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United\nStates, 295 U. S. 495, 529 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine);\n5 U. S. C. §§553(b)(3)(B), (d)(3) (APA). Because the Inter-\nim Rule is invalid, he added, the law must treat him like a\npre-Act offender who traveled interstate and violated the\nAct’s registration requirements before the Attorney Gen-\neral specified their applicability.\n   The District Court rejected on the merits Reynolds’ legal\nattack on the Interim Rule. But the Court of Appeals\nrejected Reynolds’ argument without reaching those mer-\nits. 380 Fed. Appx. 125 (2010). That court thought that\nthe Act’s registration requirements apply to pre-Act of-\nfenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a pre-\nexisting state-law registration requirement) from the date\nof the new law’s enactment—even in the absence of any\nrule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that\nthe new registration requirements apply. That being so,\nthe validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal dif-\nference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the\nnew federal registration requirements regardless of any\nrulemaking.\n   The Courts of Appeals have reached different conclu-\nsions about whether the Act’s registration requirements\napply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attor-\n6              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July\n2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held\nthat the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to\npre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so\nspecifies. United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922–\n927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159,\n1162–1164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d\n408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F.\n3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551\nF. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F.\n3d 852, 856–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Five Circuits\nhave held that they apply from the date of the Act’s en-\nactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with\nrespect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered\nunder state law. United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499,\n506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17,\n24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d\n151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d\n926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912,\n918–919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to\nconsider the question.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  The question before us is whether the Act requires\npre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General\nvalidly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions ap-\nply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing,\na natural reading of the textual language supports our\nconclusion. The text consists of four statements. See\nsupra, at 3. Statement One says that “[a] sex offender\nshall register, and keep the registration current.” State-\nment Two says that a sex offender must initially register\nbefore completing his “sentence of imprisonment” (or, if\nthe sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three\ndays of conviction). Statement Three says that the sex\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffender must update a registration within three business\ndays of any change of “name, residence, employment, or\nstudent status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney\nGeneral shall have the authority to specify the applicabil-\nity of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders\nconvicted before the enactment of this chapter.”\n   Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.\nIt specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of\na broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the First\nStatement applies. And it therefore should control the\nAct’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (specific statutory\nprovision normally controls over one of more general\napplication); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (same).\n   At the same time, the Fourth Statement says that the\nAttorney General has authority to specify the Act’s “ap-\nplicability,” not its “nonapplicability.” And it consequently\nis more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply\nthe Act, not the authority to make exceptions. That is\nhow we normally understand a term such as “authority to\nspecify” in the context of applying new rules to persons\nalready governed by pre-existing rules. If, for example,\nthe Major League Baseball Players Association and the\nteam owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball\n“shall have the authority to specify the applicability” to\nthe major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug\ntesting policy, we should think that the minor league\npolicy would not apply unless and until the Commissioner\nso specified.\n   For another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently\nresolves what Congress may well have thought were prac-\ntical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the\nnew registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The\nproblems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make\nmore uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems.\n8               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDoing so could require newly registering or re-registering\n“a large number” of pre-Act offenders. That effort could\nprove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so\nimmediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these\nproblems). Congress’ concern about these problems is re-\nflected in the Act’s providing the States with three years\nto bring their systems into compliance with federal stand-\nards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that\n3-year grace period to five years. 42 U. S. C. §16924.\n   These same considerations might have warranted dif-\nferent federal registration treatment of different catego-\nries of pre-Act offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035–38036,\nand 38046–38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines\nallowing States to meet Act requirements without regis-\ntering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg.\n1635–1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).\nAt least Congress might well have so thought. And conse-\nquently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.\nAsking the Department of Justice, charged with respon-\nsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act\noffender problems and to apply the new registration re-\nquirements accordingly could have represented one effi-\ncient and desirable solution (though we express no view\non Reynolds’ related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U. S. C.\n§§16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945\n(granting the Attorney General authority to administer\nvarious aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution\nthat the Act’s language says that Congress adopted.\n   Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have\nfilled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions)\nin a manner consistent with basic background principles\nof criminal law. The Second Statement, for example, says\nthat a sex offender must register before completing his\nprison term, but the provision says nothing about when a\npre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act\nmust register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbe prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no\ninterstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And\nto apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from\nthe date of enactment would require reading into the\nstatute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equiva-\nlent (e.g., registering or updating within a “reasonable\ntime” or “within three days of first post-Act travel in inter-\nstate commerce” or “as preexisting state law requires”).\n  Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae,\nand difficulties, might, on their own, reach different con-\nclusions about whether, or how, the new registration\nrequirements applied to them. A ruling from the Attorney\nGeneral, however, could diminish or eliminate those un-\ncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of\nvagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to\navoid. Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 266\n(1997) (noting that “the canon of strict construction of\ncriminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by\nso resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it\nonly to conduct clearly covered”).\n                                B\n  The Government makes three principal arguments to\nthe contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the\nAct conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the\n“establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for\nthe registration of [sex] offenders,” 42 U. S. C. §16901,\nthat includes offenders who committed their offenses\nbefore the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose\nwhen it defines “sex offender” broadly to include any\n“individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1).\nAnd we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in\ngeneral, the Act’s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act\noffender required to register under the Act who later\ntravels interstate and fails to register. See Carr, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n10              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Act’s history also reveals that many of its support-\ners placed considerable importance upon the registration\nof pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt.\n1, p. 24 (2005) (H. R. Rep.) (“[Twenty] percent of sexual\noffenders are ‘lost,’ and there is a strong public interest\nin finding them and having them register with current\ninformation to mitigate the risks of additional crimes\nagainst children”); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement\nof Sen. Cantwell) (“Child sex offenders have exploited this\nstunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have\nbeen tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation’s 560,000 sex\noffenders are ‘lost’ because State offender registry pro-\ngrams are not coordinated well enough”); id., at 15338\n(statement of Sen. Kyl) (“There currently are over 100,000\nsex offenders in this country who are required to register\nbut are ‘off the system.’ They are not registered. The\npenalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that\nthese individuals register”); id., at 13050 (statement of\nSen. Frist) (“There are currently 550,000 registered sex\noffenders in the U. S. and at least 100,000 of them are\nmissing from the system. Every day that we don’t have\nthis national sex offender registry, these missing sex\npredators are out there somewhere”).\n   The difficulty with the Government’s argument, how-\never, is that it overstates the need for instantaneous regis-\ntration of pre-Act offenders. Our different reading, we\nconcede, involves implementation delay. But that delay\nneed not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim\nRule 217 days after the effective date of the new law).\nAnd that delay can be justified by the need to accommo-\ndate other Act-related interests. See supra, at 7–9.\n   Second, the Government suggests that our reading leads\nto an absurd result. As it points out, the Fourth Statement\ngrants the Attorney General the “authority to specify”\nthe registration requirements’ applicability not only to\npre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“implementation” of the new Act “in a particular jurisdic-\ntion.” Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act\nfor up to five years. See 42 U. S. C. §16924; see also Dept. of\nJustice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department\nFinds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented\nSORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as\nof July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the\nAct’s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/\npressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is\nabsurd to believe that Congress would have desired so\nlong a delay in the application of its new registration\nrequirements.\n   The problem with this argument, however, is that read-\ning the two categories similarly (a matter which we need\nnot decide) would not require a long delay in applying the\nregistration requirements to post-Act offenders who com-\nmitted a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement\nthe new requirements. At most, that reading would re-\nquire the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applica-\nble to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could\nspecify that the Act’s preregistration provisions apply to\nsome or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly,\nwell before a jurisdiction implements the Act’s require-\nments. Indeed, the Attorney General’s Interim Rule and\nthe Department of Justice’s final guidelines, both issued\nbefore any jurisdiction implemented the Act’s require-\nments, state that the Act’s requirements apply to “all sex\noffenders,” including all preimplementation offenders. See\n72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR §72.3); 73 Fed. Reg.\n38036; cf. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,\nJustice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions\n to Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notifica-\ntion Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/\npressreleases/2009/SMART09154.htm.\n12              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, the Government argues against our interpreta-\ntion on the ground that the Act says only that the At-\ntorney General “shall have the authority to specify the\napplicability” of the Act’s registration requirements to pre-\nAct offenders; it does not say that he “shall specify” or\notherwise require him to do so. The Act’s language, the\nGovernment continues, consequently gives the Attorney\nGeneral the power not to specify anything; that power is\ninconsistent with Congress’ intent to ensure the speedy\nregistration of thousands of “lost” pre-Act offenders, supra,\nat 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the\nAct’s registration requirements as applying immedi-\nately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though\nthe Attorney General would have the power to make\nexceptions).\n   This argument bases too much upon too little. There is\nno reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attor-\nney General would refuse to apply the new requirements\nto pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., at 23–24; Pro-\ntecting Our Nation’s Children from Sexual Predators and\nViolent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing\nbefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4–13 (2005); Office of the Press\nSec’y, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472,\nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006\n(July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/\nnews/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html. And there was no\nneed for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic\npossibility. There is consequently no need to read the\nlanguage unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the\nauthority only to make exceptions from an implicit (un-\nstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registra-\ntion requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board\nand immediately.\n   Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General’s specification authority as applying\nonly to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with\nthe statute’s “initial registration” requirements. See 42\nU. S. C. §16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute\nsays. Rather, its Fourth Statement, §16913(d), says that\nthe Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the\napplicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act\n(and preimplementation) offenders, “and ” (2) to prescribe\nrules for their registration, “and ” (3) to prescribe registra-\ntion rules for other categories of sex offenders who are\nunable to comply with the initial registration require-\nments. See supra, at 3. The word “and” means that the\nAttorney General’s authority extends beyond those pre-Act\n“sex offenders who are unable to comply” with the initial\nregistration requirements.\n                            III\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the Act’s registra-\ntion requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until\nthe Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney\nGeneral’s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification\nconsequently matters in the case before us. And we re-\nverse the Third Circuit’s judgment to the contrary. We\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                              So ordered.\n14              REYNOLDS v.

UNITED \n\n                   STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                       [January 23, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n   In my view, the registration requirements of the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (Act), 120 Stat.\n590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. III),\napply of their own force, without action by the Attorney\nGeneral. The Act’s statement that “[t]he Attorney General\nshall have the authority to specify the applicability of\nthe [registration] requirements” to pre-Act sex offenders,\n§16913(d), is best understood as conferring on the Attor-\nney General an authority to make exceptions to the oth-\nerwise applicable registration requirements.\n   To begin with, I do not share the Court’s belief that\nto “specify the applicability” more naturally means, in the\npresent context, to “make applicable” rather than to “make\ninapplicable.” See ante, at 7. The example the Court\ngives, the Commissioner of Baseball’s “ ‘authority to spec-\nify the applicability’ ” of more stringent minor-league drug\ntesting policies to the major leagues, ibid., is entirely\ninapt, because it deals with a policy that on its face is\notherwise not applicable. Since the major leagues are not\ncovered by the policies, the Commissioner’s “ ‘authority to\nspecify [their] applicability’ ” can mean nothing else but the\nauthority to render them applicable. What we have here,\nhowever, is a statute that states in unqualified terms that\n2                  REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“a sex offender shall register,” §16913(a)—and that the\nCourt rightly believes was meant to cover pre-Act offend-\ners.* The issue is whether “specify the applicability”\nmeans that no pre-Act offenders need register unless the\nAttorney General says so, or rather that the Attorney\nGeneral may excuse the unqualified requirement for pre-\nAct offenders. In that context, it seems to me that the\nlatter meaning is more natural. One specifies the applica-\nbility of an application that already exists by describing or\nrevising its contours.\n  I think it preferable to give “specify” this meaning not\nonly because here it is more natural, but also because\nthe alternative is to read the statute as leaving it up to the\nAttorney General whether the registration requirement\nwould ever apply to pre-Act offenders, even though regis-\ntration of pre-Act offenders was (as the Court acknowl-\nedges) what the statute sought to achieve. For the statute\ndoes not instruct the Attorney General to specify; it merely\ngives him “authority” to do so. In this respect, the provi-\nsion at issue here stands in marked contrast to other\nprovisions of the Act which clearly impose duties on the\nAttorney General. See, e.g., §16912(b) (“The Attorney\nGeneral shall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret\nand implement this subchapter”); §16917(b) (“The Attor-\nney General shall prescribe rules for the notification of\n[certain] sex offenders”); §16919(a) (“The Attorney General\nshall maintain a national database”); §16926(a) (“The\nAttorney General shall establish and implement a Sex\nOffender Management Assistance program”).\n——————\n   * The Court reaches this conclusion based on an inquiry into legisla-\ntive history. See ante, at 9–10. That inquiry is quite superf luous,\nhowever since the text of the Act itself makes clear that Congress\nsought to “establis[h] a comprehensive national system for the registra-\ntion of [sex offenders],” 42 U. S. C. §16901, with “sex offender” defined\nbroadly to “mea[n] an individual who was convicted of a sex offense,”\n§16911(1) (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court’s response to this—that “there was no need\nfor a mandatory requirement to avoid [the] unrealistic\npossibility” that the Attorney General would not specify,\nante, at 12—seems to me a fine answer to the question\n“What mandatory requirements must a poorly drafted\nstatute contain in order to be workable?” It is an inade-\nquate answer, however, to the question that is relevant\nhere: “Would Congress have written the provision this way\nif it wanted pre-Act offenders covered and did not think\nthey were covered absent specification by the Attorney Gen-\neral?” Intelligently drafted statutes make mandatory\nthose executive acts essential to their functioning, whether\nor not those acts would likely occur anyway. It would have\ntaken little effort (in fact, less effort) for Congress to write\n“the Attorney General shall specify the applicability”\ninstead of “the Attorney General shall have authority to\nspecify the applicability.” The latter formulation confers\ndiscretion, and it is simply implausible that the Attorney\nGeneral was given discretion to determine whether cover-\nage of pre-Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act)\nshould exist.\n   Indeed, it is not entirely clear to me that Congress\ncan constitutionally leave it to the Attorney General to\ndecide—with no statutory standard whatever governing his\ndiscretion—whether a criminal statute will or will not\napply to certain individuals. That seems to me sailing\nclose to the wind with regard to the principle that legisla-\ntive powers are nondelegable, see Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472–476 (2001);\nLoving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 776–777 (1996)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment), and “[i]t is our settled policy to avoid an interpreta-\ntion of a federal statute that engenders constitutional\nissues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses\nno constitutional question.” Gomez v. United States, 490\nU. S. 858, 864 (1989). Construing the Act to give the\n4               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nAttorney General the power to reduce congressionally\nimposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power\nis little more than a formalized version of the time-\nhonored practice of prosecutorial discretion.\n   The Court points out that there might have been need\nfor “different federal registration treatment of different\ncategories of pre-Act offenders,” ante, at 8, and that absent\na “ruling from the Attorney General” pre-Act offenders\nwould be uncertain “about whether, or how, the new regis-\ntration requirements applied to them,” ante, at 9. But\nattending to those details would certainly come within the\nAttorney General’s authority to “specify” application of the\nAct—and so would the temporary suspension of registra-\ntion requirements pending the Attorney General’s reso-\nlution of those details. And of course the uncertainty of\nwhere to register could form the basis for the Attorney\nGeneral’s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in\nindividual cases. Neither problem, it seems to me, justi-\nfies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not\napply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney\nGeneral, in his discretion, says so.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 621294, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/01/23/Reynolds_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 3, 2011—Decided January 23, 2012\nThe federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (Act) re-\n  quires convicted sex offenders to provide state governments with, and\n  to update, information, e.g., names and current addresses, for state\n  and federal sex offender registries. It is a crime if a person who is\n  “required to register under [the Act]” and who “travels in interstate\n  . . . commerce” knowingly “fails to register or update a registration.”\n  18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The Act defines “sex offender” to include offend-\n  ers who were convicted before the Act’s effective date, 42 U. S. C.\n  §16911(1), and says that “the Attorney General shall have the au-\n  thority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements”\n  to pre-Act offenders, §16913(d). The Act, which seeks to make more\n  uniform and effective a patchwork of pre-Act federal and 50 state reg-\n  istration systems, became law in July 2006. In February 2007, the\n  Attorney General promulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the\n  Act applies to all pre-Act offenders. He has since promulgated fur-\n  ther rules, regulations, and specifications.\n      Petitioner Reynolds, a pre-Act offender, registered in Missouri in\n  2005 but moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without updat-\n  ing the Missouri registration or registering in Pennsylvania. He was\n  indicted for failing to meet the Act’s registration requirements be-\n  tween September 16 and October 16, 2007. He moved to dismiss the\n  indictment on the ground that the Act was not applicable to pre-Act\n  offenders during that time, arguing that the Attorney General’s Feb-\n  ruary 2007 Interim Rule was invalid because it violated the Constitu-\n  tion’s “nondelegation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure\n  Act’s notice and comment requirements. The District Court rejected\n  on the merits of Reynolds’ legal attack on the Interim Rule, but the\n  Third Circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits,\n2                    REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concluding that the Act’s registration requirements applied to pre-Act\n    offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General.\n    Thus, it found, the Interim Rule’s validity made no legal difference in\n    the outcome.\nHeld: The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the\n Attorney General validly specifies that the Act’s registration provi-\n sions apply to them. Pp. 6–13.\n    (a) This conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the Act’s\n text, which consists of four statements. Statement One says that “[a]\n sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current.”\n Statement Two says that, generally, the offender must initially regis-\n ter before completing his “sentence of imprisonment.” Statement\n Three says that the sex offender must update a registration within\n three business days of any change of “name, residence, employment,\n or student status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney General\n shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the require-\n ments . . . to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of” the Act.\n §16913. Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First. It\n deals specifically with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of the First State-\n ment’s broad general class (all sex offenders) and thus should control\n the Act’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v. United\n States, 498 U. S. 395, 407. Also, by giving the Attorney General au-\n thority to specify the Act’s “applicability,” not its “nonapplicability,”\n the Fourth Statement is more naturally read to confer authority to\n apply the Act, not authority to make exceptions. This reading effi-\n ciently resolves what may have been Congress’ concern about the\n practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a\n large number of pre-Act offenders, which could have been expensive\n and might not have proved feasible to do immediately. It might have\n thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for differ-\n ent categories of pre-Act offenders. And it could have concluded that\n it was efficient and desirable to ask the Justice Department, charged\n with responsibility for implementation, to examine pre-Act offender\n problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly. This read-\n ing also takes Congress to have filled potential lacunae (created by\n related Act provisions) in a manner consistent with basic criminal\n law principles. The Second Statement, e.g., requires a sex offender to\n register before completing his prison term, but says nothing about\n when a pre-Act offender who has left prison is to register.

S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006\ned. and Supp. III), requires those convicted of certain sex\ncrimes to provide state governments with (and to update)\ninformation, such as names and current addresses, for\ninclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.\n§§16912(a), 16913–16914, 16919(a) (2006 ed.). The Act\nmakes it a crime for a person who is “required to regis-\nter” under the Act and who “travels in interstate or foreign\ncommerce” knowingly to “fai[l] to register or update a reg-\nistration . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §2250(a). The question be-\nfore us concerns the date on which this federal registra-\ntion requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders\nconvicted before the Act became law.\n   The Act defines the term “sex offender” as including\nthese pre-Act offenders. 42 U. S. C. §16911(1); see Carr v.\nUnited States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7). It\nsays that “[a] sex offender shall register.” §16913(a). And\nit further says that “[t]he Attorney General shall have the\nauthority to specify the applicability of the [registration]\n2               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements . . . to sex offenders convicted before the\nenactment of this chapter . . . .” §16913(d) (emphasis\nadded). In our view, these provisions, read together, mean\nthat the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to\npre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that\nthey do apply. We reverse a Court of Appeals determina-\ntion that, in effect, holds the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The new federal Act reflects Congress’ awareness that\npre-Act registration law consisted of a patchwork of fed-\neral and 50 individual state registration systems. See\n73 Fed. Reg. 38045 (2008). The Act seeks to make those\nsystems more uniform and effective. It does so by repeal-\ning several earlier federal laws that also (but less effec-\ntively) sought uniformity; by setting forth comprehensive\nregistration-system standards; by making federal funding\ncontingent on States’ bringing their systems into compli-\nance with those standards; by requiring both state and\nfederal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions\n(and to keep registration information current); and by\ncreating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who\nviolate the Act’s registration requirements. 18 U. S. C.\n§2250(a) (criminal provision); 42 U. S. C. §§16911(10),\n16913–16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. III) (registration re-\nquirements); §16925 (federal funding); §129, 120 Stat. 600\n(repeal of earlier laws).\n   The Act’s criminal penalty applies to “[w]ho[m]ever . . .\nis required to register under [the Act].” 18 U. S. C.\n§2250(a). It says that such a person (a federal sex offender\nor a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate\ncommerce) must not knowingly fail “to register or update\na registration as required by [the Act].” Ibid.

S. C. §16913 (emphasis\n    added).\n4               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe new Act became law on July 27, 2006.\n   On February 28, 2007, the Attorney General promulgat-\ned an Interim Rule specifying that “[t]he requirements of\n[the Act] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders\nconvicted of the offense for which registration is required\nprior to the enactment of that Act.” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897\n(codified at 28 CFR §72.3). Subsequently, the Attorney\nGeneral promulgated further rules, regulations, and speci-\nfications. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (2008); 75 Fed. Reg.\n81849 (2010); 76 Fed. Reg. 1630 (2011). The present case\nfocuses upon the applicability of the Act’s registration\nrequirements to pre-Act offenders during the period be-\ntween (1) July 27, 2006 (when the Act took effect) and\n(2) the moment when the Attorney General promulgated\na valid rule specifying the registration requirements’ ap-\nplicability, namely, February 28, 2007 (or a later date if\nthe February 28 specification was invalid).\n                               B\n  Billy Joe Reynolds, the petitioner, is a pre-Act offender.\nHe was convicted of a Missouri sex offense in October\n2001; he served four years in prison; he was released in\nJuly 2005; he then registered as a Missouri sex offender;\nbut he moved to Pennsylvania in September 2007 without\nupdating his Missouri registration information (as Mis-\nsouri law required) and without registering in Pennsylva-\nnia. A federal grand jury indicted him, charging him with,\nbetween September 16 and October 16, 2007, having\n“knowingly failed to register and update a registration as\nrequired by [the Act].” App. 13; see 18 U. S. C. §2250(a).\nIn the Government’s view, Reynolds’ failure to update his\naddress information when he moved to Pennsylvania\nviolated the requirement that a “sex offender” update\nregistration information within “3 business days after\neach change of . . . residence.” 42 U. S. C. §16913(c).\n  Reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nground that in September and October 2007 the Act’s reg-\nistration requirements had not yet become applicable to\npre-Act offenders. He conceded that the Act had become\nlaw earlier (namely, in July 2006), and he conceded that\nthe Attorney General had already (in February 2007)\npromulgated an Interim Rule specifying that the Act’s\nregistration requirements were applicable to pre-Act\noffenders. But he claimed that the Interim Rule was\ninvalid because it violated both the Constitution’s “nondel-\negation” doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act’s\n(APA) requirement for “good cause” to promulgate a rule\nwithout “notice and comment” (as the Attorney General\nhad done). See A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United\nStates, 295 U. S. 495, 529 (1935) (nondelegation doctrine);\n5 U. S. C. §§553(b)(3)(B), (d)(3) (APA). Because the Inter-\nim Rule is invalid, he added, the law must treat him like a\npre-Act offender who traveled interstate and violated the\nAct’s registration requirements before the Attorney Gen-\neral specified their applicability.\n   The District Court rejected on the merits Reynolds’ legal\nattack on the Interim Rule. But the Court of Appeals\nrejected Reynolds’ argument without reaching those mer-\nits. 380 Fed. Appx. 125 (2010). That court thought that\nthe Act’s registration requirements apply to pre-Act of-\nfenders such as Reynolds (who was subject to a pre-\nexisting state-law registration requirement) from the date\nof the new law’s enactment—even in the absence of any\nrule or regulation by the Attorney General specifying that\nthe new registration requirements apply. That being so,\nthe validity of the Interim Rule could make no legal dif-\nference, for the Act required Reynolds to follow the\nnew federal registration requirements regardless of any\nrulemaking.\n   The Courts of Appeals have reached different conclu-\nsions about whether the Act’s registration requirements\napply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time that the Attor-\n6              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nney General specifies their applicability, i.e., from July\n2006 until at least February 2007. Six Circuits have held\nthat the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to\npre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney General so\nspecifies. United States v. Johnson, 632 F. 3d 912, 922–\n927 (CA5 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F. 3d 1159,\n1162–1164 (CA9 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d\n408, 414–419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F.\n3d 222, 226–229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551\nF. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008); United States v. Madera, 528 F.\n3d 852, 856–859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam). Five Circuits\nhave held that they apply from the date of the Act’s en-\nactment, and prior to any such specification, at least with\nrespect to pre-Act offenders who had already registered\nunder state law. United States v. Fuller, 627 F. 3d 499,\n506 (CA2 2010); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F. 3d 17,\n24 (CA1 2010); United States v. Shenandoah, 595 F. 3d\n151, 163 (CA3 2010); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d\n926, 932 (CA10 2008); United States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912,\n918–919 (CA8 2008). In light of this split, we agreed to\nconsider the question.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  The question before us is whether the Act requires\npre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General\nvalidly specifies that the Act’s registration provisions ap-\nply to them. We believe that it does not. For one thing,\na natural reading of the textual language supports our\nconclusion. The text consists of four statements. See\nsupra, at 3. Statement One says that “[a] sex offender\nshall register, and keep the registration current.” State-\nment Two says that a sex offender must initially register\nbefore completing his “sentence of imprisonment” (or, if\nthe sentence does not involve imprisonment, within three\ndays of conviction). Statement Three says that the sex\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffender must update a registration within three business\ndays of any change of “name, residence, employment, or\nstudent status.” Statement Four says that “[t]he Attorney\nGeneral shall have the authority to specify the applicabil-\nity of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders\nconvicted before the enactment of this chapter.”\n   Read naturally, the Fourth Statement modifies the First.\nIt specifically deals with a subset (pre-Act offenders) of\na broad general class (all sex offenders) to which the First\nStatement applies. And it therefore should control the\nAct’s application to that subset. See Gozlon-Peretz v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 395, 407 (1991) (specific statutory\nprovision normally controls over one of more general\napplication); see also Bloate v. United States, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10) (same).\n   At the same time, the Fourth Statement says that the\nAttorney General has authority to specify the Act’s “ap-\nplicability,” not its “nonapplicability.” And it consequently\nis more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply\nthe Act, not the authority to make exceptions. That is\nhow we normally understand a term such as “authority to\nspecify” in the context of applying new rules to persons\nalready governed by pre-existing rules. If, for example,\nthe Major League Baseball Players Association and the\nteam owners agreed that the Commissioner of Baseball\n“shall have the authority to specify the applicability” to\nthe major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug\ntesting policy, we should think that the minor league\npolicy would not apply unless and until the Commissioner\nso specified.\n   For another thing, this reading of the Act efficiently\nresolves what Congress may well have thought were prac-\ntical problems arising when the Act sought to apply the\nnew registration requirements to pre-Act offenders. The\nproblems arise out of the fact that the Act seeks to make\nmore uniform a patchwork of pre-existing state systems.\n8               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDoing so could require newly registering or re-registering\n“a large number” of pre-Act offenders. That effort could\nprove expensive. And it might not prove feasible to do so\nimmediately. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38063 (recognizing these\nproblems). Congress’ concern about these problems is re-\nflected in the Act’s providing the States with three years\nto bring their systems into compliance with federal stand-\nards while permitting the Attorney General to extend that\n3-year grace period to five years. 42 U. S. C. §16924.\n   These same considerations might have warranted dif-\nferent federal registration treatment of different catego-\nries of pre-Act offenders. Cf. 73 Fed. Reg. 38035–38036,\nand 38046–38047 (final Department of Justice guidelines\nallowing States to meet Act requirements without regis-\ntering certain categories of pre-Act offenders); 76 Fed. Reg.\n1635–1636 (supplemental guidelines allowing the same).\nAt least Congress might well have so thought. And conse-\nquently, Congress might well have looked for a solution.\nAsking the Department of Justice, charged with respon-\nsibility for implementation, to examine these pre-Act\noffender problems and to apply the new registration re-\nquirements accordingly could have represented one effi-\ncient and desirable solution (though we express no view\non Reynolds’ related constitutional claim). Cf. 42 U. S. C.\n§§16912(b), 16914(a)(7), (b)(7), 16919, 16941, 16945\n(granting the Attorney General authority to administer\nvarious aspects of the Act). And that is just the solution\nthat the Act’s language says that Congress adopted.\n   Finally, our reading of the Act takes Congress to have\nfilled potential lacunae (created by related Act provisions)\nin a manner consistent with basic background principles\nof criminal law. The Second Statement, for example, says\nthat a sex offender must register before completing his\nprison term, but the provision says nothing about when a\npre-Act offender who completed his prison term pre-Act\nmust register. Although a state pre-Act offender could not\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbe prosecuted until he traveled interstate, there is no\ninterstate requirement for a federal pre-Act offender. And\nto apply the Act to either of these pre-Act offenders from\nthe date of enactment would require reading into the\nstatute, silent on the point, some kind of unsaid equiva-\nlent (e.g., registering or updating within a “reasonable\ntime” or “within three days of first post-Act travel in inter-\nstate commerce” or “as preexisting state law requires”).\n  Pre-Act offenders, aware of such complexities, lacunae,\nand difficulties, might, on their own, reach different con-\nclusions about whether, or how, the new registration\nrequirements applied to them. A ruling from the Attorney\nGeneral, however, could diminish or eliminate those un-\ncertainties, thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of\nvagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to\navoid. Cf., e.g., United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 266\n(1997) (noting that “the canon of strict construction of\ncriminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by\nso resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it\nonly to conduct clearly covered”).\n                                B\n  The Government makes three principal arguments to\nthe contrary. First, it says that our interpretation of the\nAct conflicts with one basic statutory purpose, namely, the\n“establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for\nthe registration of [sex] offenders,” 42 U. S. C. §16901,\nthat includes offenders who committed their offenses\nbefore the Act became law. The Act reflects that purpose\nwhen it defines “sex offender” broadly to include any\n“individual who was convicted of a sex offense.” §16911(1).\nAnd we have recognized that purpose in stating that, in\ngeneral, the Act’s criminal provisions apply to any pre-Act\noffender required to register under the Act who later\ntravels interstate and fails to register. See Carr, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n10              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Act’s history also reveals that many of its support-\ners placed considerable importance upon the registration\nof pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt.\n1, p. 24 (2005) (H. R. Rep.) (“[Twenty] percent of sexual\noffenders are ‘lost,’ and there is a strong public interest\nin finding them and having them register with current\ninformation to mitigate the risks of additional crimes\nagainst children”); 152 Cong. Rec. 15333 (2006) (statement\nof Sen. Cantwell) (“Child sex offenders have exploited this\nstunning lack of uniformity, and the consequences have\nbeen tragic. Twenty percent of the Nation’s 560,000 sex\noffenders are ‘lost’ because State offender registry pro-\ngrams are not coordinated well enough”); id., at 15338\n(statement of Sen. Kyl) (“There currently are over 100,000\nsex offenders in this country who are required to register\nbut are ‘off the system.’ They are not registered. The\npenalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that\nthese individuals register”); id., at 13050 (statement of\nSen. Frist) (“There are currently 550,000 registered sex\noffenders in the U. S. and at least 100,000 of them are\nmissing from the system. Every day that we don’t have\nthis national sex offender registry, these missing sex\npredators are out there somewhere”).\n   The difficulty with the Government’s argument, how-\never, is that it overstates the need for instantaneous regis-\ntration of pre-Act offenders. Our different reading, we\nconcede, involves implementation delay. But that delay\nneed not be long (the Attorney General issued his Interim\nRule 217 days after the effective date of the new law).\nAnd that delay can be justified by the need to accommo-\ndate other Act-related interests. See supra, at 7–9.\n   Second, the Government suggests that our reading leads\nto an absurd result. As it points out, the Fourth Statement\ngrants the Attorney General the “authority to specify”\nthe registration requirements’ applicability not only to\npre-Act offenders but also to those convicted prior to the\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“implementation” of the new Act “in a particular jurisdic-\ntion.” Some jurisdictions might not implement the Act\nfor up to five years. See 42 U. S. C. §16924; see also Dept. of\nJustice, Office of Justice Programs, Justice Department\nFinds 24 Jurisdictions Have Substantially Implemented\nSORNA Requirements (July 28, 2011) (stating that as\nof July 28, 2011, 14 States had implemented the\nAct’s requirements), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/\npressreleases/2011/SMART_PR-072811.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). Yet, the Government concludes, it is\nabsurd to believe that Congress would have desired so\nlong a delay in the application of its new registration\nrequirements.\n   The problem with this argument, however, is that read-\ning the two categories similarly (a matter which we need\nnot decide) would not require a long delay in applying the\nregistration requirements to post-Act offenders who com-\nmitted a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement\nthe new requirements. At most, that reading would re-\nquire the Attorney General to promulgate a rule applica-\nble to all preimplementation offenders. That rule could\nspecify that the Act’s preregistration provisions apply to\nsome or to all those offenders. And it could do so quickly,\nwell before a jurisdiction implements the Act’s require-\nments. Indeed, the Attorney General’s Interim Rule and\nthe Department of Justice’s final guidelines, both issued\nbefore any jurisdiction implemented the Act’s require-\nments, state that the Act’s requirements apply to “all sex\noffenders,” including all preimplementation offenders. See\n72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR §72.3); 73 Fed. Reg.\n38036; cf. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,\nJustice Department Announces First Two Jurisdictions\n to Implement Sex Offender Registration and Notifica-\ntion Act (Sept. 23, 2009), http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/\npressreleases/2009/SMART09154.htm.\n12              REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, the Government argues against our interpreta-\ntion on the ground that the Act says only that the At-\ntorney General “shall have the authority to specify the\napplicability” of the Act’s registration requirements to pre-\nAct offenders; it does not say that he “shall specify” or\notherwise require him to do so. The Act’s language, the\nGovernment continues, consequently gives the Attorney\nGeneral the power not to specify anything; that power is\ninconsistent with Congress’ intent to ensure the speedy\nregistration of thousands of “lost” pre-Act offenders, supra,\nat 10; and we can avoid this result only by reading the\nAct’s registration requirements as applying immedi-\nately and on their own to all pre-Act offenders (though\nthe Attorney General would have the power to make\nexceptions).\n   This argument bases too much upon too little. There is\nno reason to believe that Congress feared that the Attor-\nney General would refuse to apply the new requirements\nto pre-Act offenders. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., at 23–24; Pro-\ntecting Our Nation’s Children from Sexual Predators and\nViolent Criminals: What Needs To Be Done? Hearing\nbefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary,\n109th Cong., 1st Sess., 4–13 (2005); Office of the Press\nSec’y, The White House, President Signs H. R. 4472,\nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006\n(July 27, 2006), http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/\nnews/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html. And there was no\nneed for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic\npossibility. There is consequently no need to read the\nlanguage unnaturally as giving the Attorney General the\nauthority only to make exceptions from an implicit (un-\nstated) rule that would otherwise apply the new registra-\ntion requirements to all pre-Act offenders across the board\nand immediately.\n   Finally, we note that some lower courts have read the\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General’s specification authority as applying\nonly to those pre-Act sex offenders unable to comply with\nthe statute’s “initial registration” requirements. See 42\nU. S. C. §16913(b). That, however, is not what the statute\nsays. Rather, its Fourth Statement, §16913(d), says that\nthe Attorney General has the authority (1) to specify the\napplicability of the registration requirements to pre-Act\n(and preimplementation) offenders, “and ” (2) to prescribe\nrules for their registration, “and ” (3) to prescribe registra-\ntion rules for other categories of sex offenders who are\nunable to comply with the initial registration require-\nments. See supra, at 3. The word “and” means that the\nAttorney General’s authority extends beyond those pre-Act\n“sex offenders who are unable to comply” with the initial\nregistration requirements.\n                            III\n   For these reasons, we conclude that the Act’s registra-\ntion requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until\nthe Attorney General so specifies. Whether the Attorney\nGeneral’s Interim Rule sets forth a valid specification\nconsequently matters in the case before us. And we re-\nverse the Third Circuit’s judgment to the contrary. We\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                              So ordered.\n14              REYNOLDS v.

UNITED \n\n                   STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                       [January 23, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n   In my view, the registration requirements of the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (Act), 120 Stat.\n590, 42 U. S. C. §16901 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. III),\napply of their own force, without action by the Attorney\nGeneral. The Act’s statement that “[t]he Attorney General\nshall have the authority to specify the applicability of\nthe [registration] requirements” to pre-Act sex offenders,\n§16913(d), is best understood as conferring on the Attor-\nney General an authority to make exceptions to the oth-\nerwise applicable registration requirements.\n   To begin with, I do not share the Court’s belief that\nto “specify the applicability” more naturally means, in the\npresent context, to “make applicable” rather than to “make\ninapplicable.” See ante, at 7. The example the Court\ngives, the Commissioner of Baseball’s “ ‘authority to spec-\nify the applicability’ ” of more stringent minor-league drug\ntesting policies to the major leagues, ibid., is entirely\ninapt, because it deals with a policy that on its face is\notherwise not applicable. Since the major leagues are not\ncovered by the policies, the Commissioner’s “ ‘authority to\nspecify [their] applicability’ ” can mean nothing else but the\nauthority to render them applicable. What we have here,\nhowever, is a statute that states in unqualified terms that\n2                  REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“a sex offender shall register,” §16913(a)—and that the\nCourt rightly believes was meant to cover pre-Act offend-\ners.* The issue is whether “specify the applicability”\nmeans that no pre-Act offenders need register unless the\nAttorney General says so, or rather that the Attorney\nGeneral may excuse the unqualified requirement for pre-\nAct offenders. In that context, it seems to me that the\nlatter meaning is more natural. One specifies the applica-\nbility of an application that already exists by describing or\nrevising its contours.\n  I think it preferable to give “specify” this meaning not\nonly because here it is more natural, but also because\nthe alternative is to read the statute as leaving it up to the\nAttorney General whether the registration requirement\nwould ever apply to pre-Act offenders, even though regis-\ntration of pre-Act offenders was (as the Court acknowl-\nedges) what the statute sought to achieve. For the statute\ndoes not instruct the Attorney General to specify; it merely\ngives him “authority” to do so. In this respect, the provi-\nsion at issue here stands in marked contrast to other\nprovisions of the Act which clearly impose duties on the\nAttorney General. See, e.g., §16912(b) (“The Attorney\nGeneral shall issue guidelines and regulations to interpret\nand implement this subchapter”); §16917(b) (“The Attor-\nney General shall prescribe rules for the notification of\n[certain] sex offenders”); §16919(a) (“The Attorney General\nshall maintain a national database”); §16926(a) (“The\nAttorney General shall establish and implement a Sex\nOffender Management Assistance program”).\n——————\n   * The Court reaches this conclusion based on an inquiry into legisla-\ntive history. See ante, at 9–10. That inquiry is quite superf luous,\nhowever since the text of the Act itself makes clear that Congress\nsought to “establis[h] a comprehensive national system for the registra-\ntion of [sex offenders],” 42 U. S. C. §16901, with “sex offender” defined\nbroadly to “mea[n] an individual who was convicted of a sex offense,”\n§16911(1) (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court’s response to this—that “there was no need\nfor a mandatory requirement to avoid [the] unrealistic\npossibility” that the Attorney General would not specify,\nante, at 12—seems to me a fine answer to the question\n“What mandatory requirements must a poorly drafted\nstatute contain in order to be workable?” It is an inade-\nquate answer, however, to the question that is relevant\nhere: “Would Congress have written the provision this way\nif it wanted pre-Act offenders covered and did not think\nthey were covered absent specification by the Attorney Gen-\neral?” Intelligently drafted statutes make mandatory\nthose executive acts essential to their functioning, whether\nor not those acts would likely occur anyway. It would have\ntaken little effort (in fact, less effort) for Congress to write\n“the Attorney General shall specify the applicability”\ninstead of “the Attorney General shall have authority to\nspecify the applicability.” The latter formulation confers\ndiscretion, and it is simply implausible that the Attorney\nGeneral was given discretion to determine whether cover-\nage of pre-Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act)\nshould exist.\n   Indeed, it is not entirely clear to me that Congress\ncan constitutionally leave it to the Attorney General to\ndecide—with no statutory standard whatever governing his\ndiscretion—whether a criminal statute will or will not\napply to certain individuals. That seems to me sailing\nclose to the wind with regard to the principle that legisla-\ntive powers are nondelegable, see Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 472–476 (2001);\nLoving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 776–777 (1996)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment), and “[i]t is our settled policy to avoid an interpreta-\ntion of a federal statute that engenders constitutional\nissues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses\nno constitutional question.” Gomez v. United States, 490\nU. S. 858, 864 (1989). Construing the Act to give the\n4               REYNOLDS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nAttorney General the power to reduce congressionally\nimposed requirements fits that bill, because such a power\nis little more than a formalized version of the time-\nhonored practice of prosecutorial discretion.\n   The Court points out that there might have been need\nfor “different federal registration treatment of different\ncategories of pre-Act offenders,” ante, at 8, and that absent\na “ruling from the Attorney General” pre-Act offenders\nwould be uncertain “about whether, or how, the new regis-\ntration requirements applied to them,” ante, at 9. But\nattending to those details would certainly come within the\nAttorney General’s authority to “specify” application of the\nAct—and so would the temporary suspension of registra-\ntion requirements pending the Attorney General’s reso-\nlution of those details. And of course the uncertainty of\nwhere to register could form the basis for the Attorney\nGeneral’s exercise of his discretion not to prosecute in\nindividual cases. Neither problem, it seems to me, justi-\nfies the extraordinary interpretation that this Act does not\napply to pre-Act offenders unless and until the Attorney\nGeneral, in his discretion, says so.\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/621294/", "sha1": "47b8de3d531c4cb0d505b410e35579dd221a54b8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-01-23T07:18:40"}
