HUFF, ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n             No. 11\u2013208.   Decided January 23, 2012\n\n                                                   \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  Petitioners Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zepeda, along\nwith two other officers from the Burbank Police Depart-\nment, responded to a call from Bellarmine-Jefferson High\nSchool in Burbank, California. When the officers arrived\nat the school, the principal informed them that a stu-\ndent, Vincent Huff, was rumored to have written a letter\nthreatening to \u201cshoot up\u201d the school. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n2. The principal reported that many parents, after hear-\ning the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home.\nIbid. The principal expressed concern for the safety of her\nstudents and requested that the officers investigate the\nthreat. Id., at 42, 54\u201355.\n  In the course of conducting interviews with the principal\nand two of Vincent\u2019s classmates, the officers learned that\nVincent had been absent from school for two days and\nthat he was frequently subjected to bullying. Id., at 2. The\nofficers additionally learned that one of Vincent\u2019s class-\nmates believed that Vincent was capable of carrying out\nthe alleged threat. Id., at 44. The officers found Vincent\u2019s\nabsences from school and his history of being subjected to\nbullying as cause for concern. The officers had received\ntraining on targeted school violence and were aware that\nthese characteristics are common among perpetrators of\nschool shootings. Id., at 56\u201358, 63.\n  The officers decided to continue the investigation by\ninterviewing Vincent. When the officers arrived at Vin-\ncent\u2019s house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and\nannounced several times that the officers were with the\n2                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nBurbank Police Department. No one answered the door or\notherwise responded to Officer Zepeda\u2019s knocks. Sergeant\nRyburn then called the home telephone. The officers could\nhear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one an-\nswered. Id., at 2.\n   Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of\nVincent\u2019s mother, Mrs. Huff. When Mrs. Huff answered\nthe phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and in-\nquired about her location. Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant\nRyburn that she was inside the house. Sergeant Ryburn\nthen inquired about Vincent\u2019s location, and Mrs. Huff\ninformed him that Vincent was inside with her. Sergeant\nRyburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were\noutside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff\nhung up the phone. Id., at 2\u20133.\n   One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and Vincent walked\nout of the house and stood on the front steps. Officer\nZepeda advised Vincent that he and the other officers were\nthere to discuss the threats. Vincent, apparently aware of\nthe rumor that was circulating at his school, responded,\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here for that.\u201d Id., at 3. Sergeant\nRyburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discus-\nsion inside the house, but she refused. Ibid. In Sergeant\nRyburn\u2019s experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was\n\u201cextremely unusual\u201d for a parent to decline an officer\u2019s\nrequest to interview a juvenile inside. Id., at 3, 73\u201374.\nSergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never\nasked the officers the reason for their visit. Id., at 73\u201374.\n   After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn\u2019s request to\ncontinue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her\nif there were any guns in the house. Mrs. Huff responded\nby \u201cimmediately turn[ing] around and r[unning] into the\nhouse.\u201d Id., at 3. Sergeant Ryburn, who was \u201cscared\nbecause [he] didn\u2019t know what was in that house\u201d and had\n\u201cseen too many officers killed,\u201d entered the house behind\nher. Id., at 75. Vincent entered the house behind Ser-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ngeant Ryburn, and Officer Zepeda entered after Vincent.\nOfficer Zepeda was concerned about \u201cofficer safety\u201d and\ndid not want Sergeant Ryburn to enter the house alone.\nId., at 3. The two remaining officers, who had been stand-\ning out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer\nZepeda talked to Vincent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house\nlast, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant\nRyburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter. Id., at\n3\u20134.\n   Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the\nliving room with Mrs. Huff and Vincent. Eventually,\nVincent\u2019s father entered the room and challenged the\nofficers\u2019 authority to be there. The officers remained in-\nside the house for a total of 5 to 10 minutes. During that\ntime, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and Vincent. They\ndid not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or\nVincent, or any of their property. The officers ultimately\nconcluded that the rumor about Vincent was false, and\nthey reported their conclusion to the school. Id., at 4.\n   The Huffs brought this action against the officers under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. The complaint alleges\nthat the officers violated the Huffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment\nrights by entering their home without a warrant. Follow-\ning a 2-day bench trial, the District Court entered judg-\nment in favor of the officers. The District Court resolved\nconflicting testimony regarding Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to\nSergeant Ryburn\u2019s inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs.\nHuff \u201cimmediately turned around and ran into the house.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 3. The District Court concluded that\nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity because\nMrs. Huff\u2019s odd behavior, combined with the information\nthe officers gathered at the school, could have led reason-\nable officers to believe \u201cthat there could be weapons inside\nthe house, and that family members or the officers them-\nselves were in danger.\u201d Id., at 6. The District Court noted\nthat \u201c[w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were\n4                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconfronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to\ngrave concern about the nature of the danger they were\nconfronting.\u201d Id., at 6\u20137. With respect to this kind of\n\u201crapidly evolving incident,\u201d the District Court explained,\ncourts should be especially reluctant \u201cto fault the police for\nnot obtaining a warrant.\u201d Id., at 7.\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Dis-\ntrict Court as to the two officers who entered the house on\nthe assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but re-\nversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District\nCourt\u2019s findings of fact, but disagreed with the District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. The majority acknowledged that police\nofficers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if\nthey reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary\nto protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if\nthe officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has\nbeen or is about to be committed. Id., at 24. But the\nmajority determined that, in this case, \u201cany belief that\nthe officers or other family members were in serious, im-\nminent harm would have been objectively unreasonable\u201d\ngiven that \u201c[Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end\nher conversation with the officers and returned to her\nhome.\u201d Id., at 25.\n   Judge Rawlinson dissented. She explained that \u201cthe\ndiscrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case\nwas Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question regarding wheth-\ner there were guns in the house.\u201d Id., at 31. She faulted\nthe majority for \u201crecit[ing] a sanitized account of this\nevent\u201d that differed markedly from the District Court\u2019s\nfindings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be\ncredited. Judge Rawlinson looked to \u201ccases that specifi-\ncally address the scenario where officer safety concerns\nprompted the entry\u201d and concluded that, under the ra-\ntionale articulated in those cases, \u201ca police officer could\nhave reasonably believed that he was justified in making a\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwarrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house\nhad a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without\nanswering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.\u201d\nId., at 31, 33, 37.\n   Judge Rawlinson\u2019s analysis of the qualified immunity\nissue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a\nFourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly com-\nparable to those present in this case. On the contrary,\nsome of our opinions may be read as pointing in the oppo-\nsite direction.\n   In Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006), we\nheld that officers may enter a residence without a warrant\nwhen they have \u201can objectively reasonable basis for believ-\ning that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with\n[serious injury].\u201d We explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he need to protect\nor preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification\nfor what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437\nU. S. 385, 392 (1978)). In addition, in Georgia v. Ran-\ndolph, 547 U. S. 103, 118 (2006), the Court stated that \u201cit\nwould be silly to suggest that the police would commit a\ntort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether\nviolence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.\u201d\n   A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to\nmean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to en-\nter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for\nconcluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.\nIn this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners\nhad such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such\na conclusion. The District Court wrote:\n    \u201c[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led\n    them to be concerned for their own safety and for the\n    safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual\n    behavior of the parents in not answering the door or\n    the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire\n6                    RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n    about the reason for their visit or express concern that\n    they were investigating her son; the fact that she\n    hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that\n    she refused to tell them whether there were guns in\n    the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into\n    the house while being questioned. That behavior,\n    combined with the information obtained at the\n    school\u2014that Vincent was a student who was a victim\n    of bullying, who had been absent from school for two\n    days, and who had threatened to \u2018shoot up\u2019 the\n    school\u2014led the officers to believe that there could be\n    weapons inside the house, and that family members\n    or the officers themselves were in danger.\u201d App. to\n    Pet. for Cert. 6.\nThis belief, the District Court held, was \u201cobjectively rea-\nsonable,\u201d particularly since the situation was \u201crapidly\nevolving\u201d and the officers had to make quick decisions.\nId., at 6\u20137.\n   The panel majority\u2014far removed from the scene and\nwith the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situa-\ntion\u2014confidently concluded that the officers really had no\nreason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As\nthe panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the\nHuffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the\ndoor and announced their presence and when they called\nthe home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation\nto respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.\nThe majority attributed no significance to the fact that,\nwhen the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell\nphone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conver-\nsation. And, according to the majority, the officers should\nnot have been concerned by Mrs. Huff\u2019s reaction when\nthey asked her if there were any guns in the house be-\ncause Mrs. Huff \u201cmerely asserted her right to end her\nconversation with the officers and returned to her home.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nId., at 25.\n   Confronted with the facts found by the District Court,\nreasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have\ncome to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat\nto their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous\nreasons.\n   First, although the panel majority purported to accept\nthe findings of the District Court, it changed those find-\nings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly\nobserved, \u201cthe discrete incident that precipitated the entry\nin this case was Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question\nregarding whether there were guns in the house.\u201d Id., at\n31. The District Court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Huff \u201cimmedi-\nately turned around and ran into the house\u201d implicitly\nrejected Mrs. Huff\u2019s contrary testimony that she walked\ninto the house after telling the officers that she was going\nto get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld\nthe District Court\u2019s findings of fact and acknowledged that\nit could not reverse the District Court simply because it\n\u201cmay have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and\nother evidence in another manner.\u201d Id., at 15. But the\npanel majority\u2019s determination that petitioners were not\nentitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of\nthe facts that differed markedly from the District Court\u2019s\nfinding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff \u201cmere-\nly asserted her right to end her conversation with the\nofficers and returned to her home\u201d after telling the officers\n\u201cthat she would go get her husband.\u201d Id., at 12, 25.\n   Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the\nview that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of con-\ncern so long as it is lawful. Accordingly, the panel ma-\njority concluded that Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question\nwhether there were any guns in the house (immediately\nturning around and running inside) was not a reason for\nalarm because she was under no legal obligation to con-\n8                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntinue her conversation with the police. It should go with-\nout saying, however, that there are many circumstances in\nwhich lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.\n   Third, the panel majority\u2019s method of analyzing the\nstring of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was\nentirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate\nevent in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did\nnot give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common\nsense that a combination of events each of which is mun-\ndane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming\npicture.\n   Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District\nCourt\u2019s wise admonition that judges should be cautious\nabout second-guessing a police officer\u2019s assessment, made\non the scene, of the danger presented by a particular\nsituation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliber-\nation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreason-\nable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent.\nBut we have instructed that reasonableness \u201cmust be\njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the\nscene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight\u201d and\nthat \u201c[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allow-\nance for the fact that police officers are often forced to\nmake split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are\ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201d Graham v. Con-\nnor, 490 U. S. 386, 396\u2013397 (1989). Judged from the\nproper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a\nsplit-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding\nchain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning\nand running into the house after refusing to answer a\nquestion about guns, petitioners\u2019 belief that entry was\nnecessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was\neminently reasonable.\n   In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners\u2019 position\ncould have come to the conclusion that the Fourth\nAmendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthere was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that\nviolence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could\nhave come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found\nby the District Court.\n  The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nthe entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",

The District Court concluded that\nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity because\nMrs. Huff\u2019s odd behavior, combined with the information\nthe officers gathered at the school, could have led reason-\nable officers to believe \u201cthat there could be weapons inside\nthe house, and that family members or the officers them-\nselves were in danger.\u201d Id., at 6. The District Court noted\nthat \u201c[w]ithin a very short period of time, the officers were\n4                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nconfronted with facts and circumstances giving rise to\ngrave concern about the nature of the danger they were\nconfronting.\u201d Id., at 6\u20137. With respect to this kind of\n\u201crapidly evolving incident,\u201d the District Court explained,\ncourts should be especially reluctant \u201cto fault the police for\nnot obtaining a warrant.\u201d Id., at 7.\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Dis-\ntrict Court as to the two officers who entered the house on\nthe assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but re-\nversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District\nCourt\u2019s findings of fact, but disagreed with the District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. The majority acknowledged that police\nofficers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if\nthey reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary\nto protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if\nthe officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has\nbeen or is about to be committed. Id., at 24. But the\nmajority determined that, in this case, \u201cany belief that\nthe officers or other family members were in serious, im-\nminent harm would have been objectively unreasonable\u201d\ngiven that \u201c[Mrs. Huff] merely asserted her right to end\nher conversation with the officers and returned to her\nhome.\u201d Id., at 25.\n   Judge Rawlinson dissented. She explained that \u201cthe\ndiscrete incident that precipitated the entry in this case\nwas Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question regarding wheth-\ner there were guns in the house.\u201d Id., at 31. She faulted\nthe majority for \u201crecit[ing] a sanitized account of this\nevent\u201d that differed markedly from the District Court\u2019s\nfindings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be\ncredited. Judge Rawlinson looked to \u201ccases that specifi-\ncally address the scenario where officer safety concerns\nprompted the entry\u201d and concluded that, under the ra-\ntionale articulated in those cases, \u201ca police officer could\nhave reasonably believed that he was justified in making a\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwarrantless entry to ensure that no one inside the house\nhad a gun after Mrs. Huff ran into the house without\nanswering the question of whether anyone had a weapon.\u201d\nId., at 31, 33, 37.\n   Judge Rawlinson\u2019s analysis of the qualified immunity\nissue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a\nFourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly com-\nparable to those present in this case. On the contrary,\nsome of our opinions may be read as pointing in the oppo-\nsite direction.\n   In Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006), we\nheld that officers may enter a residence without a warrant\nwhen they have \u201can objectively reasonable basis for believ-\ning that an occupant is . . . imminently threatened with\n[serious injury].\u201d We explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he need to protect\nor preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification\nfor what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or\nemergency.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 403 (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437\nU. S. 385, 392 (1978)). In addition, in Georgia v. Ran-\ndolph, 547 U. S. 103, 118 (2006), the Court stated that \u201cit\nwould be silly to suggest that the police would commit a\ntort by entering [a residence] . . . to determine whether\nviolence . . . is about to (or soon will) occur.\u201d\n   A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to\nmean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to en-\nter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for\nconcluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.\nIn this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners\nhad such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such\na conclusion. The District Court wrote:\n    \u201c[T]he officers testified that a number of factors led\n    them to be concerned for their own safety and for the\n    safety of other persons in the residence: the unusual\n    behavior of the parents in not answering the door or\n    the telephone; the fact that Mrs. Huff did not inquire\n6                    RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n    about the reason for their visit or express concern that\n    they were investigating her son; the fact that she\n    hung up the telephone on the officer; the fact that\n    she refused to tell them whether there were guns in\n    the house; and finally, the fact that she ran back into\n    the house while being questioned. That behavior,\n    combined with the information obtained at the\n    school\u2014that Vincent was a student who was a victim\n    of bullying, who had been absent from school for two\n    days, and who had threatened to \u2018shoot up\u2019 the\n    school\u2014led the officers to believe that there could be\n    weapons inside the house, and that family members\n    or the officers themselves were in danger.\u201d App. to\n    Pet. for Cert. 6.\nThis belief, the District Court held, was \u201cobjectively rea-\nsonable,\u201d particularly since the situation was \u201crapidly\nevolving\u201d and the officers had to make quick decisions.\nId., at 6\u20137.\n   The panel majority\u2014far removed from the scene and\nwith the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situa-\ntion\u2014confidently concluded that the officers really had no\nreason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As\nthe panel majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the\nHuffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the\ndoor and announced their presence and when they called\nthe home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation\nto respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone.\nThe majority attributed no significance to the fact that,\nwhen the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell\nphone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conver-\nsation. And, according to the majority, the officers should\nnot have been concerned by Mrs. Huff\u2019s reaction when\nthey asked her if there were any guns in the house be-\ncause Mrs. Huff \u201cmerely asserted her right to end her\nconversation with the officers and returned to her home.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nId., at 25.\n   Confronted with the facts found by the District Court,\nreasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have\ncome to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat\nto their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous\nreasons.\n   First, although the panel majority purported to accept\nthe findings of the District Court, it changed those find-\nings in several key respects. As Judge Rawlinson correctly\nobserved, \u201cthe discrete incident that precipitated the entry\nin this case was Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question\nregarding whether there were guns in the house.\u201d Id., at\n31. The District Court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Huff \u201cimmedi-\nately turned around and ran into the house\u201d implicitly\nrejected Mrs. Huff\u2019s contrary testimony that she walked\ninto the house after telling the officers that she was going\nto get her husband. Id., at 3. The panel majority upheld\nthe District Court\u2019s findings of fact and acknowledged that\nit could not reverse the District Court simply because it\n\u201cmay have weighed the testimony of the witnesses and\nother evidence in another manner.\u201d Id., at 15. But the\npanel majority\u2019s determination that petitioners were not\nentitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of\nthe facts that differed markedly from the District Court\u2019s\nfinding. According to the panel majority, Mrs. Huff \u201cmere-\nly asserted her right to end her conversation with the\nofficers and returned to her home\u201d after telling the officers\n\u201cthat she would go get her husband.\u201d Id., at 12, 25.\n   Second, the panel majority appears to have taken the\nview that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of con-\ncern so long as it is lawful. Accordingly, the panel ma-\njority concluded that Mrs. Huff\u2019s response to the question\nwhether there were any guns in the house (immediately\nturning around and running inside) was not a reason for\nalarm because she was under no legal obligation to con-\n8                     RYBURN v. HUFF\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ntinue her conversation with the police. It should go with-\nout saying, however, that there are many circumstances in\nwhich lawful conduct may portend imminent violence.\n   Third, the panel majority\u2019s method of analyzing the\nstring of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was\nentirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate\nevent in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did\nnot give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common\nsense that a combination of events each of which is mun-\ndane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming\npicture.\n   Fourth, the panel majority did not heed the District\nCourt\u2019s wise admonition that judges should be cautious\nabout second-guessing a police officer\u2019s assessment, made\non the scene, of the danger presented by a particular\nsituation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliber-\nation, the panel majority concluded that it was unreason-\nable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent.\nBut we have instructed that reasonableness \u201cmust be\njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the\nscene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight\u201d and\nthat \u201c[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allow-\nance for the fact that police officers are often forced to\nmake split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are\ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201d Graham v. Con-\nnor, 490 U. S. 386, 396\u2013397 (1989). Judged from the\nproper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a\nsplit-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding\nchain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning\nand running into the house after refusing to answer a\nquestion about guns, petitioners\u2019 belief that entry was\nnecessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was\neminently reasonable.\n   In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners\u2019 position\ncould have come to the conclusion that the Fourth\nAmendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nthere was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that\nviolence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could\nhave come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found\nby the District Court.\n  The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nthe entry of judgment in favor of petitioners.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
