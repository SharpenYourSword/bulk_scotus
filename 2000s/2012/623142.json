MARCHIO, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF\n          PAULINE VIRGINIA WILLETT\n ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n          COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n       Nos. 11\u2013391 and 11\u2013394.   Decided February 21, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbi-\ntration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq., with respect to all\narbitration agreements covered by that statute. Here, the\nSupreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading\nand disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting\nthe FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implement-\ning that basic principle. The state court held unenforce-\nable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to\nclaims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against\nnursing homes.\n  The decision of the state court found the FAA\u2019s coverage\nto be more limited than mandated by this Court\u2019s previous\ncases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals\nmust be vacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to\ninterpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or\nfail to implement the rule so established. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. VI, cl. 2.\n2        MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n\n                              I\n\n   This litigation involves three negligence suits against\nnursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were brought\nby Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.\nIn each case, a family member of a patient requiring ex-\ntensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a\nnursing home on behalf of the patient. The relevant parts\nof the agreements in Brown\u2019s case and Taylor\u2019s case were\nidentical. The contracts included a clause requiring the\nparties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to col-\nlect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts\nincluded a provision holding the party filing the arbitra-\ntion responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with\nthe Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee\nschedules. The agreement in Marchio\u2019s case also included\na clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to\nthe arbitration requirement and did not mention filing\nfees.\n   In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient\nwho had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleg-\ning that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in\ndeath. A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown\nand Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate. The\nSupreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated\nthose cases with Marchio\u2019s, which was before the court on\nother issues.\n   In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court\nheld that \u201cas a matter of public policy under West Virginia\nlaw, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission\nagreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence\nthat results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall\nnot be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concern-\ning the negligence.\u201d Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp.,\nNo. 35494 (W. Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 11\u2013391, pp. 85a\u201386a (hereinafter Pet. App.). The\nstate court considered whether the state public policy was\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npre-empted by the FAA. The state court found unpersua-\nsive this Court\u2019s interpretation of the FAA, calling it \u201cten-\ndentious,\u201d id., at 51a, and \u201ccreated from whole cloth,\u201d id.,\nat 53a. It later concluded that \u201cCongress did not intend\nfor the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal\ninjury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive\nfrom a written agreement that evidences a transaction\naffecting interstate commerce, particularly where the\nagreement involves a service that is a practical necessity\nfor members of the public,\u201d id., at 84a. The court thus\nconcluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub-\nlic policy against predispute arbitration agreements that\napply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death\nagainst nursing homes.\n    The West Virginia court\u2019s interpretation of the FAA was\nboth incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in\nthe precedents of this Court. The FAA provides that a\n\u201cwritten provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transac-\ntion involving commerce to settle by arbitration a contro-\nversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. The statute\u2019s text includes\nno exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.\nIt \u201crequires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\narbitrate.\u201d Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S.\n213, 217 (1985). It \u201creflects an emphatic federal policy in\nfavor of arbitral dispute resolution.\u201d KPMG LLP v. Coc-\nchi, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3)\n(quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 631 (1985); internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n    As this Court reaffirmed last Term, \u201c[w]hen state law\nprohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule\nis displaced by the FAA.\u201d AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concep-\n4        MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncion, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6\u20137). That rule\nresolves these cases. West Virginia\u2019s prohibition against\npredispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or\nwrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate-\ngorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage\nof the FAA. See ibid. See also, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 552\nU. S. 346, 356 (2008) (FAA pre-empts state law granting\nstate commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue\nthe parties agreed to arbitrate); Mastrobuono v. Shearson\nLehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 56 (1995) (FAA pre-\nempts state law requiring judicial resolution of claims\ninvolving punitive damages); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.

S. 1, 10\n(1984) (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statute\u2019s\nprohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that\nstatute).\n                               II\n   The West Virginia court proposed an \u201calternativ[e]\u201d hold-\ning that the particular arbitration clauses in Brown\u2019s\ncase and Taylor\u2019s case were unconscionable.

See also id., at 98a (not addressing the\nquestion whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio\u2019s\ncase is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).\nIt is unclear, however, to what degree the state court\u2019s\nalternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categor-\nical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute\narbitration agreements. For example, in its discussion of\nthe alternative holding, the state court found the arbitra-\ntion clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute\narbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal\ninjury or wrongful death against nursing homes \u201cclearly\nviolates public policy.\u201d Id., at 91a.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.
