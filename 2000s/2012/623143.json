Decided February 21, 2012\n\n                                                 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  James Lambert was convicted and sentenced to death in\n1984 for the murder of two patrons during a robbery of\nPrince\u2019s Lounge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s primary witnesses at Lambert\u2019s trial\nwas Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in\nthe robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as\nhis accomplices. Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a\nclaim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court,\nalleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose,\ninter alia, a \u201cpolice activity sheet\u201d in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). This document, dated\nOctober 25, 1982, noted that a photo display containing\na picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was\nshown to two witnesses to the Prince\u2019s Lounge robbery,\nbut that \u201c[n]o identification was made.\u201d Exh. 1, App. to\nBrief in Opposition. The document further noted that\n\u201cMr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant\u201d by Jackson,\nwho was in custody at the time on several charges and had\nadmitted to involvement in at least 13 armed robberies of\nbars. Ibid. The activity sheet did not indicate whether\nJackson\u2019s reference was to the Prince\u2019s Lounge crime or\none of the others. The sheet bore the names of the law\nenforcement officers involved in the investigation of the\nPrince\u2019s Lounge robbery. It also bore the names of the\nrobbery\u2019s murder victims, as well as the police case num-\nbers for those murders. The Commonwealth has identified\n2                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nno evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any\nother robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in\nany other robbery.\n   Lambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpa-\ntory, because it suggested that someone other than or in\naddition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the\nPrince\u2019s Lounge crime. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584\nPa. 461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). Lambert also\nargued that he could have used the activity sheet to im-\npeach Jackson\u2019s testimony at trial, because the statement\nattributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identi-\nfied Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lam-\nbert. Ibid.\n   The Commonwealth countered that the asserted \u201cstate-\nment\u201d by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact\nnothing more than an \u201cambiguously worded notation.\u201d\nIbid. The Commonwealth argued that this notation sim-\nply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a \u201cco-\ndefendant\u201d in some incident, without specifying whether\nWoodlock was said to be involved in the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which\nJackson had admitted participating. In this regard, the\nCommonwealth noted that Woodlock\u2019s name was not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial\nproceedings, or Jackson\u2019s statements about the Prince\u2019s\nLounge robbery. As the Commonwealth has put it, \u201cit\nseems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a par-\nticipant in one of his many other robberies, and police\nsimply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with\nthis case.\u201d Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. The Common-\nwealth \u201cfurther note[d]\u201d that the document would not have\nadvanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had\nalready been extensively impeached at trial. Lambert, 584\nPa., at 472, 884 A. 2d, at 855. Thus, according to the\nCommonwealth, the \u201cambiguous reference to Woodlock\u201d\nwould not have discredited Jackson any further. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the\nCommonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert\u2019s\nBrady claim, holding that the disputed document was not\nmaterial. Id., at 472\u2013473, 848 A. 2d, at 855\u2013856. The\ncourt concluded that there was no reasonable probability\nthat the result of Lambert\u2019s trial would have been differ-\nent had the document been disclosed. Ibid. See Strickler\nv. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281 (1999). Calling Lambert\u2019s\nclaim that the reference to Woodlock \u201cautomatically\u201d\nmeant someone else was involved in the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery \u201cpurely speculative at best,\u201d the court noted that\n\u201cthe police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock\na potential codefendant in this case as his name is not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\u201d\n584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d, at 855. \u201cMoreover,\u201d the court\ncontinued, the document \u201cwould not have materially fur-\nthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was\nalready extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and\nReese.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth\u2019s\nfailure to disclose the document violated his rights under\nBrady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that\nthe state courts\u2019 determination that the notations \u201cwere\nnot exculpatory or impeaching\u201d was \u201creasonable.\u201d Lam-\nbert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02\u20139034 (July 24, 2007),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36. The court explained that\n\u201c[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]\nclaims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-\ntirely ambiguous, and would have required the state\ncourts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for\nLambert and material to his guilt or punishment.\u201d Id.,\nat 36.\n   On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126\n4                  WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n(2011). The Third Circuit concluded that it was \u201cpatently\nunreasonable\u201d for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to\npresume that whenever a witness is impeached in one\nmanner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-\nmaterial. Id., at 134. According to the Third Circuit, the\nnotation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a \u201cco-\ndefendant\u201d would have \u201copened an entirely new line of\nimpeachment\u201d because the prosecutor at trial had relied\non the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert\nas the third participant in the robbery. Id., at 135. The\nCommonwealth petitioned for certiorari.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a\nwrit of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state\ncourt\u2019s adjudication of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). \u201cUnder \u00a72254(d), a habeas court must deter-\nmine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state\ncourt\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possi-\nble fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments\nor theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\ndecision of this Court.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were,\nas the District Court put it, \u201cnot exculpatory or impeach-\ning\u201d but instead \u201centirely ambiguous.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 34, 36. Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on\nthe alternative ground that any impeachment value that\nmight have been obtained from the notations would have\nbeen cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts\nabout the content of the document was reasonable\u2014not\nnecessarily correct, but reasonable\u2014whatever those courts\nhad to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nbe beside the point. The failure of the Third Circuit even\nto address the \u201cambiguous\u201d nature of the notations, and\nthe \u201cspeculat[ive]\u201d nature of Lambert\u2019s reading of them, is\nespecially surprising, given that this was the basis of the\nDistrict Court ruling. Id., at 36.*\n  The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of\ncapital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the\nCommonwealth retried him within 120 days. It did so\nbecause of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had\nidentified Woodlock as a \u201cco-defendant,\u201d and bearing other\ninformation associating the sheet with the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address\nthe state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was\nambiguous and any connection to the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery speculative. That ruling\u2014on which we do not now\nopine\u2014may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity\nsheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince\u2019s\nLounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other\nsuch robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the\ninvestigation into the Prince\u2019s Lounge crime. Post, at 1 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns\nwhether Jackson\u2019s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many\nothers. The dissent also finds \u201cno suggestion\u201d that the state courts\nbelieved Jackson\u2019s reference to Woodlock \u201ccontained the argued ambi-\nguity.\u201d Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recog-\nnized the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Jackson could have named\nWoodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that\n\u201cthe Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had\nreason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his\nname is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 473, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005).\nThe only state court ruling the Third Circuit addressed\u2014the conclusion\nthat any impeachment evidence would have been cumulative\u2014was one\nthe state court introduced with \u201c[m]oreover,\u201d confirming that it was an\nalternative basis for its decision. Ibid. And the District Court certainly\nunderstood the state court decisions to have considered the reference\nambiguous. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 36.\n6                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Wood-\nlock\u2019s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nfiles, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery who were shown Woodlock\u2019s photo did not identify\nhim as involved in that crime.\n   Any retrial here would take place three decades after the\ncrime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prose-\ncution. That burden should not be imposed unless each\nground supporting the state court decision is examined\nand found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.\n   The petition for certiorari and respondent\u2019s motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, I cannot accept that the \u201cnotations\u201d at\nissue are \u201centirely ambiguous.\u201d I attach a copy of the\nrelevant police notation. See Appendix, infra. The nota-\ntion clearly refers to this case, not to some other case. It\nsets forth the file number of this investigation, the inves-\ntigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and\nthe potential witnesses of these events. It does not refer\nspecifically to any other robbery. The notation says that\n\u201c[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this\ncase],\u201d and it specifies that the \u201c[p]hoto display contained\na Lawrence WOODLOCK.\u201d In this context, the words\nmust refer to a display that included persons potentially\ninvolved in this robbery. That being so, the most natural\nreading of the statement, \u201cMr. WOODLOCK is named as\nco-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,\u201d is that it too refers\nto this murder and not to some other crime. Ibid.\n   For another thing, the Circuit did not \u201coverloo[k] the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were\n2                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . \u2018ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4 (quoting the Federal District\nCourt, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36 (emphasis added)).\nThere were no such state court \u201cdetermination[s].\u201d Ante,\nat 4. Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation\nwas not material for Brady purposes only because \u201cJack-\nson was comprehensively impeached\u201d at trial and \u201cit is not\nreasonable to believe that Jackson\u2019s further inconsistency\nfound only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his\nstatements to police would have caused the jury to dis-\ncredit him.\u201d Record 228 (emphasis added). As the itali-\ncized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any\nview about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation\nwas not ambiguous.\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the\nCommonwealth argued that the document was \u201c \u2018ambig-\nuously worded.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa.\n461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). But the court did\nnot adopt this rationale. Rather, it found the document\nnot material with respect to impeachment because \u201c[a]ny\nadditional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police\nnotation would have been cumulative.\u201d Id., at 473, 884\nA. 2d, at 856. The Third Circuit disagreed with the state\ncourts in respect to this last-mentioned holding. But this\nCourt does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this\npoint. The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylva-\nnia Supreme Court used the word \u201c \u2018speculative.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n3. But in context it is clear that the court used that word\nto refer to Lambert\u2019s claim that the notation showed that\nhe was innocent. With respect to that claim (not at issue\nhere), the court wrote: \u201c[Lambert\u2019s] claim that Jackson\u2019s\nreference to Woodlock automatically means that someone\nother than himself committed the shootings and robbery\nis purely speculative at best.\u201d 584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d,\nat 855. And it supported the \u201cspeculative\u201d nature of the\ninnocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock\u2019s name \u201cis\nnot mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfiles.\u201d Ibid. There is no suggestion that the notation\ncontained the argued ambiguity.\n   Finally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case\nagainst Lambert. See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F. 3d 126,\n135\u2013136 (CA3 2011). It pointed out that the case against\nLambert was largely based on Jackson\u2019s testimony, ex-\nplaining that \u201cwithout Jackson\u2019s statements to the police,\nthe Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on\nthese charges.\u201d Id., at 131. Yet Jackson had made \u201cfour\nprior inconsistent statements to the police about who did\nwhat and who said what on the night in question,\u201d and he\nhad admitted that his goal in testifying was \u201cto save him-\nself from a death sentence.\u201d Ibid. The Circuit could not\n\u201chelp but observe that the evidence is very strong that\nReese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that\nLambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testi-\nfied) was in the Prince\u2019s Lounge that night.\u201d Id., at 135.\nThe Circuit stated: \u201cOne wonders how the Commonwealth\ncould have based this case of first-degree murder on a\nBernard Jackson.\u201d Id., at 131. These statements suggest\nthat the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Lambert was\nunusually weak. If the Commonwealth was wrong, an\ninnocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under\nsentence of death for a crime he did not commit.\n   We do not normally consider questions of the type pre-\nsented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether\na lower court properly applied the well-established legal\nprinciples that it sets forth in its opinion. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(An \u201cintensely fact-specific case in which the court below\nunquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not\nunquestionably err\u201d is \u201cprecisely the type of case in which\nwe are most inclined to deny certiorari\u201d). And, for the\nreasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to\ngrant certiorari in this case.\n   I would deny the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n4       WETZEL v.

One of\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s primary witnesses at Lambert\u2019s trial\nwas Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in\nthe robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as\nhis accomplices. Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a\nclaim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court,\nalleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose,\ninter alia, a \u201cpolice activity sheet\u201d in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). This document, dated\nOctober 25, 1982, noted that a photo display containing\na picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was\nshown to two witnesses to the Prince\u2019s Lounge robbery,\nbut that \u201c[n]o identification was made.\u201d Exh. 1, App. to\nBrief in Opposition. The document further noted that\n\u201cMr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant\u201d by Jackson,\nwho was in custody at the time on several charges and had\nadmitted to involvement in at least 13 armed robberies of\nbars. Ibid. The activity sheet did not indicate whether\nJackson\u2019s reference was to the Prince\u2019s Lounge crime or\none of the others. The sheet bore the names of the law\nenforcement officers involved in the investigation of the\nPrince\u2019s Lounge robbery. It also bore the names of the\nrobbery\u2019s murder victims, as well as the police case num-\nbers for those murders. The Commonwealth has identified\n2                   WETZEL v.

Lambert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472626/commonwealth-v-lambert/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). Lambert also\nargued that he could have used the activity sheet to im-\npeach Jackson\u2019s testimony at trial, because the statement\nattributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identi-\nfied Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lam-\nbert. Ibid.\n   The Commonwealth countered that the asserted \u201cstate-\nment\u201d by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact\nnothing more than an \u201cambiguously worded notation.\u201d\nIbid. The Commonwealth argued that this notation sim-\nply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a \u201cco-\ndefendant\u201d in some incident, without specifying whether\nWoodlock was said to be involved in the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which\nJackson had admitted participating. In this regard, the\nCommonwealth noted that Woodlock\u2019s name was not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial\nproceedings, or Jackson\u2019s statements about the Prince\u2019s\nLounge robbery. As the Commonwealth has put it, \u201cit\nseems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a par-\nticipant in one of his many other robberies, and police\nsimply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with\nthis case.\u201d Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. The Common-\nwealth \u201cfurther note[d]\u201d that the document would not have\nadvanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had\nalready been extensively impeached at trial. Lambert, 584\nPa., at 472, 884 A. 2d, at 855. Thus, according to the\nCommonwealth, the \u201cambiguous reference to Woodlock\u201d\nwould not have discredited Jackson any further.

S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the\nCommonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert\u2019s\nBrady claim, holding that the disputed document was not\nmaterial. Id., at 472\u2013473, 848 A. 2d, at 855\u2013856. The\ncourt concluded that there was no reasonable probability\nthat the result of Lambert\u2019s trial would have been differ-\nent had the document been disclosed. Ibid. See Strickler\nv. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281 (1999). Calling Lambert\u2019s\nclaim that the reference to Woodlock \u201cautomatically\u201d\nmeant someone else was involved in the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery \u201cpurely speculative at best,\u201d the court noted that\n\u201cthe police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock\na potential codefendant in this case as his name is not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\u201d\n584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d, at 855. \u201cMoreover,\u201d the court\ncontinued, the document \u201cwould not have materially fur-\nthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was\nalready extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and\nReese.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth\u2019s\nfailure to disclose the document violated his rights under\nBrady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that\nthe state courts\u2019 determination that the notations \u201cwere\nnot exculpatory or impeaching\u201d was \u201creasonable.\u201d Lam-\nbert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02\u20139034 (July 24, 2007),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36. The court explained that\n\u201c[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]\nclaims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-\ntirely ambiguous, and would have required the state\ncourts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for\nLambert and material to his guilt or punishment.\u201d Id.,\nat 36.\n   On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126\n4                  WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n(2011). The Third Circuit concluded that it was \u201cpatently\nunreasonable\u201d for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to\npresume that whenever a witness is impeached in one\nmanner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-\nmaterial. Id., at 134. According to the Third Circuit, the\nnotation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a \u201cco-\ndefendant\u201d would have \u201copened an entirely new line of\nimpeachment\u201d because the prosecutor at trial had relied\non the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert\nas the third participant in the robbery. Id., at 135. The\nCommonwealth petitioned for certiorari.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a\nwrit of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state\ncourt\u2019s adjudication of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). \u201cUnder \u00a72254(d), a habeas court must deter-\nmine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state\ncourt\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possi-\nble fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments\nor theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\ndecision of this Court.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were,\nas the District Court put it, \u201cnot exculpatory or impeach-\ning\u201d but instead \u201centirely ambiguous.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 34, 36. Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on\nthe alternative ground that any impeachment value that\nmight have been obtained from the notations would have\nbeen cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts\nabout the content of the document was reasonable\u2014not\nnecessarily correct, but reasonable\u2014whatever those courts\nhad to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The failure of the Third Circuit even\nto address the \u201cambiguous\u201d nature of the notations, and\nthe \u201cspeculat[ive]\u201d nature of Lambert\u2019s reading of them, is\nespecially surprising, given that this was the basis of the\nDistrict Court ruling. Id., at 36.*\n  The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of\ncapital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the\nCommonwealth retried him within 120 days. It did so\nbecause of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had\nidentified Woodlock as a \u201cco-defendant,\u201d and bearing other\ninformation associating the sheet with the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address\nthe state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was\nambiguous and any connection to the Prince\u2019s Lounge\nrobbery speculative. That ruling\u2014on which we do not now\nopine\u2014may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity\nsheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince\u2019s\nLounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other\nsuch robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the\ninvestigation into the Prince\u2019s Lounge crime. Post, at 1 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns\nwhether Jackson\u2019s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many\nothers. The dissent also finds \u201cno suggestion\u201d that the state courts\nbelieved Jackson\u2019s reference to Woodlock \u201ccontained the argued ambi-\nguity.\u201d Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recog-\nnized the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Jackson could have named\nWoodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that\n\u201cthe Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had\nreason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his\nname is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\u201d\nCommonwealth v.

I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, I cannot accept that the \u201cnotations\u201d at\nissue are \u201centirely ambiguous.\u201d I attach a copy of the\nrelevant police notation. See Appendix, infra. The nota-\ntion clearly refers to this case, not to some other case. It\nsets forth the file number of this investigation, the inves-\ntigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and\nthe potential witnesses of these events. It does not refer\nspecifically to any other robbery. The notation says that\n\u201c[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this\ncase],\u201d and it specifies that the \u201c[p]hoto display contained\na Lawrence WOODLOCK.\u201d In this context, the words\nmust refer to a display that included persons potentially\ninvolved in this robbery. That being so, the most natural\nreading of the statement, \u201cMr. WOODLOCK is named as\nco-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,\u201d is that it too refers\nto this murder and not to some other crime. Ibid.\n   For another thing, the Circuit did not \u201coverloo[k] the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were\n2                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . \u2018ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4 (quoting the Federal District\nCourt, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36 (emphasis added)).\nThere were no such state court \u201cdetermination[s].\u201d Ante,\nat 4. Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation\nwas not material for Brady purposes only because \u201cJack-\nson was comprehensively impeached\u201d at trial and \u201cit is not\nreasonable to believe that Jackson\u2019s further inconsistency\nfound only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his\nstatements to police would have caused the jury to dis-\ncredit him.\u201d Record 228 (emphasis added). As the itali-\ncized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any\nview about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation\nwas not ambiguous.\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the\nCommonwealth argued that the document was \u201c \u2018ambig-\nuously worded.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Lambert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472626/commonwealth-v-lambert/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). But the court did\nnot adopt this rationale. Rather, it found the document\nnot material with respect to impeachment because \u201c[a]ny\nadditional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police\nnotation would have been cumulative.\u201d Id., at 473, 884\nA. 2d, at 856. The Third Circuit disagreed with the state\ncourts in respect to this last-mentioned holding. But this\nCourt does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this\npoint. The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylva-\nnia Supreme Court used the word \u201c \u2018speculative.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n3. But in context it is clear that the court used that word\nto refer to Lambert\u2019s claim that the notation showed that\nhe was innocent. With respect to that claim (not at issue\nhere), the court wrote: \u201c[Lambert\u2019s] claim that Jackson\u2019s\nreference to Woodlock automatically means that someone\nother than himself committed the shootings and robbery\nis purely speculative at best.\u201d 584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d,\nat 855. And it supported the \u201cspeculative\u201d nature of the\ninnocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock\u2019s name \u201cis\nnot mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

There is no suggestion that the notation\ncontained the argued ambiguity.\n   Finally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case\nagainst Lambert. See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F. 3d 126,\n135\u2013136 (CA3 2011). It pointed out that the case against\nLambert was largely based on Jackson\u2019s testimony, ex-\nplaining that \u201cwithout Jackson\u2019s statements to the police,\nthe Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on\nthese charges.\u201d Id., at 131. Yet Jackson had made \u201cfour\nprior inconsistent statements to the police about who did\nwhat and who said what on the night in question,\u201d and he\nhad admitted that his goal in testifying was \u201cto save him-\nself from a death sentence.\u201d Ibid. The Circuit could not\n\u201chelp but observe that the evidence is very strong that\nReese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that\nLambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testi-\nfied) was in the Prince\u2019s Lounge that night.\u201d Id., at 135.\nThe Circuit stated: \u201cOne wonders how the Commonwealth\ncould have based this case of first-degree murder on a\nBernard Jackson.\u201d Id., at 131. These statements suggest\nthat the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Lambert was\nunusually weak. If the Commonwealth was wrong, an\ninnocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under\nsentence of death for a crime he did not commit.\n   We do not normally consider questions of the type pre-\nsented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether\na lower court properly applied the well-established legal\nprinciples that it sets forth in its opinion. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(An \u201cintensely fact-specific case in which the court below\nunquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not\nunquestionably err\u201d is \u201cprecisely the type of case in which\nwe are most inclined to deny certiorari\u201d). And, for the\nreasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to\ngrant certiorari in this case.\n   I would deny the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n4       WETZEL v.
