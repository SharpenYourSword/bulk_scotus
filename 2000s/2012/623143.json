One of\nthe Commonwealth’s primary witnesses at Lambert’s trial\nwas Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in\nthe robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as\nhis accomplices. Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a\nclaim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court,\nalleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose,\ninter alia, a “police activity sheet” in violation of Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.

In this regard, the\nCommonwealth noted that Woodlock’s name was not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial\nproceedings, or Jackson’s statements about the Prince’s\nLounge robbery.

Id., at 472–473, 848 A. 2d, at 855–856. The\ncourt concluded that there was no reasonable probability\nthat the result of Lambert’s trial would have been differ-\nent had the document been disclosed. Ibid. See Strickler\nv. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281 (1999). Calling Lambert’s\nclaim that the reference to Woodlock “automatically”\nmeant someone else was involved in the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery “purely speculative at best,” the court noted that\n“the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock\na potential codefendant in this case as his name is not\nmentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”\n584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d, at 855. “Moreover,” the court\ncontinued, the document “would not have materially fur-\nthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was\nalready extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and\nReese.” Ibid.\n   Lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth’s\nfailure to disclose the document violated his rights under\nBrady. The District Court denied the writ, holding that\nthe state courts’ determination that the notations “were\nnot exculpatory or impeaching” was “reasonable.” Lam-\nbert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02–9034 (July 24, 2007),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36. The court explained that\n“[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]\nclaims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-\ntirely ambiguous, and would have required the state\ncourts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for\nLambert and material to his guilt or punishment.” Id.,\nat 36.\n   On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126\n4                  WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n(2011). The Third Circuit concluded that it was “patently\nunreasonable” for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to\npresume that whenever a witness is impeached in one\nmanner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-\nmaterial. Id., at 134. According to the Third Circuit, the\nnotation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a “co-\ndefendant” would have “opened an entirely new line of\nimpeachment” because the prosecutor at trial had relied\non the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert\nas the third participant in the robbery. Id., at 135. The\nCommonwealth petitioned for certiorari.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a\nwrit of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state\ncourt’s adjudication of his claim “resulted in a decision\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). “Under §2254(d), a habeas court must deter-\nmine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state\ncourt’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possi-\nble fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments\nor theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\ndecision of this Court.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were,\nas the District Court put it, “not exculpatory or impeach-\ning” but instead “entirely ambiguous.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 34, 36. Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on\nthe alternative ground that any impeachment value that\nmight have been obtained from the notations would have\nbeen cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts\nabout the content of the document was reasonable—not\nnecessarily correct, but reasonable—whatever those courts\nhad to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The failure of the Third Circuit even\nto address the “ambiguous” nature of the notations, and\nthe “speculat[ive]” nature of Lambert’s reading of them, is\nespecially surprising, given that this was the basis of the\nDistrict Court ruling. Id., at 36.*\n  The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of\ncapital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the\nCommonwealth retried him within 120 days. It did so\nbecause of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had\nidentified Woodlock as a “co-defendant,” and bearing other\ninformation associating the sheet with the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address\nthe state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was\nambiguous and any connection to the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery speculative. That ruling—on which we do not now\nopine—may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity\nsheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince’s\nLounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other\nsuch robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several\n——————\n  * The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the\ninvestigation into the Prince’s Lounge crime. Post, at 1 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns\nwhether Jackson’s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many\nothers. The dissent also finds “no suggestion” that the state courts\nbelieved Jackson’s reference to Woodlock “contained the argued ambi-\nguity.” Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recog-\nnized the Commonwealth’s argument that Jackson could have named\nWoodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that\n“the Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had\nreason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his\nname is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”\nCommonwealth v.

Ibid. And the District Court certainly\nunderstood the state court decisions to have considered the reference\nambiguous. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 36.\n6                   WETZEL v.

I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, I cannot accept that the “notations” at\nissue are “entirely ambiguous.” I attach a copy of the\nrelevant police notation. See Appendix, infra. The nota-\ntion clearly refers to this case, not to some other case. It\nsets forth the file number of this investigation, the inves-\ntigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and\nthe potential witnesses of these events. It does not refer\nspecifically to any other robbery. The notation says that\n“[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this\ncase],” and it specifies that the “[p]hoto display contained\na Lawrence WOODLOCK.” In this context, the words\nmust refer to a display that included persons potentially\ninvolved in this robbery. That being so, the most natural\nreading of the statement, “Mr. WOODLOCK is named as\nco-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,” is that it too refers\nto this murder and not to some other crime. Ibid.\n   For another thing, the Circuit did not “overloo[k] the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were\n2                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . ‘ambiguous.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting the Federal District\nCourt, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36 (emphasis added)).\nThere were no such state court “determination[s].” Ante,\nat 4. Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation\nwas not material for Brady purposes only because “Jack-\nson was comprehensively impeached” at trial and “it is not\nreasonable to believe that Jackson’s further inconsistency\nfound only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his\nstatements to police would have caused the jury to dis-\ncredit him.” Record 228 (emphasis added). As the itali-\ncized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any\nview about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation\nwas not ambiguous.\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the\nCommonwealth argued that the document was “ ‘ambig-\nuously worded.’ ” Commonwealth v. Lambert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472626/commonwealth-v-lambert/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). But the court did\nnot adopt this rationale. Rather, it found the document\nnot material with respect to impeachment because “[a]ny\nadditional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police\nnotation would have been cumulative.” Id., at 473, 884\nA. 2d, at 856. The Third Circuit disagreed with the state\ncourts in respect to this last-mentioned holding. But this\nCourt does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this\npoint. The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylva-\nnia Supreme Court used the word “ ‘speculative.’ ” Ante, at\n3. But in context it is clear that the court used that word\nto refer to Lambert’s claim that the notation showed that\nhe was innocent. With respect to that claim (not at issue\nhere), the court wrote: “[Lambert’s] claim that Jackson’s\nreference to Woodlock automatically means that someone\nother than himself committed the shootings and robbery\nis purely speculative at best.” 584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d,\nat 855. And it supported the “speculative” nature of the\ninnocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock’s name “is\nnot mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfiles.” Ibid. There is no suggestion that the notation\ncontained the argued ambiguity.\n   Finally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case\nagainst Lambert. See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F. 3d 126,\n135–136 (CA3 2011). It pointed out that the case against\nLambert was largely based on Jackson’s testimony, ex-\nplaining that “without Jackson’s statements to the police,\nthe Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on\nthese charges.” Id., at 131. Yet Jackson had made “four\nprior inconsistent statements to the police about who did\nwhat and who said what on the night in question,” and he\nhad admitted that his goal in testifying was “to save him-\nself from a death sentence.” Ibid. The Circuit could not\n“help but observe that the evidence is very strong that\nReese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that\nLambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testi-\nfied) was in the Prince’s Lounge that night.” Id., at 135.\nThe Circuit stated: “One wonders how the Commonwealth\ncould have based this case of first-degree murder on a\nBernard Jackson.” Id., at 131. These statements suggest\nthat the Commonwealth’s case against Lambert was\nunusually weak. If the Commonwealth was wrong, an\ninnocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under\nsentence of death for a crime he did not commit.\n   We do not normally consider questions of the type pre-\nsented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether\na lower court properly applied the well-established legal\nprinciples that it sets forth in its opinion. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(An “intensely fact-specific case in which the court below\nunquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not\nunquestionably err” is “precisely the type of case in which\nwe are most inclined to deny certiorari”). And, for the\nreasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to\ngrant certiorari in this case.\n   I would deny the Commonwealth’s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n4       WETZEL v.

The court explained that\n“[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert]\nclaims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-\ntirely ambiguous, and would have required the state\ncourts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for\nLambert and material to his guilt or punishment.” Id.,\nat 36.\n   On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit reversed and granted the writ. 633 F. 3d 126\n4                  WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n(2011). The Third Circuit concluded that it was “patently\nunreasonable” for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to\npresume that whenever a witness is impeached in one\nmanner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-\nmaterial. Id., at 134. According to the Third Circuit, the\nnotation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a “co-\ndefendant” would have “opened an entirely new line of\nimpeachment” because the prosecutor at trial had relied\non the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert\nas the third participant in the robbery. Id., at 135. The\nCommonwealth petitioned for certiorari.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a\nwrit of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state\ncourt’s adjudication of his claim “resulted in a decision\nthat was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica-\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). “Under §2254(d), a habeas court must deter-\nmine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state\ncourt’s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possi-\nble fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments\nor theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\ndecision of this Court.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).\n   In this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were,\nas the District Court put it, “not exculpatory or impeach-\ning” but instead “entirely ambiguous.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 34, 36. Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on\nthe alternative ground that any impeachment value that\nmight have been obtained from the notations would have\nbeen cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts\nabout the content of the document was reasonable—not\nnecessarily correct, but reasonable—whatever those courts\nhad to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The failure of the Third Circuit even\nto address the “ambiguous” nature of the notations, and\nthe “speculat[ive]” nature of Lambert’s reading of them, is\nespecially surprising, given that this was the basis of the\nDistrict Court ruling. Id., at 36.*\n  The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of\ncapital murder nearly 30 years ago, be set free unless the\nCommonwealth retried him within 120 days. It did so\nbecause of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had\nidentified Woodlock as a “co-defendant,” and bearing other\ninformation associating the sheet with the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery. The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address\nthe state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was\nambiguous and any connection to the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery speculative. That ruling—on which we do not now\nopine—may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity\nsheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince’s\nLounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other\nsuch robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several\n——————\n  * The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the\ninvestigation into the Prince’s Lounge crime. Post, at 1 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns\nwhether Jackson’s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many\nothers. The dissent also finds “no suggestion” that the state courts\nbelieved Jackson’s reference to Woodlock “contained the argued ambi-\nguity.” Post, at 3. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recog-\nnized the Commonwealth’s argument that Jackson could have named\nWoodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that\n“the Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had\nreason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his\nname is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.”\nCommonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 473, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005).\nThe only state court ruling the Third Circuit addressed—the conclusion\nthat any impeachment evidence would have been cumulative—was one\nthe state court introduced with “[m]oreover,” confirming that it was an\nalternative basis for its decision. Ibid. And the District Court certainly\nunderstood the state court decisions to have considered the reference\nambiguous. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 36.\n6                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Wood-\nlock’s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince’s Lounge\nfiles, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince’s Lounge\nrobbery who were shown Woodlock’s photo did not identify\nhim as involved in that crime.\n   Any retrial here would take place three decades after the\ncrime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prose-\ncution. That burden should not be imposed unless each\nground supporting the state court decision is examined\nand found to be unreasonable under AEDPA.\n   The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

I cannot agree.\n   For one thing, I cannot accept that the “notations” at\nissue are “entirely ambiguous.” I attach a copy of the\nrelevant police notation. See Appendix, infra. The nota-\ntion clearly refers to this case, not to some other case. It\nsets forth the file number of this investigation, the inves-\ntigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and\nthe potential witnesses of these events. It does not refer\nspecifically to any other robbery. The notation says that\n“[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this\ncase],” and it specifies that the “[p]hoto display contained\na Lawrence WOODLOCK.” In this context, the words\nmust refer to a display that included persons potentially\ninvolved in this robbery. That being so, the most natural\nreading of the statement, “Mr. WOODLOCK is named as\nco-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,” is that it too refers\nto this murder and not to some other crime. Ibid.\n   For another thing, the Circuit did not “overloo[k] the\ndetermination of the state courts that the notations were\n2                   WETZEL v. LAMBERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . ‘ambiguous.’ ” Ante, at 4 (quoting the Federal District\nCourt, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36 (emphasis added)).\nThere were no such state court “determination[s].” Ante,\nat 4. Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation\nwas not material for Brady purposes only because “Jack-\nson was comprehensively impeached” at trial and “it is not\nreasonable to believe that Jackson’s further inconsistency\nfound only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his\nstatements to police would have caused the jury to dis-\ncredit him.” Record 228 (emphasis added). As the itali-\ncized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any\nview about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation\nwas not ambiguous.\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the\nCommonwealth argued that the document was “ ‘ambig-\nuously worded.’ ” Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa.\n461, 472, 884 A. 2d 848, 855 (2005). But the court did\nnot adopt this rationale. Rather, it found the document\nnot material with respect to impeachment because “[a]ny\nadditional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police\nnotation would have been cumulative.” Id., at 473, 884\nA. 2d, at 856. The Third Circuit disagreed with the state\ncourts in respect to this last-mentioned holding. But this\nCourt does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this\npoint. The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylva-\nnia Supreme Court used the word “ ‘speculative.’ ” Ante, at\n3. But in context it is clear that the court used that word\nto refer to Lambert’s claim that the notation showed that\nhe was innocent. With respect to that claim (not at issue\nhere), the court wrote: “[Lambert’s] claim that Jackson’s\nreference to Woodlock automatically means that someone\nother than himself committed the shootings and robbery\nis purely speculative at best.” 584 Pa., at 473, 884 A. 2d,\nat 855. And it supported the “speculative” nature of the\ninnocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock’s name “is\nnot mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfiles.” Ibid. There is no suggestion that the notation\ncontained the argued ambiguity.\n   Finally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case\nagainst Lambert. See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F. 3d 126,\n135–136 (CA3 2011). It pointed out that the case against\nLambert was largely based on Jackson’s testimony, ex-\nplaining that “without Jackson’s statements to the police,\nthe Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on\nthese charges.” Id., at 131. Yet Jackson had made “four\nprior inconsistent statements to the police about who did\nwhat and who said what on the night in question,” and he\nhad admitted that his goal in testifying was “to save him-\nself from a death sentence.” Ibid. The Circuit could not\n“help but observe that the evidence is very strong that\nReese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that\nLambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testi-\nfied) was in the Prince’s Lounge that night.” Id., at 135.\nThe Circuit stated: “One wonders how the Commonwealth\ncould have based this case of first-degree murder on a\nBernard Jackson.” Id., at 131. These statements suggest\nthat the Commonwealth’s case against Lambert was\nunusually weak. If the Commonwealth was wrong, an\ninnocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under\nsentence of death for a crime he did not commit.\n   We do not normally consider questions of the type pre-\nsented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether\na lower court properly applied the well-established legal\nprinciples that it sets forth in its opinion. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(An “intensely fact-specific case in which the court below\nunquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not\nunquestionably err” is “precisely the type of case in which\nwe are most inclined to deny certiorari”). And, for the\nreasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to\ngrant certiorari in this case.\n   I would deny the Commonwealth’s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n4       WETZEL v.
