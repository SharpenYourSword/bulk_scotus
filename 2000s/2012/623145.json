Argued November 7, 2011—Decided February 21, 2012\nAn Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and\n Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction\n for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 26 U. S. C.\n §7206(1), and Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction for aiding and assisting\n in the preparation of a false tax return, §7206(2), qualified as crimes\n involving fraud or deceit under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause\n (i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deport-\n ed under §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals af-\n firmed. Holding that convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2)\n in which the Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute\n aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but\n remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima’s\n conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.\nHeld: Convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the\n Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated\n felonies pursuant to Clause (i). Pp. 3−11.\n    (a) The Kawashimas’ argument that they cannot be deported for\n the commission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes under\n §§7206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by\n Clause (i) is rejected. This Court looks to the statute defining the\n crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the\n crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 186, to deter-\n mine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses involve fraud or deceit with-\n in the meaning of Clause (i). Section 7206(1) provides that any per-\n son who “willfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which\n contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under\n the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and\n2                        KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    correct as to every material matter,” shall be guilty of a felony. Alt-\n    hough the words “fraud” and “deceit” are absent from §7206(1) and\n    are not themselves formal elements of the crime, it does not follow\n    that Mr. Kawashima’s offense falls outside Clause (i). Clause (i) is not\n    limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\n    Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or de-\n    ceit―meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudu-\n    lent or deceitful conduct. Mr. Kawashima’s conviction under §7206(1)\n    involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submit-\n    ted a tax return that was false as to a material matter. Mrs. Ka-\n    washima was convicted of violating §7206(2), which declares that any\n    person who “[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or\n    presentation . . . of a return . . . which is fraudulent or is false as to\n    any material matter” has committed a felony. She committed a felo-\n    ny involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her hus-\n    band’s filing of a materially false tax return. Pp. 3−6.\n       (b) The Kawashimas’ argument that Clause (i), when considered in\n    light of 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (Clause (ii)), must be interpret-\n    ed as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected. Clause (i) de-\n    fines “aggravated felony” to mean an offense that “involves fraud or\n    deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.”\n    Clause (ii) defines “aggravated felony” as an offense that is “described\n    in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the reve-\n    nue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.” Contrary to the Ka-\n    washimas’ claim, the difference in the clauses’ language—“revenue\n    loss to the Government” in Clause (ii) compared to “loss to the victim”\n    in Clause (i)—does not establish Congress’ intent to remove tax\n    crimes from the scope of Clause (i). By its plain language, Clause (i)\n    covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Con-\n    gress’ decision to tailor Clause (ii)’s language to match the sole type\n    of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to\n    implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)’s broad scope. Furthermore, inter-\n    preting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presump-\n    tion against superfluities. The specific inclusion of tax evasion in\n    Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the in-\n    clusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to 26\n    U. S. C. §7201 was a deportable offense. Pp. 6−10.\n       (c) The United States Sentencing Guidelines’ separate treatment of\n    tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the\n    Kawashimas’ contention that Congress did not intend to include tax\n    crimes within Clause (i). No evidence suggests that Congress consid-\n    ered the Guidelines when drafting 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M). More-\n    over, the differences between §1101(a)(43)(M) and the Guidelines un-\n    dercut any inference that Congress was incorporating the distinction\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

ERIC H.\n       HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                             [February 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns whether aliens who commit certain\nfederal tax crimes are subject to deportation as aliens\nwho have been convicted of an aggravated felony. We\nhold that violations of 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) are\ncrimes “involv[ing] fraud or deceit” under 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(i) and are therefore aggravated felonies as\nthat term is defined in the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq., when the loss to the Govern-\nment exceeds $10,000.\n                             I\n   Petitioners, Akio and Fusako Kawashima, are natives\nand citizens of Japan who have been lawful permanent\nresidents of the United States since June 21, 1984. In\n1997, Mr. Kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of will-\nfully making and subscribing a false tax return in viola-\ntion of 26 U. S. C. §7206(1). Mrs. Kawashima pleaded\nguilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the prep-\naration of a false tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C.\n§7206(2).\n   Following their convictions, the Immigration and Natu-\n2                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nralization Service charged the Kawashimas with being\ndeportable from the United States as aliens who had\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony.1 See 8 U. S. C.\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (“Any alien who is convicted of an ag-\ngravated felony at any time after admission is deporta-\nble”).2 In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress\nlisted categories of offenses that qualify as “aggravated\nfelonies” for the purpose of deportation. See §1101(a)(43).\nHere, the Government charged the Kawashimas with be-\ning deportable for committing offenses under subpara-\ngraph (M) of §1101(a)(43). That subparagraph classifies\nas an aggravated felony an offense that either: “(i) involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or vic-\ntims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of\ntitle 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000.” Hereinafter,\nwe refer to §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) as “Clause (i)” and to\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as “Clause (ii).”\n   At their deportation hearing, the Kawashimas argued\nthat their convictions under 26 U. S. C. §7206 did not\nqualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph (M).\nThe Immigration Judge disagreed and ordered removal,\nconcluding that the Kawashimas’ convictions qualified as\naggravated felonies under Clause (i). The Kawashimas\nappealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge’s\ndecision. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board to\n——————\n  1 On March 1, 2003, most of the functions of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization\nService ceased to exist.\n  2 Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the\n\ncountry: “deportation” of aliens who were already present, and “exclu-\nsion” of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country. Since 1996,\nthe Government has used a unified procedure, known as “removal,” for\nboth exclusion and deportation. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. We use\nthe terms “deportation” and “removal” interchangeably in this opinion.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreopen its decision, the Kawashimas filed petitions for\nreview of the Board’s decision in the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that “convictions for violating\n§§7206(1) and (2) in which the tax loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000 constitute aggravated felonies under\nsubsection (M)(i).” 615 F. 3d 1043, 1053 (2010). The\ncourt concluded that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction un-\nder §7206(1) qualified as an aggravated felony within\nClause (i)’s definition “because it involved ‘fraud or deceit’\nand because his offense resulted in a loss to the govern-\nment in excess of $10,000.” Id., at 1055. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit also determined that Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction\nunder §7206(2) “necessarily ‘involve[d] fraud or deceit.’ ”\nId., at 1055. But because Mrs. Kawashima’s plea agree-\nment was not in the administrative record, the Ninth\nCircuit remanded to the Board to determine whether Mrs.\nKawashima’s conviction had caused a loss to the Govern-\nment in excess of $10,000. Id., at 1056–1057.\n   We granted the Kawashimas’ petition for a writ of certi-\norari to determine whether their convictions for violations\nof 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) respectively qualify as\naggravated felonies under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). We now affirm.\n                             II\n   The Kawashimas argue that they cannot be deported for\ncommission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes\nunder §§7206(1) and (2) do not “involv[e] fraud or deceit”\nas required by Clause (i). The Kawashimas also assert\nthat their convictions under §7206 are not “aggravated\nfelonies” because tax crimes are not included within\nClause (i) at all. We address each argument in turn.\n                        A\n  The Kawashimas contend that their offenses of convic-\n4                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion do not fall within the scope of Clause (i) because\nneither “fraud” nor “deceit” is a formal element of a con-\nviction under §7206(1) or §7206(2). The Government\nresponds that the Kawashimas’ convictions necessarily in-\nvolved deceit because they required a showing that the\nKawashimas willfully made materially false statements.\nTo determine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses “involv[e]\nfraud or deceit” within the meaning of Clause (i), we em-\nploy a categorical approach by looking to the statute defin-\ning the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts\nunderlying the crime. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,\n549 U. S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the approach set forth\nin Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–600 (1990)).\nIf the elements of the offenses establish that the Ka-\nwashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,\nthen the first requirement of Clause (i) is satisfied.3\n   Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C.\n§7206(1), which provides that any person who “[w]illfully\nmakes and subscribes any return, statement, or other\ndocument, which contains or is verified by a written decla-\nration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and\nwhich he does not believe to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter,” shall be guilty of a felony. Mr. Ka-\nwashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation\nof §7206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in ques-\ntion was false as to a material matter, that the defendant\ndid not believe the document to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter, and that he acted willfully with the\nspecific intent to violate the law. See, e.g., United States v.\nAramony, 88 F. 3d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v.\nKaiser, 893 F. 2d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.\n\n——————\n    3 We\n       note that the issue whether the Kawashimas’ offenses satisfy\nthe second requirement of Clause (i)—that the loss to the victim ex-\nceeded $10,000—is not before us. We address only whether their\noffenses of conviction qualify as crimes “involv[ing] fraud or deceit.”\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMarabelles, 724 F. 2d 1374, 1380 (CA9 1984); United\nStates v. Whyte, 699 F. 2d 375, 381 (CA7 1983). Although\nthe words “fraud” and “deceit” are absent from the text of\n§7206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the\ncrime, it does not follow that his offense falls outside of\nClause (i). The scope of that clause is not limited to of-\nfenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\nRather, Clause (i) refers more broadly to offenses that\n“involv[e]” fraud or deceit—meaning offenses with ele-\nments that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful\nconduct.\n   When subparagraph (M) was enacted, the term “deceit”\nmeant a “the act or process of deceiving (as by falsification,\nconcealment, or cheating).” Webster’s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 584 (1993). Mr. Kawashima’s conviction\nunder §7206(1) establishes that he knowingly and willfully\nsubmitted a tax return that was false as to a material\nmatter. He therefore committed a felony that involved\n“deceit.”\n   Turning to Mrs. Kawashima, our analysis follows a\nsimilar path. Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating\n26 U. S. C. §7206(2), which declares that any person who\n“[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or presen-\ntation under, or in connection with any matter arising\nunder, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit,\nclaim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as\nto any material matter,” has committed a felony. Mrs.\nKawashima does not dispute that the elements of a viola-\ntion of §7206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in\nquestion was false as to a material matter and that the\ndefendant acted willfully. See Aramony, supra, at 1382;\nUnited States v. Sassak, 881 F. 2d 276, 278 (CA6 1989);\nUnited States v. Hooks, 848 F. 2d 785, 788–789 (CA7\n1988); United States v. Dahlstrom, 713 F. 2d 1423, 1426–\n1427 (CA9 1983). We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima’s\nconviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully\n6                  KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassisting her husband’s filing of a materially false tax\nreturn, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that\ninvolved “deceit.”\n  The language of Clause (i) is clear. Anyone who is con-\nvicted of an offense that “involves fraud or deceit in which\nthe loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” has\ncommitted an aggravated felony and is subject to depor-\ntation pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The ele-\nments of willfully making and subscribing a false corpo-\nrate tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(1), and of\naiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax re-\nturn, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(2), establish that\nthose crimes are deportable offenses because they neces-\nsarily entail deceit.\n                            B\n   The Kawashimas’ second argument is based on infer-\nences drawn from the interaction of Clause (i) and\nClause (ii). The full text of subparagraph (M) reads as\nfollows:\n\n\n     “(43) The term ‘aggravated felony’ means—\n          .           .           .           .           .\n    “(M) an offense that—\n    “(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n    “(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\n    tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Govern-\n    ment exceeds $10,000.”\nThe Kawashimas argue that when Clause (i) is read to-\ngether with Clause (ii), Clause (i) must be interpreted as\nbeing inapplicable to tax crimes. In their view, subpara-\ngraph (M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates\nthat Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive\ncategories of crimes in subparagraph (M)’s two clauses:\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngeneral, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that\ncause actual losses to real victims in Clause (i), and\ntax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government\nin Clause (ii). For the reasons discussed below, this\nargument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause\n(i), which encompasses the Kawashimas’ offenses of\nconviction.\n                              1\n  The Kawashimas contend that textual differences be-\ntween Clauses (i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended\nto exclude tax crimes from Clause (i). Specifically, they\nnote that Clause (i) addresses “loss to the victim,” whereas\nClause (ii) addresses “revenue loss to the Government.”\n  This difference in language does not establish Congress’\nintent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).\nClause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve\nfraud or deceit. Clause (i) thus uses correspondingly broad\nlanguage to refer to the wide range of potential losses and\nvictims. Clause (ii), on the other hand, is limited to the\nsingle type of offense “described in section 7201 of title 26\n(relating to tax evasion),” which, by definition, can only\ncause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim\n(the Government). Congress’ decision to tailor Clause (ii)’s\nlanguage to match the sole type of offense covered by\nClause (ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also in-\ntended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of\nClause (i)’s plain language.\n                             2\n  Next, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting\nClause (i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption\nagainst superfluities by rendering Clause (ii) completely\nredundant to Clause (i). Clause (ii) explicitly states that\nconvictions for tax evasion pursuant to 26 U. S. C. §7201\nthat cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Gov-\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernment are aggravated felonies. The Kawashimas assert\nthat, if Clause (i) applies to tax crimes, then qualifying\nconvictions for tax evasion under Clause (ii) would also\nqualify as aggravated felonies under Clause (i), because\ntax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit. To but-\ntress this argument, the Kawashimas point to a body of\nlaw providing that a conviction for tax evasion under\n§7201 collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from\ncontesting a civil penalty under 26 U. S. C. §6663(b) for\n“underpayment . . . attributable to fraud.” See, e.g., Gray\nv. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6 1983) (“Numer-\nous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal\nincome tax evasion, either upon a plea of guilty, or upon\na jury verdict of guilt, conclusively establishes fraud in a\nsubsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application\nof the doctrine of collateral estoppel”). Therefore, accord-\ning to the Kawashimas, if Clause (i) covers tax offenses,\nthen Clause (ii) is mere surplusage.\n   We disagree with the Kawashimas’ contention that the\nspecific mention of one type of tax crime in Clause (ii)\nimpliedly limits the scope of Clause (i)’s plain language,\nwhich extends to any offense that “involves fraud or de-\nceit.” We think it more likely that Congress specifically\nincluded tax evasion offenses under 26 U. S. C. §7201 in\nClause (ii) to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.\n   Several considerations support this conclusion. Like\n§§7206(1) and (2), §7201 does not, on its face, mention\nfraud or deceit. Instead, §7201 simply provides that “[a]ny\nperson who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or\ndefeat any tax imposed by [the Internal Revenue Code] or\nthe payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties\nprovided by law, be guilty of a felony.” Accordingly, nei-\nther fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction\nunder §7201, which include: (1) willfulness; (2) the exist-\nence of a tax deficiency; and (3) an affirmative act consti-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntuting an evasion or an attempted evasion of the tax.\nBoulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424, n. 2 (2008).\nA conviction under §7201, therefore, only qualifies as an\naggravated felony under Clause (i) if a willful, affirmative\nattempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.\n   This Court’s decision in United States v. Scharton, 285\nU. S. 518 (1932), gave Congress good reason to doubt that\na conviction under §7201 satisfies that condition. In\nScharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to\nevade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable\nincome. The question before the Court was whether the\ncrime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations\ngenerally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was\ninstead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations appli-\ncable to “ ‘offenses involving the defrauding or attempting\nto defraud the United States or any agency thereof,\nwhether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.’ ” Id., at\n520, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe Government argued that the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions applied because “fraud is implicit in the concept of\nevading or defeating” and because any effort to evade a tax\nis tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.\n285 U. S., at 520–521. The Court rejected that argument,\nnoting that, in an indictment for evasion, “an averment [of\nintent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be\nsufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade\nor defeat.” Id., at 521.\n   Moreover, §7201 includes two offenses: “the offense of\nwillfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a\ntax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade\nor defeat the payment of a tax.” Sansone v. United States,\n380 U. S. 343, 354 (1965) (emphasis in original). As the\nGovernment notes, it is possible to willfully evade or de-\nfeat payment of a tax under §7201 without making any\nmisrepresentation. For example, §7201 can be violated by\na taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also\n10                KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his\nassets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nAlthough the Government concedes that evasion-of-\npayment cases will almost invariably involve some affirm-\native acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the ele-\nments of tax evasion pursuant to §7201 do not necessarily\ninvolve fraud or deceit. Thus, we conclude that the specif-\nic inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) was intended to\nensure that tax evasion pursuant to §7201 was a deporta-\nble offense. Clause (ii) does not implicitly remove all other\ntax offenses from the scope of Clause (i)’s plain language.\n                               3\n   The Kawashimas also assert that the separate treat-\nment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit\nin the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their\ncontention that Congress did not intend to include tax\ncrimes within Clause (i). They point to the fact that, in\n1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included\nwithin the Guidelines a category of “offenses involving\nfraud or deceit.” USSG §§2F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effec-\ntive Nov. 1, 2001). The Commission simultaneously in-\ncluded “offenses involving taxation” as a separate category.\n§§2T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011). Although the Kawashimas\nacknowledge that they have found no evidence that Con-\ngress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend\nthat “it is likely that the language of [Clause (i)] and\n[Clause (ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines” by\nthe sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of\naggravated felony to include subparagraph (M). Brief for\nPetitioners 29. Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer\nfrom the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress\ndid not intend Clause (i) to include tax crimes.\n   We reject the Kawashimas’ reliance on the Guidelines.\nThe Kawashimas’ argument is at odds with the fact that,\nunlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause (ii)\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes not refer to all offenses “involving taxation.” Rather,\nClause (ii) is expressly limited to tax evasion offenses\nunder §7201. That textual difference undercuts any infer-\nence that Congress was considering, much less incorporat-\ning, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.\n                                C\n  Finally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph (M)’s\ntreatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambigu-\nous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in\ntheir favor. It is true that we have, in the past, construed\nambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien’s favor.\nSee INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001). We think\nthe application of the present statute clear enough that\nresort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.\n                        *     *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that convictions\nunder 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggra-\nvated felonies pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).\nBecause the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as\naliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies\npursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. C.\n§7206(1). His wife, petitioner Fusako Kawashima, was\nconvicted under §7206(2) of assisting her husband in\npreparing the false return. The question presented is\nwhether a conviction under §7206 is an “aggravated felo-\nny” that renders the Kawashimas deportable from the\nUnited States. See 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   Congress has defined “aggravated felony” to include,\ninter alia, offenses that “(i) involv[e] fraud or deceit in\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” or\n“(ii) [are] described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\ntax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000.” §1101(a)(43)(M). The Kawashimas\nargue that tax offenses triggering deportation are deline-\nated exclusively in §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (or Clause (ii)), and\nthat §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (or Clause (i)) does not encompass\ntax crimes. The Court rejects this argument, and holds\nthat any tax offense “involv[ing] fraud or deceit,” if the loss\nto the fisc exceeds $10,000, ranks as an “aggravated fel-\nony.” See ante, at 11. Because the Kawashimas’ tax of-\nfense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,\nthe Court concludes, they have committed an aggravated\n2                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfelony and are therefore deportable.\n   The Court’s construction of the statute is dubious, as\nI see it. For one thing, it effectively renders Clause (ii)\nsuperfluous. Further, the Court’s reading sweeps a wide\nvariety of federal, state, and local tax offenses—including\nmisdemeanors—into the “aggravated felony” category. In\naddition, today’s decision may discourage aliens from\npleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,\nthereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the\ninternal revenue laws. I conclude that Clause (i) does not\naddress tax offenses, and would therefore hold that mak-\ning a false statement on a tax return in violation of §7206\nis not an “aggravated felony.”\n                             I\n  Any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony” after\nadmission to the United States is deportable. 8 U. S. C.\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Subparagraph (M) of §1101(a)(43)\nincludes as an “aggravated felony”:\n    “an offense that—\n      “(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n      “(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating\n    to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Gov-\n    ernment exceeds $10,000.”\n   Notably, Clause (i) speaks of “loss to the victim,” Clause\n(ii) of “revenue loss to the Government.” The Kawashimas\ncontend that Clause (i) covers crimes of fraud or deceit\ncausing losses unrelated to tax revenue. Tax crimes,\nthey argue, are addressed exclusively in Clause (ii), and\nthat clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by 26\nU. S. C. §7201 as an “aggravated felony.” Willfully sub-\nmitting a false statement proscribed by §7206, the\nKawashimas maintain, is not an “aggravated felony”\nthat would render them deportable under 8 U. S. C.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   The Government contends that Clause (i) covers all\ntax offenses involving fraud or deceit, and that Congress\nincluded Clause (ii) out of caution, to make certain that\npersons convicted of tax evasion would be subject to depor-\ntation. Under the Government’s construction, because the\ncrime of making a false statement on a tax return involves\n“fraud” or “deceit,” the Kawashimas committed an aggra-\nvated felony. See ante, at 5 (“the words ‘fraud’ and ‘deceit’\nare absent from the text of §7206(1) and are not them-\nselves formal elements of the crime,” nonetheless, “[the]\nelements [of a §7206 crime] necessarily entail fraudulent\nor deceitful conduct”).\n   The Court’s task is to determine which reading of\nthe statute is correct. If the two proffered constructions of\nsubparagraph (M) are plausible in roughly equal measure,\nthen our precedent directs us to construe the statute in\nthe Kawashimas’ favor. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333\nU. S. 6, 10 (1948) (“We resolve the doubts in favor of [the\nalien] because deportation is a drastic measure . . . .”); INS\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001) (same).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\nIn interpreting 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M), I would rely\n\nupon the familiar canon that statutes should be interpret-\ned to avoid superfluity. See Corley v. United States, 556 \n\nU. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,\n101 (2004) (“[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons” is\nthat a “statute should be construed so that effect is given\nto all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or\nsuperfluous, void or insignificant . . . .”)). If Clause (i) is\nconstrued to apply to tax crimes, then Clause (ii)’s discrete\ninclusion of tax evasion would add nothing, for tax evasion\nis itself an offense that, in all actual instances of which\nthe Government is aware, “involves fraud or deceit.” See\n4                    KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(i); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.\n   The elements of tax evasion are the existence of a tax\ndeficiency, willfulness, and “an affirmative act constitut-\ning an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.” Sansone\nv. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351 (1965). As this Court’s\ndecisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or\nfraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax\nliability or misleading the Government as to the extent of\nthe liability. See, e.g., Spies v. United States, 317 U. S.\n492, 499 (1943) (an act of tax evasion may be “any con-\nduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to\nconceal”). Accordingly, courts have determined that tax\nevasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessari-\nly involves fraud. See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d\n1081, 1085, n. 7 (CA9 2005) (fraud is “implicit in the na-\nture of the crime” of tax evasion); Considine v. United\nStates, 683 F. 2d 1285, 1287 (CA9 1982) (“The express\nlanguage of section 7201 requires an intent to avoid tax (a\nlegitimate synonym for fraud).”); Costello v. INS, 311 F. 2d\n343, 348 (CA2 1962) (“There can be no ‘wilful’ [tax] eva-\nsion without a specific intent to defraud.”), rev’d on other\ngrounds, 376 U. S. 120 (1964).\n   Even more to the point, courts have held that a convic-\ntion for tax evasion under 26 U. S. C. §7201 “conclusively\nestablishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceed-\ning.” Gray v. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6\n1983); see Klein v. Commissioner, 880 F. 2d 260, 262\n(CA10 1989) (conviction under 7201 “collaterally estops a\ntaxpayer from denying fraud [in a] civil tax case involving\nthe same years”).1 This preclusive effect obtains, courts\nhave explained, because “ ‘willful’ [tax evasion] includes all\nof the elements of fraud.” Tomlinson v. Lefkowitz, 334\n——————\n  1 See also, e.g., Blohm v. Commissioner, 994 F. 2d 1542, 1554 (CA11\n\n1993); Fontneau v. United States, 654 F. 2d 8, 10 (CA1 1981)\n(per curiam); Plunkett v.

United States, 360 F. 2d 353, 356\n(CA4 1966) (“[W]hile the criminal evasion statute does not\nexplicitly require a finding of fraud, the case-by-case pro-\ncess of construction of the civil [fraud] and criminal tax\nprovisions has demonstrated that their constituent ele-\nments are identical.”).\n   Tax offenses span a wide range, from failure to file a tax\nreturn, 26 U. S. C. §7203, to the unauthorized use of tax\nstamps, §7209. But “the gravest of offenses against the\nrevenues,” this Court has said, the “capstone” of tax law\nviolations, is tax evasion. Spies, 317 U. S., at 497, 499;\nsee Boulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424 (2008).\nTellingly, the Kawashimas pleaded guilty to a crime carry-\ning a maximum prison term of three years, §7206; for tax\nevasion, the maximum term is five years, §7201. It is thus\nunderstandable that Congress would single out tax eva-\nsion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and\nno other tax crime, an “aggravated felony” for deportation\npurposes.\n   The Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).\nTax evasion, made criminal by §7201, the Court states,\n“almost invariably,” but “not necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud\nor deceit.” Ante, at 10. But see supra, at 4 and this page.\nCongress likely included Clause (ii), the Court suggests,\nsimply “to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.” Ante, at 8. In other words, in\nholding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court\nfinds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.\n   In support of the notion that tax evasion can occur\nwithout fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v.\nScharton, 285 U. S. 518 (1932); see ante, at 9. In that\nlong-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government’s\nplea for the application of an extended limitation period to\na prosecution for tax evasion. The generally applicable\n6                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nstatute of limitations was three years; for tax offenses that\ninvolve defrauding the United States, however, the limita-\ntion period was six years. An averment of intent to de-\nfraud, the Court said in Scharton, would be “surplusage,”\nfor it would suffice “to plead and prove a wilful attempt to\nevade or defeat.” 285 U. S., at 521.\n   Courts had limited Scharton to its statute of limita-\ntions context several decades before Congress enacted\n§1101(a)(43)(M) in 1994. See Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 247\nF. 2d 929, 936, n. 6 (CA9 1957) (distinguishing Scharton\nand holding that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude\nbecause it entails fraud); Lefkowitz, 334 F. 2d, at 265\n(distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion\nnecessarily involves fraud). Moreover, Congress, since\n1954, has expressly prescribed a six-year limitation period\nfor tax evasion. See 26 U. S. C. §6531(2). In short, Schar-\nton is a cryptic, thinly reasoned opinion, one that did not\ninfluence subsequent federal-court description of the crime\nof tax evasion. The suggestion that Congress may have\nworried about Scharton when framing legislation over 60\nyears later is hardly credible.\n   The Court presents another reason, drawn from the\nGovernment’s brief, why Congress may have treated tax\nevasion discretely, while embracing tax crimes generally\nwithin the Clause (i) category. Section 7201 covers both\nevasion of assessment and evasion of payment. Imagine a\ntaxpayer who files a truthful return, then moves her as-\nsets to a place “beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue\nService.” Ante, at 10; see Brief for Respondent 34. The\nCourt acknowledges that evasion-of-payment cases almost\nalways “involve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit.”\nAnte, at 10. Still, there may be a rare case in which that is\nnot so. Rare, indeed; imaginary would be an apt char-\nacterization.    The Government conceded that, to its\nknowledge, there have been no actual instances of indict-\nments for tax evasion unaccompanied by any act of fraud\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nor deceit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.\n   The canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid su-\nperfluity cannot be skirted as easily as the Government\nhere urges. We have declined to interpret legislation in\na way that “would in practical effect render [a provision]\nentirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circum-\nstances.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). It\nis hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a\ncase in which the provision might have some independent\nrole. See id., at 30. Where, as here, “the Government\nconcede[s] that the independent function one could attrib-\nute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,” a construction\nmoored to a case “most unlikely” to exist should be reject-\ned. Id., at 31. It is highly improbable that “a pro-\nviso accounting for more than half of [the] text” of\n§1101(a)(43)(M), i.e., Clause (ii), “would lie dormant in all\nbut the most unlikely situations.” See 534 U. S., at 31.\n   Congress’ aim in drafting §1101(a)(43) was to determine\nwhich crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant the “dras-\ntic measure” of deportation, and which are not. See Fong\nHaw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10. It is implausible that Con-\ngress, when drafting §1101(a)(43)(M), intended to address,\nor was even aware of, the Government’s scenario: a tax-\npayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collec-\ntion of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore. Far\nmore likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offens-\nes in §1101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision\nto address fraudulent schemes against private victims,\nthen added §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the “capstone” tax\noffense against the Government also qualified as an ag-\ngravated felony. See supra, at 5.\n                            B\n  The Court’s construction of the statute is even less\nplausible given the numerous offenses it would rank as\n“aggravated felon[ies].” Many federal tax offenses, like 26\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. §7206, involve false statements or misleading\nconduct. See, e.g., §7202 (failing to truthfully account for\nand pay taxes owed). Conviction of any of these offenses,\nif the Court’s construction were correct, would render an\nalien deportable. So would conviction of state and local\ntax offenses involving false statements. Ferreira v. Ash-\ncroft, 390 F. 3d 1091, 1096–1097 (CA9 2004) (state-law\noffenses qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit under\n8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)); see, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n30, §574 (2009) (submitting a tax return false as to any\nmaterial matter is a criminal offense); D. C. Code §47–\n4106 (2001–2005) (same); Ala. Code §40–29–114 (2003)\n(same); Va. Code Ann. §58.1–1815 (2009) (willfully failing\nto account truthfully for and pay certain taxes is a crimi-\nnal offense).\n   Rendering all tax offenses involving false statements\n“aggravated felon[ies]” that subject an alien to deportation\nis all the more problematic, for many of these offenses are\nmisdemeanors. Among federal misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26\nU. S. C. §7204 (“furnish[ing] a false” W-2 form to an em-\nployee); §7205 (“suppl[ying] false or fraudulent infor-\nmation” to an employer); §7207 (filing a return “known . . .\nto be false as to any material matter”). On the state and\nlocal level, see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax.

It is often\neasier for the Government to obtain a conviction under\n§7206 (false statements) than under §7201 (tax evasion).\nSee United States v. Olgin, 745 F. 2d 263, 272 (CA3 1984)\n(unlike a conviction under §7201, a conviction under §7206\ndoes not require proof of a tax deficiency); Considine, 683\nF. 2d, at 1287 (unlike a conviction under §7201, a convic-\ntion under §7206 does not require proof of an attempt to\nescape a tax). For this reason, the Government has al-\nlowed taxpayers to plead guilty to a §7206 charge in lieu of\ngoing to trial under §7201 on an evasion charge. See\nWalters Brief 19–20. Deportation consequences are im-\nportant to aliens facing criminal charges. See Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10)\n(“[P]reserving the client’s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.” (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322)). If a §7206 charge carries the same prospect of\ndeportation as a §7201 charge, then an alien’s incentive to\nplead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.\n\n\n——————\n  2 One might also ask what reason Congress would have for making a\n\ntax misdemeanor a deportable offense, while more serious crimes do not\njeopardize an alien’s residency in the United States. See, e.g., Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11–12 (2004) (driving while drunk, causing\nserious bodily injury to others is not an aggravated felony).\n10                KAWASHIMA v.

Argued November 7, 2011—Decided February 21, 2012\nAn Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and\n Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction\n for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 26 U. S. C.\n §7206(1), and Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction for aiding and assisting\n in the preparation of a false tax return, §7206(2), qualified as crimes\n involving fraud or deceit under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause\n (i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deport-\n ed under §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals af-\n firmed. Holding that convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2)\n in which the Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute\n aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but\n remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima’s\n conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.\nHeld: Convictions under 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the\n Government’s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated\n felonies pursuant to Clause (i). Pp. 3−11.\n    (a) The Kawashimas’ argument that they cannot be deported for\n the commission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes under\n §§7206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by\n Clause (i) is rejected. This Court looks to the statute defining the\n crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the\n crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 186, to deter-\n mine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses involve fraud or deceit with-\n in the meaning of Clause (i). Section 7206(1) provides that any per-\n son who “willfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which\n contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under\n the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and\n2                        KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    correct as to every material matter,” shall be guilty of a felony. Alt-\n    hough the words “fraud” and “deceit” are absent from §7206(1) and\n    are not themselves formal elements of the crime, it does not follow\n    that Mr. Kawashima’s offense falls outside Clause (i). Clause (i) is not\n    limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\n    Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or de-\n    ceit―meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudu-\n    lent or deceitful conduct. Mr. Kawashima’s conviction under §7206(1)\n    involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submit-\n    ted a tax return that was false as to a material matter. Mrs. Ka-\n    washima was convicted of violating §7206(2), which declares that any\n    person who “[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or\n    presentation . . . of a return . . . which is fraudulent or is false as to\n    any material matter” has committed a felony. She committed a felo-\n    ny involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her hus-\n    band’s filing of a materially false tax return. Pp. 3−6.\n       (b) The Kawashimas’ argument that Clause (i), when considered in\n    light of 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (Clause (ii)), must be interpret-\n    ed as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected. Clause (i) de-\n    fines “aggravated felony” to mean an offense that “involves fraud or\n    deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.”\n    Clause (ii) defines “aggravated felony” as an offense that is “described\n    in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the reve-\n    nue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.” Contrary to the Ka-\n    washimas’ claim, the difference in the clauses’ language—“revenue\n    loss to the Government” in Clause (ii) compared to “loss to the victim”\n    in Clause (i)—does not establish Congress’ intent to remove tax\n    crimes from the scope of Clause (i). By its plain language, Clause (i)\n    covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Con-\n    gress’ decision to tailor Clause (ii)’s language to match the sole type\n    of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to\n    implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)’s broad scope. Furthermore, inter-\n    preting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presump-\n    tion against superfluities. The specific inclusion of tax evasion in\n    Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the in-\n    clusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to 26\n    U. S. C. §7201 was a deportable offense. Pp. 6−10.\n       (c) The United States Sentencing Guidelines’ separate treatment of\n    tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the\n    Kawashimas’ contention that Congress did not intend to include tax\n    crimes within Clause (i). No evidence suggests that Congress consid-\n    ered the Guidelines when drafting 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M). More-\n    over, the differences between §1101(a)(43)(M) and the Guidelines un-\n    dercut any inference that Congress was incorporating the distinction\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

ERIC H.\n       HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                             [February 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns whether aliens who commit certain\nfederal tax crimes are subject to deportation as aliens\nwho have been convicted of an aggravated felony. We\nhold that violations of 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) are\ncrimes “involv[ing] fraud or deceit” under 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(i) and are therefore aggravated felonies as\nthat term is defined in the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq., when the loss to the Govern-\nment exceeds $10,000.\n                             I\n   Petitioners, Akio and Fusako Kawashima, are natives\nand citizens of Japan who have been lawful permanent\nresidents of the United States since June 21, 1984. In\n1997, Mr. Kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of will-\nfully making and subscribing a false tax return in viola-\ntion of 26 U. S. C. §7206(1). Mrs. Kawashima pleaded\nguilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the prep-\naration of a false tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C.\n§7206(2).\n   Following their convictions, the Immigration and Natu-\n2                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nralization Service charged the Kawashimas with being\ndeportable from the United States as aliens who had\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony.1 See 8 U. S. C.\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (“Any alien who is convicted of an ag-\ngravated felony at any time after admission is deporta-\nble”).2 In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress\nlisted categories of offenses that qualify as “aggravated\nfelonies” for the purpose of deportation. See §1101(a)(43).\nHere, the Government charged the Kawashimas with be-\ning deportable for committing offenses under subpara-\ngraph (M) of §1101(a)(43). That subparagraph classifies\nas an aggravated felony an offense that either: “(i) involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or vic-\ntims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of\ntitle 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000.” Hereinafter,\nwe refer to §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) as “Clause (i)” and to\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as “Clause (ii).”\n   At their deportation hearing, the Kawashimas argued\nthat their convictions under 26 U. S. C. §7206 did not\nqualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph (M).\nThe Immigration Judge disagreed and ordered removal,\nconcluding that the Kawashimas’ convictions qualified as\naggravated felonies under Clause (i). The Kawashimas\nappealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge’s\ndecision. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board to\n——————\n  1 On March 1, 2003, most of the functions of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization\nService ceased to exist.\n  2 Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the\n\ncountry: “deportation” of aliens who were already present, and “exclu-\nsion” of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country. Since 1996,\nthe Government has used a unified procedure, known as “removal,” for\nboth exclusion and deportation. See 8 U. S. C. §§1229, 1229a. We use\nthe terms “deportation” and “removal” interchangeably in this opinion.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreopen its decision, the Kawashimas filed petitions for\nreview of the Board’s decision in the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that “convictions for violating\n§§7206(1) and (2) in which the tax loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000 constitute aggravated felonies under\nsubsection (M)(i).” 615 F. 3d 1043, 1053 (2010). The\ncourt concluded that Mr. Kawashima’s conviction un-\nder §7206(1) qualified as an aggravated felony within\nClause (i)’s definition “because it involved ‘fraud or deceit’\nand because his offense resulted in a loss to the govern-\nment in excess of $10,000.” Id., at 1055. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit also determined that Mrs. Kawashima’s conviction\nunder §7206(2) “necessarily ‘involve[d] fraud or deceit.’ ”\nId., at 1055. But because Mrs. Kawashima’s plea agree-\nment was not in the administrative record, the Ninth\nCircuit remanded to the Board to determine whether Mrs.\nKawashima’s conviction had caused a loss to the Govern-\nment in excess of $10,000. Id., at 1056–1057.\n   We granted the Kawashimas’ petition for a writ of certi-\norari to determine whether their convictions for violations\nof 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) respectively qualify as\naggravated felonies under 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). We now affirm.\n                             II\n   The Kawashimas argue that they cannot be deported for\ncommission of an “aggravated felony” because crimes\nunder §§7206(1) and (2) do not “involv[e] fraud or deceit”\nas required by Clause (i). The Kawashimas also assert\nthat their convictions under §7206 are not “aggravated\nfelonies” because tax crimes are not included within\nClause (i) at all. We address each argument in turn.\n                        A\n  The Kawashimas contend that their offenses of convic-\n4                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion do not fall within the scope of Clause (i) because\nneither “fraud” nor “deceit” is a formal element of a con-\nviction under §7206(1) or §7206(2). The Government\nresponds that the Kawashimas’ convictions necessarily in-\nvolved deceit because they required a showing that the\nKawashimas willfully made materially false statements.\nTo determine whether the Kawashimas’ offenses “involv[e]\nfraud or deceit” within the meaning of Clause (i), we em-\nploy a categorical approach by looking to the statute defin-\ning the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts\nunderlying the crime. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,\n549 U. S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the approach set forth\nin Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–600 (1990)).\nIf the elements of the offenses establish that the Ka-\nwashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,\nthen the first requirement of Clause (i) is satisfied.3\n   Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C.\n§7206(1), which provides that any person who “[w]illfully\nmakes and subscribes any return, statement, or other\ndocument, which contains or is verified by a written decla-\nration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and\nwhich he does not believe to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter,” shall be guilty of a felony. Mr. Ka-\nwashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation\nof §7206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in ques-\ntion was false as to a material matter, that the defendant\ndid not believe the document to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter, and that he acted willfully with the\nspecific intent to violate the law. See, e.g., United States v.\nAramony, 88 F. 3d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v.\nKaiser, 893 F. 2d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.\n\n——————\n    3 We\n       note that the issue whether the Kawashimas’ offenses satisfy\nthe second requirement of Clause (i)—that the loss to the victim ex-\nceeded $10,000—is not before us. We address only whether their\noffenses of conviction qualify as crimes “involv[ing] fraud or deceit.”\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMarabelles, 724 F. 2d 1374, 1380 (CA9 1984); United\nStates v. Whyte, 699 F. 2d 375, 381 (CA7 1983). Although\nthe words “fraud” and “deceit” are absent from the text of\n§7206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the\ncrime, it does not follow that his offense falls outside of\nClause (i). The scope of that clause is not limited to of-\nfenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\nRather, Clause (i) refers more broadly to offenses that\n“involv[e]” fraud or deceit—meaning offenses with ele-\nments that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful\nconduct.\n   When subparagraph (M) was enacted, the term “deceit”\nmeant a “the act or process of deceiving (as by falsification,\nconcealment, or cheating).” Webster’s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 584 (1993). Mr. Kawashima’s conviction\nunder §7206(1) establishes that he knowingly and willfully\nsubmitted a tax return that was false as to a material\nmatter. He therefore committed a felony that involved\n“deceit.”\n   Turning to Mrs. Kawashima, our analysis follows a\nsimilar path. Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating\n26 U. S. C. §7206(2), which declares that any person who\n“[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or presen-\ntation under, or in connection with any matter arising\nunder, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit,\nclaim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as\nto any material matter,” has committed a felony. Mrs.\nKawashima does not dispute that the elements of a viola-\ntion of §7206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in\nquestion was false as to a material matter and that the\ndefendant acted willfully. See Aramony, supra, at 1382;\nUnited States v. Sassak, 881 F. 2d 276, 278 (CA6 1989);\nUnited States v. Hooks, 848 F. 2d 785, 788–789 (CA7\n1988); United States v. Dahlstrom, 713 F. 2d 1423, 1426–\n1427 (CA9 1983). We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima’s\nconviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully\n6                  KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassisting her husband’s filing of a materially false tax\nreturn, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that\ninvolved “deceit.”\n  The language of Clause (i) is clear. Anyone who is con-\nvicted of an offense that “involves fraud or deceit in which\nthe loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” has\ncommitted an aggravated felony and is subject to depor-\ntation pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The ele-\nments of willfully making and subscribing a false corpo-\nrate tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(1), and of\naiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax re-\nturn, in violation of 26 U. S. C. §7206(2), establish that\nthose crimes are deportable offenses because they neces-\nsarily entail deceit.\n                            B\n   The Kawashimas’ second argument is based on infer-\nences drawn from the interaction of Clause (i) and\nClause (ii). The full text of subparagraph (M) reads as\nfollows:\n\n\n     “(43) The term ‘aggravated felony’ means—\n          .           .           .           .           .\n    “(M) an offense that—\n    “(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n    “(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\n    tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Govern-\n    ment exceeds $10,000.”\nThe Kawashimas argue that when Clause (i) is read to-\ngether with Clause (ii), Clause (i) must be interpreted as\nbeing inapplicable to tax crimes. In their view, subpara-\ngraph (M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates\nthat Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive\ncategories of crimes in subparagraph (M)’s two clauses:\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngeneral, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that\ncause actual losses to real victims in Clause (i), and\ntax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government\nin Clause (ii). For the reasons discussed below, this\nargument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause\n(i), which encompasses the Kawashimas’ offenses of\nconviction.\n                              1\n  The Kawashimas contend that textual differences be-\ntween Clauses (i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended\nto exclude tax crimes from Clause (i). Specifically, they\nnote that Clause (i) addresses “loss to the victim,” whereas\nClause (ii) addresses “revenue loss to the Government.”\n  This difference in language does not establish Congress’\nintent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).\nClause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve\nfraud or deceit. Clause (i) thus uses correspondingly broad\nlanguage to refer to the wide range of potential losses and\nvictims. Clause (ii), on the other hand, is limited to the\nsingle type of offense “described in section 7201 of title 26\n(relating to tax evasion),” which, by definition, can only\ncause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim\n(the Government). Congress’ decision to tailor Clause (ii)’s\nlanguage to match the sole type of offense covered by\nClause (ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also in-\ntended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of\nClause (i)’s plain language.\n                             2\n  Next, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting\nClause (i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption\nagainst superfluities by rendering Clause (ii) completely\nredundant to Clause (i). Clause (ii) explicitly states that\nconvictions for tax evasion pursuant to 26 U. S. C. §7201\nthat cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Gov-\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernment are aggravated felonies. The Kawashimas assert\nthat, if Clause (i) applies to tax crimes, then qualifying\nconvictions for tax evasion under Clause (ii) would also\nqualify as aggravated felonies under Clause (i), because\ntax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit. To but-\ntress this argument, the Kawashimas point to a body of\nlaw providing that a conviction for tax evasion under\n§7201 collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from\ncontesting a civil penalty under 26 U. S. C. §6663(b) for\n“underpayment . . . attributable to fraud.” See, e.g., Gray\nv. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6 1983) (“Numer-\nous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal\nincome tax evasion, either upon a plea of guilty, or upon\na jury verdict of guilt, conclusively establishes fraud in a\nsubsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application\nof the doctrine of collateral estoppel”). Therefore, accord-\ning to the Kawashimas, if Clause (i) covers tax offenses,\nthen Clause (ii) is mere surplusage.\n   We disagree with the Kawashimas’ contention that the\nspecific mention of one type of tax crime in Clause (ii)\nimpliedly limits the scope of Clause (i)’s plain language,\nwhich extends to any offense that “involves fraud or de-\nceit.” We think it more likely that Congress specifically\nincluded tax evasion offenses under 26 U. S. C. §7201 in\nClause (ii) to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.\n   Several considerations support this conclusion. Like\n§§7206(1) and (2), §7201 does not, on its face, mention\nfraud or deceit. Instead, §7201 simply provides that “[a]ny\nperson who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or\ndefeat any tax imposed by [the Internal Revenue Code] or\nthe payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties\nprovided by law, be guilty of a felony.” Accordingly, nei-\nther fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction\nunder §7201, which include: (1) willfulness; (2) the exist-\nence of a tax deficiency; and (3) an affirmative act consti-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntuting an evasion or an attempted evasion of the tax.\nBoulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424, n. 2 (2008).\nA conviction under §7201, therefore, only qualifies as an\naggravated felony under Clause (i) if a willful, affirmative\nattempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.\n   This Court’s decision in United States v. Scharton, 285\nU. S. 518 (1932), gave Congress good reason to doubt that\na conviction under §7201 satisfies that condition. In\nScharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to\nevade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable\nincome. The question before the Court was whether the\ncrime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations\ngenerally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was\ninstead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations appli-\ncable to “ ‘offenses involving the defrauding or attempting\nto defraud the United States or any agency thereof,\nwhether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.’ ” Id., at\n520, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe Government argued that the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions applied because “fraud is implicit in the concept of\nevading or defeating” and because any effort to evade a tax\nis tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.\n285 U. S., at 520–521. The Court rejected that argument,\nnoting that, in an indictment for evasion, “an averment [of\nintent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be\nsufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade\nor defeat.” Id., at 521.\n   Moreover, §7201 includes two offenses: “the offense of\nwillfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a\ntax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade\nor defeat the payment of a tax.” Sansone v. United States,\n380 U. S. 343, 354 (1965) (emphasis in original). As the\nGovernment notes, it is possible to willfully evade or de-\nfeat payment of a tax under §7201 without making any\nmisrepresentation. For example, §7201 can be violated by\na taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also\n10                KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his\nassets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nAlthough the Government concedes that evasion-of-\npayment cases will almost invariably involve some affirm-\native acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the ele-\nments of tax evasion pursuant to §7201 do not necessarily\ninvolve fraud or deceit. Thus, we conclude that the specif-\nic inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) was intended to\nensure that tax evasion pursuant to §7201 was a deporta-\nble offense. Clause (ii) does not implicitly remove all other\ntax offenses from the scope of Clause (i)’s plain language.\n                               3\n   The Kawashimas also assert that the separate treat-\nment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit\nin the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their\ncontention that Congress did not intend to include tax\ncrimes within Clause (i). They point to the fact that, in\n1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included\nwithin the Guidelines a category of “offenses involving\nfraud or deceit.” USSG §§2F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effec-\ntive Nov. 1, 2001). The Commission simultaneously in-\ncluded “offenses involving taxation” as a separate category.\n§§2T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011). Although the Kawashimas\nacknowledge that they have found no evidence that Con-\ngress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend\nthat “it is likely that the language of [Clause (i)] and\n[Clause (ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines” by\nthe sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of\naggravated felony to include subparagraph (M). Brief for\nPetitioners 29. Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer\nfrom the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress\ndid not intend Clause (i) to include tax crimes.\n   We reject the Kawashimas’ reliance on the Guidelines.\nThe Kawashimas’ argument is at odds with the fact that,\nunlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause (ii)\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes not refer to all offenses “involving taxation.” Rather,\nClause (ii) is expressly limited to tax evasion offenses\nunder §7201. That textual difference undercuts any infer-\nence that Congress was considering, much less incorporat-\ning, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.\n                                C\n  Finally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph (M)’s\ntreatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambigu-\nous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in\ntheir favor. It is true that we have, in the past, construed\nambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien’s favor.\nSee INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001). We think\nthe application of the present statute clear enough that\nresort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.\n                        *     *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that convictions\nunder 26 U. S. C. §§7206(1) and (2) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggra-\nvated felonies pursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).\nBecause the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as\naliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies\npursuant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. C.\n§7206(1). His wife, petitioner Fusako Kawashima, was\nconvicted under §7206(2) of assisting her husband in\npreparing the false return. The question presented is\nwhether a conviction under §7206 is an “aggravated felo-\nny” that renders the Kawashimas deportable from the\nUnited States. See 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   Congress has defined “aggravated felony” to include,\ninter alia, offenses that “(i) involv[e] fraud or deceit in\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000” or\n“(ii) [are] described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\ntax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000.” §1101(a)(43)(M). The Kawashimas\nargue that tax offenses triggering deportation are deline-\nated exclusively in §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (or Clause (ii)), and\nthat §1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (or Clause (i)) does not encompass\ntax crimes. The Court rejects this argument, and holds\nthat any tax offense “involv[ing] fraud or deceit,” if the loss\nto the fisc exceeds $10,000, ranks as an “aggravated fel-\nony.” See ante, at 11. Because the Kawashimas’ tax of-\nfense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,\nthe Court concludes, they have committed an aggravated\n2                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfelony and are therefore deportable.\n   The Court’s construction of the statute is dubious, as\nI see it. For one thing, it effectively renders Clause (ii)\nsuperfluous. Further, the Court’s reading sweeps a wide\nvariety of federal, state, and local tax offenses—including\nmisdemeanors—into the “aggravated felony” category. In\naddition, today’s decision may discourage aliens from\npleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,\nthereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the\ninternal revenue laws. I conclude that Clause (i) does not\naddress tax offenses, and would therefore hold that mak-\ning a false statement on a tax return in violation of §7206\nis not an “aggravated felony.”\n                             I\n  Any alien convicted of an “aggravated felony” after\nadmission to the United States is deportable. 8 U. S. C.\n§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Subparagraph (M) of §1101(a)(43)\nincludes as an “aggravated felony”:\n    “an offense that—\n      “(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n      “(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating\n    to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Gov-\n    ernment exceeds $10,000.”\n   Notably, Clause (i) speaks of “loss to the victim,” Clause\n(ii) of “revenue loss to the Government.” The Kawashimas\ncontend that Clause (i) covers crimes of fraud or deceit\ncausing losses unrelated to tax revenue. Tax crimes,\nthey argue, are addressed exclusively in Clause (ii), and\nthat clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by 26\nU. S. C. §7201 as an “aggravated felony.” Willfully sub-\nmitting a false statement proscribed by §7206, the\nKawashimas maintain, is not an “aggravated felony”\nthat would render them deportable under 8 U. S. C.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Under the Government’s construction, because the\ncrime of making a false statement on a tax return involves\n“fraud” or “deceit,” the Kawashimas committed an aggra-\nvated felony. See ante, at 5 (“the words ‘fraud’ and ‘deceit’\nare absent from the text of §7206(1) and are not them-\nselves formal elements of the crime,” nonetheless, “[the]\nelements [of a §7206 crime] necessarily entail fraudulent\nor deceitful conduct”).\n   The Court’s task is to determine which reading of\nthe statute is correct. If the two proffered constructions of\nsubparagraph (M) are plausible in roughly equal measure,\nthen our precedent directs us to construe the statute in\nthe Kawashimas’ favor. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333\nU. S. 6, 10 (1948) (“We resolve the doubts in favor of [the\nalien] because deportation is a drastic measure . . . .”); INS\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001) (same).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\nIn interpreting 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M), I would rely\n\nupon the familiar canon that statutes should be interpret-\ned to avoid superfluity. See Corley v. United States, 556 \n\nU. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,\n101 (2004) (“[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons” is\nthat a “statute should be construed so that effect is given\nto all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or\nsuperfluous, void or insignificant . . . .”)). If Clause (i) is\nconstrued to apply to tax crimes, then Clause (ii)’s discrete\ninclusion of tax evasion would add nothing, for tax evasion\nis itself an offense that, in all actual instances of which\nthe Government is aware, “involves fraud or deceit.” See\n4                    KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(i); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.\n   The elements of tax evasion are the existence of a tax\ndeficiency, willfulness, and “an affirmative act constitut-\ning an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.” Sansone\nv. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351 (1965). As this Court’s\ndecisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or\nfraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax\nliability or misleading the Government as to the extent of\nthe liability. See, e.g., Spies v. United States, 317 U. S.\n492, 499 (1943) (an act of tax evasion may be “any con-\nduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to\nconceal”). Accordingly, courts have determined that tax\nevasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessari-\nly involves fraud. See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d\n1081, 1085, n. 7 (CA9 2005) (fraud is “implicit in the na-\nture of the crime” of tax evasion); Considine v. United\nStates, 683 F. 2d 1285, 1287 (CA9 1982) (“The express\nlanguage of section 7201 requires an intent to avoid tax (a\nlegitimate synonym for fraud).”); Costello v. INS, 311 F. 2d\n343, 348 (CA2 1962) (“There can be no ‘wilful’ [tax] eva-\nsion without a specific intent to defraud.”), rev’d on other\ngrounds, 376 U. S. 120 (1964).\n   Even more to the point, courts have held that a convic-\ntion for tax evasion under 26 U. S. C. §7201 “conclusively\nestablishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceed-\ning.” Gray v. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6\n1983); see Klein v. Commissioner, 880 F. 2d 260, 262\n(CA10 1989) (conviction under 7201 “collaterally estops a\ntaxpayer from denying fraud [in a] civil tax case involving\nthe same years”).1 This preclusive effect obtains, courts\nhave explained, because “ ‘willful’ [tax evasion] includes all\nof the elements of fraud.” Tomlinson v.

United States, 360 F. 2d 353, 356\n(CA4 1966) (“[W]hile the criminal evasion statute does not\nexplicitly require a finding of fraud, the case-by-case pro-\ncess of construction of the civil [fraud] and criminal tax\nprovisions has demonstrated that their constituent ele-\nments are identical.”).\n   Tax offenses span a wide range, from failure to file a tax\nreturn, 26 U. S. C. §7203, to the unauthorized use of tax\nstamps, §7209. But “the gravest of offenses against the\nrevenues,” this Court has said, the “capstone” of tax law\nviolations, is tax evasion. Spies, 317 U. S., at 497, 499;\nsee Boulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424 (2008).\nTellingly, the Kawashimas pleaded guilty to a crime carry-\ning a maximum prison term of three years, §7206; for tax\nevasion, the maximum term is five years, §7201. It is thus\nunderstandable that Congress would single out tax eva-\nsion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and\nno other tax crime, an “aggravated felony” for deportation\npurposes.\n   The Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).\nTax evasion, made criminal by §7201, the Court states,\n“almost invariably,” but “not necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud\nor deceit.” Ante, at 10. But see supra, at 4 and this page.\nCongress likely included Clause (ii), the Court suggests,\nsimply “to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.” Ante, at 8. In other words, in\nholding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court\nfinds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.\n   In support of the notion that tax evasion can occur\nwithout fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v.\nScharton, 285 U. S. 518 (1932); see ante, at 9. In that\nlong-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government’s\nplea for the application of an extended limitation period to\na prosecution for tax evasion. The generally applicable\n6                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nstatute of limitations was three years; for tax offenses that\ninvolve defrauding the United States, however, the limita-\ntion period was six years. An averment of intent to de-\nfraud, the Court said in Scharton, would be “surplusage,”\nfor it would suffice “to plead and prove a wilful attempt to\nevade or defeat.” 285 U. S., at 521.\n   Courts had limited Scharton to its statute of limita-\ntions context several decades before Congress enacted\n§1101(a)(43)(M) in 1994. See Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 247\nF. 2d 929, 936, n. 6 (CA9 1957) (distinguishing Scharton\nand holding that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude\nbecause it entails fraud); Lefkowitz, 334 F. 2d, at 265\n(distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion\nnecessarily involves fraud). Moreover, Congress, since\n1954, has expressly prescribed a six-year limitation period\nfor tax evasion. See 26 U. S. C. §6531(2). In short, Schar-\nton is a cryptic, thinly reasoned opinion, one that did not\ninfluence subsequent federal-court description of the crime\nof tax evasion. The suggestion that Congress may have\nworried about Scharton when framing legislation over 60\nyears later is hardly credible.\n   The Court presents another reason, drawn from the\nGovernment’s brief, why Congress may have treated tax\nevasion discretely, while embracing tax crimes generally\nwithin the Clause (i) category. Section 7201 covers both\nevasion of assessment and evasion of payment. Imagine a\ntaxpayer who files a truthful return, then moves her as-\nsets to a place “beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue\nService.” Ante, at 10; see Brief for Respondent 34. The\nCourt acknowledges that evasion-of-payment cases almost\nalways “involve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit.”\nAnte, at 10. Still, there may be a rare case in which that is\nnot so. Rare, indeed; imaginary would be an apt char-\nacterization.    The Government conceded that, to its\nknowledge, there have been no actual instances of indict-\nments for tax evasion unaccompanied by any act of fraud\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nor deceit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31.\n   The canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid su-\nperfluity cannot be skirted as easily as the Government\nhere urges. We have declined to interpret legislation in\na way that “would in practical effect render [a provision]\nentirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circum-\nstances.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). It\nis hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a\ncase in which the provision might have some independent\nrole. See id., at 30. Where, as here, “the Government\nconcede[s] that the independent function one could attrib-\nute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,” a construction\nmoored to a case “most unlikely” to exist should be reject-\ned. Id., at 31. It is highly improbable that “a pro-\nviso accounting for more than half of [the] text” of\n§1101(a)(43)(M), i.e., Clause (ii), “would lie dormant in all\nbut the most unlikely situations.” See 534 U. S., at 31.\n   Congress’ aim in drafting §1101(a)(43) was to determine\nwhich crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant the “dras-\ntic measure” of deportation, and which are not. See Fong\nHaw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10. It is implausible that Con-\ngress, when drafting §1101(a)(43)(M), intended to address,\nor was even aware of, the Government’s scenario: a tax-\npayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collec-\ntion of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore. Far\nmore likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offens-\nes in §1101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision\nto address fraudulent schemes against private victims,\nthen added §1101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the “capstone” tax\noffense against the Government also qualified as an ag-\ngravated felony. See supra, at 5.\n                            B\n  The Court’s construction of the statute is even less\nplausible given the numerous offenses it would rank as\n“aggravated felon[ies].” Many federal tax offenses, like 26\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. §7206, involve false statements or misleading\nconduct. See, e.g., §7202 (failing to truthfully account for\nand pay taxes owed). Conviction of any of these offenses,\nif the Court’s construction were correct, would render an\nalien deportable. So would conviction of state and local\ntax offenses involving false statements. Ferreira v. Ash-\ncroft, 390 F. 3d 1091, 1096–1097 (CA9 2004) (state-law\noffenses qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit under\n8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)); see, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n30, §574 (2009) (submitting a tax return false as to any\nmaterial matter is a criminal offense); D. C. Code §47–\n4106 (2001–2005) (same); Ala. Code §40–29–114 (2003)\n(same); Va. Code Ann. §58.1–1815 (2009) (willfully failing\nto account truthfully for and pay certain taxes is a crimi-\nnal offense).\n   Rendering all tax offenses involving false statements\n“aggravated felon[ies]” that subject an alien to deportation\nis all the more problematic, for many of these offenses are\nmisdemeanors. Among federal misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26\nU. S. C. §7204 (“furnish[ing] a false” W-2 form to an em-\nployee); §7205 (“suppl[ying] false or fraudulent infor-\nmation” to an employer); §7207 (filing a return “known . . .\nto be false as to any material matter”). On the state and\nlocal level, see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §1610.4\n(West 1998) (“Every person who wilfully states anything\nwhich he knows to be false in any oral or written state-\nment, not under oath, required or authorized to be made\nas the basis of an application to reduce any tax or assess-\nment, is guilty of a misdemeanor.”); N. D. Cent. Code Ann.\n§57–37.116 (Lexis 2011) (“Every person who willfully and\nknowingly subscribes or makes any false statement of\nfacts [on an estate tax return] . . . is guilty of a class A\nmisdemeanor.”); Columbus, Ohio City Code §§361.31(a)(4),\n(b), (d) (2009) (any person who “knowingly make[s]\nand file[s] an incomplete, false or fraudulent [municipal]\nreturn” is guilty of a fourth-degree misdemeanor).\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

C.\n§1101(a)(43)(M) prevent deportation for tax crimes far less\nserious than willful tax evasion, for as many as six years\nmay be included in the amount-of-loss calculation. See 26\nU. S. C. §6531 (setting a six-year statute of limitations for,\ninter alia, tax crimes involving fraud or falsity); Brief for\nJohnnie M. Walters as Amicus Curiae 15–16 (hereinafter\nWalters Brief).2\n   Finally, the Court’s decision has adverse consequences\nfor the efficient handling of tax prosecutions. It is often\neasier for the Government to obtain a conviction under\n§7206 (false statements) than under §7201 (tax evasion).\nSee United States v. Olgin, 745 F. 2d 263, 272 (CA3 1984)\n(unlike a conviction under §7201, a conviction under §7206\ndoes not require proof of a tax deficiency); Considine, 683\nF. 2d, at 1287 (unlike a conviction under §7201, a convic-\ntion under §7206 does not require proof of an attempt to\nescape a tax). For this reason, the Government has al-\nlowed taxpayers to plead guilty to a §7206 charge in lieu of\ngoing to trial under §7201 on an evasion charge. See\nWalters Brief 19–20. Deportation consequences are im-\nportant to aliens facing criminal charges. See Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10)\n(“[P]reserving the client’s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.” (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322)). If a §7206 charge carries the same prospect of\ndeportation as a §7201 charge, then an alien’s incentive to\nplead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.\n\n\n——————\n  2 One might also ask what reason Congress would have for making a\n\ntax misdemeanor a deportable offense, while more serious crimes do not\njeopardize an alien’s residency in the United States. See, e.g., Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11–12 (2004) (driving while drunk, causing\nserious bodily injury to others is not an aggravated felony).\n10                KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                       *    *      *\n  For the reasons stated, I would hold that making a\nmaterial, false statement on a tax return does not qualify\nas an aggravated felony within the compass of 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43)(M)(i). I would therefore reverse the judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/623145/", "sha1": "555219c8bbf6ba235fab578f488dfec0f822530b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-02-21T07:46:16"}
