HOLDER, ATTORNEY \n\n                     GENERAL\n  \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 10\u2013577.      Argued November 7, 2011\u2014Decided February 21, 2012\nAn Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and\n Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\n for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 26 U. S. C.\n \u00a77206(1), and Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s conviction for aiding and assisting\n in the preparation of a false tax return, \u00a77206(2), qualified as crimes\n involving fraud or deceit under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause\n (i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deport-\n ed under \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals af-\n firmed. Holding that convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2)\n in which the Government\u2019s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute\n aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but\n remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s\n conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.\nHeld: Convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) in which the\n Government\u2019s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated\n felonies pursuant to Clause (i). Pp. 3\u221211.\n    (a) The Kawashimas\u2019 argument that they cannot be deported for\n the commission of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because crimes under\n \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by\n Clause (i) is rejected. This Court looks to the statute defining the\n crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the\n crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 186, to deter-\n mine whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses involve fraud or deceit with-\n in the meaning of Clause (i). Section 7206(1) provides that any per-\n son who \u201cwillfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which\n contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under\n the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and\n2                        KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    correct as to every material matter,\u201d shall be guilty of a felony. Alt-\n    hough the words \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d are absent from \u00a77206(1) and\n    are not themselves formal elements of the crime, it does not follow\n    that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s offense falls outside Clause (i). Clause (i) is not\n    limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\n    Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or de-\n    ceit\u2015meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudu-\n    lent or deceitful conduct. Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction under \u00a77206(1)\n    involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submit-\n    ted a tax return that was false as to a material matter. Mrs. Ka-\n    washima was convicted of violating \u00a77206(2), which declares that any\n    person who \u201c[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or\n    presentation . . . of a return . . . which is fraudulent or is false as to\n    any material matter\u201d has committed a felony. She committed a felo-\n    ny involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her hus-\n    band\u2019s filing of a materially false tax return. Pp. 3\u22126.\n       (b) The Kawashimas\u2019 argument that Clause (i), when considered in\n    light of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (Clause (ii)), must be interpret-\n    ed as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected. Clause (i) de-\n    fines \u201caggravated felony\u201d to mean an offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or\n    deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d\n    Clause (ii) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as an offense that is \u201cdescribed\n    in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the reve-\n    nue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\u201d Contrary to the Ka-\n    washimas\u2019 claim, the difference in the clauses\u2019 language\u2014\u201crevenue\n    loss to the Government\u201d in Clause (ii) compared to \u201closs to the victim\u201d\n    in Clause (i)\u2014does not establish Congress\u2019 intent to remove tax\n    crimes from the scope of Clause (i). By its plain language, Clause (i)\n    covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Con-\n    gress\u2019 decision to tailor Clause (ii)\u2019s language to match the sole type\n    of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to\n    implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)\u2019s broad scope. Furthermore, inter-\n    preting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presump-\n    tion against superfluities. The specific inclusion of tax evasion in\n    Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the in-\n    clusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to 26\n    U. S. C. \u00a77201 was a deportable offense. Pp. 6\u221210.\n       (c) The United States Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 separate treatment of\n    tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the\n    Kawashimas\u2019 contention that Congress did not intend to include tax\n    crimes within Clause (i). No evidence suggests that Congress consid-\n    ered the Guidelines when drafting 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M). More-\n    over, the differences between \u00a71101(a)(43)(M) and the Guidelines un-\n    dercut any inference that Congress was incorporating the distinction\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

ERIC H.\n       HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                             [February 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns whether aliens who commit certain\nfederal tax crimes are subject to deportation as aliens\nwho have been convicted of an aggravated felony. We\nhold that violations of 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) are\ncrimes \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit\u201d under 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) and are therefore aggravated felonies as\nthat term is defined in the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., when the loss to the Govern-\nment exceeds $10,000.\n                             I\n   Petitioners, Akio and Fusako Kawashima, are natives\nand citizens of Japan who have been lawful permanent\nresidents of the United States since June 21, 1984. In\n1997, Mr. Kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of will-\nfully making and subscribing a false tax return in viola-\ntion of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1). Mrs. Kawashima pleaded\nguilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the prep-\naration of a false tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a77206(2).\n   Following their convictions, the Immigration and Natu-\n2                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nralization Service charged the Kawashimas with being\ndeportable from the United States as aliens who had\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony.1 See 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an ag-\ngravated felony at any time after admission is deporta-\nble\u201d).2 In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress\nlisted categories of offenses that qualify as \u201caggravated\nfelonies\u201d for the purpose of deportation. See \u00a71101(a)(43).\nHere, the Government charged the Kawashimas with be-\ning deportable for committing offenses under subpara-\ngraph (M) of \u00a71101(a)(43). That subparagraph classifies\nas an aggravated felony an offense that either: \u201c(i) involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or vic-\ntims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of\ntitle 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\u201d Hereinafter,\nwe refer to \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) as \u201cClause (i)\u201d and to\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as \u201cClause (ii).\u201d\n   At their deportation hearing, the Kawashimas argued\nthat their convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206 did not\nqualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph (M).\nThe Immigration Judge disagreed and ordered removal,\nconcluding that the Kawashimas\u2019 convictions qualified as\naggravated felonies under Clause (i). The Kawashimas\nappealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s\ndecision. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 On March 1, 2003, most of the functions of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization\nService ceased to exist.\n  2 Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the\n\ncountry: \u201cdeportation\u201d of aliens who were already present, and \u201cexclu-\nsion\u201d of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country. Since 1996,\nthe Government has used a unified procedure, known as \u201cremoval,\u201d for\nboth exclusion and deportation. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229, 1229a. We use\nthe terms \u201cdeportation\u201d and \u201cremoval\u201d interchangeably in this opinion.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreopen its decision, the Kawashimas filed petitions for\nreview of the Board\u2019s decision in the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that \u201cconvictions for violating\n\u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) in which the tax loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000 constitute aggravated felonies under\nsubsection (M)(i).\u201d 615 F. 3d 1043, 1053 (2010). The\ncourt concluded that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction un-\nder \u00a77206(1) qualified as an aggravated felony within\nClause (i)\u2019s definition \u201cbecause it involved \u2018fraud or deceit\u2019\nand because his offense resulted in a loss to the govern-\nment in excess of $10,000.\u201d Id., at 1055. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit also determined that Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a77206(2) \u201cnecessarily \u2018involve[d] fraud or deceit.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 1055. But because Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s plea agree-\nment was not in the administrative record, the Ninth\nCircuit remanded to the Board to determine whether Mrs.\nKawashima\u2019s conviction had caused a loss to the Govern-\nment in excess of $10,000. Id., at 1056\u20131057.\n   We granted the Kawashimas\u2019 petition for a writ of certi-\norari to determine whether their convictions for violations\nof 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) respectively qualify as\naggravated felonies under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i).\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). We now affirm.\n                             II\n   The Kawashimas argue that they cannot be deported for\ncommission of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because crimes\nunder \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) do not \u201cinvolv[e] fraud or deceit\u201d\nas required by Clause (i). The Kawashimas also assert\nthat their convictions under \u00a77206 are not \u201caggravated\nfelonies\u201d because tax crimes are not included within\nClause (i) at all. We address each argument in turn.\n                        A\n  The Kawashimas contend that their offenses of convic-\n4                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion do not fall within the scope of Clause (i) because\nneither \u201cfraud\u201d nor \u201cdeceit\u201d is a formal element of a con-\nviction under \u00a77206(1) or \u00a77206(2). The Government\nresponds that the Kawashimas\u2019 convictions necessarily in-\nvolved deceit because they required a showing that the\nKawashimas willfully made materially false statements.\nTo determine whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses \u201cinvolv[e]\nfraud or deceit\u201d within the meaning of Clause (i), we em-\nploy a categorical approach by looking to the statute defin-\ning the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts\nunderlying the crime. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,\n549 U. S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the approach set forth\nin Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599\u2013600 (1990)).\nIf the elements of the offenses establish that the Ka-\nwashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,\nthen the first requirement of Clause (i) is satisfied.3\n   Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a77206(1), which provides that any person who \u201c[w]illfully\nmakes and subscribes any return, statement, or other\ndocument, which contains or is verified by a written decla-\nration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and\nwhich he does not believe to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter,\u201d shall be guilty of a felony. Mr. Ka-\nwashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation\nof \u00a77206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in ques-\ntion was false as to a material matter, that the defendant\ndid not believe the document to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter, and that he acted willfully with the\nspecific intent to violate the law. See, e.g., United States v.\nAramony, 88 F. 3d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v.\nKaiser, 893 F. 2d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 We\n       note that the issue whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses satisfy\nthe second requirement of Clause (i)\u2014that the loss to the victim ex-\nceeded $10,000\u2014is not before us. We address only whether their\noffenses of conviction qualify as crimes \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMarabelles, 724 F. 2d 1374, 1380 (CA9 1984); United\nStates v. Whyte, 699 F. 2d 375, 381 (CA7 1983). Although\nthe words \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d are absent from the text of\n\u00a77206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the\ncrime, it does not follow that his offense falls outside of\nClause (i). The scope of that clause is not limited to of-\nfenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\nRather, Clause (i) refers more broadly to offenses that\n\u201cinvolv[e]\u201d fraud or deceit\u2014meaning offenses with ele-\nments that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful\nconduct.\n   When subparagraph (M) was enacted, the term \u201cdeceit\u201d\nmeant a \u201cthe act or process of deceiving (as by falsification,\nconcealment, or cheating).\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 584 (1993). Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a77206(1) establishes that he knowingly and willfully\nsubmitted a tax return that was false as to a material\nmatter. He therefore committed a felony that involved\n\u201cdeceit.\u201d\n   Turning to Mrs. Kawashima, our analysis follows a\nsimilar path. Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating\n26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(2), which declares that any person who\n\u201c[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or presen-\ntation under, or in connection with any matter arising\nunder, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit,\nclaim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as\nto any material matter,\u201d has committed a felony. Mrs.\nKawashima does not dispute that the elements of a viola-\ntion of \u00a77206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in\nquestion was false as to a material matter and that the\ndefendant acted willfully. See Aramony, supra, at 1382;\nUnited States v. Sassak, 881 F. 2d 276, 278 (CA6 1989);\nUnited States v. Hooks, 848 F. 2d 785, 788\u2013789 (CA7\n1988); United States v. Dahlstrom, 713 F. 2d 1423, 1426\u2013\n1427 (CA9 1983). We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s\nconviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully\n6                  KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassisting her husband\u2019s filing of a materially false tax\nreturn, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that\ninvolved \u201cdeceit.\u201d\n  The language of Clause (i) is clear. Anyone who is con-\nvicted of an offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which\nthe loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d has\ncommitted an aggravated felony and is subject to depor-\ntation pursuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The ele-\nments of willfully making and subscribing a false corpo-\nrate tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1), and of\naiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax re-\nturn, in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(2), establish that\nthose crimes are deportable offenses because they neces-\nsarily entail deceit.\n                            B\n   The Kawashimas\u2019 second argument is based on infer-\nences drawn from the interaction of Clause (i) and\nClause (ii). The full text of subparagraph (M) reads as\nfollows:\n\n\n     \u201c(43) The term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 means\u2014\n          .           .           .           .           .\n    \u201c(M) an offense that\u2014\n    \u201c(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n    \u201c(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\n    tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Govern-\n    ment exceeds $10,000.\u201d\nThe Kawashimas argue that when Clause (i) is read to-\ngether with Clause (ii), Clause (i) must be interpreted as\nbeing inapplicable to tax crimes. In their view, subpara-\ngraph (M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates\nthat Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive\ncategories of crimes in subparagraph (M)\u2019s two clauses:\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngeneral, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that\ncause actual losses to real victims in Clause (i), and\ntax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government\nin Clause (ii). For the reasons discussed below, this\nargument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause\n(i), which encompasses the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses of\nconviction.\n                              1\n  The Kawashimas contend that textual differences be-\ntween Clauses (i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended\nto exclude tax crimes from Clause (i). Specifically, they\nnote that Clause (i) addresses \u201closs to the victim,\u201d whereas\nClause (ii) addresses \u201crevenue loss to the Government.\u201d\n  This difference in language does not establish Congress\u2019\nintent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).\nClause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve\nfraud or deceit. Clause (i) thus uses correspondingly broad\nlanguage to refer to the wide range of potential losses and\nvictims. Clause (ii), on the other hand, is limited to the\nsingle type of offense \u201cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26\n(relating to tax evasion),\u201d which, by definition, can only\ncause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim\n(the Government). Congress\u2019 decision to tailor Clause (ii)\u2019s\nlanguage to match the sole type of offense covered by\nClause (ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also in-\ntended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of\nClause (i)\u2019s plain language.\n                             2\n  Next, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting\nClause (i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption\nagainst superfluities by rendering Clause (ii) completely\nredundant to Clause (i). Clause (ii) explicitly states that\nconvictions for tax evasion pursuant to 26 U. S. C. \u00a77201\nthat cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Gov-\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernment are aggravated felonies. The Kawashimas assert\nthat, if Clause (i) applies to tax crimes, then qualifying\nconvictions for tax evasion under Clause (ii) would also\nqualify as aggravated felonies under Clause (i), because\ntax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit. To but-\ntress this argument, the Kawashimas point to a body of\nlaw providing that a conviction for tax evasion under\n\u00a77201 collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from\ncontesting a civil penalty under 26 U. S. C. \u00a76663(b) for\n\u201cunderpayment . . . attributable to fraud.\u201d See, e.g., Gray\nv. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6 1983) (\u201cNumer-\nous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal\nincome tax evasion, either upon a plea of guilty, or upon\na jury verdict of guilt, conclusively establishes fraud in a\nsubsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application\nof the doctrine of collateral estoppel\u201d). Therefore, accord-\ning to the Kawashimas, if Clause (i) covers tax offenses,\nthen Clause (ii) is mere surplusage.\n   We disagree with the Kawashimas\u2019 contention that the\nspecific mention of one type of tax crime in Clause (ii)\nimpliedly limits the scope of Clause (i)\u2019s plain language,\nwhich extends to any offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or de-\nceit.\u201d We think it more likely that Congress specifically\nincluded tax evasion offenses under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77201 in\nClause (ii) to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.\n   Several considerations support this conclusion. Like\n\u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2), \u00a77201 does not, on its face, mention\nfraud or deceit. Instead, \u00a77201 simply provides that \u201c[a]ny\nperson who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or\ndefeat any tax imposed by [the Internal Revenue Code] or\nthe payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties\nprovided by law, be guilty of a felony.\u201d Accordingly, nei-\nther fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction\nunder \u00a77201, which include: (1) willfulness; (2) the exist-\nence of a tax deficiency; and (3) an affirmative act consti-\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

S. 421, 424, n. 2 (2008).\nA conviction under \u00a77201, therefore, only qualifies as an\naggravated felony under Clause (i) if a willful, affirmative\nattempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.\n   This Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Scharton, 285\nU. S. 518 (1932), gave Congress good reason to doubt that\na conviction under \u00a77201 satisfies that condition. In\nScharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to\nevade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable\nincome. The question before the Court was whether the\ncrime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations\ngenerally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was\ninstead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations appli-\ncable to \u201c \u2018offenses involving the defrauding or attempting\nto defraud the United States or any agency thereof,\nwhether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n520, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a7585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe Government argued that the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions applied because \u201cfraud is implicit in the concept of\nevading or defeating\u201d and because any effort to evade a tax\nis tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.\n285 U. S., at 520\u2013521. The Court rejected that argument,\nnoting that, in an indictment for evasion, \u201can averment [of\nintent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be\nsufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade\nor defeat.\u201d Id., at 521.\n   Moreover, \u00a77201 includes two offenses: \u201cthe offense of\nwillfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a\ntax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade\nor defeat the payment of a tax.\u201d Sansone v. United States,\n380 U. S. 343, 354 (1965) (emphasis in original). As the\nGovernment notes, it is possible to willfully evade or de-\nfeat payment of a tax under \u00a77201 without making any\nmisrepresentation. For example, \u00a77201 can be violated by\na taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also\n10                KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his\nassets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nAlthough the Government concedes that evasion-of-\npayment cases will almost invariably involve some affirm-\native acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the ele-\nments of tax evasion pursuant to \u00a77201 do not necessarily\ninvolve fraud or deceit. Thus, we conclude that the specif-\nic inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) was intended to\nensure that tax evasion pursuant to \u00a77201 was a deporta-\nble offense. Clause (ii) does not implicitly remove all other\ntax offenses from the scope of Clause (i)\u2019s plain language.\n                               3\n   The Kawashimas also assert that the separate treat-\nment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit\nin the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their\ncontention that Congress did not intend to include tax\ncrimes within Clause (i). They point to the fact that, in\n1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included\nwithin the Guidelines a category of \u201coffenses involving\nfraud or deceit.\u201d USSG \u00a7\u00a72F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effec-\ntive Nov. 1, 2001). The Commission simultaneously in-\ncluded \u201coffenses involving taxation\u201d as a separate category.\n\u00a7\u00a72T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011). Although the Kawashimas\nacknowledge that they have found no evidence that Con-\ngress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend\nthat \u201cit is likely that the language of [Clause (i)] and\n[Clause (ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d by\nthe sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of\naggravated felony to include subparagraph (M). Brief for\nPetitioners 29. Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer\nfrom the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress\ndid not intend Clause (i) to include tax crimes.\n   We reject the Kawashimas\u2019 reliance on the Guidelines.\nThe Kawashimas\u2019 argument is at odds with the fact that,\nunlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause (ii)\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

That textual difference undercuts any infer-\nence that Congress was considering, much less incorporat-\ning, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.\n                                C\n  Finally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph (M)\u2019s\ntreatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambigu-\nous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in\ntheir favor. It is true that we have, in the past, construed\nambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien\u2019s favor.\nSee INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001). We think\nthe application of the present statute clear enough that\nresort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.\n                        *     *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that convictions\nunder 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggra-\nvated felonies pursuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i).\nBecause the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as\naliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies\npursuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S. C.\n\u00a77206(1). His wife, petitioner Fusako Kawashima, was\nconvicted under \u00a77206(2) of assisting her husband in\npreparing the false return. The question presented is\nwhether a conviction under \u00a77206 is an \u201caggravated felo-\nny\u201d that renders the Kawashimas deportable from the\nUnited States. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   Congress has defined \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include,\ninter alia, offenses that \u201c(i) involv[e] fraud or deceit in\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d or\n\u201c(ii) [are] described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\ntax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(M). The Kawashimas\nargue that tax offenses triggering deportation are deline-\nated exclusively in \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (or Clause (ii)), and\nthat \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (or Clause (i)) does not encompass\ntax crimes. The Court rejects this argument, and holds\nthat any tax offense \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit,\u201d if the loss\nto the fisc exceeds $10,000, ranks as an \u201caggravated fel-\nony.\u201d See ante, at 11. Because the Kawashimas\u2019 tax of-\nfense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,\nthe Court concludes, they have committed an aggravated\n2                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfelony and are therefore deportable.\n   The Court\u2019s construction of the statute is dubious, as\nI see it. For one thing, it effectively renders Clause (ii)\nsuperfluous. Further, the Court\u2019s reading sweeps a wide\nvariety of federal, state, and local tax offenses\u2014including\nmisdemeanors\u2014into the \u201caggravated felony\u201d category. In\naddition, today\u2019s decision may discourage aliens from\npleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,\nthereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the\ninternal revenue laws. I conclude that Clause (i) does not\naddress tax offenses, and would therefore hold that mak-\ning a false statement on a tax return in violation of \u00a77206\nis not an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d\n                             I\n  Any alien convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d after\nadmission to the United States is deportable. 8 U.

Tax crimes,\nthey argue, are addressed exclusively in Clause (ii), and\nthat clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by 26\nU. S. C. \u00a77201 as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Willfully sub-\nmitting a false statement proscribed by \u00a77206, the\nKawashimas maintain, is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nthat would render them deportable under 8 U.

Under the Government\u2019s construction, because the\ncrime of making a false statement on a tax return involves\n\u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cdeceit,\u201d the Kawashimas committed an aggra-\nvated felony. See ante, at 5 (\u201cthe words \u2018fraud\u2019 and \u2018deceit\u2019\nare absent from the text of \u00a77206(1) and are not them-\nselves formal elements of the crime,\u201d nonetheless, \u201c[the]\nelements [of a \u00a77206 crime] necessarily entail fraudulent\nor deceitful conduct\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s task is to determine which reading of\nthe statute is correct. If the two proffered constructions of\nsubparagraph (M) are plausible in roughly equal measure,\nthen our precedent directs us to construe the statute in\nthe Kawashimas\u2019 favor. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333\nU. S. 6, 10 (1948) (\u201cWe resolve the doubts in favor of [the\nalien] because deportation is a drastic measure . . . .\u201d); INS\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U.

If Clause (i) is\nconstrued to apply to tax crimes, then Clause (ii)\u2019s discrete\ninclusion of tax evasion would add nothing, for tax evasion\nis itself an offense that, in all actual instances of which\nthe Government is aware, \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit.\u201d See\n4                    KAWASHIMA v.

United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351 (1965). As this Court\u2019s\ndecisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or\nfraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax\nliability or misleading the Government as to the extent of\nthe liability. See, e.g., Spies v. United States, 317 U. S.\n492, 499 (1943) (an act of tax evasion may be \u201cany con-\nduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to\nconceal\u201d). Accordingly, courts have determined that tax\nevasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessari-\nly involves fraud. See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d\n1081, 1085, n. 7 (CA9 2005) (fraud is \u201cimplicit in the na-\nture of the crime\u201d of tax evasion); Considine v.

It is thus\nunderstandable that Congress would single out tax eva-\nsion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and\nno other tax crime, an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for deportation\npurposes.\n   The Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).\nTax evasion, made criminal by \u00a77201, the Court states,\n\u201calmost invariably,\u201d but \u201cnot necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud\nor deceit.\u201d Ante, at 10.

In other words, in\nholding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court\nfinds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.\n   In support of the notion that tax evasion can occur\nwithout fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v.\nScharton, 285 U. S. 518 (1932); see ante, at 9. In that\nlong-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government\u2019s\nplea for the application of an extended limitation period to\na prosecution for tax evasion. The generally applicable\n6                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nstatute of limitations was three years; for tax offenses that\ninvolve defrauding the United States, however, the limita-\ntion period was six years. An averment of intent to de-\nfraud, the Court said in Scharton, would be \u201csurplusage,\u201d\nfor it would suffice \u201cto plead and prove a wilful attempt to\nevade or defeat.\u201d 285 U. S., at 521.\n   Courts had limited Scharton to its statute of limita-\ntions context several decades before Congress enacted\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M) in 1994. See Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 247\nF. 2d 929, 936, n. 6 (CA9 1957) (distinguishing Scharton\nand holding that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude\nbecause it entails fraud); Lefkowitz, 334 F. 2d, at 265\n(distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion\nnecessarily involves fraud). Moreover, Congress, since\n1954, has expressly prescribed a six-year limitation period\nfor tax evasion. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a76531(2). In short, Schar-\nton is a cryptic, thinly reasoned opinion, one that did not\ninfluence subsequent federal-court description of the crime\nof tax evasion. The suggestion that Congress may have\nworried about Scharton when framing legislation over 60\nyears later is hardly credible.\n   The Court presents another reason, drawn from the\nGovernment\u2019s brief, why Congress may have treated tax\nevasion discretely, while embracing tax crimes generally\nwithin the Clause (i) category. Section 7201 covers both\nevasion of assessment and evasion of payment. Imagine a\ntaxpayer who files a truthful return, then moves her as-\nsets to a place \u201cbeyond the reach of the Internal Revenue\nService.\u201d Ante, at 10; see Brief for Respondent 34. The\nCourt acknowledges that evasion-of-payment cases almost\nalways \u201cinvolve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. Still, there may be a rare case in which that is\nnot so. Rare, indeed; imaginary would be an apt char-\nacterization.    The Government conceded that, to its\nknowledge, there have been no actual instances of indict-\nments for tax evasion unaccompanied by any act of fraud\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nor deceit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201331.\n   The canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid su-\nperfluity cannot be skirted as easily as the Government\nhere urges. We have declined to interpret legislation in\na way that \u201cwould in practical effect render [a provision]\nentirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circum-\nstances.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). It\nis hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a\ncase in which the provision might have some independent\nrole. See id., at 30. Where, as here, \u201cthe Government\nconcede[s] that the independent function one could attrib-\nute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,\u201d a construction\nmoored to a case \u201cmost unlikely\u201d to exist should be reject-\ned. Id., at 31. It is highly improbable that \u201ca pro-\nviso accounting for more than half of [the] text\u201d of\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M), i.e., Clause (ii), \u201cwould lie dormant in all\nbut the most unlikely situations.\u201d See 534 U. S., at 31.\n   Congress\u2019 aim in drafting \u00a71101(a)(43) was to determine\nwhich crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant the \u201cdras-\ntic measure\u201d of deportation, and which are not. See Fong\nHaw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10. It is implausible that Con-\ngress, when drafting \u00a71101(a)(43)(M), intended to address,\nor was even aware of, the Government\u2019s scenario: a tax-\npayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collec-\ntion of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore. Far\nmore likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offens-\nes in \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision\nto address fraudulent schemes against private victims,\nthen added \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the \u201ccapstone\u201d tax\noffense against the Government also qualified as an ag-\ngravated felony. See supra, at 5.\n                            B\n  The Court\u2019s construction of the statute is even less\nplausible given the numerous offenses it would rank as\n\u201caggravated felon[ies].\u201d Many federal tax offenses, like 26\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. \u00a77206, involve false statements or misleading\nconduct. See, e.g., \u00a77202 (failing to truthfully account for\nand pay taxes owed). Conviction of any of these offenses,\nif the Court\u2019s construction were correct, would render an\nalien deportable. So would conviction of state and local\ntax offenses involving false statements. Ferreira v. Ash-\ncroft, 390 F. 3d 1091, 1096\u20131097 (CA9 2004) (state-law\noffenses qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit under\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)); see, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n30, \u00a7574 (2009) (submitting a tax return false as to any\nmaterial matter is a criminal offense); D. C. Code \u00a747\u2013\n4106 (2001\u20132005) (same); Ala. Code \u00a740\u201329\u2013114 (2003)\n(same); Va. Code Ann. \u00a758.1\u20131815 (2009) (willfully failing\nto account truthfully for and pay certain taxes is a crimi-\nnal offense).\n   Rendering all tax offenses involving false statements\n\u201caggravated felon[ies]\u201d that subject an alien to deportation\nis all the more problematic, for many of these offenses are\nmisdemeanors. Among federal misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26\nU. S. C. \u00a77204 (\u201cfurnish[ing] a false\u201d W-2 form to an em-\nployee); \u00a77205 (\u201csuppl[ying] false or fraudulent infor-\nmation\u201d to an employer); \u00a77207 (filing a return \u201cknown . . .\nto be false as to any material matter\u201d). On the state and\nlocal level, see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. \u00a71610.4\n(West 1998) (\u201cEvery person who wilfully states anything\nwhich he knows to be false in any oral or written state-\nment, not under oath, required or authorized to be made\nas the basis of an application to reduce any tax or assess-\nment, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d); N. D. Cent.

C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M) prevent deportation for tax crimes far less\nserious than willful tax evasion, for as many as six years\nmay be included in the amount-of-loss calculation. See 26\nU. S. C. \u00a76531 (setting a six-year statute of limitations for,\ninter alia, tax crimes involving fraud or falsity); Brief for\nJohnnie M. Walters as Amicus Curiae 15\u201316 (hereinafter\nWalters Brief).2\n   Finally, the Court\u2019s decision has adverse consequences\nfor the efficient handling of tax prosecutions. It is often\neasier for the Government to obtain a conviction under\n\u00a77206 (false statements) than under \u00a77201 (tax evasion).\nSee United States v. Olgin, 745 F. 2d 263, 272 (CA3 1984)\n(unlike a conviction under \u00a77201, a conviction under \u00a77206\ndoes not require proof of a tax deficiency); Considine, 683\nF. 2d, at 1287 (unlike a conviction under \u00a77201, a convic-\ntion under \u00a77206 does not require proof of an attempt to\nescape a tax). For this reason, the Government has al-\nlowed taxpayers to plead guilty to a \u00a77206 charge in lieu of\ngoing to trial under \u00a77201 on an evasion charge. See\nWalters Brief 19\u201320. Deportation consequences are im-\nportant to aliens facing criminal charges. See Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10)\n(\u201c[P]reserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.\u201d (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322)). If a \u00a77206 charge carries the same prospect of\ndeportation as a \u00a77201 charge, then an alien\u2019s incentive to\nplead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 One might also ask what reason Congress would have for making a\n\ntax misdemeanor a deportable offense, while more serious crimes do not\njeopardize an alien\u2019s residency in the United States. See, e.g., Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11\u201312 (2004) (driving while drunk, causing\nserious bodily injury to others is not an aggravated felony).\n10                KAWASHIMA v.

Argued November 7, 2011\u2014Decided February 21, 2012\nAn Immigration Judge ordered the removal of resident aliens Akio and\n Fusako Kawashima, determining that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\n for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return, 26 U. S. C.\n \u00a77206(1), and Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s conviction for aiding and assisting\n in the preparation of a false tax return, \u00a77206(2), qualified as crimes\n involving fraud or deceit under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (Clause\n (i)) and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deport-\n ed under \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board of Immigration Appeals af-\n firmed. Holding that convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2)\n in which the Government\u2019s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 constitute\n aggravated felonies under Clause (i), the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but\n remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s\n conviction had caused a Government loss in excess of $10,000.\nHeld: Convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) in which the\n Government\u2019s revenue loss exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggravated\n felonies pursuant to Clause (i). Pp. 3\u221211.\n    (a) The Kawashimas\u2019 argument that they cannot be deported for\n the commission of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because crimes under\n \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) do not involve the fraud or deceit required by\n Clause (i) is rejected. This Court looks to the statute defining the\n crime of conviction, rather than the specific facts underlying the\n crime, see Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 186, to deter-\n mine whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses involve fraud or deceit with-\n in the meaning of Clause (i). Section 7206(1) provides that any per-\n son who \u201cwillfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which\n contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under\n the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and\n2                        KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    correct as to every material matter,\u201d shall be guilty of a felony. Alt-\n    hough the words \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d are absent from \u00a77206(1) and\n    are not themselves formal elements of the crime, it does not follow\n    that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s offense falls outside Clause (i). Clause (i) is not\n    limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\n    Rather, it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or de-\n    ceit\u2015meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudu-\n    lent or deceitful conduct. Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction under \u00a77206(1)\n    involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submit-\n    ted a tax return that was false as to a material matter. Mrs. Ka-\n    washima was convicted of violating \u00a77206(2), which declares that any\n    person who \u201c[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or\n    presentation . . . of a return . . . which is fraudulent or is false as to\n    any material matter\u201d has committed a felony. She committed a felo-\n    ny involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her hus-\n    band\u2019s filing of a materially false tax return. Pp. 3\u22126.\n       (b) The Kawashimas\u2019 argument that Clause (i), when considered in\n    light of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (Clause (ii)), must be interpret-\n    ed as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected. Clause (i) de-\n    fines \u201caggravated felony\u201d to mean an offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or\n    deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d\n    Clause (ii) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as an offense that is \u201cdescribed\n    in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the reve-\n    nue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\u201d Contrary to the Ka-\n    washimas\u2019 claim, the difference in the clauses\u2019 language\u2014\u201crevenue\n    loss to the Government\u201d in Clause (ii) compared to \u201closs to the victim\u201d\n    in Clause (i)\u2014does not establish Congress\u2019 intent to remove tax\n    crimes from the scope of Clause (i). By its plain language, Clause (i)\n    covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit, and Con-\n    gress\u2019 decision to tailor Clause (ii)\u2019s language to match the sole type\n    of offense it covers does not demonstrate that Congress intended to\n    implicitly circumscribe Clause (i)\u2019s broad scope. Furthermore, inter-\n    preting Clause (i) to include tax crimes does not violate the presump-\n    tion against superfluities. The specific inclusion of tax evasion in\n    Clause (ii) does not make it redundant to Clause (i) because the in-\n    clusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to 26\n    U. S. C. \u00a77201 was a deportable offense. Pp. 6\u221210.\n       (c) The United States Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 separate treatment of\n    tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the\n    Kawashimas\u2019 contention that Congress did not intend to include tax\n    crimes within Clause (i). No evidence suggests that Congress consid-\n    ered the Guidelines when drafting 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M). More-\n    over, the differences between \u00a71101(a)(43)(M) and the Guidelines un-\n    dercut any inference that Congress was incorporating the distinction\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

We\nhold that violations of 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) are\ncrimes \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit\u201d under 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) and are therefore aggravated felonies as\nthat term is defined in the Immigration and Nationality\nAct, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., when the loss to the Govern-\nment exceeds $10,000.\n                             I\n   Petitioners, Akio and Fusako Kawashima, are natives\nand citizens of Japan who have been lawful permanent\nresidents of the United States since June 21, 1984. In\n1997, Mr. Kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of will-\nfully making and subscribing a false tax return in viola-\ntion of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1). Mrs. Kawashima pleaded\nguilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the prep-\naration of a false tax return in violation of 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a77206(2).\n   Following their convictions, the Immigration and Natu-\n2                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nralization Service charged the Kawashimas with being\ndeportable from the United States as aliens who had\nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony.1 See 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an ag-\ngravated felony at any time after admission is deporta-\nble\u201d).2 In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress\nlisted categories of offenses that qualify as \u201caggravated\nfelonies\u201d for the purpose of deportation. See \u00a71101(a)(43).\nHere, the Government charged the Kawashimas with be-\ning deportable for committing offenses under subpara-\ngraph (M) of \u00a71101(a)(43). That subparagraph classifies\nas an aggravated felony an offense that either: \u201c(i) involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or vic-\ntims exceeds $10,000; or (ii) is described in section 7201 of\ntitle 26 (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000.\u201d Hereinafter,\nwe refer to \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) as \u201cClause (i)\u201d and to\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) as \u201cClause (ii).\u201d\n   At their deportation hearing, the Kawashimas argued\nthat their convictions under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206 did not\nqualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph (M).\nThe Immigration Judge disagreed and ordered removal,\nconcluding that the Kawashimas\u2019 convictions qualified as\naggravated felonies under Clause (i). The Kawashimas\nappealed the removal order to the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (Board), which affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s\ndecision. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Board to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 On March 1, 2003, most of the functions of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement, and the Immigration and Naturalization\nService ceased to exist.\n  2 Before 1996, there were two procedures for removing aliens from the\n\ncountry: \u201cdeportation\u201d of aliens who were already present, and \u201cexclu-\nsion\u201d of aliens seeking entry or reentry into the country. Since 1996,\nthe Government has used a unified procedure, known as \u201cremoval,\u201d for\nboth exclusion and deportation. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71229, 1229a. We use\nthe terms \u201cdeportation\u201d and \u201cremoval\u201d interchangeably in this opinion.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

The\ncourt concluded that Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction un-\nder \u00a77206(1) qualified as an aggravated felony within\nClause (i)\u2019s definition \u201cbecause it involved \u2018fraud or deceit\u2019\nand because his offense resulted in a loss to the govern-\nment in excess of $10,000.\u201d Id., at 1055. The Ninth Cir-\ncuit also determined that Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a77206(2) \u201cnecessarily \u2018involve[d] fraud or deceit.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 1055. But because Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s plea agree-\nment was not in the administrative record, the Ninth\nCircuit remanded to the Board to determine whether Mrs.\nKawashima\u2019s conviction had caused a loss to the Govern-\nment in excess of $10,000. Id., at 1056\u20131057.\n   We granted the Kawashimas\u2019 petition for a writ of certi-\norari to determine whether their convictions for violations\nof 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) respectively qualify as\naggravated felonies under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i).\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). We now affirm.\n                             II\n   The Kawashimas argue that they cannot be deported for\ncommission of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because crimes\nunder \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) do not \u201cinvolv[e] fraud or deceit\u201d\nas required by Clause (i). The Kawashimas also assert\nthat their convictions under \u00a77206 are not \u201caggravated\nfelonies\u201d because tax crimes are not included within\nClause (i) at all. We address each argument in turn.\n                        A\n  The Kawashimas contend that their offenses of convic-\n4                     KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntion do not fall within the scope of Clause (i) because\nneither \u201cfraud\u201d nor \u201cdeceit\u201d is a formal element of a con-\nviction under \u00a77206(1) or \u00a77206(2). The Government\nresponds that the Kawashimas\u2019 convictions necessarily in-\nvolved deceit because they required a showing that the\nKawashimas willfully made materially false statements.\nTo determine whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses \u201cinvolv[e]\nfraud or deceit\u201d within the meaning of Clause (i), we em-\nploy a categorical approach by looking to the statute defin-\ning the crime of conviction, rather than to the specific facts\nunderlying the crime. See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez,\n549 U. S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the approach set forth\nin Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599\u2013600 (1990)).\nIf the elements of the offenses establish that the Ka-\nwashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,\nthen the first requirement of Clause (i) is satisfied.3\n   Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a77206(1), which provides that any person who \u201c[w]illfully\nmakes and subscribes any return, statement, or other\ndocument, which contains or is verified by a written decla-\nration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and\nwhich he does not believe to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter,\u201d shall be guilty of a felony. Mr. Ka-\nwashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation\nof \u00a77206(1) include, inter alia, that the document in ques-\ntion was false as to a material matter, that the defendant\ndid not believe the document to be true and correct as to\nevery material matter, and that he acted willfully with the\nspecific intent to violate the law. See, e.g., United States v.\nAramony, 88 F. 3d 1369, 1382 (CA4 1996); United States v.\nKaiser, 893 F. 2d 1300, 1305 (CA11 1990); United States v.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 We\n       note that the issue whether the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses satisfy\nthe second requirement of Clause (i)\u2014that the loss to the victim ex-\nceeded $10,000\u2014is not before us. We address only whether their\noffenses of conviction qualify as crimes \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMarabelles, 724 F. 2d 1374, 1380 (CA9 1984); United\nStates v. Whyte, 699 F. 2d 375, 381 (CA7 1983). Although\nthe words \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d are absent from the text of\n\u00a77206(1) and are not themselves formal elements of the\ncrime, it does not follow that his offense falls outside of\nClause (i). The scope of that clause is not limited to of-\nfenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.\nRather, Clause (i) refers more broadly to offenses that\n\u201cinvolv[e]\u201d fraud or deceit\u2014meaning offenses with ele-\nments that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful\nconduct.\n   When subparagraph (M) was enacted, the term \u201cdeceit\u201d\nmeant a \u201cthe act or process of deceiving (as by falsification,\nconcealment, or cheating).\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 584 (1993). Mr. Kawashima\u2019s conviction\nunder \u00a77206(1) establishes that he knowingly and willfully\nsubmitted a tax return that was false as to a material\nmatter. He therefore committed a felony that involved\n\u201cdeceit.\u201d\n   Turning to Mrs. Kawashima, our analysis follows a\nsimilar path. Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating\n26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(2), which declares that any person who\n\u201c[w]illfully aids or assists in . . . the preparation or presen-\ntation under, or in connection with any matter arising\nunder, the internal revenue laws, of a return, affidavit,\nclaim, or other document, which is fraudulent or is false as\nto any material matter,\u201d has committed a felony. Mrs.\nKawashima does not dispute that the elements of a viola-\ntion of \u00a77206(2) include, inter alia, that the document in\nquestion was false as to a material matter and that the\ndefendant acted willfully. See Aramony, supra, at 1382;\nUnited States v. Sassak, 881 F. 2d 276, 278 (CA6 1989);\nUnited States v. Hooks, 848 F. 2d 785, 788\u2013789 (CA7\n1988); United States v. Dahlstrom, 713 F. 2d 1423, 1426\u2013\n1427 (CA9 1983). We conclude that Mrs. Kawashima\u2019s\nconviction establishes that, by knowingly and willfully\n6                  KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassisting her husband\u2019s filing of a materially false tax\nreturn, Mrs. Kawashima also committed a felony that\ninvolved \u201cdeceit.\u201d\n  The language of Clause (i) is clear. Anyone who is con-\nvicted of an offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which\nthe loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d has\ncommitted an aggravated felony and is subject to depor-\ntation pursuant to 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The ele-\nments of willfully making and subscribing a false corpo-\nrate tax return, in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(1), and of\naiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax re-\nturn, in violation of 26 U. S. C. \u00a77206(2), establish that\nthose crimes are deportable offenses because they neces-\nsarily entail deceit.\n                            B\n   The Kawashimas\u2019 second argument is based on infer-\nences drawn from the interaction of Clause (i) and\nClause (ii). The full text of subparagraph (M) reads as\nfollows:\n\n\n     \u201c(43) The term \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 means\u2014\n          .           .           .           .           .\n    \u201c(M) an offense that\u2014\n    \u201c(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n    \u201c(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\n    tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Govern-\n    ment exceeds $10,000.\u201d\nThe Kawashimas argue that when Clause (i) is read to-\ngether with Clause (ii), Clause (i) must be interpreted as\nbeing inapplicable to tax crimes. In their view, subpara-\ngraph (M), when considered in its entirety, demonstrates\nthat Congress was addressing two mutually exclusive\ncategories of crimes in subparagraph (M)\u2019s two clauses:\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngeneral, non-tax crimes involving fraud or deceit that\ncause actual losses to real victims in Clause (i), and\ntax crimes involving revenue losses to the Government\nin Clause (ii). For the reasons discussed below, this\nargument cannot overcome the plain language of Clause\n(i), which encompasses the Kawashimas\u2019 offenses of\nconviction.\n                              1\n  The Kawashimas contend that textual differences be-\ntween Clauses (i) and (ii) indicate that Congress intended\nto exclude tax crimes from Clause (i). Specifically, they\nnote that Clause (i) addresses \u201closs to the victim,\u201d whereas\nClause (ii) addresses \u201crevenue loss to the Government.\u201d\n  This difference in language does not establish Congress\u2019\nintent to remove tax crimes from the scope of Clause (i).\nClause (i) covers a broad class of offenses that involve\nfraud or deceit. Clause (i) thus uses correspondingly broad\nlanguage to refer to the wide range of potential losses and\nvictims. Clause (ii), on the other hand, is limited to the\nsingle type of offense \u201cdescribed in section 7201 of title 26\n(relating to tax evasion),\u201d which, by definition, can only\ncause one type of loss (revenue loss) to one type of victim\n(the Government). Congress\u2019 decision to tailor Clause (ii)\u2019s\nlanguage to match the sole type of offense covered by\nClause (ii) does not demonstrate that Congress also in-\ntended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of\nClause (i)\u2019s plain language.\n                             2\n  Next, the Kawashimas argue that interpreting\nClause (i) to include tax crimes violates the presumption\nagainst superfluities by rendering Clause (ii) completely\nredundant to Clause (i). Clause (ii) explicitly states that\nconvictions for tax evasion pursuant to 26 U. S. C. \u00a77201\nthat cause a revenue loss of at least $10,000 to the Gov-\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernment are aggravated felonies. The Kawashimas assert\nthat, if Clause (i) applies to tax crimes, then qualifying\nconvictions for tax evasion under Clause (ii) would also\nqualify as aggravated felonies under Clause (i), because\ntax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit. To but-\ntress this argument, the Kawashimas point to a body of\nlaw providing that a conviction for tax evasion under\n\u00a77201 collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from\ncontesting a civil penalty under 26 U. S. C. \u00a76663(b) for\n\u201cunderpayment . . . attributable to fraud.\u201d See, e.g., Gray\nv. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6 1983) (\u201cNumer-\nous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal\nincome tax evasion, either upon a plea of guilty, or upon\na jury verdict of guilt, conclusively establishes fraud in a\nsubsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application\nof the doctrine of collateral estoppel\u201d). Therefore, accord-\ning to the Kawashimas, if Clause (i) covers tax offenses,\nthen Clause (ii) is mere surplusage.\n   We disagree with the Kawashimas\u2019 contention that the\nspecific mention of one type of tax crime in Clause (ii)\nimpliedly limits the scope of Clause (i)\u2019s plain language,\nwhich extends to any offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or de-\nceit.\u201d We think it more likely that Congress specifically\nincluded tax evasion offenses under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77201 in\nClause (ii) to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.\n   Several considerations support this conclusion. Like\n\u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2), \u00a77201 does not, on its face, mention\nfraud or deceit. Instead, \u00a77201 simply provides that \u201c[a]ny\nperson who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or\ndefeat any tax imposed by [the Internal Revenue Code] or\nthe payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties\nprovided by law, be guilty of a felony.\u201d Accordingly, nei-\nther fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction\nunder \u00a77201, which include: (1) willfulness; (2) the exist-\nence of a tax deficiency; and (3) an affirmative act consti-\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

S. 421, 424, n. 2 (2008).\nA conviction under \u00a77201, therefore, only qualifies as an\naggravated felony under Clause (i) if a willful, affirmative\nattempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.\n   This Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Scharton, 285\nU. S. 518 (1932), gave Congress good reason to doubt that\na conviction under \u00a77201 satisfies that condition. In\nScharton, the defendant was indicted for attempting to\nevade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable\nincome. The question before the Court was whether the\ncrime was subject to the 3-year statute of limitations\ngenerally applicable to tax crimes, or whether it was\ninstead subject to the 6-year statute of limitations appli-\ncable to \u201c \u2018offenses involving the defrauding or attempting\nto defraud the United States or any agency thereof,\nwhether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n520, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a7585 (1962 ed., Supp. V)).\nThe Government argued that the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions applied because \u201cfraud is implicit in the concept of\nevading or defeating\u201d and because any effort to evade a tax\nis tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body.\n285 U. S., at 520\u2013521. The Court rejected that argument,\nnoting that, in an indictment for evasion, \u201can averment [of\nintent to defraud] would be surplusage, for it would be\nsufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade\nor defeat.\u201d Id., at 521.\n   Moreover, \u00a77201 includes two offenses: \u201cthe offense of\nwillfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a\ntax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade\nor defeat the payment of a tax.\u201d Sansone v. United States,\n380 U. S. 343, 354 (1965) (emphasis in original). As the\nGovernment notes, it is possible to willfully evade or de-\nfeat payment of a tax under \u00a77201 without making any\nmisrepresentation. For example, \u00a77201 can be violated by\na taxpayer who files a truthful tax return, but who also\n10                KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his\nassets beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.\nAlthough the Government concedes that evasion-of-\npayment cases will almost invariably involve some affirm-\native acts of fraud or deceit, it is still true that the ele-\nments of tax evasion pursuant to \u00a77201 do not necessarily\ninvolve fraud or deceit. Thus, we conclude that the specif-\nic inclusion of tax evasion in Clause (ii) was intended to\nensure that tax evasion pursuant to \u00a77201 was a deporta-\nble offense. Clause (ii) does not implicitly remove all other\ntax offenses from the scope of Clause (i)\u2019s plain language.\n                               3\n   The Kawashimas also assert that the separate treat-\nment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit\nin the United State Sentencing Guidelines supports their\ncontention that Congress did not intend to include tax\ncrimes within Clause (i). They point to the fact that, in\n1987, the United States Sentencing Commission included\nwithin the Guidelines a category of \u201coffenses involving\nfraud or deceit.\u201d USSG \u00a7\u00a72F1.1 to 2F1.2 (deleted effec-\ntive Nov. 1, 2001). The Commission simultaneously in-\ncluded \u201coffenses involving taxation\u201d as a separate category.\n\u00a7\u00a72T1.1 et seq. (Nov. 2011). Although the Kawashimas\nacknowledge that they have found no evidence that Con-\ngress actually considered the Guidelines, they contend\nthat \u201cit is likely that the language of [Clause (i)] and\n[Clause (ii)] was taken from the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d by\nthe sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of\naggravated felony to include subparagraph (M). Brief for\nPetitioners 29. Therefore, the theory goes, we can infer\nfrom the similar language in the Guidelines that Congress\ndid not intend Clause (i) to include tax crimes.\n   We reject the Kawashimas\u2019 reliance on the Guidelines.\nThe Kawashimas\u2019 argument is at odds with the fact that,\nunlike the Guideline that the Kawashimas cite, Clause (ii)\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

That textual difference undercuts any infer-\nence that Congress was considering, much less incorporat-\ning, the distinction drawn by the Guidelines.\n                                C\n  Finally, the Kawashimas argue that subparagraph (M)\u2019s\ntreatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambigu-\nous, and that we should therefore construe the statute in\ntheir favor. It is true that we have, in the past, construed\nambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien\u2019s favor.\nSee INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001). We think\nthe application of the present statute clear enough that\nresort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.\n                        *     *   *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that convictions\nunder 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77206(1) and (2) in which the revenue\nloss to the Government exceeds $10,000 qualify as aggra-\nvated felonies pursuant to 8 U. S.

S. C.\n\u00a77206(1). His wife, petitioner Fusako Kawashima, was\nconvicted under \u00a77206(2) of assisting her husband in\npreparing the false return. The question presented is\nwhether a conviction under \u00a77206 is an \u201caggravated felo-\nny\u201d that renders the Kawashimas deportable from the\nUnited States. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   Congress has defined \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include,\ninter alia, offenses that \u201c(i) involv[e] fraud or deceit in\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d or\n\u201c(ii) [are] described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to\ntax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Government\nexceeds $10,000.\u201d \u00a71101(a)(43)(M). The Kawashimas\nargue that tax offenses triggering deportation are deline-\nated exclusively in \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) (or Clause (ii)), and\nthat \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (or Clause (i)) does not encompass\ntax crimes. The Court rejects this argument, and holds\nthat any tax offense \u201cinvolv[ing] fraud or deceit,\u201d if the loss\nto the fisc exceeds $10,000, ranks as an \u201caggravated fel-\nony.\u201d See ante, at 11. Because the Kawashimas\u2019 tax of-\nfense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,\nthe Court concludes, they have committed an aggravated\n2                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfelony and are therefore deportable.\n   The Court\u2019s construction of the statute is dubious, as\nI see it. For one thing, it effectively renders Clause (ii)\nsuperfluous. Further, the Court\u2019s reading sweeps a wide\nvariety of federal, state, and local tax offenses\u2014including\nmisdemeanors\u2014into the \u201caggravated felony\u201d category. In\naddition, today\u2019s decision may discourage aliens from\npleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,\nthereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the\ninternal revenue laws. I conclude that Clause (i) does not\naddress tax offenses, and would therefore hold that mak-\ning a false statement on a tax return in violation of \u00a77206\nis not an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d\n                             I\n  Any alien convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d after\nadmission to the United States is deportable. 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Subparagraph (M) of \u00a71101(a)(43)\nincludes as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d:\n    \u201can offense that\u2014\n      \u201c(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\n    victim or victims exceeds $10,000; or\n      \u201c(ii) is described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating\n    to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the Gov-\n    ernment exceeds $10,000.\u201d\n   Notably, Clause (i) speaks of \u201closs to the victim,\u201d Clause\n(ii) of \u201crevenue loss to the Government.\u201d The Kawashimas\ncontend that Clause (i) covers crimes of fraud or deceit\ncausing losses unrelated to tax revenue. Tax crimes,\nthey argue, are addressed exclusively in Clause (ii), and\nthat clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by 26\nU. S. C. \u00a77201 as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Willfully sub-\nmitting a false statement proscribed by \u00a77206, the\nKawashimas maintain, is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d\nthat would render them deportable under 8 U. S. C.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Under the Government\u2019s construction, because the\ncrime of making a false statement on a tax return involves\n\u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cdeceit,\u201d the Kawashimas committed an aggra-\nvated felony. See ante, at 5 (\u201cthe words \u2018fraud\u2019 and \u2018deceit\u2019\nare absent from the text of \u00a77206(1) and are not them-\nselves formal elements of the crime,\u201d nonetheless, \u201c[the]\nelements [of a \u00a77206 crime] necessarily entail fraudulent\nor deceitful conduct\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s task is to determine which reading of\nthe statute is correct. If the two proffered constructions of\nsubparagraph (M) are plausible in roughly equal measure,\nthen our precedent directs us to construe the statute in\nthe Kawashimas\u2019 favor. See Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333\nU. S. 6, 10 (1948) (\u201cWe resolve the doubts in favor of [the\nalien] because deportation is a drastic measure . . . .\u201d); INS\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 320 (2001) (same).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\nIn interpreting 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M), I would rely\n\nupon the familiar canon that statutes should be interpret-\ned to avoid superfluity. See Corley v. United States, 556 \n\nU. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,\n101 (2004) (\u201c[O]ne of the most basic interpretive canons\u201d is\nthat a \u201cstatute should be construed so that effect is given\nto all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or\nsuperfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d)). If Clause (i) is\nconstrued to apply to tax crimes, then Clause (ii)\u2019s discrete\ninclusion of tax evasion would add nothing, for tax evasion\nis itself an offense that, in all actual instances of which\nthe Government is aware, \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit.\u201d See\n4                    KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201331.\n   The elements of tax evasion are the existence of a tax\ndeficiency, willfulness, and \u201can affirmative act constitut-\ning an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.\u201d Sansone\nv. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351 (1965). As this Court\u2019s\ndecisions indicate, the evasion of taxes involves deceit or\nfraud upon the Government, achieved by concealing a tax\nliability or misleading the Government as to the extent of\nthe liability. See, e.g., Spies v. United States, 317 U. S.\n492, 499 (1943) (an act of tax evasion may be \u201cany con-\nduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to\nconceal\u201d). Accordingly, courts have determined that tax\nevasion is a crime of moral turpitude, because it necessari-\nly involves fraud. See, e.g., Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d\n1081, 1085, n. 7 (CA9 2005) (fraud is \u201cimplicit in the na-\nture of the crime\u201d of tax evasion); Considine v. United\nStates, 683 F. 2d 1285, 1287 (CA9 1982) (\u201cThe express\nlanguage of section 7201 requires an intent to avoid tax (a\nlegitimate synonym for fraud).\u201d); Costello v. INS, 311 F. 2d\n343, 348 (CA2 1962) (\u201cThere can be no \u2018wilful\u2019 [tax] eva-\nsion without a specific intent to defraud.\u201d), rev\u2019d on other\ngrounds, 376 U. S. 120 (1964).\n   Even more to the point, courts have held that a convic-\ntion for tax evasion under 26 U. S. C. \u00a77201 \u201cconclusively\nestablishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceed-\ning.\u201d Gray v. Commissioner, 708 F. 2d 243, 246 (CA6\n1983); see Klein v. Commissioner, 880 F. 2d 260, 262\n(CA10 1989) (conviction under 7201 \u201ccollaterally estops a\ntaxpayer from denying fraud [in a] civil tax case involving\nthe same years\u201d).1 This preclusive effect obtains, courts\nhave explained, because \u201c \u2018willful\u2019 [tax evasion] includes all\nof the elements of fraud.\u201d Tomlinson v.

United States, 360 F. 2d 353, 356\n(CA4 1966) (\u201c[W]hile the criminal evasion statute does not\nexplicitly require a finding of fraud, the case-by-case pro-\ncess of construction of the civil [fraud] and criminal tax\nprovisions has demonstrated that their constituent ele-\nments are identical.\u201d).\n   Tax offenses span a wide range, from failure to file a tax\nreturn, 26 U. S. C. \u00a77203, to the unauthorized use of tax\nstamps, \u00a77209. But \u201cthe gravest of offenses against the\nrevenues,\u201d this Court has said, the \u201ccapstone\u201d of tax law\nviolations, is tax evasion. Spies, 317 U. S., at 497, 499;\nsee Boulware v. United States, 552 U. S. 421, 424 (2008).\nTellingly, the Kawashimas pleaded guilty to a crime carry-\ning a maximum prison term of three years, \u00a77206; for tax\nevasion, the maximum term is five years, \u00a77201. It is thus\nunderstandable that Congress would single out tax eva-\nsion, as it did in Clause (ii), specifically designating it, and\nno other tax crime, an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for deportation\npurposes.\n   The Court ascribes a different purpose to Clause (ii).\nTax evasion, made criminal by \u00a77201, the Court states,\n\u201calmost invariably,\u201d but \u201cnot necessarily[,] involve[s] fraud\nor deceit.\u201d Ante, at 10. But see supra, at 4 and this page.\nCongress likely included Clause (ii), the Court suggests,\nsimply \u201cto remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies\nas an aggravated felony.\u201d Ante, at 8. In other words, in\nholding that Clause (i) includes tax offenses, the Court\nfinds Clause (ii) largely, but not totally, redundant.\n   In support of the notion that tax evasion can occur\nwithout fraud or deceit, the Court cites United States v.\nScharton, 285 U. S. 518 (1932); see ante, at 9. In that\nlong-obsolete case, the Court rejected the Government\u2019s\nplea for the application of an extended limitation period to\na prosecution for tax evasion. The generally applicable\n6                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nstatute of limitations was three years; for tax offenses that\ninvolve defrauding the United States, however, the limita-\ntion period was six years. An averment of intent to de-\nfraud, the Court said in Scharton, would be \u201csurplusage,\u201d\nfor it would suffice \u201cto plead and prove a wilful attempt to\nevade or defeat.\u201d 285 U. S., at 521.\n   Courts had limited Scharton to its statute of limita-\ntions context several decades before Congress enacted\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M) in 1994. See Tseung Chu v. Cornell, 247\nF. 2d 929, 936, n. 6 (CA9 1957) (distinguishing Scharton\nand holding that tax evasion is a crime of moral turpitude\nbecause it entails fraud); Lefkowitz, 334 F. 2d, at 265\n(distinguishing Scharton and holding that tax evasion\nnecessarily involves fraud). Moreover, Congress, since\n1954, has expressly prescribed a six-year limitation period\nfor tax evasion. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a76531(2). In short, Schar-\nton is a cryptic, thinly reasoned opinion, one that did not\ninfluence subsequent federal-court description of the crime\nof tax evasion. The suggestion that Congress may have\nworried about Scharton when framing legislation over 60\nyears later is hardly credible.\n   The Court presents another reason, drawn from the\nGovernment\u2019s brief, why Congress may have treated tax\nevasion discretely, while embracing tax crimes generally\nwithin the Clause (i) category. Section 7201 covers both\nevasion of assessment and evasion of payment. Imagine a\ntaxpayer who files a truthful return, then moves her as-\nsets to a place \u201cbeyond the reach of the Internal Revenue\nService.\u201d Ante, at 10; see Brief for Respondent 34. The\nCourt acknowledges that evasion-of-payment cases almost\nalways \u201cinvolve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. Still, there may be a rare case in which that is\nnot so. Rare, indeed; imaginary would be an apt char-\nacterization.    The Government conceded that, to its\nknowledge, there have been no actual instances of indict-\nments for tax evasion unaccompanied by any act of fraud\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nor deceit. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201331.\n   The canon that statutes should be interpreted to avoid su-\nperfluity cannot be skirted as easily as the Government\nhere urges. We have declined to interpret legislation in\na way that \u201cwould in practical effect render [a provision]\nentirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circum-\nstances.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 29 (2001). It\nis hardly sufficient for the Government to hypothesize a\ncase in which the provision might have some independent\nrole. See id., at 30. Where, as here, \u201cthe Government\nconcede[s] that the independent function one could attrib-\nute to the [provision] would [rarely] arise,\u201d a construction\nmoored to a case \u201cmost unlikely\u201d to exist should be reject-\ned. Id., at 31. It is highly improbable that \u201ca pro-\nviso accounting for more than half of [the] text\u201d of\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M), i.e., Clause (ii), \u201cwould lie dormant in all\nbut the most unlikely situations.\u201d See 534 U. S., at 31.\n   Congress\u2019 aim in drafting \u00a71101(a)(43) was to determine\nwhich crimes are sufficiently serious to warrant the \u201cdras-\ntic measure\u201d of deportation, and which are not. See Fong\nHaw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10. It is implausible that Con-\ngress, when drafting \u00a71101(a)(43)(M), intended to address,\nor was even aware of, the Government\u2019s scenario: a tax-\npayer who files a truthful return, then, to thwart collec-\ntion of the tax due, moves all her assets offshore. Far\nmore likely, Congress did not intend to include tax offens-\nes in \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(i), but instead drafted that provision\nto address fraudulent schemes against private victims,\nthen added \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)(ii) so that the \u201ccapstone\u201d tax\noffense against the Government also qualified as an ag-\ngravated felony. See supra, at 5.\n                            B\n  The Court\u2019s construction of the statute is even less\nplausible given the numerous offenses it would rank as\n\u201caggravated felon[ies].\u201d Many federal tax offenses, like 26\n8                 KAWASHIMA v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. C. \u00a77206, involve false statements or misleading\nconduct. See, e.g., \u00a77202 (failing to truthfully account for\nand pay taxes owed). Conviction of any of these offenses,\nif the Court\u2019s construction were correct, would render an\nalien deportable. So would conviction of state and local\ntax offenses involving false statements. Ferreira v. Ash-\ncroft, 390 F. 3d 1091, 1096\u20131097 (CA9 2004) (state-law\noffenses qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit under\n8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(M)); see, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n30, \u00a7574 (2009) (submitting a tax return false as to any\nmaterial matter is a criminal offense); D. C. Code \u00a747\u2013\n4106 (2001\u20132005) (same); Ala. Code \u00a740\u201329\u2013114 (2003)\n(same); Va. Code Ann. \u00a758.1\u20131815 (2009) (willfully failing\nto account truthfully for and pay certain taxes is a crimi-\nnal offense).\n   Rendering all tax offenses involving false statements\n\u201caggravated felon[ies]\u201d that subject an alien to deportation\nis all the more problematic, for many of these offenses are\nmisdemeanors. Among federal misdemeanors, see, e.g., 26\nU. S. C. \u00a77204 (\u201cfurnish[ing] a false\u201d W-2 form to an em-\nployee); \u00a77205 (\u201csuppl[ying] false or fraudulent infor-\nmation\u201d to an employer); \u00a77207 (filing a return \u201cknown . . .\nto be false as to any material matter\u201d). On the state and\nlocal level, see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax.

C.\n\u00a71101(a)(43)(M) prevent deportation for tax crimes far less\nserious than willful tax evasion, for as many as six years\nmay be included in the amount-of-loss calculation. See 26\nU. S.

Walters as Amicus Curiae 15\u201316 (hereinafter\nWalters Brief).2\n   Finally, the Court\u2019s decision has adverse consequences\nfor the efficient handling of tax prosecutions. It is often\neasier for the Government to obtain a conviction under\n\u00a77206 (false statements) than under \u00a77201 (tax evasion).\nSee United States v. Olgin, 745 F. 2d 263, 272 (CA3 1984)\n(unlike a conviction under \u00a77201, a conviction under \u00a77206\ndoes not require proof of a tax deficiency); Considine, 683\nF. 2d, at 1287 (unlike a conviction under \u00a77201, a convic-\ntion under \u00a77206 does not require proof of an attempt to\nescape a tax). For this reason, the Government has al-\nlowed taxpayers to plead guilty to a \u00a77206 charge in lieu of\ngoing to trial under \u00a77201 on an evasion charge. See\nWalters Brief 19\u201320. Deportation consequences are im-\nportant to aliens facing criminal charges. See Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 10)\n(\u201c[P]reserving the client\u2019s right to remain in the United\nStates may be more important to the client than any\npotential jail sentence.\u201d (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at\n322)). If a \u00a77206 charge carries the same prospect of\ndeportation as a \u00a77201 charge, then an alien\u2019s incentive to\nplead guilty to any tax offense is significantly reduced.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 One might also ask what reason Congress would have for making a\n\ntax misdemeanor a deportable offense, while more serious crimes do not\njeopardize an alien\u2019s residency in the United States. See, e.g., Leocal v.\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11\u201312 (2004) (driving while drunk, causing\nserious bodily injury to others is not an aggravated felony).\n10                KAWASHIMA v.
