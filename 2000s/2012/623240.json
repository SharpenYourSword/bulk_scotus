Argued October 3, 2011\u2014Decided February 22, 2012*\r\nMedicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical\r\n care to needy individuals. To qualify for federal funds, a State must\r\n submit its Medicaid plan and any amendments to the federal agency\r\n that administers the program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\r\n Services (CMS). Before approving a plan or amendments, CMS con-\r\n ducts a review to determine whether they comply with federal re-\r\n quirements. Federal law requires state plans or amendments to \u201cas-\r\n sure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and\r\n quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers\u201d to make\r\n Medicaid \u201ccare and services\u201d available. 42 U. S.

INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                      SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                                  \r\n\r\n                            Syllabus\r\n\r\n\r\n    amendments to CMS. Before the agency finished its review, Medi-\r\n    caid providers and beneficiaries sought, in a series of cases, to enjoin\r\n    the rate reductions on the ground that they were pre-empted by fed-\r\n    eral Medicaid law. In seven decisions, the Ninth Circuit ultimately\r\n    affirmed or ordered preliminary injunctions preventing the State\r\n    from implementing its statutes. The court (1) held that the providers\r\n    and beneficiaries could bring a Supremacy Clause action; (2) essen-\r\n    tially accepted their claim that the State did not show that its\r\n    amended plan would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the\r\n    amendments thus conflicted with \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A); and (4) held that\r\n    the federal statute pre-empted the new state laws. In the meantime,\r\n    agency officials disapproved the amendments, and California sought\r\n    further administrative review. The cases were in this posture when\r\n    the Court granted certiorari to decide whether respondents could\r\n    mount a Supremacy Clause challenge. After oral argument, CMS\r\n    approved several of the State\u2019s amendments, and the State withdrew\r\n    its requests for approval of the remainder.\r\nHeld: The judgments are vacated and the cases are remanded, thereby\r\n permitting the parties to argue before the Ninth Circuit in the first\r\n instance the question whether respondents may maintain Supremacy\r\n Clause actions now that CMS has approved the state statutes. Pp.\r\n 5\u20138.\r\n    (a) CMS\u2019 approval does not make these cases moot, but it does put\r\n them in a different posture, since the federal agency charged with\r\n administering Medicaid has now found that the rate reductions com-\r\n ply with federal law. That decision does not change the substantive\r\n question whether California\u2019s statutes are consistent with federal\r\n law, but it may change the answer. It may also require respondents\r\n to seek review of CMS\u2019 determination under the Administrative Pro-\r\n cedure Act (APA) rather than in a Supremacy Clause action against\r\n California. The APA would likely permit respondents to obtain an\r\n authoritative judicial determination of the merits of their legal claim.\r\n And their basic challenge now presents the kind of legal question or-\r\n dinarily calling for APA review. The Medicaid Act commits to a fed-\r\n eral agency the power to administer a federal program, and the agen-\r\n cy has exercised that authority. As CMS is comparatively expert in\r\n the statute\u2019s subject matter, its decision carries weight. And\r\n \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A)\u2019s broad and general language suggests that CMS\u2019\r\n expertise is relevant in determining the provision\u2019s application. Fi-\r\n nally, to allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed once CMS has\r\n reached a decision threatens potential inconsistency or confusion.\r\n The Ninth Circuit declined to give weight to the Federal Govern-\r\n ment\u2019s interpretation of the federal law, but courts are ordinarily re-\r\n quired to apply deference standards to agency decisionmaking.

That\r\n  would make the Supremacy Clause challenge at best redundant.\r\n  Permitting it to continue would seem inefficient, for the federal agen-\r\n  cy is not a participant in the action, which will decide whether\r\n  agency-approved state rates violate federal law. Pp. 5\u20138.\r\n    (b) Given the present posture of the cases, the Court does not ad-\r\n  dress whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Supremacy\r\n  Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final\r\n  action. To decide whether these cases may proceed under the Su-\r\n  premacy Clause now that the agency has acted, it will be necessary\r\n  on remand to consider at least the matters addressed by this Court.\r\n  P. 8.\r\nNo. 09\u2013958, 572 F. 3d 644 (first judgment), 342 Fed.

INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwith (and pre-empts) state Medicaid statutes that reduce\r\npayments to providers. Since we granted certiorari, how-\r\never, the relevant circumstances have changed. The fed-\r\neral agency in charge of administering Medicaid, the Cen-\r\nters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has now\r\napproved the state statutes as consistent with the federal\r\nlaw. In light of the changed circumstances, we believe\r\nthat the question before us now is whether, once the agen-\r\ncy has approved the state statutes, groups of Medicaid\r\nproviders and beneficiaries may still maintain a Suprem-\r\nacy Clause action asserting that the state statutes are\r\ninconsistent with the federal Medicaid law. For the rea-\r\nsons set forth below, we vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judg-\r\nments and remand these cases for proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n                             I\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that\r\nprovides medical care to needy individuals. To qualify\r\nfor federal funds, States must submit to a federal agency\r\n(CMS, a division of the Department of Health and Human\r\nServices) a state Medicaid plan that details the nature and\r\nscope of the State\u2019s Medicaid program. It must also sub-\r\nmit any amendments to the plan that it may make from\r\ntime to time. And it must receive the agency\u2019s approval of\r\nthe plan and any amendments. Before granting approval,\r\nthe agency reviews the State\u2019s plan and amendments to\r\ndetermine whether they comply with the statutory and\r\nregulatory requirements governing the Medicaid program.\r\nSee 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71316(a)(1), (b), 1396a(a), (b); 42 CFR\r\n\u00a7430.10 et seq. (2010); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,\r\n496 U. S. 498, 502 (1990). And the agency\u2019s director has\r\nspecified that the agency will not provide federal funds for\r\nany state plan amendment until the agency approves the\r\namendment. See Letter from Timothy M.

Dept. of Health and Human\r\nServs., to State Medicaid Director (Jan. 2, 2001), online at\r\nhttp://www.cms.gov/SMDL/downloads/SMD010201.pdf (as\r\nvisited Feb. 17, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\r\nfile).\r\n   The federal statutory provision relevant here says that a\r\nState\u2019s Medicaid plan and amendments must:\r\n    \u201cprovide such methods and procedures relating to the\r\n    utilization of, and the payment for, care and services\r\n    available under the plan . . . as may be necessary to\r\n    safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care\r\n    and services and to assure that payments are con-\r\n    sistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care\r\n    and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that\r\n    care and services are available under the plan at least\r\n    to the extent that such care and services are available\r\n    to the general population in the geographic area.\u201d 42\r\n    U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A) (emphasis added).\r\n                              B\r\n   In 2008 and 2009, the California Legislature passed\r\nthree statutes changing that State\u2019s Medicaid plan. The\r\nfirst statute, enacted in February 2008, reduced by 10%\r\npayments that the State makes to various Medicaid pro-\r\nviders, such as physicians, pharmacies, and clinics. See\r\n2007\u20132008 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary Sess. ch. 3,\r\n\u00a7\u00a714, 15. The second statute, enacted in September 2008,\r\nreplaced the 10% rate reductions with a more modest set\r\nof cuts. See 2008 Cal. Sess. Laws ch. 758, \u00a7\u00a745, 57. And\r\nthe last statute, enacted in February 2009, placed a cap on\r\nthe State\u2019s maximum contribution to wages and benefits\r\npaid by counties to providers of in-home supportive ser-\r\nvices. See 2009\u20132010 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary\r\nSess. ch. 13, \u00a79.\r\n   In September and December 2008, the State submitted\r\n4      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                        \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nto the federal agency a series of plan amendments de-\r\nsigned to implement most of the reductions contained in\r\nthese bills. Before the agency finished reviewing the\r\namendments, however, groups of Medicaid providers and\r\nbeneficiaries filed a series of lawsuits seeking to enjoin the\r\nrate reductions on the ground that they conflicted with,\r\nand therefore were pre-empted by, federal Medicaid law,\r\nin particular the statutory provision that we have just\r\nset forth. They argued that California\u2019s Medicaid plan\r\namendments were inconsistent with the federal provision\r\nbecause the State had failed to study whether the rate\r\nreductions would be consistent with the statutory factors\r\nof efficiency, economy, quality, and access to care. In\r\neffect, they argued that California had not shown that its\r\nMedicaid plan, as amended, would \u201cenlist enough provid-\r\ners\u201d to make Medicaid \u201ccare and services\u201d sufficiently\r\navailable. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A).\r\n  The consolidated cases before us encompass five law-\r\nsuits brought by Medicaid providers and beneficiaries\r\nagainst state officials. Those cases produced seven deci-\r\nsions of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See\r\n572 F. 3d 644 (2009); 342 Fed. Appx. 306 (2009); 596 F. 3d\r\n1098 (2010); 563 F. 3d 847 (2009); 374 Fed. Appx. 690\r\n(2010); 596 F. 3d 1087 (2010); and 380 Fed. Appx. 656\r\n(2010). The decisions ultimately affirmed or ordered\r\npreliminary injunctions that prevented the State from im-\r\nplementing its statutes. They (1) held that the Medi-\r\ncaid providers and beneficiaries could directly bring an\r\naction based on the Supremacy Clause; (2) essentially\r\naccepted the claim that the State had not demonstrated\r\nthat its Medicaid plan, as amended, would provide suffi-\r\ncient services; (3) held that the amendments consequently\r\nconflicted with the statutory provision we have quoted;\r\nand (4) held that, given the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy\r\nClause, the federal statute must prevail. That is to say,\r\nthe federal statute pre-empted the State\u2019s new laws.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   In the meantime, the federal agency was also reviewing\r\nthe same state statutes to determine whether they satis-\r\nfied the same federal statutory conditions. In November\r\n2010, agency officials concluded that they did not sat-\r\nisfy those conditions, and the officials disapproved the\r\namendments. California then exercised its right to further\r\nadministrative review within the agency. The cases were\r\nin this posture when we granted certiorari to decide\r\nwhether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause\r\nchallenge to the state statutes and obtain a court injunc-\r\ntion preventing California from implementing its statutes.\r\n   About a month after we heard oral argument, the feder-\r\nal agency reversed course and approved several of Califor-\r\nnia\u2019s statutory amendments to its plan. See Letter from\r\nDonald M. Berwick, Administrator, CMS, to Toby Douglas,\r\nDirector, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs. (Oct. 27, 2011);\r\nLetter from Larry Reed, Director, Division of Pharmacy,\r\nDisabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, CMS, to\r\nToby Douglas, Director, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs.\r\n(Oct. 27, 2011). In doing so, the agency also approved a\r\nlimited retroactive implementation of some of the amend-\r\nments\u2019 rate reductions. The State, in turn, withdrew its\r\nrequests for approval of the remaining amendments, in\r\neffect agreeing (with one exception) that it would not seek\r\nto implement any unapproved reduction. See Letter from\r\nMichael E. Kilpatrick, Assistant Chief Counsel, Cal. Dept.\r\nof Health Care Servs., to Benjamin R. Cohen, Director,\r\nOffice of Hearings, CMS (Oct. 27, 2011). (The exception\r\nconsists of one statute for which California has submitted\r\nno amendment and which, by its own terms, cannot take\r\neffect unless and until this litigation is complete, see 2010\r\nCal. Sess. Laws ch. 725, \u00a725.)\r\n                             II\r\n   All parties agree that the agency\u2019s approval of the en-\r\njoined rate reductions does not make these cases moot.\r\n6      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                       \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nFor one thing, the providers and beneficiaries continue to\r\nbelieve that the reductions violate the federal provision,\r\nthe agency\u2019s view to the contrary notwithstanding. For\r\nanother, federal-court injunctions remain in place, forbid-\r\nding California to implement the agency-approved rate\r\nreductions. And, in light of the agency\u2019s action, California\r\nmay well ask the lower courts to set those injunctions\r\naside.\r\n   While the cases are not moot, they are now in a different\r\nposture. The federal agency charged with administering\r\nthe Medicaid program has determined that the challenged\r\nrate reductions comply with federal law. That agency\r\ndecision does not change the underlying substantive ques-\r\ntion, namely whether California\u2019s statutes are consistent\r\nwith a specific federal statutory provision (requiring that\r\nreimbursement rates be \u201csufficient to enlist enough pro-\r\nviders\u201d). But it may change the answer. And it may\r\nrequire respondents now to proceed by seeking review of\r\nthe agency determination under the Administrative Pro-\r\ncedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701 et seq., rather than in an\r\naction against California under the Supremacy Clause.\r\n   For one thing, the APA would likely permit respondents\r\nto obtain an authoritative judicial determination of the\r\nmerits of their legal claim. The Act provides for judicial\r\nreview of final agency action. \u00a7704. It permits any person\r\nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action to obtain\r\njudicial review of the lawfulness of that action. \u00a7702. And\r\nit requires a reviewing court to set aside agency action\r\nfound to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\r\nor otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a7706(2)(A).\r\n   For another thing, respondents\u2019 basic challenge now\r\npresents the kind of legal question that ordinarily calls for\r\nAPA review. The Medicaid Act commits to the federal\r\nagency the power to administer a federal program. And\r\nhere the agency has acted under this grant of authority.\r\nThat decision carries weight. After all, the agency is\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

And\r\nthe language of the particular provision at issue here is\r\nbroad and general, suggesting that the agency\u2019s expertise\r\nis relevant in determining its application.\r\n   Finally, to allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed\r\nonce the agency has reached a decision threatens potential\r\ninconsistency or confusion. In these cases, for example,\r\nthe Ninth Circuit, in sustaining respondents\u2019 challenges,\r\ndeclined to give weight to the Federal Government\u2019s inter-\r\npretation of the federal statutory language. (That view\r\nwas expressed in an amicus curiae brief that the United\r\nStates submitted in prior litigation.) See Independent\r\nLiving Center of Southern Cal., Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572\r\nF. 3d 644, 654 (CA9 2009) (referring to the United States\u2019\r\ncertiorari-stage invitation brief in Belshe v. Orthopaedic\r\nHospital, 522 U. S. 1044 (1998) (denying writ of certiora-\r\nri)). And the District Court decisions that underlie injunc-\r\ntions that now forbid California to implement its laws may\r\nrest upon similar analysis.\r\n   But ordinarily review of agency action requires courts\r\nto apply certain standards of deference to agency deci-\r\nsionmaking. See National Cable & Telecommunications\r\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)\r\n(describing deference reviewing courts must show); Chev-\r\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\r\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984) (same). And the parties have\r\nnot suggested reasons why courts should not now (in the\r\nchanged posture of these cases) apply those ordinary\r\nstandards of deference.\r\n   Nor have the parties suggested reasons why, once the\r\nagency has taken final action, a court should reach a\r\ndifferent result in a case like this one, depending upon\r\nwhether the case proceeds in a Supremacy Clause action\r\nrather than under the APA for review of an agency deci-\r\nsion. Indeed, to permit a difference in result here would\r\nsubject the States to conflicting interpretations of federal\r\n8      DOUGLAS v.

Cf. Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa\r\nClara County, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2)\r\n(noting that the treatment of lawsuits that are \u201cin sub-\r\nstance one and the same\u201d \u201cmust be the same, \u2018[n]o matter\r\nthe clothing in which [plaintiffs] dress their claims\u2019 \u201d (quot-\r\ning Tenet v. Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 8 (2005)). If the two kinds of\r\nactions should reach the same result, the Supremacy\r\nClause challenge is at best redundant. And to permit the\r\ncontinuation of the action in that form would seem to be\r\ninefficient, for the agency is not a participant in the pend-\r\ning litigation below, litigation that will decide whether the\r\nagency-approved state rates violate the federal statute.\r\n                              III\r\n   In the present posture of these cases, we do not address\r\nwhether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Suprem-\r\nacy Clause action to enforce this federal statute before the\r\nagency took final action. To decide whether these cases\r\nmay proceed directly under the Supremacy Clause now\r\nthat the agency has acted, it will be necessary to take\r\naccount, in light of the proceedings that have already\r\ntaken place, of at least the matters we have set forth\r\nabove. It must be recognized, furthermore, that the par-\r\nties have not fully argued this question. Thus, it may be\r\nthat not all of the considerations that may bear upon the\r\nproper resolution of the issue have been presented in the\r\nbriefs to this Court or in the arguments addressed to and\r\nconsidered by the Court of Appeals. Given the complexity\r\nof these cases, rather than ordering reargument, we va-\r\ncate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgments and remand the cases,\r\nthereby permitting the parties to argue the matter before\r\nthat Circuit in the first instance.\r\n                                             It is so ordered.\r\n                       Cite as: 565 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nlation; in exchange for federal funds a State agrees to\r\nabide by specified rules in implementing the program.\r\nOne of those rules is set forth in \u00a730(A) of the Act, which\r\nrequires States to meet particular criteria in establishing\r\nMedicaid reimbursement rates for those providing services\r\nunder the Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A). In 2008 and\r\n2009, California enacted legislation reducing the rates at\r\nwhich it would compensate some providers. Certain pro-\r\nviders and individuals receiving Medicaid benefits thought\r\nthe new reimbursement rates did not comply with the\r\ncriteria set forth in \u00a730(A). They sued the State to prevent\r\nthe new rates from going into effect.\r\n   But those plaintiffs faced a significant problem: Nothing\r\nin the Medicaid Act allows providers or beneficiaries\r\n(or anyone else, for that matter) to sue to enforce \u00a730(A).\r\nThe Act instead vests responsibility for enforcement\r\nwith a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\r\nServices (CMS). See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71316(a)(1). That is\r\nsettled law in the Ninth Circuit. See Sanchez v. Johnson,\r\n416 F. 3d 1051, 1058\u20131062 (2005) (\u201c[T]he flexible, admin-\r\nistrative standards embodied in [\u00a730(A)] do not reflect a\r\nCongressional intent to provide a private remedy for their\r\nviolation\u201d). And it is the law in virtually every other cir-\r\ncuit as well. See, e.g., Long Term Care Pharmacy Alli-\r\nance v. Ferguson, 362 F. 3d 50, 57\u201359 (CA1 2004) (holding\r\nthat it would be inconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedent to\r\nfind that \u00a730(A) creates rights enforceable by private\r\nparties). The respondents have never argued the contrary.\r\nThus, as this case comes to us, the federal rule is that\r\nMedicaid reimbursement rates must meet certain criteria,\r\nbut private parties have no statutory right to sue to en-\r\nforce those requirements in court.\r\n   The providers and beneficiaries sought to overcome that\r\ndifficulty by arguing that they could proceed against the\r\nState directly under the Supremacy Clause of the Consti-\r\ntution, even if they could not do so under the Act. They\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncontended that the new state reimbursement rates were\r\ninconsistent with the requirements of \u00a730(A). The Su-\r\npremacy Clause provides that a federal statute such as\r\n\u00a730(A) preempts contrary state law. Therefore, the pro-\r\nviders and beneficiaries claimed, they could sue to enforce\r\nthe Supremacy Clause, which requires striking down the\r\nstate law and giving effect to \u00a730(A). The Ninth Circuit\r\nagreed with this argument and blocked the new state\r\nreimbursement rates.\r\n  During briefing and argument in this case, the parties\r\nhave debated broad questions, such as whether and when\r\nconstitutional provisions as a general matter are directly\r\nenforceable. It is not necessary to consider these larger\r\nissues. It is not even necessary to decide whether the\r\nSupremacy Clause can ever provide a private cause of\r\naction. The question presented in the certiorari petitions\r\nis narrow: \u201cWhether Medicaid recipients and providers\r\nmay maintain a cause of action under the Supremacy\r\nClause to enforce [\u00a730(A)] by asserting that the provision\r\npreempts a state law reducing reimbursement rates.\u201d To\r\ndecide this case, it is enough to conclude that the Suprem-\r\nacy Clause does not provide a cause of action to enforce\r\nthe requirements of \u00a730(A) when Congress, in establishing\r\nthose requirements, elected not to provide such a cause of\r\naction in the statute itself.\r\n  The Supremacy Clause operates differently than other\r\nconstitutional provisions. For example, if Congress says in\r\na law that certain provisions do not give rise to a taking\r\nwithout just compensation, that obviously does not resolve\r\na claim under the Takings Clause that they do. The Su-\r\npremacy Clause, on the other hand, is \u201cnot a source of any\r\nfederal rights.\u201d Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights\r\nOrganization, 441 U. S. 600, 613 (1979); accord, Dennis v.\r\nHiggins, 498 U. S. 439, 450 (1991) (contrasting, in this\r\nregard, the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause).\r\nThe purpose of the Supremacy Clause is instead to ensure\r\n4      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, in a conflict with state law, whatever Congress says\r\ngoes. See The Federalist, No. 33, p. 205 (C. Rossiter ed.\r\n1961) (A. Hamilton) (the Supremacy Clause \u201conly declares\r\na truth which flows immediately and necessarily from the\r\ninstitution of a federal government\u201d).\r\n   Thus, if Congress does not intend for a statute to supply\r\na cause of action for its enforcement, it makes no sense to\r\nclaim that the Supremacy Clause itself must provide one.\r\nSaying that there is a private right of action under the\r\nSupremacy Clause would substantively change the federal\r\nrule established by Congress in the Medicaid Act. That is\r\nnot a proper role for the Supremacy Clause, which simply\r\nensures that the rule established by Congress controls.\r\n   Indeed, to say that there is a federal statutory right\r\nenforceable under the Supremacy Clause, when there is no\r\nsuch right under the pertinent statute itself, would effect\r\na complete end-run around this Court\u2019s implied right of\r\naction and 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 jurisprudence. We have em-\r\nphasized that \u201cwhere the text and structure of a statute\r\nprovide no indication that Congress intends to create\r\nnew individual rights, there is no basis for a private suit,\r\nwhether under \u00a71983 or under an implied right of action.\u201d\r\nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 286 (2002). This\r\nbody of law would serve no purpose if a plaintiff could\r\novercome the absence of a statutory right of action simply\r\nby invoking a right of action under the Supremacy Clause\r\nto the exact same effect. Cf. Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa\r\nClara County, 563 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntraditional exercise of equity jurisdiction supports finding\r\na direct cause of action in the Supremacy Clause. This\r\ncontention fails for the same reason. It is a longstand-\r\ning maxim that \u201c[e]quity follows the law.\u201d 1 J. Pomeroy,\r\nTreatise on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7425 (3d ed. 1905). A\r\ncourt of equity may not \u201ccreate a remedy in violation of\r\nlaw, or even without the authority of law.\u201d Rees v. Water-\r\ntown, 19 Wall. 107, 122 (1874). Here the law established\r\nby Congress is that there is no remedy available to private\r\nparties to enforce the federal rules against the State. For\r\na court to reach a contrary conclusion under its general\r\nequitable powers would raise the most serious concerns\r\nregarding both the separation of powers (Congress, not\r\nthe Judiciary, decides whether there is a private right of\r\naction to enforce a federal statute) and federalism (the\r\nStates under the Spending Clause agree only to conditions\r\nclearly specified by Congress, not any implied on an ad hoc\r\nbasis by the courts).\r\n  This is not to say that federal courts lack equitable\r\npowers to enforce the supremacy of federal law when such\r\naction gives effect to the federal rule, rather than con-\r\ntravening it. The providers and beneficiaries rely heavily\r\non cases of this kind, most prominently Ex parte Young,\r\n209 U. S. 123 (1908). Those cases, however, present quite\r\ndifferent questions involving \u201cthe pre-emptive assertion in\r\nequity of a defense that would otherwise have been avail-\r\nable in the State\u2019s enforcement proceedings at law.\u201d Vir-\r\nginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v.

But the\r\nCMS approvals have no impact on the question before this\r\nCourt. If, as I believe, there is no private right of action\r\nunder the Supremacy Clause to enforce \u00a730(A), that is the\r\nend of the matter. If, on the other hand, the Court be-\r\nlieves that there is such a cause of action, but that CMS\u2019s\r\nrecent rate approvals may have an effect on that action\r\ngoing forward, then the Court should say just that and\r\nthen remand to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of the\r\neffect of the agency approvals.\r\n   I am not sure what a remand without answering the\r\npreliminary question is meant to accomplish. The major-\r\nity claims that the agency\u2019s recent action \u201cmay change the\r\n[lower courts\u2019] answer\u201d to the question whether the partic-\r\nular state rates violate \u00a730(A). Ante, at 6. But that fact-\r\nspecific question is not the one before us; we chose not to\r\ngrant certiorari on the question whether California\u2019s rates\r\ncomplied with \u00a730(A), limiting our grant to the cause of\r\naction question. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n   The majority also asserts that the lower courts must\r\n\u201cdecide whether these cases may proceed directly under\r\nthe Supremacy Clause now that the agency has acted.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 8. The majority contends that the parties have\r\nnot \u201cfully argued this question.\u201d Ibid. But the agency\r\nproceedings that ultimately led to the CMS approvals\r\nwere well underway when this Court granted certiorari.\r\nThe parties debated the import of the parallel adminis-\r\ntrative proceedings in their initial briefs and at oral ar-\r\ngument. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 28\u201329 (\u201cPrivate\r\nlawsuits . . . interfere with . . .

See, e.g., Tr.\r\nof Oral Arg. 53\u201354 (counsel for respondents) (arguing that,\r\n\u201cto be sure,\u201d there would be a cause of action under the\r\nSupremacy Clause even after the agency took action on\r\nthe challenged rates).\r\n   Once the CMS approvals were issued, this Court di-\r\nrected the parties to file supplemental briefs to address\r\n\u201cthe effect, if any, of the [CMS approvals] on the proper\r\ndisposition of this case.\u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Again, no\r\none argued on supplemental briefing that the CMS ap-\r\nprovals affected the answer to the question before this\r\nCourt. See, e.g., Supp. Letter Brief for Certain Respond-\r\nents 6 (\u201cThe CMS findings do not directly resolve whether\r\nthe Constitution supports a right of action\u201d); Supp. Letter\r\nBrief for Petitioner 6 (agreeing that \u201cif a preemption cause\r\nof action may be stated here against the State, [CMS]\r\napproval may affect its merits but not its existence\u201d). It\r\nseems odd, then, to claim that the parties have not had the\r\nopportunity to fully address the impact of the agency\r\naction on the question that we granted certiorari to re-\r\nview: whether the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized a\r\nprivate cause of action under the Supremacy Clause to\r\nenforce \u00a730(A).\r\n   So what is the Court of Appeals to do on remand? It\r\ncould change its view and decide that there is no cause of\r\naction directly under the Supremacy Clause to enforce\r\n\u00a730(A). The majority itself provides a compelling list of\r\nreasons for such a result: \u201cThe Medicaid Act commits to\r\nthe federal agency the power to administer a federal pro-\r\ngram\u201d; \u201cthe agency is comparatively expert in the statute\u2019s\r\nsubject matter\u201d; \u201cthe language of the particular provision\r\n8      DOUGLAS v.

Allowing for both Supremacy Clause actions and\r\nagency enforcement \u201cthreatens potential inconsistency or\r\nconfusion,\u201d and imperils \u201cthe uniformity that Congress\r\nintended by centralizing administration of the federal\r\nprogram in the agency.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138; see Gonzaga, 536\r\nU. S., at 291\u2013293 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment)\r\n(explaining that Congress often means to preclude a pri-\r\nvate right of action in statutes where it employs an ad-\r\nministrative enforcement scheme that achieves \u201cexpertise,\r\nuniformity, widespread consultation, and resulting admin-\r\nistrative guidance,\u201d while \u201cavoid[ing] the comparative risk\r\nof inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can\r\narise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the\r\nstatute in a private action for damages\u201d).\r\n   The majority acknowledges, in light of all this, that the\r\nSupremacy Clause challenge appears \u201cat best redundant,\u201d\r\nand that \u201ccontinuation of the action in that form would\r\nseem to be inefficient.\u201d Ante, at 8. Still, according to the\r\nmajority, the Court of Appeals on remand could determine\r\nthat the Supremacy Clause action may be brought but\r\nthen must abate \u201cnow that the agency has acted,\u201d ibid.\u2014\r\nas everyone knew the agency would. A Court concerned\r\nwith \u201cinefficien[cy]\u201d should not find that result very pal-\r\natable, and the majority cites no precedent for a cause of\r\naction that fades away once a federal agency has acted.\r\nSuch a scenario would also create a bizarre rush to the\r\ncourthouse, as litigants seek to file and have their Su-\r\npremacy Clause causes of action decided before the agency\r\nhas time to arrive at final agency action reviewable in\r\ncourt.\r\n   Or perhaps the suits should continue in a different\r\n\u201cform,\u201d by which I understand the Court to suggest that\r\nthey should morph into APA actions.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nreview provisions, however, seem to stand in the way of\r\nsuch a transformation. To convert the litigation into an\r\nAPA suit, the current defendant (the State) would need to\r\nbe dismissed and the agency (which is not currently a\r\nparty at all) would have to be sued in its stead. 5 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7701\u2013706. Given that APA actions also feature\u2014among\r\nother things\u2014different standards of review, different\r\nrecords, and different potential remedies, it is difficult to\r\nsee what would be left of the original Supremacy Clause\r\nsuit. Or, again, why one should have been permitted in\r\nthe first place, when agency review was provided by stat-\r\nute, and the parties were able to and did participate fully\r\nin that process.\r\n  I would dispel all these difficulties by simply holding\r\nwhat the logic of the majority\u2019s own opinion suggests:\r\nWhen Congress did not intend to provide a private right of\r\naction to enforce a statute enacted under the Spending\r\nClause, the Supremacy Clause does not supply one of its\r\nown force. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions to the contrary\r\nshould be reversed.\r\n",

Argued October 3, 2011\u2014Decided February 22, 2012*\r\nMedicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical\r\n care to needy individuals. To qualify for federal funds, a State must\r\n submit its Medicaid plan and any amendments to the federal agency\r\n that administers the program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\r\n Services (CMS). Before approving a plan or amendments, CMS con-\r\n ducts a review to determine whether they comply with federal re-\r\n quirements. Federal law requires state plans or amendments to \u201cas-\r\n sure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and\r\n quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers\u201d to make\r\n Medicaid \u201ccare and services\u201d available. 42 U.

INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                      SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                                  \r\n\r\n                            Syllabus\r\n\r\n\r\n    amendments to CMS. Before the agency finished its review, Medi-\r\n    caid providers and beneficiaries sought, in a series of cases, to enjoin\r\n    the rate reductions on the ground that they were pre-empted by fed-\r\n    eral Medicaid law. In seven decisions, the Ninth Circuit ultimately\r\n    affirmed or ordered preliminary injunctions preventing the State\r\n    from implementing its statutes. The court (1) held that the providers\r\n    and beneficiaries could bring a Supremacy Clause action; (2) essen-\r\n    tially accepted their claim that the State did not show that its\r\n    amended plan would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the\r\n    amendments thus conflicted with \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A); and (4) held that\r\n    the federal statute pre-empted the new state laws. In the meantime,\r\n    agency officials disapproved the amendments, and California sought\r\n    further administrative review. The cases were in this posture when\r\n    the Court granted certiorari to decide whether respondents could\r\n    mount a Supremacy Clause challenge. After oral argument, CMS\r\n    approved several of the State\u2019s amendments, and the State withdrew\r\n    its requests for approval of the remainder.\r\nHeld: The judgments are vacated and the cases are remanded, thereby\r\n permitting the parties to argue before the Ninth Circuit in the first\r\n instance the question whether respondents may maintain Supremacy\r\n Clause actions now that CMS has approved the state statutes. Pp.\r\n 5\u20138.\r\n    (a) CMS\u2019 approval does not make these cases moot, but it does put\r\n them in a different posture, since the federal agency charged with\r\n administering Medicaid has now found that the rate reductions com-\r\n ply with federal law. That decision does not change the substantive\r\n question whether California\u2019s statutes are consistent with federal\r\n law, but it may change the answer. It may also require respondents\r\n to seek review of CMS\u2019 determination under the Administrative Pro-\r\n cedure Act (APA) rather than in a Supremacy Clause action against\r\n California. The APA would likely permit respondents to obtain an\r\n authoritative judicial determination of the merits of their legal claim.\r\n And their basic challenge now presents the kind of legal question or-\r\n dinarily calling for APA review. The Medicaid Act commits to a fed-\r\n eral agency the power to administer a federal program, and the agen-\r\n cy has exercised that authority. As CMS is comparatively expert in\r\n the statute\u2019s subject matter, its decision carries weight. And\r\n \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A)\u2019s broad and general language suggests that CMS\u2019\r\n expertise is relevant in determining the provision\u2019s application. Fi-\r\n nally, to allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed once CMS has\r\n reached a decision threatens potential inconsistency or confusion.\r\n The Ninth Circuit declined to give weight to the Federal Govern-\r\n ment\u2019s interpretation of the federal law, but courts are ordinarily re-\r\n quired to apply deference standards to agency decisionmaking.

That\r\n  would make the Supremacy Clause challenge at best redundant.\r\n  Permitting it to continue would seem inefficient, for the federal agen-\r\n  cy is not a participant in the action, which will decide whether\r\n  agency-approved state rates violate federal law. Pp. 5\u20138.\r\n    (b) Given the present posture of the cases, the Court does not ad-\r\n  dress whether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Supremacy\r\n  Clause action to enforce the federal law before the agency took final\r\n  action. To decide whether these cases may proceed under the Su-\r\n  premacy Clause now that the agency has acted, it will be necessary\r\n  on remand to consider at least the matters addressed by this Court.\r\n  P. 8.\r\nNo. 09\u2013958, 572 F. 3d 644 (first judgment), 342 Fed.

INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nwith (and pre-empts) state Medicaid statutes that reduce\r\npayments to providers. Since we granted certiorari, how-\r\never, the relevant circumstances have changed. The fed-\r\neral agency in charge of administering Medicaid, the Cen-\r\nters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has now\r\napproved the state statutes as consistent with the federal\r\nlaw. In light of the changed circumstances, we believe\r\nthat the question before us now is whether, once the agen-\r\ncy has approved the state statutes, groups of Medicaid\r\nproviders and beneficiaries may still maintain a Suprem-\r\nacy Clause action asserting that the state statutes are\r\ninconsistent with the federal Medicaid law. For the rea-\r\nsons set forth below, we vacate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judg-\r\nments and remand these cases for proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n                             I\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that\r\nprovides medical care to needy individuals. To qualify\r\nfor federal funds, States must submit to a federal agency\r\n(CMS, a division of the Department of Health and Human\r\nServices) a state Medicaid plan that details the nature and\r\nscope of the State\u2019s Medicaid program. It must also sub-\r\nmit any amendments to the plan that it may make from\r\ntime to time. And it must receive the agency\u2019s approval of\r\nthe plan and any amendments. Before granting approval,\r\nthe agency reviews the State\u2019s plan and amendments to\r\ndetermine whether they comply with the statutory and\r\nregulatory requirements governing the Medicaid program.\r\nSee 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71316(a)(1), (b), 1396a(a), (b); 42 CFR\r\n\u00a7430.10 et seq. (2010); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,\r\n496 U. S. 498, 502 (1990). And the agency\u2019s director has\r\nspecified that the agency will not provide federal funds for\r\nany state plan amendment until the agency approves the\r\namendment. See Letter from Timothy M.

S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A) (emphasis added).\r\n                              B\r\n   In 2008 and 2009, the California Legislature passed\r\nthree statutes changing that State\u2019s Medicaid plan. The\r\nfirst statute, enacted in February 2008, reduced by 10%\r\npayments that the State makes to various Medicaid pro-\r\nviders, such as physicians, pharmacies, and clinics. See\r\n2007\u20132008 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary Sess. ch. 3,\r\n\u00a7\u00a714, 15. The second statute, enacted in September 2008,\r\nreplaced the 10% rate reductions with a more modest set\r\nof cuts. See 2008 Cal. Sess. Laws ch. 758, \u00a7\u00a745, 57. And\r\nthe last statute, enacted in February 2009, placed a cap on\r\nthe State\u2019s maximum contribution to wages and benefits\r\npaid by counties to providers of in-home supportive ser-\r\nvices. See 2009\u20132010 Cal. Sess. Laws, 3d Extraordinary\r\nSess. ch. 13, \u00a79.\r\n   In September and December 2008, the State submitted\r\n4      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                        \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nto the federal agency a series of plan amendments de-\r\nsigned to implement most of the reductions contained in\r\nthese bills. Before the agency finished reviewing the\r\namendments, however, groups of Medicaid providers and\r\nbeneficiaries filed a series of lawsuits seeking to enjoin the\r\nrate reductions on the ground that they conflicted with,\r\nand therefore were pre-empted by, federal Medicaid law,\r\nin particular the statutory provision that we have just\r\nset forth. They argued that California\u2019s Medicaid plan\r\namendments were inconsistent with the federal provision\r\nbecause the State had failed to study whether the rate\r\nreductions would be consistent with the statutory factors\r\nof efficiency, economy, quality, and access to care. In\r\neffect, they argued that California had not shown that its\r\nMedicaid plan, as amended, would \u201cenlist enough provid-\r\ners\u201d to make Medicaid \u201ccare and services\u201d sufficiently\r\navailable. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A).\r\n  The consolidated cases before us encompass five law-\r\nsuits brought by Medicaid providers and beneficiaries\r\nagainst state officials. Those cases produced seven deci-\r\nsions of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See\r\n572 F. 3d 644 (2009); 342 Fed. Appx. 306 (2009); 596 F. 3d\r\n1098 (2010); 563 F. 3d 847 (2009); 374 Fed. Appx. 690\r\n(2010); 596 F. 3d 1087 (2010); and 380 Fed. Appx. 656\r\n(2010). The decisions ultimately affirmed or ordered\r\npreliminary injunctions that prevented the State from im-\r\nplementing its statutes. They (1) held that the Medi-\r\ncaid providers and beneficiaries could directly bring an\r\naction based on the Supremacy Clause; (2) essentially\r\naccepted the claim that the State had not demonstrated\r\nthat its Medicaid plan, as amended, would provide suffi-\r\ncient services; (3) held that the amendments consequently\r\nconflicted with the statutory provision we have quoted;\r\nand (4) held that, given the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy\r\nClause, the federal statute must prevail. That is to say,\r\nthe federal statute pre-empted the State\u2019s new laws.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   In the meantime, the federal agency was also reviewing\r\nthe same state statutes to determine whether they satis-\r\nfied the same federal statutory conditions. In November\r\n2010, agency officials concluded that they did not sat-\r\nisfy those conditions, and the officials disapproved the\r\namendments. California then exercised its right to further\r\nadministrative review within the agency. The cases were\r\nin this posture when we granted certiorari to decide\r\nwhether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause\r\nchallenge to the state statutes and obtain a court injunc-\r\ntion preventing California from implementing its statutes.\r\n   About a month after we heard oral argument, the feder-\r\nal agency reversed course and approved several of Califor-\r\nnia\u2019s statutory amendments to its plan. See Letter from\r\nDonald M. Berwick, Administrator, CMS, to Toby Douglas,\r\nDirector, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs. (Oct. 27, 2011);\r\nLetter from Larry Reed, Director, Division of Pharmacy,\r\nDisabled and Elderly Health Programs Group, CMS, to\r\nToby Douglas, Director, Cal. Dept. of Health Care Servs.\r\n(Oct. 27, 2011). In doing so, the agency also approved a\r\nlimited retroactive implementation of some of the amend-\r\nments\u2019 rate reductions. The State, in turn, withdrew its\r\nrequests for approval of the remaining amendments, in\r\neffect agreeing (with one exception) that it would not seek\r\nto implement any unapproved reduction. See Letter from\r\nMichael E. Kilpatrick, Assistant Chief Counsel, Cal. Dept.\r\nof Health Care Servs., to Benjamin R. Cohen, Director,\r\nOffice of Hearings, CMS (Oct. 27, 2011). (The exception\r\nconsists of one statute for which California has submitted\r\nno amendment and which, by its own terms, cannot take\r\neffect unless and until this litigation is complete, see 2010\r\nCal. Sess. Laws ch. 725, \u00a725.)\r\n                             II\r\n   All parties agree that the agency\u2019s approval of the en-\r\njoined rate reductions does not make these cases moot.\r\n6      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                       \r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court \r\n\r\n\r\nFor one thing, the providers and beneficiaries continue to\r\nbelieve that the reductions violate the federal provision,\r\nthe agency\u2019s view to the contrary notwithstanding. For\r\nanother, federal-court injunctions remain in place, forbid-\r\nding California to implement the agency-approved rate\r\nreductions. And, in light of the agency\u2019s action, California\r\nmay well ask the lower courts to set those injunctions\r\naside.\r\n   While the cases are not moot, they are now in a different\r\nposture. The federal agency charged with administering\r\nthe Medicaid program has determined that the challenged\r\nrate reductions comply with federal law. That agency\r\ndecision does not change the underlying substantive ques-\r\ntion, namely whether California\u2019s statutes are consistent\r\nwith a specific federal statutory provision (requiring that\r\nreimbursement rates be \u201csufficient to enlist enough pro-\r\nviders\u201d). But it may change the answer. And it may\r\nrequire respondents now to proceed by seeking review of\r\nthe agency determination under the Administrative Pro-\r\ncedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701 et seq., rather than in an\r\naction against California under the Supremacy Clause.\r\n   For one thing, the APA would likely permit respondents\r\nto obtain an authoritative judicial determination of the\r\nmerits of their legal claim. The Act provides for judicial\r\nreview of final agency action. \u00a7704. It permits any person\r\nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action to obtain\r\njudicial review of the lawfulness of that action. \u00a7702. And\r\nit requires a reviewing court to set aside agency action\r\nfound to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\r\nor otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d \u00a7706(2)(A).\r\n   For another thing, respondents\u2019 basic challenge now\r\npresents the kind of legal question that ordinarily calls for\r\nAPA review. The Medicaid Act commits to the federal\r\nagency the power to administer a federal program. And\r\nhere the agency has acted under this grant of authority.\r\nThat decision carries weight. After all, the agency is\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncomparatively expert in the statute\u2019s subject matter. And\r\nthe language of the particular provision at issue here is\r\nbroad and general, suggesting that the agency\u2019s expertise\r\nis relevant in determining its application.\r\n   Finally, to allow a Supremacy Clause action to proceed\r\nonce the agency has reached a decision threatens potential\r\ninconsistency or confusion. In these cases, for example,\r\nthe Ninth Circuit, in sustaining respondents\u2019 challenges,\r\ndeclined to give weight to the Federal Government\u2019s inter-\r\npretation of the federal statutory language. (That view\r\nwas expressed in an amicus curiae brief that the United\r\nStates submitted in prior litigation.) See Independent\r\nLiving Center of Southern Cal., Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572\r\nF. 3d 644, 654 (CA9 2009) (referring to the United States\u2019\r\ncertiorari-stage invitation brief in Belshe v. Orthopaedic\r\nHospital, 522 U. S. 1044 (1998) (denying writ of certiora-\r\nri)). And the District Court decisions that underlie injunc-\r\ntions that now forbid California to implement its laws may\r\nrest upon similar analysis.\r\n   But ordinarily review of agency action requires courts\r\nto apply certain standards of deference to agency deci-\r\nsionmaking. See National Cable & Telecommunications\r\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)\r\n(describing deference reviewing courts must show); Chev-\r\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\r\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984) (same). And the parties have\r\nnot suggested reasons why courts should not now (in the\r\nchanged posture of these cases) apply those ordinary\r\nstandards of deference.\r\n   Nor have the parties suggested reasons why, once the\r\nagency has taken final action, a court should reach a\r\ndifferent result in a case like this one, depending upon\r\nwhether the case proceeds in a Supremacy Clause action\r\nrather than under the APA for review of an agency deci-\r\nsion.

Doe, 544 U. S. 1, 8 (2005)). If the two kinds of\r\nactions should reach the same result, the Supremacy\r\nClause challenge is at best redundant. And to permit the\r\ncontinuation of the action in that form would seem to be\r\ninefficient, for the agency is not a participant in the pend-\r\ning litigation below, litigation that will decide whether the\r\nagency-approved state rates violate the federal statute.\r\n                              III\r\n   In the present posture of these cases, we do not address\r\nwhether the Ninth Circuit properly recognized a Suprem-\r\nacy Clause action to enforce this federal statute before the\r\nagency took final action. To decide whether these cases\r\nmay proceed directly under the Supremacy Clause now\r\nthat the agency has acted, it will be necessary to take\r\naccount, in light of the proceedings that have already\r\ntaken place, of at least the matters we have set forth\r\nabove. It must be recognized, furthermore, that the par-\r\nties have not fully argued this question. Thus, it may be\r\nthat not all of the considerations that may bear upon the\r\nproper resolution of the issue have been presented in the\r\nbriefs to this Court or in the arguments addressed to and\r\nconsidered by the Court of Appeals. Given the complexity\r\nof these cases, rather than ordering reargument, we va-\r\ncate the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgments and remand the cases,\r\nthereby permitting the parties to argue the matter before\r\nthat Circuit in the first instance.\r\n                                             It is so ordered.\r\n                       Cite as: 565 U.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nlation; in exchange for federal funds a State agrees to\r\nabide by specified rules in implementing the program.\r\nOne of those rules is set forth in \u00a730(A) of the Act, which\r\nrequires States to meet particular criteria in establishing\r\nMedicaid reimbursement rates for those providing services\r\nunder the Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(30)(A). In 2008 and\r\n2009, California enacted legislation reducing the rates at\r\nwhich it would compensate some providers. Certain pro-\r\nviders and individuals receiving Medicaid benefits thought\r\nthe new reimbursement rates did not comply with the\r\ncriteria set forth in \u00a730(A). They sued the State to prevent\r\nthe new rates from going into effect.\r\n   But those plaintiffs faced a significant problem: Nothing\r\nin the Medicaid Act allows providers or beneficiaries\r\n(or anyone else, for that matter) to sue to enforce \u00a730(A).\r\nThe Act instead vests responsibility for enforcement\r\nwith a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\r\nServices (CMS). See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71316(a)(1). That is\r\nsettled law in the Ninth Circuit. See Sanchez v. Johnson,\r\n416 F. 3d 1051, 1058\u20131062 (2005) (\u201c[T]he flexible, admin-\r\nistrative standards embodied in [\u00a730(A)] do not reflect a\r\nCongressional intent to provide a private remedy for their\r\nviolation\u201d). And it is the law in virtually every other cir-\r\ncuit as well. See, e.g., Long Term Care Pharmacy Alli-\r\nance v. Ferguson, 362 F. 3d 50, 57\u201359 (CA1 2004) (holding\r\nthat it would be inconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedent to\r\nfind that \u00a730(A) creates rights enforceable by private\r\nparties). The respondents have never argued the contrary.\r\nThus, as this case comes to us, the federal rule is that\r\nMedicaid reimbursement rates must meet certain criteria,\r\nbut private parties have no statutory right to sue to en-\r\nforce those requirements in court.\r\n   The providers and beneficiaries sought to overcome that\r\ndifficulty by arguing that they could proceed against the\r\nState directly under the Supremacy Clause of the Consti-\r\ntution, even if they could not do so under the Act. They\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncontended that the new state reimbursement rates were\r\ninconsistent with the requirements of \u00a730(A). The Su-\r\npremacy Clause provides that a federal statute such as\r\n\u00a730(A) preempts contrary state law. Therefore, the pro-\r\nviders and beneficiaries claimed, they could sue to enforce\r\nthe Supremacy Clause, which requires striking down the\r\nstate law and giving effect to \u00a730(A). The Ninth Circuit\r\nagreed with this argument and blocked the new state\r\nreimbursement rates.\r\n  During briefing and argument in this case, the parties\r\nhave debated broad questions, such as whether and when\r\nconstitutional provisions as a general matter are directly\r\nenforceable. It is not necessary to consider these larger\r\nissues. It is not even necessary to decide whether the\r\nSupremacy Clause can ever provide a private cause of\r\naction. The question presented in the certiorari petitions\r\nis narrow: \u201cWhether Medicaid recipients and providers\r\nmay maintain a cause of action under the Supremacy\r\nClause to enforce [\u00a730(A)] by asserting that the provision\r\npreempts a state law reducing reimbursement rates.\u201d To\r\ndecide this case, it is enough to conclude that the Suprem-\r\nacy Clause does not provide a cause of action to enforce\r\nthe requirements of \u00a730(A) when Congress, in establishing\r\nthose requirements, elected not to provide such a cause of\r\naction in the statute itself.\r\n  The Supremacy Clause operates differently than other\r\nconstitutional provisions. For example, if Congress says in\r\na law that certain provisions do not give rise to a taking\r\nwithout just compensation, that obviously does not resolve\r\na claim under the Takings Clause that they do. The Su-\r\npremacy Clause, on the other hand, is \u201cnot a source of any\r\nfederal rights.\u201d Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights\r\nOrganization, 441 U. S. 600, 613 (1979); accord, Dennis v.\r\nHiggins, 498 U. S. 439, 450 (1991) (contrasting, in this\r\nregard, the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause).\r\nThe purpose of the Supremacy Clause is instead to ensure\r\n4      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, in a conflict with state law, whatever Congress says\r\ngoes. See The Federalist, No. 33, p. 205 (C. Rossiter ed.\r\n1961) (A. Hamilton) (the Supremacy Clause \u201conly declares\r\na truth which flows immediately and necessarily from the\r\ninstitution of a federal government\u201d).\r\n   Thus, if Congress does not intend for a statute to supply\r\na cause of action for its enforcement, it makes no sense to\r\nclaim that the Supremacy Clause itself must provide one.\r\nSaying that there is a private right of action under the\r\nSupremacy Clause would substantively change the federal\r\nrule established by Congress in the Medicaid Act. That is\r\nnot a proper role for the Supremacy Clause, which simply\r\nensures that the rule established by Congress controls.\r\n   Indeed, to say that there is a federal statutory right\r\nenforceable under the Supremacy Clause, when there is no\r\nsuch right under the pertinent statute itself, would effect\r\na complete end-run around this Court\u2019s implied right of\r\naction and 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 jurisprudence. We have em-\r\nphasized that \u201cwhere the text and structure of a statute\r\nprovide no indication that Congress intends to create\r\nnew individual rights, there is no basis for a private suit,\r\nwhether under \u00a71983 or under an implied right of action.\u201d\r\nGonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 286 (2002). This\r\nbody of law would serve no purpose if a plaintiff could\r\novercome the absence of a statutory right of action simply\r\nby invoking a right of action under the Supremacy Clause\r\nto the exact same effect. Cf. Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa\r\nClara County, 563 U.

Here the law established\r\nby Congress is that there is no remedy available to private\r\nparties to enforce the federal rules against the State. For\r\na court to reach a contrary conclusion under its general\r\nequitable powers would raise the most serious concerns\r\nregarding both the separation of powers (Congress, not\r\nthe Judiciary, decides whether there is a private right of\r\naction to enforce a federal statute) and federalism (the\r\nStates under the Spending Clause agree only to conditions\r\nclearly specified by Congress, not any implied on an ad hoc\r\nbasis by the courts).\r\n  This is not to say that federal courts lack equitable\r\npowers to enforce the supremacy of federal law when such\r\naction gives effect to the federal rule, rather than con-\r\ntravening it. The providers and beneficiaries rely heavily\r\non cases of this kind, most prominently Ex parte Young,\r\n209 U. S. 123 (1908). Those cases, however, present quite\r\ndifferent questions involving \u201cthe pre-emptive assertion in\r\nequity of a defense that would otherwise have been avail-\r\nable in the State\u2019s enforcement proceedings at law.\u201d Vir-\r\nginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v.

Nothing of that sort is at issue here; the respondents\r\nare not subject to or threatened with any enforcement\r\nproceeding like the one in Ex parte Young. They simply\r\nseek a private cause of action Congress chose not to\r\nprovide.\r\n6      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\n                         *    *     *\r\n   The Court decides not to decide the question on which\r\nwe granted certiorari but instead to send the cases back to\r\nthe Court of Appeals, because of the recent action by CMS\r\napproving California\u2019s new reimbursement rates. But the\r\nCMS approvals have no impact on the question before this\r\nCourt. If, as I believe, there is no private right of action\r\nunder the Supremacy Clause to enforce \u00a730(A), that is the\r\nend of the matter. If, on the other hand, the Court be-\r\nlieves that there is such a cause of action, but that CMS\u2019s\r\nrecent rate approvals may have an effect on that action\r\ngoing forward, then the Court should say just that and\r\nthen remand to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of the\r\neffect of the agency approvals.\r\n   I am not sure what a remand without answering the\r\npreliminary question is meant to accomplish. The major-\r\nity claims that the agency\u2019s recent action \u201cmay change the\r\n[lower courts\u2019] answer\u201d to the question whether the partic-\r\nular state rates violate \u00a730(A). Ante, at 6. But that fact-\r\nspecific question is not the one before us; we chose not to\r\ngrant certiorari on the question whether California\u2019s rates\r\ncomplied with \u00a730(A), limiting our grant to the cause of\r\naction question. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n   The majority also asserts that the lower courts must\r\n\u201cdecide whether these cases may proceed directly under\r\nthe Supremacy Clause now that the agency has acted.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 8. The majority contends that the parties have\r\nnot \u201cfully argued this question.\u201d Ibid. But the agency\r\nproceedings that ultimately led to the CMS approvals\r\nwere well underway when this Court granted certiorari.\r\nThe parties debated the import of the parallel adminis-\r\ntrative proceedings in their initial briefs and at oral ar-\r\ngument. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 28\u201329 (\u201cPrivate\r\nlawsuits . . . interfere with . . .

S. ____ (2012)           7\r\n\r\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\npital et al. in No.10\u2013283, p. 46 (\u201cThis case vividly illus-\r\ntrates why the [administrative] enforcement scheme . . .\r\ncannot substitute for a constitutional preemption claim\u201d).\r\nNo party\u2014nor the United States as amicus curiae\u2014\r\nargued that any action by CMS would affect the answer to\r\nthe question we granted certiorari to review. See, e.g., Tr.\r\nof Oral Arg. 53\u201354 (counsel for respondents) (arguing that,\r\n\u201cto be sure,\u201d there would be a cause of action under the\r\nSupremacy Clause even after the agency took action on\r\nthe challenged rates).\r\n   Once the CMS approvals were issued, this Court di-\r\nrected the parties to file supplemental briefs to address\r\n\u201cthe effect, if any, of the [CMS approvals] on the proper\r\ndisposition of this case.\u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Again, no\r\none argued on supplemental briefing that the CMS ap-\r\nprovals affected the answer to the question before this\r\nCourt. See, e.g., Supp. Letter Brief for Certain Respond-\r\nents 6 (\u201cThe CMS findings do not directly resolve whether\r\nthe Constitution supports a right of action\u201d); Supp. Letter\r\nBrief for Petitioner 6 (agreeing that \u201cif a preemption cause\r\nof action may be stated here against the State, [CMS]\r\napproval may affect its merits but not its existence\u201d). It\r\nseems odd, then, to claim that the parties have not had the\r\nopportunity to fully address the impact of the agency\r\naction on the question that we granted certiorari to re-\r\nview: whether the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized a\r\nprivate cause of action under the Supremacy Clause to\r\nenforce \u00a730(A).\r\n   So what is the Court of Appeals to do on remand? It\r\ncould change its view and decide that there is no cause of\r\naction directly under the Supremacy Clause to enforce\r\n\u00a730(A). The majority itself provides a compelling list of\r\nreasons for such a result: \u201cThe Medicaid Act commits to\r\nthe federal agency the power to administer a federal pro-\r\ngram\u201d; \u201cthe agency is comparatively expert in the statute\u2019s\r\nsubject matter\u201d; \u201cthe language of the particular provision\r\n8      DOUGLAS v. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF\r\n                  SOUTHERN CAL., INC.                      \r\n\r\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\r\n\r\n\r\nat issue here is broad and general, suggesting that the\r\nagency\u2019s expertise is relevant\u201d; and APA review would\r\nprovide \u201can authoritative judicial determination.\u201d Ante, at\r\n6\u20137. Allowing for both Supremacy Clause actions and\r\nagency enforcement \u201cthreatens potential inconsistency or\r\nconfusion,\u201d and imperils \u201cthe uniformity that Congress\r\nintended by centralizing administration of the federal\r\nprogram in the agency.\u201d Ante, at 7\u20138; see Gonzaga, 536\r\nU. S., at 291\u2013293 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment)\r\n(explaining that Congress often means to preclude a pri-\r\nvate right of action in statutes where it employs an ad-\r\nministrative enforcement scheme that achieves \u201cexpertise,\r\nuniformity, widespread consultation, and resulting admin-\r\nistrative guidance,\u201d while \u201cavoid[ing] the comparative risk\r\nof inconsistent interpretations and misincentives that can\r\narise out of an occasional inappropriate application of the\r\nstatute in a private action for damages\u201d).\r\n   The majority acknowledges, in light of all this, that the\r\nSupremacy Clause challenge appears \u201cat best redundant,\u201d\r\nand that \u201ccontinuation of the action in that form would\r\nseem to be inefficient.\u201d Ante, at 8. Still, according to the\r\nmajority, the Court of Appeals on remand could determine\r\nthat the Supremacy Clause action may be brought but\r\nthen must abate \u201cnow that the agency has acted,\u201d ibid.\u2014\r\nas everyone knew the agency would. A Court concerned\r\nwith \u201cinefficien[cy]\u201d should not find that result very pal-\r\natable, and the majority cites no precedent for a cause of\r\naction that fades away once a federal agency has acted.\r\nSuch a scenario would also create a bizarre rush to the\r\ncourthouse, as litigants seek to file and have their Su-\r\npremacy Clause causes of action decided before the agency\r\nhas time to arrive at final agency action reviewable in\r\ncourt.\r\n   Or perhaps the suits should continue in a different\r\n\u201cform,\u201d by which I understand the Court to suggest that\r\nthey should morph into APA actions.

J., dissenting\r\n\r\nreview provisions, however, seem to stand in the way of\r\nsuch a transformation. To convert the litigation into an\r\nAPA suit, the current defendant (the State) would need to\r\nbe dismissed and the agency (which is not currently a\r\nparty at all) would have to be sued in its stead. 5 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7701\u2013706. Given that APA actions also feature\u2014among\r\nother things\u2014different standards of review, different\r\nrecords, and different potential remedies, it is difficult to\r\nsee what would be left of the original Supremacy Clause\r\nsuit. Or, again, why one should have been permitted in\r\nthe first place, when agency review was provided by stat-\r\nute, and the parties were able to and did participate fully\r\nin that process.\r\n  I would dispel all these difficulties by simply holding\r\nwhat the logic of the majority\u2019s own opinion suggests:\r\nWhen Congress did not intend to provide a private right of\r\naction to enforce a statute enacted under the Spending\r\nClause, the Supremacy Clause does not supply one of its\r\nown force. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions to the contrary\r\nshould be reversed.\r\n</pre>",
