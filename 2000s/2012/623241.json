MONTANA\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA\r\n\r\n  No. 10\u2013218.     Argued December 7, 2011\u2014Decided February 22, 2012\r\nPetitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric\r\n  facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds\r\n  underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Riv-\r\n  ers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along\r\n  the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and\r\n  PPL\u2019s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Fer-\r\n  ry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons\r\n  on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The\r\n  Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both\r\n  projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\r\n  PPL\u2019s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a centu-\r\n  ry. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects\u2019 existence,\r\n  sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of\r\n  PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United\r\n  States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal\r\n  suit, claiming that PPL\u2019s facilities were on riverbeds that were state\r\n  owned and part of Montana\u2019s school trust lands. The State joined the\r\n  suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the\r\n  riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power com-\r\n  panies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred\r\n  from seeking compensation for PPL\u2019s riverbed use. Montana coun-\r\n  terclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\n  the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court\r\n  granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes\r\n  of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41\r\n  million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Mon-\r\n  tana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the\r\n  navigability test, it discounted this Court\u2019s approach of considering\r\n  the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-\r\n2                  PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying\r\n    those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court\r\n    declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of\r\n    navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavi-\r\n    gability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.\r\n    Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison\r\n    River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the\r\n    time of statehood.\r\nHeld: The Montana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Montana owns and\r\n may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm\r\n legal understanding of this Court\u2019s rules of navigability for title un-\r\n der the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10\u201326.\r\n    (a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold\r\n \u201ctitle in the soil of rivers really navigable,\u201d Shively v. Bowlby, 152\r\n U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-\r\n footing doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of state-\r\n hood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\n navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state\r\n law subject only to the United States\u2019 power \u201cto control such waters\r\n for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.\u201d Unit-\r\n ed States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title\r\n vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then naviga-\r\n ble. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doc-\r\n trine, rivers must be \u201cnavigable in fact,\u201d meaning \u201cthey are used, or\r\n are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over\r\n which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary\r\n modes of trade and travel on water.\u201d The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557,\r\n 563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of wa-\r\n terbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.\r\n Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10\u201314.\r\n    (b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the ques-\r\n tion of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under\r\n the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a seg-\r\n ment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,\r\n under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,\r\n e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discount-\r\n ing this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign own-\r\n ership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow pri-\r\n vate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that\r\n could interfere with the public\u2019s right to use the waters as a highway\r\n for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on seg-\r\n ments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to\r\n deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing\r\n doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ncal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river\r\nand provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end\r\npoints for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent\r\nwith the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed\r\ntitle. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable\r\nwhen the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds\r\nfor purposes of determining their value and PPL\u2019s corresponding\r\nrents. The State Supreme Court\u2019s view that the segment-by-segment\r\napproach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not\r\nsupported by this Court\u2019s Utah decision. Even if the law might find\r\nsome nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment\r\nas part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments\r\nin this case would meet that standard. Applying its \u201cshort interrup-\r\ntions\u201d approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls\r\nreach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route\r\nportage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day\r\nwould demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.\r\nThus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect\r\nto the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages\r\nwere insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they\r\nare, because they require transportation over land rather than over\r\nthe water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In\r\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied\r\nThe Montello, 20 Wall. 430. There, portage was considered in deter-\r\nmining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce\r\nfor federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the\r\noutcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title con-\r\ntext apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and\r\ndo so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dis-\r\npute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and\r\nthe trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The\r\nGreat Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the\r\nfoot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that\r\nsome of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigabil-\r\nity test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana\r\ncourts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light\r\nof the principles discussed here. Pp. 14\u201321.\r\n   (c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in\r\nrelying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the\r\nMadison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns a river\u2019s usefulness for \u201c \u2018trade and trav-\r\nel.\u2019 \u201d Utah, 283 U. S., at 75\u201376. River segments are navigable if they\r\n4                   PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

Id., at 76. Evidence\r\n    of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on suscepti-\r\n    bility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82\u201383.\r\n    In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at\r\n    statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in\r\n    customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and\r\n    (2) the river\u2019s poststatehood condition may not be materially different\r\n    from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court\r\n    offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21\u2013\r\n    24.\r\n        (d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the\r\n    Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred\r\n    as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. P. 24.\r\n        (e) Montana\u2019s suggestion that denying the State title to the disput-\r\n    ed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine\u2014which con-\r\n    cerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,\r\n    fishing, and other recreational uses\u2014underscores its misapprehen-\r\n    sion of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Unlike the equal-\r\n    footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navi-\r\n    gability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters\r\n    within the State\u2019s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal\r\n    regulatory power. Pp. 24\u201325.\r\n        (f) This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of\r\n    Montana\u2019s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar\r\n    the State\u2019s claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in ti-\r\n    tle on the State\u2019s long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some\r\n    evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over\r\n    those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doc-\r\n    trine.

MONTANA\r\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\r\n\r\n                      MONTANA\r\n\r\n                              [February 22, 2012]\r\n\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   This case concerns three rivers which flow through\r\nMontana and then beyond its borders. The question is\r\nwhether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in\r\nMontana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that\r\nconcept for purposes of determining whether the State\r\nacquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,\r\nwhen the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana\r\ncontends that the rivers must be found navigable at the\r\ndisputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts\r\nthat in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under\r\nthe constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its\r\ntitle claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL\r\nMontana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv\u00ad\r\nerbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts\r\ngranted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding\r\nit $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from\r\n2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.\r\n                             I\r\n  The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the\r\nMadison River, and the Clark Fork River. The Missouri\r\nand the Madison are on the eastern side of the Continen\u00ad\r\n2             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which\r\nthen continues at length to its junction with the Missis\u00ad\r\nsippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side\r\nof the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia\r\nRiver system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river\r\nshall be described in somewhat more detail.\r\n                             A\r\n   The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses\r\nseven States before a point just north of St. Louis where\r\nit joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270\r\n(int\u2019l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path\r\nformed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv\u00ad\r\ner\u2019s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the\r\nlongest river in the United States.

The river flows northward for about 40 miles;\r\nturns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north\u00ad\r\neast for a short stint, by which time it has descended\r\nnearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north\u00ad\r\nwestward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in\r\nnorthern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co\u00ad\r\nlumbia River of the Pacific Northwest. Ibid.; 1 Columbia\r\nGazetteer 816.

This was\r\ncorrect, for shortly before the Clark Fork exits to Idaho\r\nfrom the northwest corner of Montana, \u201cthe waters of the\r\nriver dash madly along their rocky bed,\u201d dropping over 30\r\nfeet in a half-mile as they rush over falls and rapids in\u00ad\r\ncluding a \u201cfoaming waterfall\u201d now known as Thompson\r\nFalls.

Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds\r\nunderlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and\r\nClark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is\r\ndisputed.\r\n   On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec\u00ad\r\ntric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,\r\nincluding on the three tallest falls; and the other two are\r\nin canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.\r\nRobison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar\u00ad\r\nstad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145\u2013146. On the Madison\r\nRiver, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can\u00ad\r\nyons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is\r\nconstructed on the Thompson Falls.\r\n   The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are\r\ncalled the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls\r\nfacility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects\r\nare licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis\u00ad\r\nsion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the\r\nMontana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405\u2013406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 426.\r\n   PPL\u2019s power facilities have existed at their locations for\r\nmany decades, some for over a century. See Robison,\r\nsupra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).\r\nUntil recently, these facilities were operated without title\u00ad\r\nbased objection by the State of Montana. The State was\r\nwell aware of the facilities\u2019 existence on the riverbeds\u2014\r\nindeed, various Montana state agencies had participated\r\nin federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric\r\nprojects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P. C. 751, 752\r\n(1949) (Thompson Falls project); Montana Power Co., 27\r\nFERC \u00b662,097, pp. 63,188\u201363,189 (1984) (Ryan Dam of\r\n8              PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

Instead, the understanding of PPL and the\r\nUnited States is that PPL has been paying rents to the\r\nUnited States for use of those riverbeds, as well as for use\r\nof river uplands flooded by PPL\u2019s projects.

Prompted\r\nby the litigation, the State joined the lawsuit, for the first\r\ntime seeking rents for PPL\u2019s riverbed use.

Brief for Petitioner 26. The\r\nUnited States as amicus is in substantial agreement with\r\nPPL\u2019s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis\u00ad\r\ncussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea\u00ad\r\ntional use. Brief for United States 27\u201333.\r\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the\r\nlegal principles that control the case.\r\n                             B\r\n  The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,\r\nhold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins\r\nin English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.\r\n1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between\r\nwaters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)\r\nand nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to\r\nroyal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the\r\nriverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of\r\npassage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect\r\nto public highways, as the name suggests, the public also\r\nretained the right of water passage; but title to the riv\u00ad\r\nerbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private\r\nownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each\r\nowning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as\r\nwell as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.\r\nCoeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n(summarizing J. Angell, A Treatise on the Common Law\r\nin Relation to Water-Courses 14\u201318 (1824)); 3 J. Kent,\r\nCommentaries on American Law 528\u2013529 (9th ed. 1858).\r\n   While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the\r\ninitial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri\u00ad\r\ncan law moved to a different standard. Some state courts\r\ncame early to the conclusion that a State holds presump\u00ad\r\ntive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters\r\nare subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. See, e.g., Car-\r\nson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v.\r\nWadlington, 12 S. C. L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13\r\nN. C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835);\r\nElder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845). The tidal rule of\r\n\u201cnavigability\u201d for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while\r\nperhaps appropriate for England\u2019s dominant coastal geog\u00ad\r\nraphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast\r\nnumber of major inland rivers upon which navigation\r\ncould be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv\u00ad\r\ners 26\u201327, 31\u201335 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,\r\n667\u2013669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had\r\nrecognized \u201cthe now prevailing doctrine\u201d of state sovereign\r\n\u201ctitle in the soil of rivers really navigable.\u201d Shively, supra,\r\nat 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (\u201cIn\r\nthis country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed\r\nnavigable which are really so\u201d). This title rule became\r\nknown as \u201cnavigability in fact.\u201d\r\n   The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti\u00ad\r\ntutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In\r\n1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,\r\nthe people of each State, based on principles of sovereign\u00ad\r\nty, \u201chold the absolute right to all their navigable waters\r\nand the soils under them,\u201d subject only to rights surren\u00ad\r\ndered and powers granted by the Constitution to the\r\nFederal Government. Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet.\r\n367, 410 (1842). In a series of 19th-century cases, the\r\nCourt determined that the same principle applied to\r\n12            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nStates later admitted to the Union, because the States in\r\nthe Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.\r\nSee, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228\u2013229\r\n(1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161,\r\n183 (1891); Shively, supra, at 26\u201331; see United States v.\r\nTexas, 339 U. S. 707, 716 (1950). These precedents are the\r\nbasis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State\u2019s\r\ntitle to these lands was \u201cconferred not by Congress but by\r\nthe Constitution itself.\u201d Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.\r\nCorvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It\r\nfollows that any ensuing questions of navigability for de-\r\ntermining state riverbed title are governed by federal\r\nlaw. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75\r\n(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).\r\n   The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can\r\nbe stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State\r\ngains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\nnavigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.\r\nv. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not\r\nrelevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those\r\nlands according to state law subject only to \u201cthe para\u00ad\r\nmount power of the United States to control such waters\r\nfor purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com\u00ad\r\nmerce.\u201d Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United\r\nStates, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt\r\nState Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States\r\nretains any title vested in it before statehood to any land\r\nbeneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ\u00ad\r\nenced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.\r\nSee Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.\r\n   Returning to the \u201cnavigability in fact\u201d rule, the Court\r\nhas explained the elements of this test. A basic formula\u00ad\r\ntion of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.\r\n557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate\r\nnavigation:\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    \u201cThose rivers must be regarded as public navigable\r\n    rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they\r\n    are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus\u00ad\r\n    ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as\r\n    highways for commerce, over which trade and travel\r\n    are or may be conducted in the customary modes of\r\n    trade and travel on water.\u201d Id., at 563.\r\n   The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con\u00ad\r\nsidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as\u00ad\r\nsessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu\u00ad\r\ntion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to\r\nthe waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,\r\n20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian\r\nElec. Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 406, and n. 21 (1940) (Fed\u00ad\r\neral Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,\r\n730\u2013731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,\r\nat 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It\r\nhas been used as well to determine questions of title to\r\nwater beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,\r\nsupra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586\r\n(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,\r\nhowever, that the test for navigability is not applied in the\r\nsame way in these distinct types of cases.\r\n   Among the differences in application are the following.\r\nFor state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga\u00ad\r\nbility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,\r\nsupra, at 75, and based on the \u201cnatural and ordinary con-\r\ndition\u201d of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In\r\ncontrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes\r\nmade navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte\r\nBoyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631\u2013632 (1884) (artificial canal); and\r\nfederal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only\r\nrecently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.\r\nv. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634\u2013635 (1912), were once\r\nnavigable but are no longer, see Economy Light & Power\r\n14             PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

With respect to the federal com\u00ad\r\nmerce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically\r\nfocused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,\r\nsupra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex\u00ad\r\ntends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United\r\nStates, 444 U. S. 164, 173\u2013174 (1979). In contrast, for title\r\npurposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not\r\non interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of\r\ndifferences is not exhaustive. Indeed, \u201c[e]ach application\r\nof [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations\r\nand refinements which require further elaboration.\u201d Ap-\r\npalachian Elec.

In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court\r\nnoted,\r\n     \u201cthe controversy relates only to the sections of the riv\u00ad\r\n     ers which are described in the complaint, and the\r\n     Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to\r\n     navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,\r\n     in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,\r\n     is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,\r\n     speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,\r\n     and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,\r\n     it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi\u00ad\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    dence, how far navigability extends.\u201d 283 U. S., at 77.\r\nThe Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as\u00ad\r\nsessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga\u00ad\r\nble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the\r\nnext roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain\u00ad\r\ning 149 miles. Id., at 73\u201374, 79\u201381, 89. The Court noted\r\nthe importance of determining \u201cthe exact point at which\r\nnavigability may be deemed to end.\u201d Id., at 90.\r\n  Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United\r\nStates, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the\r\nsegment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage\r\nIndian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River\r\nwas \u201cnavigable in fact at the locus in quo.\u201d The Court\r\nconcluded that the United States originally, and the Osag\u00ad\r\nes as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds\r\nbecause the Arkansas River \u201cis and was not navigable at\r\nthe place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,\r\nare.\u201d Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river\r\nalong the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a\r\nsegment of the river that began further downstream was\r\nnavigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,\r\n587\u2013588, 589\u2013591 (noting that \u201chow far up the streams\r\nnavigability extended was not known\u201d; assessing separate\u00ad\r\nly the segments of the Red River above and below its\r\nconfluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma\u2019s\r\nborders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence\r\n\u201cno part of the river within Oklahoma,\u201d was navigable).\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment\u00ad\r\nby-segment approach of this Court\u2019s cases, calling it\r\n\u201ca piecemeal classification of navigability\u2014with some\r\nstretches declared navigable, and others declared non\u00ad\r\nnavigable.\u201d 355 Mont., at 440\u2013442, 229 P. 3d, at 448\u2013449.\r\nThis was error. The segment-by-segment approach to\r\nnavigability for title is well settled, and it should not be\r\ndisregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of\r\n16            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nnavigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow\r\nprivate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the\r\nriverbeds that could interfere with the public\u2019s right to use\r\nthe waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal\r\nGovernment and States retain regulatory power to protect\r\npublic navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un\u00ad\r\nderlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict\r\nbetween private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at\r\n82\u201383; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments\r\nthat are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those\r\nover which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is\r\nno reason that these segments also should be deemed\r\nowned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n   Practical considerations also support segmentation.\r\nPhysical conditions that affect navigability often vary\r\nsignificantly over the length of a river. This is particularly\r\ntrue with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different\r\nterrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying\r\nlocal climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent\r\nexample: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for\r\nover 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons\r\nand upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and\r\nacross sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and\r\nfarmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions\r\nprovide a means to determine appropriate start points and\r\nend points for the segment in question. Topographical and\r\ngeographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,\r\nat 77\u201380 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589\r\n(location of tributary providing additional flow).\r\n   A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in\r\nwhich private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For\r\ncenturies, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover\u00ad\r\neign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title\r\namong riparian landowners involved apportionment de\u00ad\r\nfined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalong the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each\r\nlandowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).\r\nSee J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses\r\n18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474\r\n(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,\r\ncannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when\r\nthe state courts managed to divide up and apportion the\r\nunderlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their\r\nvalue and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de-\r\ncided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable\r\nhere because it \u201cdoes not apply to \u2018short interruption[s] of\r\nnavigability in a stream otherwise navigable.\u2019 \u201d 355 Mont.,\r\nat 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).\r\nThis was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass\u00ad\r\ning that the facts of the case concerned \u201clong reaches\r\nwith particular characteristics of navigability or non\u00ad\r\nnavigability\u201d rather than \u201cshort interruption[s].\u201d Id., at\r\n77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a\r\ndifferent outcome if a \u201cshort interruption\u201d were concerned.\r\nIbid.\r\n  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments\r\nso minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,\r\nnavigable reach for purposes of title under the equal\u00ad\r\nfooting doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in\r\nthis case would meet that standard, and one\u2014the Great\r\nFalls reach\u2014certainly would not. As an initial matter, the\r\nkinds of considerations that would define a de minimis\r\nexception to the segment-by-segment approach would be\r\nthose related to principles of ownership and title, such as\r\ninadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,\r\nor worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See\r\nHeller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.\r\nRev. 621, 682\u2013684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop-\r\nerty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail-\r\ning legal mechanisms, \u201cparalyze the alienability of scarce\r\n18            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nresources . . . or diminish their value too drastically\u201d). An\r\nanalysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied. A\r\ncomparison of the nonnavigable segment\u2019s length to the\r\noverall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply\r\nirrelevant to the issue at hand.\r\n   A number of the segments at issue here are both dis\u00ad\r\ncrete, as defined by physical features characteristic of\r\nnavigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a\r\nmatter of administrability for title purposes. This is best\r\nillustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long\r\nand has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con\u00ad\r\ntinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to\r\ndoubt that reach\u2019s navigability based on the presence of\r\nthe series of falls. There is also reason to think that title\r\nto that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin\u00ad\r\nistrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent\r\nin the amount of $41 million for PPL\u2019s various hydroelec\u00ad\r\ntric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are\r\nalong the Great Falls reach.\r\n   Applying its \u201cshort interruptions\u201d approach, the Mon\u00ad\r\ntana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach\r\nwas navigable because it could be managed by way of land\r\nroute portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,\r\n449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis\r\nand Clark\u2019s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re\u00ad\r\nveals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s\r\nanalysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and\r\nClark transported their supplies and some small canoes\r\nabout 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and\r\nprobably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126\u2013152;\r\n9 Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 173; Dear\r\nBrother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only\r\none day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the\r\nneed to bypass the river segment, all because that part of\r\nthe river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nreach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that\r\nportages \u201care not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigabil\u00ad\r\nity.\u201d 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. In most cases,\r\nthey are, because they require transportation over land\r\nrather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as\r\nto the Great Falls reach.\r\n   In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage\r\ndoes not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt misapplied this Court\u2019s decision in The Montello, 20\r\nWall. 430. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The\r\nconsideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ\u00ad\r\nent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether\r\nthe river in question was navigable for title purposes but\r\ninstead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter\u00ad\r\nmining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the\r\nFederal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary\r\nfocus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact\r\nbut upon whether the river was a \u201cnavigable water of the\r\nUnited States.\u201d Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is\r\ndoctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river\r\n\u201cforms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a\r\ncontinued highway over which commerce is, or may be,\r\ncarried with other States or foreign countries in the cus\u00ad\r\ntomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by\r\nwater.\u201d Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557).\r\nIt is language similar to \u201ccontinued highway\u201d that Mon\u00ad\r\ntana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu\r\nof the Court\u2019s established segmentation approach. Brief\r\nfor Respondent 42\u201343, n. 16.\r\n   The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages\r\nrequired in that case did not prevent the river from being\r\npart of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con\u00ad\r\ntinued that channel because goods could be successfully\r\ntransported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques\u00ad\r\ntion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats\r\nat places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate\r\n20             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nportions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,\r\nthe question regards ownership of the bed under river\r\nsegments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling\r\nthem \u201cinterruptions in the navigation,\u201d 355 Mont., at 442,\r\n229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The\r\nreasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control\r\nthe outcome where the quite different concerns of the\r\nriverbed title context apply.\r\n   Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability\r\nfor title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls\r\nreach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could\r\ndemonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.\r\nMontana does not dispute that overland portage was\r\nnecessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits\r\n\u201cthe falls themselves were not passable by boat at state\u00ad\r\nhood.\u201d Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted\r\nthe falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con\u00ad\r\ncludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\r\nthat the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head\r\nof the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable\r\nfor purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing\r\ndoctrine.\r\n   This Court also determines, based on evidence in the\r\nrecord, that there is a significant likelihood that some of\r\nthe other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal\r\ntest of navigability for the purpose of determining title.\r\nFor example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork\r\nRiver, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the\r\nsole evidence for nonnavigability \u201cconsists of conclusory\r\nstatements . . . without any specific factual support.\u201d 355\r\nMont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. In fact, PPL introduced a\r\nreport of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891,\r\ntwo years after Montana\u2019s date of statehood, documenting\r\nthat the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula\r\nand Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379\u2013380\r\n(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on\r\nvarious failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the\r\nThompson Falls \u201ca complete obstruction to navigation\u201d\r\nand the river around that area \u201cexceedingly rapid, rough,\r\nand full of rocks.\u201d 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This\r\nwas consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.\r\nThe decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private\r\nparties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls\r\nand declared the river at that place \u201cwas and is a non\u00ad\r\nnavigable stream incapable of carrying the products of\r\nthe country in the usual manner of water transportation.\u201d\r\nSteele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,\r\n1910), p. 1; see App. 380\u2013381 (Docket No. 169). While the\r\nultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the\r\nMontana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence\r\nshould be assessed in light of the principles discussed in\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter\r\nof law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,\r\nprimarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is\r\nnot inherent in a court\u2019s consideration of such evidence,\r\nbut the evidence must be confined to that which shows the\r\nriver could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a\r\nrealistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state\u00ad\r\nhood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns the river\u2019s usefulness for \u201c \u2018trade\r\nand travel,\u2019 \u201d rather than for other purposes.

If modern watercraft permit navigabil\u00ad\r\nity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the\r\nriver has changed in ways that substantially improve its\r\nnavigability, then the evidence of present-day use has\r\nlittle or no bearing on navigability at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica\u00ad\r\ntion that it made these necessary findings.

It provided meaning\u00ad\r\nful evidence that the river\u2019s conditions had changed since\r\nstatehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the\r\nriver easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.\r\nWhile the Montana court was correct that a river need not\r\nbe susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,\r\nneither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a\r\ncommercial reality. Against this background, the present\u00ad\r\nday recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil\u00ad\r\nity for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\nThe Montana Supreme Court\u2019s reliance upon the State\u2019s\r\nevidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without\r\nfurther inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.\r\n                           C\r\n  The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the\r\nCourt declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt further erred as to the burden of proof regarding\r\nnavigability.\r\n                            D\r\n  As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests\r\nthat denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis\u00ad\r\npute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con\u00ad\r\ncerns public access to the waters above those beds for\r\npurposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational\r\nuses.

Its roots\r\ntrace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in\r\nthe English common law on public navigation and fishing\r\nrights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun\u00ad\r\ntry. See Coeur d\u2019Alene, 521 U. S., at 284\u2013286; Illinois\r\nCentral R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);\r\nD. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3\u20138,\r\n15\u201324 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior\r\nCourt of Alpine Cty., 33 Cal. 3d 419, 433\u2013441, 658 P. 2d\r\n709, 718\u2013724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9\u201310\r\n(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which\r\nis the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of\r\nriverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter\r\nof state law, see Coeur d\u2019Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois\r\nCentral, a Supreme Court public trust case, was \u201c \u2018neces\u00ad\r\nsarily a statement of Illinois law\u2019 \u201d); Appleby v. City of New\r\nYork, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to\r\nthe federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under\r\nthe Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal\u00ad\r\nfooting cases have noted that the State takes title to the\r\nnavigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see\r\nShively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15\u201317, 24, 46, the contours of\r\nthat public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.\r\nUnder accepted principles of federalism, the States retain\r\nresidual power to determine the scope of the public trust\r\nover waters within their borders, while federal law deter\u00ad\r\nmines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n                             V\r\n   As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana\r\nfiled its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the\r\nfirst of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana\r\nhad not sought compensation before then, despite its full\r\nawareness of PPL\u2019s hydroelectric projects and despite the\r\nState\u2019s own participation in the projects\u2019 federal licensing\r\n26            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess. While this Court does not reach the question, it\r\nmay be that by virtue of the State\u2019s sovereignty, neither\r\nlaches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the\r\nState\u2019s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and\r\nits predecessors in title upon the State\u2019s long failure to\r\nassert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that\r\nthe river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the\r\nequal-footing doctrine.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Montana\r\nowns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the\r\nState was based upon an infirm legal understanding of\r\nthis Court\u2019s rules of navigability for title under the equal\u00ad\r\nfooting doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, \u201cIt is\r\nnot for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the\r\ngeneral subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive\r\nrule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge\r\nwhat actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad\u00ad\r\nmission, under the constitutional rule of equality here\r\ninvoked.\u201d 260 U. S., at 88.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  The judgment of the Montana Supreme Court is re\u00ad\r\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\r\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n                                          It is so ordered.\r\n",

MONTANA\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA\r\n\r\n  No. 10\u2013218.     Argued December 7, 2011\u2014Decided February 22, 2012\r\nPetitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric\r\n  facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds\r\n  underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Riv-\r\n  ers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along\r\n  the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and\r\n  PPL\u2019s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Fer-\r\n  ry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons\r\n  on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The\r\n  Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both\r\n  projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\r\n  PPL\u2019s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a centu-\r\n  ry. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects\u2019 existence,\r\n  sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of\r\n  PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United\r\n  States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal\r\n  suit, claiming that PPL\u2019s facilities were on riverbeds that were state\r\n  owned and part of Montana\u2019s school trust lands. The State joined the\r\n  suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the\r\n  riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power com-\r\n  panies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred\r\n  from seeking compensation for PPL\u2019s riverbed use. Montana coun-\r\n  terclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\n  the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court\r\n  granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes\r\n  of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41\r\n  million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Mon-\r\n  tana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the\r\n  navigability test, it discounted this Court\u2019s approach of considering\r\n  the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-\r\n2                  PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying\r\n    those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court\r\n    declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of\r\n    navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavi-\r\n    gability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.\r\n    Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison\r\n    River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the\r\n    time of statehood.\r\nHeld: The Montana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Montana owns and\r\n may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm\r\n legal understanding of this Court\u2019s rules of navigability for title un-\r\n der the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10\u201326.\r\n    (a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold\r\n \u201ctitle in the soil of rivers really navigable,\u201d Shively v. Bowlby, 152\r\n U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-\r\n footing doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of state-\r\n hood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\n navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state\r\n law subject only to the United States\u2019 power \u201cto control such waters\r\n for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.\u201d Unit-\r\n ed States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title\r\n vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then naviga-\r\n ble. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doc-\r\n trine, rivers must be \u201cnavigable in fact,\u201d meaning \u201cthey are used, or\r\n are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over\r\n which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary\r\n modes of trade and travel on water.\u201d The Daniel Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n 563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of wa-\r\n terbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.\r\n Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10\u201314.\r\n    (b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the ques-\r\n tion of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under\r\n the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a seg-\r\n ment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,\r\n under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,\r\n e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discount-\r\n ing this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign own-\r\n ership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow pri-\r\n vate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that\r\n could interfere with the public\u2019s right to use the waters as a highway\r\n for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on seg-\r\n ments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to\r\n deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing\r\n doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ncal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river\r\nand provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end\r\npoints for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent\r\nwith the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed\r\ntitle. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable\r\nwhen the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds\r\nfor purposes of determining their value and PPL\u2019s corresponding\r\nrents. The State Supreme Court\u2019s view that the segment-by-segment\r\napproach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not\r\nsupported by this Court\u2019s Utah decision. Even if the law might find\r\nsome nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment\r\nas part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments\r\nin this case would meet that standard. Applying its \u201cshort interrup-\r\ntions\u201d approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls\r\nreach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route\r\nportage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day\r\nwould demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.\r\nThus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect\r\nto the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages\r\nwere insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they\r\nare, because they require transportation over land rather than over\r\nthe water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In\r\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied\r\nThe Montello, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, portage was considered in deter-\r\nmining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce\r\nfor federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the\r\noutcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title con-\r\ntext apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and\r\ndo so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dis-\r\npute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and\r\nthe trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The\r\nGreat Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the\r\nfoot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that\r\nsome of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigabil-\r\nity test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana\r\ncourts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light\r\nof the principles discussed here. Pp. 14\u201321.\r\n   (c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in\r\nrelying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the\r\nMadison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns a river\u2019s usefulness for \u201c \u2018trade and trav-\r\nel.\u2019 \u201d Utah, 283 U. S., at 75\u201376.

Id., at 76. Evidence\r\n    of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on suscepti-\r\n    bility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82\u201383.\r\n    In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at\r\n    statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in\r\n    customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and\r\n    (2) the river\u2019s poststatehood condition may not be materially different\r\n    from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court\r\n    offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21\u2013\r\n    24.\r\n        (d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the\r\n    Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred\r\n    as to the burden of proof regarding navigability.

The question is\r\nwhether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in\r\nMontana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that\r\nconcept for purposes of determining whether the State\r\nacquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,\r\nwhen the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana\r\ncontends that the rivers must be found navigable at the\r\ndisputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts\r\nthat in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under\r\nthe constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its\r\ntitle claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL\r\nMontana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv\u00ad\r\nerbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts\r\ngranted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding\r\nit $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from\r\n2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.\r\n                             I\r\n  The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the\r\nMadison River, and the Clark Fork River. The Missouri\r\nand the Madison are on the eastern side of the Continen\u00ad\r\n2             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which\r\nthen continues at length to its junction with the Missis\u00ad\r\nsippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side\r\nof the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia\r\nRiver system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river\r\nshall be described in somewhat more detail.\r\n                             A\r\n   The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses\r\nseven States before a point just north of St. Louis where\r\nit joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270\r\n(int\u2019l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path\r\nformed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv\u00ad\r\ner\u2019s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the\r\nlongest river in the United States.

They consist of five cascade-like\r\nwaterfalls located over a stretch of the Upper Missouri\r\nleading downstream from the city of Great Falls in mid\u00ad\r\nwestern Montana. The waterfall farthest downstream,\r\nand the one first encountered by Meriwether Lewis and\r\nWilliam Clark when they led their remarkable expedition\r\nthrough the American West in 1805, is the eponymous\r\n\u201cGreat Falls,\u201d the tallest of the five falls at 87 feet.

Despite the falls\u2019 beauty, Lewis could see that\r\ntheir steep cliffs and swift waters would impede progress\r\non the river, which had been the expedition\u2019s upstream\r\ncourse for so many months.

The river flows northward for about 40 miles;\r\nturns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north\u00ad\r\neast for a short stint, by which time it has descended\r\nnearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north\u00ad\r\nwestward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in\r\nnorthern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co\u00ad\r\nlumbia River of the Pacific Northwest.

Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds\r\nunderlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and\r\nClark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is\r\ndisputed.\r\n   On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec\u00ad\r\ntric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,\r\nincluding on the three tallest falls; and the other two are\r\nin canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.\r\nRobison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar\u00ad\r\nstad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145\u2013146. On the Madison\r\nRiver, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can\u00ad\r\nyons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is\r\nconstructed on the Thompson Falls.\r\n   The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are\r\ncalled the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls\r\nfacility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects\r\nare licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis\u00ad\r\nsion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the\r\nMontana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405\u2013406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 426.\r\n   PPL\u2019s power facilities have existed at their locations for\r\nmany decades, some for over a century. See Robison,\r\nsupra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).\r\nUntil recently, these facilities were operated without title\u00ad\r\nbased objection by the State of Montana. The State was\r\nwell aware of the facilities\u2019 existence on the riverbeds\u2014\r\nindeed, various Montana state agencies had participated\r\nin federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric\r\nprojects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P.

The\r\nUnited States as amicus is in substantial agreement with\r\nPPL\u2019s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis\u00ad\r\ncussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea\u00ad\r\ntional use.

See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.\r\n1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between\r\nwaters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)\r\nand nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to\r\nroyal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the\r\nriverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of\r\npassage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect\r\nto public highways, as the name suggests, the public also\r\nretained the right of water passage; but title to the riv\u00ad\r\nerbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private\r\nownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each\r\nowning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as\r\nwell as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.\r\nCoeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Some state courts\r\ncame early to the conclusion that a State holds presump\u00ad\r\ntive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters\r\nare subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.

The tidal rule of\r\n\u201cnavigability\u201d for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while\r\nperhaps appropriate for England\u2019s dominant coastal geog\u00ad\r\nraphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast\r\nnumber of major inland rivers upon which navigation\r\ncould be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv\u00ad\r\ners 26\u201327, 31\u201335 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,\r\n667\u2013669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had\r\nrecognized \u201cthe now prevailing doctrine\u201d of state sovereign\r\n\u201ctitle in the soil of rivers really navigable.\u201d Shively, supra,\r\nat 31; see Barney v.

Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not\r\nrelevant in this case).

It should be noted,\r\nhowever, that the test for navigability is not applied in the\r\nsame way in these distinct types of cases.\r\n   Among the differences in application are the following.\r\nFor state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga\u00ad\r\nbility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,\r\nsupra, at 75, and based on the \u201cnatural and ordinary con-\r\ndition\u201d of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In\r\ncontrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes\r\nmade navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte\r\nBoyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631\u2013632 (1884) (artificial canal); and\r\nfederal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only\r\nrecently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.\r\nv. Stimson, 223 U.

With respect to the federal com\u00ad\r\nmerce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically\r\nfocused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,\r\nsupra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex\u00ad\r\ntends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United\r\nStates, 444 U. S. 164, 173\u2013174 (1979). In contrast, for title\r\npurposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not\r\non interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of\r\ndifferences is not exhaustive. Indeed, \u201c[e]ach application\r\nof [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations\r\nand refinements which require further elaboration.\u201d Ap-\r\npalachian Elec.

In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court\r\nnoted,\r\n     \u201cthe controversy relates only to the sections of the riv\u00ad\r\n     ers which are described in the complaint, and the\r\n     Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to\r\n     navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,\r\n     in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,\r\n     is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,\r\n     speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,\r\n     and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,\r\n     it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi\u00ad\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S., at 77.\r\nThe Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as\u00ad\r\nsessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga\u00ad\r\nble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the\r\nnext roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain\u00ad\r\ning 149 miles. Id., at 73\u201374, 79\u201381, 89. The Court noted\r\nthe importance of determining \u201cthe exact point at which\r\nnavigability may be deemed to end.\u201d Id., at 90.\r\n  Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United\r\nStates, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the\r\nsegment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage\r\nIndian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River\r\nwas \u201cnavigable in fact at the locus in quo.\u201d The Court\r\nconcluded that the United States originally, and the Osag\u00ad\r\nes as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds\r\nbecause the Arkansas River \u201cis and was not navigable at\r\nthe place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,\r\nare.\u201d Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river\r\nalong the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a\r\nsegment of the river that began further downstream was\r\nnavigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,\r\n587\u2013588, 589\u2013591 (noting that \u201chow far up the streams\r\nnavigability extended was not known\u201d; assessing separate\u00ad\r\nly the segments of the Red River above and below its\r\nconfluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma\u2019s\r\nborders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence\r\n\u201cno part of the river within Oklahoma,\u201d was navigable).\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment\u00ad\r\nby-segment approach of this Court\u2019s cases, calling it\r\n\u201ca piecemeal classification of navigability\u2014with some\r\nstretches declared navigable, and others declared non\u00ad\r\nnavigable.\u201d 355 Mont., at 440\u2013442, 229 P. 3d, at 448\u2013449.\r\nThis was error. The segment-by-segment approach to\r\nnavigability for title is well settled, and it should not be\r\ndisregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of\r\n16            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nnavigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow\r\nprivate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the\r\nriverbeds that could interfere with the public\u2019s right to use\r\nthe waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal\r\nGovernment and States retain regulatory power to protect\r\npublic navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un\u00ad\r\nderlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict\r\nbetween private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at\r\n82\u201383; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments\r\nthat are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those\r\nover which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is\r\nno reason that these segments also should be deemed\r\nowned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n   Practical considerations also support segmentation.\r\nPhysical conditions that affect navigability often vary\r\nsignificantly over the length of a river. This is particularly\r\ntrue with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different\r\nterrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying\r\nlocal climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent\r\nexample: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for\r\nover 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons\r\nand upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and\r\nacross sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and\r\nfarmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions\r\nprovide a means to determine appropriate start points and\r\nend points for the segment in question. Topographical and\r\ngeographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,\r\nat 77\u201380 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589\r\n(location of tributary providing additional flow).\r\n   A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in\r\nwhich private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For\r\ncenturies, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover\u00ad\r\neign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title\r\namong riparian landowners involved apportionment de\u00ad\r\nfined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalong the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each\r\nlandowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).\r\nSee J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses\r\n18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Montana, moreover,\r\ncannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when\r\nthe state courts managed to divide up and apportion the\r\nunderlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their\r\nvalue and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de-\r\ncided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable\r\nhere because it \u201cdoes not apply to \u2018short interruption[s] of\r\nnavigability in a stream otherwise navigable.\u2019 \u201d 355 Mont.,\r\nat 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).\r\nThis was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass\u00ad\r\ning that the facts of the case concerned \u201clong reaches\r\nwith particular characteristics of navigability or non\u00ad\r\nnavigability\u201d rather than \u201cshort interruption[s].\u201d Id., at\r\n77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a\r\ndifferent outcome if a \u201cshort interruption\u201d were concerned.\r\nIbid.\r\n  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments\r\nso minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,\r\nnavigable reach for purposes of title under the equal\u00ad\r\nfooting doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in\r\nthis case would meet that standard, and one\u2014the Great\r\nFalls reach\u2014certainly would not. As an initial matter, the\r\nkinds of considerations that would define a de minimis\r\nexception to the segment-by-segment approach would be\r\nthose related to principles of ownership and title, such as\r\ninadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,\r\nor worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See\r\nHeller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.\r\nRev. 621, 682\u2013684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop-\r\nerty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail-\r\ning legal mechanisms, \u201cparalyze the alienability of scarce\r\n18            PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

A\r\ncomparison of the nonnavigable segment\u2019s length to the\r\noverall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply\r\nirrelevant to the issue at hand.\r\n   A number of the segments at issue here are both dis\u00ad\r\ncrete, as defined by physical features characteristic of\r\nnavigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a\r\nmatter of administrability for title purposes. This is best\r\nillustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long\r\nand has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con\u00ad\r\ntinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to\r\ndoubt that reach\u2019s navigability based on the presence of\r\nthe series of falls. There is also reason to think that title\r\nto that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin\u00ad\r\nistrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent\r\nin the amount of $41 million for PPL\u2019s various hydroelec\u00ad\r\ntric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are\r\nalong the Great Falls reach.\r\n   Applying its \u201cshort interruptions\u201d approach, the Mon\u00ad\r\ntana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach\r\nwas navigable because it could be managed by way of land\r\nroute portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,\r\n449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis\r\nand Clark\u2019s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re\u00ad\r\nveals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s\r\nanalysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and\r\nClark transported their supplies and some small canoes\r\nabout 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and\r\nprobably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126\u2013152;\r\n9 Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 173; Dear\r\nBrother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only\r\none day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the\r\nneed to bypass the river segment, all because that part of\r\nthe river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

In most cases,\r\nthey are, because they require transportation over land\r\nrather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as\r\nto the Great Falls reach.\r\n   In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage\r\ndoes not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt misapplied this Court\u2019s decision in The Montello, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The\r\nconsideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ\u00ad\r\nent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether\r\nthe river in question was navigable for title purposes but\r\ninstead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter\u00ad\r\nmining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the\r\nFederal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary\r\nfocus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact\r\nbut upon whether the river was a \u201cnavigable water of the\r\nUnited States.\u201d Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is\r\ndoctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river\r\n\u201cforms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a\r\ncontinued highway over which commerce is, or may be,\r\ncarried with other States or foreign countries in the cus\u00ad\r\ntomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by\r\nwater.\u201d Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\r\nIt is language similar to \u201ccontinued highway\u201d that Mon\u00ad\r\ntana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu\r\nof the Court\u2019s established segmentation approach. Brief\r\nfor Respondent 42\u201343, n. 16.\r\n   The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages\r\nrequired in that case did not prevent the river from being\r\npart of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con\u00ad\r\ntinued that channel because goods could be successfully\r\ntransported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques\u00ad\r\ntion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats\r\nat places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate\r\n20             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nportions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,\r\nthe question regards ownership of the bed under river\r\nsegments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling\r\nthem \u201cinterruptions in the navigation,\u201d 355 Mont., at 442,\r\n229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The\r\nreasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control\r\nthe outcome where the quite different concerns of the\r\nriverbed title context apply.\r\n   Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability\r\nfor title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls\r\nreach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could\r\ndemonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.\r\nMontana does not dispute that overland portage was\r\nnecessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits\r\n\u201cthe falls themselves were not passable by boat at state\u00ad\r\nhood.\u201d Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted\r\nthe falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con\u00ad\r\ncludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\r\nthat the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head\r\nof the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable\r\nfor purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing\r\ndoctrine.\r\n   This Court also determines, based on evidence in the\r\nrecord, that there is a significant likelihood that some of\r\nthe other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal\r\ntest of navigability for the purpose of determining title.\r\nFor example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork\r\nRiver, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the\r\nsole evidence for nonnavigability \u201cconsists of conclusory\r\nstatements . . . without any specific factual support.\u201d 355\r\nMont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448.

It found the\r\nThompson Falls \u201ca complete obstruction to navigation\u201d\r\nand the river around that area \u201cexceedingly rapid, rough,\r\nand full of rocks.\u201d 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This\r\nwas consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.\r\nThe decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private\r\nparties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls\r\nand declared the river at that place \u201cwas and is a non\u00ad\r\nnavigable stream incapable of carrying the products of\r\nthe country in the usual manner of water transportation.\u201d\r\nSteele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,\r\n1910), p. 1; see App. 380\u2013381 (Docket No. 169). While the\r\nultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the\r\nMontana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence\r\nshould be assessed in light of the principles discussed in\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter\r\nof law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,\r\nprimarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is\r\nnot inherent in a court\u2019s consideration of such evidence,\r\nbut the evidence must be confined to that which shows the\r\nriver could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a\r\nrealistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state\u00ad\r\nhood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns the river\u2019s usefulness for \u201c \u2018trade\r\nand travel,\u2019 \u201d rather than for other purposes. See Utah,\r\n283 U. S., at 75\u201376. Mere use by initial explorers or trap\u00ad\r\n22            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npers, who may have dragged their boats in or alongside\r\nthe river despite its nonnavigability in order to avoid\r\ngetting lost, or to provide water for their horses and them\u00ad\r\nselves, is not itself enough. See Oregon, 295 U. S., at\r\n20\u201321 (evidence that \u201ctrappers appear to have waded or\r\nwalked\u201d through the river, dragging their boats rather\r\nthan floating them, had \u201cno bearing on navigability\u201d).\r\n   True, river segments are navigable not only if they\r\n\u201c[were] used,\u201d but also if they \u201c[were] susceptible of being\r\nused,\u201d as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.\r\nUtah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nEvidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may\r\nbear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of\r\nstatehood. See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S., at\r\n416 (\u201c[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the\r\navailability of the stream for the simpler types of commer\u00ad\r\ncial navigation\u201d); Utah, 283 U. S., at 82 (fact that actual\r\nuse has \u201cbeen more of a private nature than of a public,\r\ncommercial sort . . . cannot be regarded as controlling\u201d).\r\nSimilarly, poststatehood evidence, depending on its na\u00ad\r\nture, may show susceptibility of use at the time of state\u00ad\r\nhood. See id., at 82\u201383 (\u201c[E]xtensive and continued\r\n[historical] use for commercial purposes\u201d may be the \u201cmost\r\npersuasive\u201d form of evidence, but the \u201ccrucial question\u201d is\r\nthe potential for such use at the time of statehood, rather\r\nthan \u201cthe mere manner or extent of actual use\u201d).\r\n   Evidence of present-day use may be considered to the\r\nextent it informs the historical determination whether the\r\nriver segment was susceptible of use for commercial navi\u00ad\r\ngation at the time of statehood. For the susceptibility\r\nanalysis, it must be determined whether trade and travel\r\ncould have been conducted \u201cin the customary modes of\r\ntrade and travel on water,\u201d over the relevant river seg\u00ad\r\nment \u201cin [its] natural and ordinary condition.\u201d Id., at 76\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). At a minimum, there\u00ad\r\nfore, the party seeking to use present-day evidence for title\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npurposes must show: (1) the watercraft are meaningfully\r\nsimilar to those in customary use for trade and travel\r\nat the time of statehood; and (2) the river\u2019s poststatehood\r\ncondition is not materially different from its physical con-\r\ndition at statehood. See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (find-\r\ning that scientific and historical evidence showed that\r\nthe physical condition of particular water bodies had not\r\nvaried substantially since statehood in a way that might\r\naffect navigation). If modern watercraft permit navigabil\u00ad\r\nity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the\r\nriver has changed in ways that substantially improve its\r\nnavigability, then the evidence of present-day use has\r\nlittle or no bearing on navigability at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica\u00ad\r\ntion that it made these necessary findings. The court\r\nconcluded the evidence of present-day use of the Madison\r\nwas probative of its susceptibility of use at statehood, but\r\nthere is no apparent basis for its conclusion. 355 Mont., at\r\n442\u2013443, 438\u2013439, 229 P. 3d, at 449, 446\u2013447. The court\r\ndid not find the watercraft similar to those used at the\r\ntime of statehood, and the State\u2019s evidence of present-day\r\nuse for recreational fishing did not indicate what types of\r\nboats are now used. App. 46\u201348. Modern recreational\r\nfishing boats, including inflatable rafts and lightweight\r\ncanoes or kayaks, may be able to navigate waters much\r\nmore shallow or with rockier beds than the boats custom\u00ad\r\narily used for trade and travel at statehood.\r\n   As to the river\u2019s physical condition, the Montana Su\u00ad\r\npreme Court did not assess with care PPL\u2019s evidence\r\nabout changes to the river\u2019s flow and the location and\r\npattern of its channel since statehood. The affidavit of\r\nPPL\u2019s expert in fluvial geomorphology\u2014the study of river\u00ad\r\nrelated landforms\u2014at least suggests that as a result of\r\nPPL\u2019s dams, the river has become \u201cless torrential\u201d in high\r\nflow periods and less shallow in low flow periods. App.\r\n575\u2013577 (Docket No. 170). Thus, the river may well be\r\n24            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\neasier to navigate now than at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court altogether ignored the\r\nexpert\u2019s reasoning about the past condition of the river\u2019s\r\nchannels and the significance of that information for\r\nnavigability. Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, the expert\u2019s affidavit was not mere\r\nevidence of change in \u201cseasonal variations\u201d of water depth.\r\n355 Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. It provided meaning\u00ad\r\nful evidence that the river\u2019s conditions had changed since\r\nstatehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the\r\nriver easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.\r\nWhile the Montana court was correct that a river need not\r\nbe susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,\r\nneither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a\r\ncommercial reality. Against this background, the present\u00ad\r\nday recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil\u00ad\r\nity for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\nThe Montana Supreme Court\u2019s reliance upon the State\u2019s\r\nevidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without\r\nfurther inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.\r\n                           C\r\n  The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the\r\nCourt declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt further erred as to the burden of proof regarding\r\nnavigability.\r\n                            D\r\n  As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests\r\nthat denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis\u00ad\r\npute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con\u00ad\r\ncerns public access to the waters above those beds for\r\npurposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational\r\nuses.

Its roots\r\ntrace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in\r\nthe English common law on public navigation and fishing\r\nrights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun\u00ad\r\ntry. See Coeur d\u2019Alene, 521 U. S., at 284\u2013286; Illinois\r\nCentral R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);\r\nD. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3\u20138,\r\n15\u201324 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior\r\nCourt of Alpine Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174072\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174072/national-audubon-society-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433\u2013441, 658 P. 2d\r\n709, 718\u2013724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9\u201310\r\n(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which\r\nis the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of\r\nriverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter\r\nof state law, see Coeur d\u2019Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois\r\nCentral, a Supreme Court public trust case, was \u201c \u2018neces\u00ad\r\nsarily a statement of Illinois law\u2019 \u201d); Appleby v. City of New\r\nYork, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to\r\nthe federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under\r\nthe Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal\u00ad\r\nfooting cases have noted that the State takes title to the\r\nnavigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see\r\nShively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15\u201317, 24, 46, the contours of\r\nthat public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.\r\nUnder accepted principles of federalism, the States retain\r\nresidual power to determine the scope of the public trust\r\nover waters within their borders, while federal law deter\u00ad\r\nmines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n                             V\r\n   As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana\r\nfiled its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the\r\nfirst of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana\r\nhad not sought compensation before then, despite its full\r\nawareness of PPL\u2019s hydroelectric projects and despite the\r\nState\u2019s own participation in the projects\u2019 federal licensing\r\n26            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess. While this Court does not reach the question, it\r\nmay be that by virtue of the State\u2019s sovereignty, neither\r\nlaches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the\r\nState\u2019s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and\r\nits predecessors in title upon the State\u2019s long failure to\r\nassert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that\r\nthe river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the\r\nequal-footing doctrine.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Montana\r\nowns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the\r\nState was based upon an infirm legal understanding of\r\nthis Court\u2019s rules of navigability for title under the equal\u00ad\r\nfooting doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, \u201cIt is\r\nnot for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the\r\ngeneral subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive\r\nrule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge\r\nwhat actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad\u00ad\r\nmission, under the constitutional rule of equality here\r\ninvoked.\u201d 260 U. S., at 88.\r\n                        *     *     *\r\n  The judgment of the Montana Supreme Court is re\u00ad\r\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\r\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n                                          It is so ordered.\r\n</pre>",
