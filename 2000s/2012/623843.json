Argued November 9, 2011\u2014Decided February 29, 2012\nGeorge Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.\n After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He and\n his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Prod-\n ucts Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from\n Corson\u2019s exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts\n distributed by respondents. The Corsons alleged state-law claims of\n defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.\n After Corson died, petitioner Kurns, executrix of his estate, was sub-\n stituted as a party. Respondents removed the case to the Federal\n District Court, which granted them summary judgment, ruling that\n the state-law claims were pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection\n Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. \u00a720701 et seq. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners\u2019 state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims\n fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted\n by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line\n R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. Pp. 2\u221211.\n    (a) The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be\n used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomo-\n tive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition\n and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,\n have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations pre-\n scribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can with-\n stand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary. See\n \u00a720701. Pp. 2\u20133.\n    (b) Congress may expressly pre-empt state law. But even without\n2         KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    an express pre-emption provision, state law must yield to a congres-\n    sional Act to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute, see\n    Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372, or\n    when the federal statute\u2019s scope indicates that Congress intended\n    federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. My-\n    rick, 514 U. S. 280, 287. This case involves only the latter, so-called\n    \u201cfield pre-emption.\u201d Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (c) In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of\n    locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the\n    broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Com-\n    mission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIA\u2019s\n    requirements) was a \u201cgeneral one\u201d that \u201cextends to the design, the\n    construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and\n    tender and of all appurtenances.\u201d 272 U. S., at 611. The Court re-\n    jected the States\u2019 contention that the scope of the pre-empted field\n    was to \u201cbe determined by the object sought through legislation, ra-\n    ther than the physical elements affected by it,\u201d id., at 612, and found\n    it dispositive that \u201c[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the\n    same subject\u2015the equipment of locomotives.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 4\u22125.\n       (d) The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter\n    the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope. By its terms, the FRSA\u2014which in-\n    structs that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation . . . shall prescribe\n    regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supple-\n    menting laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970,\u201d 49\n    U. S. C. \u00a720103(a)\u2014does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety\n    statutes. Rather, it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the\n    Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supple-\n    mental regulation. Because the LIA was already in effect when the\n    FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope\n    as defined by Napier, intact. P. 6.\n       (e) Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled. In-\n    stead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA\u2019s\n    pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier. Petitioners\u2019 arguments\n    are unpersuasive. First, the argument that the pre-empted field\n    does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or\n    maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier\u2019s holding\n    that Congress, in enacting the LIA, \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to oc-\n    cupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.\u201d 272 U. S.,\n    at 611. Second, the argument that petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn\n    claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the\n    design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn\n    claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied\n    by sufficient warnings or instructions. Because petitioners\u2019 failure-\n    to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomo-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by Napier. Third,\n  the argument that petitioners\u2019 claims are not pre-empted because\n  manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was\n  exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the\n  pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not\n  on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation. Finally, con-\n  trary to petitioners\u2019 argument, the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope is not lim-\n  ited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-\n  law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive\n  equipment.

S. C. \u00a720701 et seq. The United States Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 claims fall within the field pre-empted by that Act, as\nthat field was defined by this Court\u2019s decision in Napier v.\nAtlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605 (1926). We\nagree.\n                             I\n   George Corson was employed as a welder and machinist\nby the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad\nfrom 1947 until 1974. Corson worked in locomotive repair\nand maintenance facilities, where his duties included\ninstalling brakeshoes on locomotives and stripping insula\u00ad\ntion from locomotive boilers. In 2005, Corson was diag\u00ad\nnosed with malignant mesothelioma.\n   In 2007, Corson and his wife filed suit in Pennsylvania\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate court against 59 defendants, including respondents\nRailroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC) and Viad\nCorp (Viad). According to the complaint, RFPC distribut\u00ad\ned locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad\nwas the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac\u00ad\ntured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves\ncontaining asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this\nequipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes\u00ad\ntos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the\nequipment was defectively designed because it contained\nasbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan\u00ad\ngers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its\nsafe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed\naway, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was\nsubstituted as a party. Corson\u2019s widow and the executrix\nare petitioners here.\n   Respondents removed the case to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nand moved for summary judgment. Respondents argued\nthat petitioners\u2019 state-law claims were pre-empted by the\nLIA. The District Court agreed and granted summary\njudgment for respondents. See Kurns v. A. W. Chesterton,\nCiv. Action No. 08\u20132216 (ED Pa., Feb. 3, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 39a. The Third Circuit affirmed. See Kurns\nv. A. W. Chesterton, Inc., 620 F. 3d 392 (2010). We granted\ncertiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  Congress enacted the predecessor to the LIA, the Boiler\nInspection Act (BIA), in 1911. The BIA made it unlawful\nto use a steam locomotive \u201cunless the boiler of said loco\u00ad\nmotive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition\nand safe to operate . . . without unnecessary peril to life or\nlimb.\u201d Act of Feb. 17, 1911, ch. 103, \u00a72, 36 Stat. 913\u2013914.\nIn 1915, Congress amended the BIA to apply to \u201cthe entire\nlocomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthereof.\u201d1 Act of Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 169, \u00a71, 38 Stat. 1192.\nThe BIA as amended became commonly known as the\nLocomotive Inspection Act. As relevant here, the LIA\nprovides:\n       \u201cA railroad carrier may use or allow to be used\n     a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only\n     when the locomotive or tender and its parts and\n     appurtenances\u2014\n       \u201c(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate\n     without unnecessary danger of personal injury;\n       \u201c(2) have been inspected as required under this\n     chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\n     Transportation under this chapter; and\n       \u201c(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec\u00ad\n     retary under this chapter.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a720701.2\n  The issue presented in this case is whether the LIA pre\u00ad\nempts petitioners\u2019 state-law claims that respondents\ndefectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn\nCorson of dangers associated with those parts. In light of\nthis Court\u2019s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude\nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are pre-empted.\n                           III\n\n                              \n\n                            A\n\n  The Supremacy Clause provides that federal law \u201cshall\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the\nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not\u00ad\nwithstanding.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Pre-emption of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 A \u201ctender\u201d is a \u201c[a] car attached to a locomotive, for carrying a sup\u00ad\n\nply of fuel and water.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 2126 (1917).\n  2 At the time of Corson\u2019s employment, this provision of the LIA was\n\nworded somewhat differently. See 45 U. S. C. \u00a723 (1946 ed.). Petition\u00ad\ners do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any\ndifference in this case.\n4           KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law thus occurs through the \u201cdirect operation of the\nSupremacy Clause.\u201d Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S.\n491, 501 (1984). Congress may, of course, expressly pre\u00ad\nempt state law, but \u201c[e]ven without an express provision\nfor preemption, we have found that state law must yield to\na congressional Act in at least two circumstances.\u201d Crosby\nv. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\n(2000). First, \u201cstate law is naturally preempted to the\nextent of any conflict with a federal statute.\u201d Ibid. Se\u00ad\ncond, we have deemed state law pre-empted \u201cwhen the\nscope of a [federal] statute indicates that Congress intend\u00ad\ned federal law to occupy a field exclusively.\u201d Freightliner\nCorp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995). We deal here\nonly with the latter, so-called field pre-emption.\n                             B\n  We do not, however, address the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive ef-\nfect on a clean slate, because this Court addressed that\nissue 85 years ago in Napier. In that case, railroads chal\u00ad\nlenged two state laws that \u201cprohibit[ed] use within the\nState of locomotives not equipped with\u201d certain prescribed\ndevices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au\u00ad\nthority to carry out the LIA\u2019s requirements, had not re\u00ad\nquired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In\nresponse, the States argued that their requirements were\nnot pre-empted because they were directed at a different\nobjective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the\nStates, their regulations were intended to protect railroad\nworkers from sickness and disease, whereas \u201cthe federal\nregulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Act\n       of Feb. 17, 1911, \u00a76, 36 Stat. 915. That authority has since\nbeen transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. Department of\nTransportation Act, \u00a7\u00a76(e)(1)(E) and (F), 80 Stat. 939; see 49 U. S.

The Court answered\nthat question in the affirmative, stating that \u201c[t]he broad\nscope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]\u201d by Con\u00ad\ngress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The\npower delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a\n\u201cgeneral one\u201d that \u201cextends to the design, the construction\nand the material of every part of the locomotive and ten\u00ad\nder and of all appurtenances.\u201d Id., at 611.\n   The Court rejected the States\u2019 contention that the scope\nof the pre-empted field was to \u201cbe determined by the object\nsought through the legislation, rather than the physical\nelements affected by it.\u201d Id., at 612. The Court found it\ndispositive that \u201c[t]he federal and the state statutes are\ndirected to the same subject\u2014the equipment of locomo\u00ad\ntives.\u201d Ibid. Because the States\u2019 requirements operated\nupon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court\nheld that the state laws, \u201chowever commendable or how\u00ad\never different their purpose,\u201d id., at 613, fell within the\nLIA\u2019s pre-empted field.\n                            IV\n   Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two\narguments in support of their position that their state-law\nclaims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip\u00ad\nment do not fall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field. Peti\u00ad\ntioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the\nscope of the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because that field has\nbeen narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.\nAlternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not\nfall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field, even as that field\nwas defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners\u2019\narguments in turn.\n6       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n    First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad\nSafety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49\nU. S. C. \u00a720102 et seq.), altered the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive\nscope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation\nbroad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See\n\u00a720103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA\u2019s pre-emption\nprovision, which provides in part that \u201c[a] State may adopt\nor continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to\nrailroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation\n. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the\nsubject matter of the State requirement.\u201d \u00a720106(a)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA\u2019s\npre-emption provision supplanted the LIA\u2019s pre-emption of\nthe field, with the result that petitioners\u2019 claims are not\npre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula\u00ad\ntion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives\nor locomotive parts.\n    Petitioners\u2019 reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The\nFRSA instructs that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation,\nas necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders\nfor every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and\nregulations in effect on October 16, 1970.\u201d \u00a720103(a) (2006\ned.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does\nnot alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.\n\u201cRather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author\u00ad\nizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety\nwith supplemental regulation.\u201d Marshall v. Burlington\nNorthern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152\u20131153 (CA9 1983)\n(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect\nwhen the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA\nleft the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Na-\npier, intact.\n                            B\n    Since the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners do not\nask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over\u00ad\ncome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this\n85-year-old precedent.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting\nthe \u201cspecial force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re\u00ad\ngard to questions of statutory interpretation\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance\nseveral arguments aimed at demonstrating that their\nclaims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it\nwas defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.\n                               1\n   Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus\ncuriae, first argue that petitioners\u2019 claims do not fall with\u00ad\nin the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because the claims arise out\nof the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than\nthe use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they\ncontend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA\nis coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government\u2019s\nregulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,\ndoes not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from\nthe repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the\nargument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or\nmaintenance\u2014as opposed to claims arising from use on\nthe line\u2014do not fall within the pre-empted field.\n   We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.\nIn Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the\nLIA, \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field\nof regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d and the Court did\nnot distinguish between hazards arising from repair and\nmaintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the\nline. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined\nby Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.\nPetitioners\u2019 common-law claims for defective design and\nfailure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.\n8      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause those claims \u201care directed to the same subject\u201d as\nthe LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre\u00ad\nempted field. Id., at 612.\n                              2\n  Petitioners further argue that, even if their design\u00ad\ndefect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims\ndo not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners\nalleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents\nnegligently failed to warn of the risks associated with\nasbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe\u00ad\nguards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestos-\ncontaining products were defective because respondents\nfailed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con\u00ad\ncerning the \u201crisks, dangers, and harm inherent in said\nasbestos products.\u201d See App. 20\u201327 (\u00b6\u00b67\u201310, 12), 42 (\u00b68);\nsee also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,\nthese claims do not fall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field\nbecause \u201c[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is\nnot the \u2018design\u2019 or \u2018manufacture\u2019 of a product,\u201d but is in\u00ad\nstead \u201cthe failure to provide adequate warnings regarding\nthe product\u2019s risks.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.\n  We disagree. A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the\nproduct itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied\nby sufficient warnings or instructions.         Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72(c) (1997) (A failure\u00ad\nto-warn claim alleges that a product is defective \u201cwhen the\nforeseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have\nbeen reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable\ninstructions or warnings by the seller or other distribu\u00ad\ntor, . . . and the omission of the instructions or warnings\nrenders the product not reasonably safe\u201d); see also id.,\nComment l, at 33 (\u201cReasonable designs and instructions\nor warnings both play important roles in the production\nand distribution of reasonably safe products\u201d).

Because petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the\nequipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted\nfield defined by Napier. 272 U. S., at 612.4\n                               3\n  Petitioners also contend that their state-law claims\nagainst manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts\nfall outside of the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because manufac\u00ad\nturers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that\nCorson was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Petitioners\npoint out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA,\nsubjected only common carriers to civil penalties. Act of\nFeb. 17, 1911, \u00a79, 36 Stat. 916. It was not until 1988, well\nafter the events of this case, that the LIA\u2019s penalty provi\u00ad\nsion was revised to apply to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d violating the\nLIA. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, \u00a714(7)(A), 102\nStat. 633; see also \u00a714(7)(B) (amending penalty provision\nto provide that \u201can act by an individual that causes\na railroad to be in violation . . . shall be deemed a\nviolation\u201d).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR apparently agrees that petitioners\u2019 failure-to\u00ad\n\nwarn claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives. Post, at 5\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Yet, she argues,\nthose claims affect locomotive equipment only \u201c \u2018tangentially.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(quoting English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990)). Not\nso. A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of\nlocomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state\nlaw are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of\nliability will inevitably influence a manufacturer\u2019s choice whether to\nuse that particular design. By influencing design decisions in that\nmanner, failure-to-warn liability has a \u201c \u2018direct and substantial effect\u2019 \u201d\non the \u201cphysical elements\u201d of a locomotive. Post, at 5 (quoting English,\nsupra, at 85).\n10     KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  This argument fails for the same reason as the two\npreceding arguments: It is inconsistent with Napier.\nNapier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the\nbasis of the physical elements regulated\u2014\u201cthe equipment\nof locomotives\u201d\u2014not on the basis of the entity directly\nsubject to regulation. 272 U. S., at 612. Because petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,\nthey fall within the pre-empted field.\n  Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is also contrary to common\nsense. Under petitioners\u2019 approach, a State could not\nrequire railroads to equip their locomotives with parts\nmeeting state-imposed specifications, but could require\nmanufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts\nmeeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a\nsimilar approach in an express pre-emption context in\nEngine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Manage-\nment Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004). There, a state entity\nargued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of\nvehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions require\u00ad\nments were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a77543(a), because the rules in question were\naimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manu\u00ad\nfacture or sale. 541 U. S., at 248. We observed, however,\nthat \u201ctreating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions\ndifferently for pre-emption purposes would make no\nsense,\u201d because the \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s right to sell federally\napproved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur\u00ad\nchaser\u2019s right to buy them.\u201d Id., at 255. Similarly, a\nrailroad\u2019s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli\u00ad\nance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur\u00ad\ners are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive\nparts that meet those standards. Petitioners\u2019 claims thus\ndo not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at\nthe manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners note\nthat \u201ca preempted field does not necessarily include state\ncommon law.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 38\u201339 (citing Silkwood\nv. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984); Sprietsma v.\nMercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002)). Napier, however,\nheld that the LIA \u201coccup[ied] the entire field of regulating\nlocomotive equipment\u201d to the exclusion of state regulation.\n272 U. S., at 611\u2013612. That categorical conclusion admits\nof no exception for state common-law duties and standards\nof care. As we have recognized, state \u201cregulation can be\n. . . effectively exerted through an award of damages,\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is\ndesigned to be, a potent method of governing conduct and\ncontrolling policy.\u201d San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U.

We therefore conclude that state common-law\nduties and standards of care directed to the subject of\nlocomotive equipment are pre-empted by the LIA.\n                        *   *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that petitioners\u2019\nstate-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims fall\nwithin the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre\u00ad\nempted by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605\n(1926), in the same way today. The Napier Court conclud-\ned that Congress had \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy\nthe entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d based\non nothing more than a statute granting regulatory au-\nthority over that subject matter to a federal agency. Id.,\nat 611. Under our more recent cases, Congress must do\nmuch more to oust all of state law from a field. See, e.g.,\nNew York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S.\n405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Con-\ngress had enacted a \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d regu-\nlatory scheme). Viewed through the lens of modern\npreemption law, Napier is an anachronism.\n  But Napier governs so long as Congress lets it\u2014and\nthat decision provides a straightforward way to determine\nwhether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are\npreempted. According to Napier, the scope of the agency\u2019s\npower under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) deter-\nmines the boundaries of the preempted field. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nthey fell \u201cwithin the scope of the authority delegated to the\nCommission\u201d); see also ante, at 5 (the \u201c \u2018broad scope of the\nauthority\u2019 \u201d given to the agency \u201cled to [Napier\u2019s] conclu-\nsion\u201d); post, at 7\u20138 (\u201c[T]he pre-empted field is congruent\nwith the regulated field\u201d). And under that test, none of\nthe state-law claims at issue here can survive.\n   All of us agree that the petitioners\u2019 defective-design\nclaims are preempted. Napier recognized the federal\nagency\u2019s delegated authority over \u201cthe design, the con-\nstruction and the material of every part of the locomotive.\u201d\n272 U. S., at 611. In doing so, Napier did not distinguish\nbetween \u201chazards arising from repair and maintenance\u201d of\nthe parts and hazards stemming from their \u201cuse on the\nline.\u201d Ante, at 7. The agency thus has authority to regu-\nlate the design of locomotive equipment\u2014like the asbetos-\ncontaining brakeshoes here\u2014to prevent either danger.\nAnd that fact resolves the preemption question. Because\nthe agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as\ndesigned, the petitioners\u2019 defective-design claims\u2014which\nwould effectively accomplish the identical result\u2014fall\nwithin the preempted field.\n   So too the petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims, and for\nthe same reason. Napier did not specifically address\nwarnings, because the case in no way involved them. But\nif an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomo-\ntive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use\nof that equipment on proper warnings. (And that is so,\ncontrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s view, see post, at 8, n. 3,\nwhether the warning is engraved into the part itself or\nposted on the workshop wall.) Here, for example, the\nagency need not have chosen between banning asbestos-\ncontaining brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregu-\nlated. It could instead have required a warning about how\nto handle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would\nhave protected a worker from risk, then the agency could\nhave demanded a notice to that effect. See, e.g., Law v.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nGeneral Motors Corp., 114 F. 3d 908, 911 (CA9 1997) (\u201cAs\nfor warning requirements, these too are within the scope\nof the [agency\u2019s] authority\u201d); Scheiding v. General Motors\nCorp., 22 Cal. 4th 471, 484, 993 P. 2d 996, 1004 (2000)\n(same).* And because the agency could have required\nwarnings about the equipment\u2019s use, the petitioners\u2019\nfailure-to-warn claims, no less than their defective-design\nclaims, are preempted under Napier.\n  I understand these views to comport with the Court\u2019s\nopinion in this case, and I accordingly join it in full.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that \u201cpreserving petitioners\u2019 failure-to-\nwarn claims coheres with the LIA\u2019s regulatory regime\u201d because the\nagency disclaims authority over locomotive repair and maintenance.\nPost, at 7. But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The\nagency draws a line not between mandating design changes and man-\ndating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous\nto repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the\nrailroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that\nthe petitioners\u2019 design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted\nfield because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous\nonly their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313. The agency\u2019s understanding of its author-\nity therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s position. As the\nagency agrees, the petitioners\u2019 claims must stand or fall together if\nviewed through the lens of the agency\u2019s regulatory authority. In my\nview, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency\u2019s proffered\ndistinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and\nregulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.

Instead of relying on such\nindications of Congress\u2019 intent to oust state law, Napier\nimplied field pre-emption from the LIA\u2019s mere delegation\nof regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com\u00ad\nmission.

RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n(\u201cIn products liability suits based upon strict liability, . . .\nthe product itself need not be defective. Where a manufac\u00ad\nturer or seller has reason to anticipate that danger may\nresult from a particular use of his product, and he fails to\ngive adequate warning of such a danger, the product sold\nwithout such warning is in a defective condition within\nthe strict liability doctrine\u201d); Greiner v. Volkswagenwerk\nAktiengeselleschaft, 540 F. 2d 85, 92\u201393 (CA3 1976) (find\u00ad\ning that \u201cfailure to adequately warn of inherent or latent\nlimitations in a product, which do not necessarily amount\nto a design defect\u201d is \u201can independent basis of liability\u201d\nunder Pennsylvania law).2\n   Similarly, this Court has explained that a failure-to\u00ad\nwarn claim is \u201cnarrower\u201d than a claim that alleges a defect\nin the underlying product. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565 (2009). Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state\ndamages award based on a drug manufacturer\u2019s failure to\nprovide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intrave\u00ad\nnous administration of the drug, but noted that it was\nunnecessary to decide \u201cwhether a state rule proscribing\nintravenous administration would be pre-empted.\u201d Ibid.\nCf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 444\n(2005) (\u201cRules that require manufacturers to design rea\u00ad\nsonably safe products . . . plainly do not qualify as re\u00ad\nquirements for \u2018labeling or packaging.\u2019 None of these\ncommon-law rules requires that manufacturers label or\npackage their products in any particular way\u201d).\n   The majority treats defective-design and failure-to-warn\nclaims as congruent, reasoning that each asserts a product\ndefect. See ante, at 8\u20139 (citing Restatement \u00a72(c) and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Petitioners brought suit in Pennsylvania, but alleged that their\n\ndecedent, George Corson, was exposed to asbestos at railroad mainte\u00ad\nnance and repair shops in Montana and South Dakota. Id., at 42, \u00b6\u00b66\u2013\n7.

That may be true at a high level of gener-\nality, but \u201c[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims . . . rest on\ndifferent factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.\u201d\nRestatement \u00a72, at 35, Comment n. For example, a manu\u00ad\nfacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasona\u00ad\nbly unsafe design merely by issuing a warning. See id., at\n33, Comment l (\u201cWarnings are not . . . a substitute for the\nprovision of a reasonably safe design\u201d). In a fundamental\nsense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak\u00ad\ning a product\u2019s physical design as a given. A failure-to\u00ad\nwarn claim alleges a \u201cdefect\u201d by asserting that a product,\nas designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a\nwarning\u2014not that a product must be designed differently.\n   The majority further conflates defective-design and\nfailure-to-warn claims by noting that each is \u201cdirected at\u201d\nlocomotive equipment. Ante, at 9. That is insufficient.\nNot every state law that \u201ccould be said to affect tangen\u00ad\ntially\u201d matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990).\nRather, \u201cfor a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone,\nit must have some direct and substantial effect\u201d on the\nprimary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.\nIbid. As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical\nequipment of locomotives. But petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn\nclaims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the\nphysical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents\nthemselves acknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55\n(petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims \u201cmay not themselves\nliterally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive\u2019s\ndesign or construction\u201d).\n   In the majority\u2019s view, a \u201cduty to warn and the accom\u00ad\npanying threat of liability will inevitably influence\u201d a\nmanufacturer\u2019s design choices. Ante, at 9, n. 4. But an\n\u201cinfluence\u201d is not the same as an \u201ceffect,\u201d and not every\nstate law with some imaginable impact on matters within\na federally regulated field is, for that reason alone, pre\u00ad\n6      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nempted. See English, 496 U. S., at 85\u201386; Silkwood v.\nKerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984). Indeed, the\nmajority elides the distinction between indirect and direct\nregulation, even though this Court has explained that\nthe two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes. See\nGoodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 186 (1988)\n(\u201cCongress may reasonably determine that incidental reg-\nulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory\nauthority is not\u201d). State wage-and-hour laws, work-\nplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology,\nfor example, could all \u201cinfluence\u201d the means and materials\nof locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing\ndirect obligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its\nassertion that the \u201cinfluence\u201d exerted by a duty to warn\nneed be \u201cinevitabl[e]\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d Ante, at 9, n. 4. To\nthe contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty\ncould be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,\nin comparison to the commercial value of retaining an\nexisting design.\n   Respondents could have complied with state-law duties\nto warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance\nof asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man\u00ad\nuals. See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine\nManual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at\nhttp://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html        (last\nvisited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). Or respondents could have ensured that repair\nshops posted signs. See Restatement \u00a72, at 29\u201330, Com\u00ad\nment i (duty to warn \u201cmay require that instructions and\nwarnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and\nconsumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller\nshould know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the\nrisk of harm\u201d); see also, e.g., Patch v. Hillerich & Bradsby\nCo., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P. 3d 383, 388 (2011) (\u201cWhile\nplacing a warning directly on a product is one method of\nwarning, other methods of warning exist, including, but\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Neither\nstep would encroach on the pre-empted field of locomo\u00ad\ntives\u2019 \u201cphysical elements.\u201d Napier, 272 U. S., at 612. The\nmajority is therefore wrong to say that \u201cthe \u2018gravamen\u2019 of\npetitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims \u2018is still that [Corson]\nsuffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure\nto asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurte\u00ad\nnances.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8\u20139 (quoting Kurns v. A. W. Chesteron,\nInc., 620 F. 3d 392, 398, n. 8 (CA3 2010)). Rather, the\n\u201cgravamen\u201d of these claims is that petitioners\u2019 decedent\nGeorge Corson could have avoided the harmful conse\u00ad\nquences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely\nthe same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him,\nfor example, to wear a mask.\n   Finally, preserving petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims\ncoheres with the LIA\u2019s regulatory regime. Neither the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first\ndelegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail\u00ad\nroad Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now\nbelongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte\u00ad\nnance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it\nlacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive\nmaintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae in John Crane, Inc. v. Atwell, O. T.\n2010, No. 10\u2013272, p. 10 (\u201c[T]he field covered by the LIA\ndoes not include requirements concerning the repair of\nlocomotives that are not in use\u201d); Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 13 (\u201cThe preempted field . . . does not\ninclude tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo\u00ad\ntives are not in use\u201d). The FRA has determined that the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,\nbears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ\u00ad\ning with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.\n10583\u201310590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and\nn. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that\n8       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\naddress warnings specific to maintenance and repair.\nBecause the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu\u00ad\nlated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,\n112 (2000), the majority\u2019s decision sweeps far too broadly.3\n                        *     *     *\n  In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive\neffect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition\u00ad\ners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex\u00ad\nposure to asbestos in repair facilities. \u201cIt is difficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all\nmeans of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal\nconduct.\u201d Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true\nin light of the LIA\u2019s \u201cpurpose . . . of facilitating employee\nrecovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it\nimpossible.\u201d Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).\n  I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Disagreeing with the agency\u2019s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con\u00ad\n\ncludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an\nincident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,\n2\u20133 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22\u201323. Such power,\nif it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require\u00ad\nments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,\nsupra; 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,\nbut it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the\nauthority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See\nNapier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611\u2013612 (1926).\nAnd it is the line that separates petitioners\u2019 design-defect claims from\ntheir claims for failure to warn.\n",

Argued November 9, 2011\u2014Decided February 29, 2012\nGeorge Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.\n After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He and\n his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Prod-\n ucts Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from\n Corson\u2019s exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts\n distributed by respondents. The Corsons alleged state-law claims of\n defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.\n After Corson died, petitioner Kurns, executrix of his estate, was sub-\n stituted as a party. Respondents removed the case to the Federal\n District Court, which granted them summary judgment, ruling that\n the state-law claims were pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection\n Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. \u00a720701 et seq. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners\u2019 state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims\n fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted\n by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line\n R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. Pp. 2\u221211.\n    (a) The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be\n used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomo-\n tive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition\n and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,\n have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations pre-\n scribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can with-\n stand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary. See\n \u00a720701. Pp. 2\u20133.\n    (b) Congress may expressly pre-empt state law. But even without\n2         KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    an express pre-emption provision, state law must yield to a congres-\n    sional Act to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute, see\n    Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372, or\n    when the federal statute\u2019s scope indicates that Congress intended\n    federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. My-\n    rick, 514 U. S. 280, 287. This case involves only the latter, so-called\n    \u201cfield pre-emption.\u201d Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (c) In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of\n    locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the\n    broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Com-\n    mission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIA\u2019s\n    requirements) was a \u201cgeneral one\u201d that \u201cextends to the design, the\n    construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and\n    tender and of all appurtenances.\u201d 272 U. S., at 611. The Court re-\n    jected the States\u2019 contention that the scope of the pre-empted field\n    was to \u201cbe determined by the object sought through legislation, ra-\n    ther than the physical elements affected by it,\u201d id., at 612, and found\n    it dispositive that \u201c[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the\n    same subject\u2015the equipment of locomotives.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 4\u22125.\n       (d) The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter\n    the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope. By its terms, the FRSA\u2014which in-\n    structs that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation . . . shall prescribe\n    regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supple-\n    menting laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970,\u201d 49\n    U. S. C. \u00a720103(a)\u2014does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety\n    statutes. Rather, it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the\n    Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supple-\n    mental regulation. Because the LIA was already in effect when the\n    FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope\n    as defined by Napier, intact. P. 6.\n       (e) Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled. In-\n    stead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA\u2019s\n    pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier. Petitioners\u2019 arguments\n    are unpersuasive. First, the argument that the pre-empted field\n    does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or\n    maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier\u2019s holding\n    that Congress, in enacting the LIA, \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to oc-\n    cupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.\u201d 272 U. S.,\n    at 611. Second, the argument that petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn\n    claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the\n    design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn\n    claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied\n    by sufficient warnings or instructions. Because petitioners\u2019 failure-\n    to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomo-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Third,\n  the argument that petitioners\u2019 claims are not pre-empted because\n  manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was\n  exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the\n  pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not\n  on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation. Finally, con-\n  trary to petitioners\u2019 argument, the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope is not lim-\n  ited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-\n  law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive\n  equipment.

According to the complaint, RFPC distribut\u00ad\ned locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad\nwas the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac\u00ad\ntured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves\ncontaining asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this\nequipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes\u00ad\ntos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the\nequipment was defectively designed because it contained\nasbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan\u00ad\ngers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its\nsafe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed\naway, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was\nsubstituted as a party.

As relevant here, the LIA\nprovides:\n       \u201cA railroad carrier may use or allow to be used\n     a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only\n     when the locomotive or tender and its parts and\n     appurtenances\u2014\n       \u201c(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate\n     without unnecessary danger of personal injury;\n       \u201c(2) have been inspected as required under this\n     chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\n     Transportation under this chapter; and\n       \u201c(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec\u00ad\n     retary under this chapter.\u201d 49 U.

In light of\nthis Court\u2019s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude\nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are pre-empted.\n                           III\n\n                              \n\n                            A\n\n  The Supremacy Clause provides that federal law \u201cshall\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the\nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not\u00ad\nwithstanding.\u201d U.

See 45 U. S. C. \u00a723 (1946 ed.). Petition\u00ad\ners do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any\ndifference in this case.\n4           KURNS v.

Congress may, of course, expressly pre\u00ad\nempt state law, but \u201c[e]ven without an express provision\nfor preemption, we have found that state law must yield to\na congressional Act in at least two circumstances.\u201d Crosby\nv.

We deal here\nonly with the latter, so-called field pre-emption.\n                             B\n  We do not, however, address the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive ef-\nfect on a clean slate, because this Court addressed that\nissue 85 years ago in Napier. In that case, railroads chal\u00ad\nlenged two state laws that \u201cprohibit[ed] use within the\nState of locomotives not equipped with\u201d certain prescribed\ndevices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au\u00ad\nthority to carry out the LIA\u2019s requirements, had not re\u00ad\nquired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In\nresponse, the States argued that their requirements were\nnot pre-empted because they were directed at a different\nobjective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the\nStates, their regulations were intended to protect railroad\nworkers from sickness and disease, whereas \u201cthe federal\nregulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Act\n       of Feb. 17, 1911, \u00a76, 36 Stat. 915.

The Court answered\nthat question in the affirmative, stating that \u201c[t]he broad\nscope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]\u201d by Con\u00ad\ngress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The\npower delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a\n\u201cgeneral one\u201d that \u201cextends to the design, the construction\nand the material of every part of the locomotive and ten\u00ad\nder and of all appurtenances.\u201d Id., at 611.\n   The Court rejected the States\u2019 contention that the scope\nof the pre-empted field was to \u201cbe determined by the object\nsought through the legislation, rather than the physical\nelements affected by it.\u201d Id., at 612. The Court found it\ndispositive that \u201c[t]he federal and the state statutes are\ndirected to the same subject\u2014the equipment of locomo\u00ad\ntives.\u201d Ibid. Because the States\u2019 requirements operated\nupon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court\nheld that the state laws, \u201chowever commendable or how\u00ad\never different their purpose,\u201d id., at 613, fell within the\nLIA\u2019s pre-empted field.\n                            IV\n   Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two\narguments in support of their position that their state-law\nclaims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip\u00ad\nment do not fall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field. Peti\u00ad\ntioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the\nscope of the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because that field has\nbeen narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.\nAlternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not\nfall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field, even as that field\nwas defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners\u2019\narguments in turn.\n6       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n    First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad\nSafety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49\nU. S. C. \u00a720102 et seq.), altered the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive\nscope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation\nbroad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See\n\u00a720103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA\u2019s pre-emption\nprovision, which provides in part that \u201c[a] State may adopt\nor continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to\nrailroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation\n. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the\nsubject matter of the State requirement.\u201d \u00a720106(a)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA\u2019s\npre-emption provision supplanted the LIA\u2019s pre-emption of\nthe field, with the result that petitioners\u2019 claims are not\npre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula\u00ad\ntion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives\nor locomotive parts.\n    Petitioners\u2019 reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The\nFRSA instructs that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation,\nas necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders\nfor every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and\nregulations in effect on October 16, 1970.\u201d \u00a720103(a) (2006\ned.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does\nnot alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.\n\u201cRather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author\u00ad\nizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety\nwith supplemental regulation.\u201d Marshall v. Burlington\nNorthern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152\u20131153 (CA9 1983)\n(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect\nwhen the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA\nleft the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Na-\npier, intact.\n                            B\n    Since the LIA\u2019s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners must contend with Napier. Petitioners do not\nask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over\u00ad\ncome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this\n85-year-old precedent. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.\nSEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting\nthe \u201cspecial force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re\u00ad\ngard to questions of statutory interpretation\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance\nseveral arguments aimed at demonstrating that their\nclaims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it\nwas defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.\n                               1\n   Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus\ncuriae, first argue that petitioners\u2019 claims do not fall with\u00ad\nin the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because the claims arise out\nof the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than\nthe use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they\ncontend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA\nis coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government\u2019s\nregulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,\ndoes not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from\nthe repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the\nargument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or\nmaintenance\u2014as opposed to claims arising from use on\nthe line\u2014do not fall within the pre-empted field.\n   We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.\nIn Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the\nLIA, \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field\nof regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d and the Court did\nnot distinguish between hazards arising from repair and\nmaintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the\nline. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined\nby Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.\nPetitioners\u2019 common-law claims for defective design and\nfailure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.\n8      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause those claims \u201care directed to the same subject\u201d as\nthe LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre\u00ad\nempted field. Id., at 612.\n                              2\n  Petitioners further argue that, even if their design\u00ad\ndefect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims\ndo not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners\nalleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents\nnegligently failed to warn of the risks associated with\nasbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe\u00ad\nguards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestos-\ncontaining products were defective because respondents\nfailed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con\u00ad\ncerning the \u201crisks, dangers, and harm inherent in said\nasbestos products.\u201d See App. 20\u201327 (\u00b6\u00b67\u201310, 12), 42 (\u00b68);\nsee also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,\nthese claims do not fall within the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field\nbecause \u201c[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is\nnot the \u2018design\u2019 or \u2018manufacture\u2019 of a product,\u201d but is in\u00ad\nstead \u201cthe failure to provide adequate warnings regarding\nthe product\u2019s risks.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.\n  We disagree. A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the\nproduct itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied\nby sufficient warnings or instructions.         Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72(c) (1997) (A failure\u00ad\nto-warn claim alleges that a product is defective \u201cwhen the\nforeseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have\nbeen reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable\ninstructions or warnings by the seller or other distribu\u00ad\ntor, . . . and the omission of the instructions or warnings\nrenders the product not reasonably safe\u201d); see also id.,\nComment l, at 33 (\u201cReasonable designs and instructions\nor warnings both play important roles in the production\nand distribution of reasonably safe products\u201d). Thus, the\n\u201cgravamen\u201d of petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims \u201cis still\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

Because petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the\nequipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted\nfield defined by Napier. 272 U. S., at 612.4\n                               3\n  Petitioners also contend that their state-law claims\nagainst manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts\nfall outside of the LIA\u2019s pre-empted field because manufac\u00ad\nturers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that\nCorson was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Petitioners\npoint out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA,\nsubjected only common carriers to civil penalties. Act of\nFeb. 17, 1911, \u00a79, 36 Stat. 916. It was not until 1988, well\nafter the events of this case, that the LIA\u2019s penalty provi\u00ad\nsion was revised to apply to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d violating the\nLIA. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, \u00a714(7)(A), 102\nStat. 633; see also \u00a714(7)(B) (amending penalty provision\nto provide that \u201can act by an individual that causes\na railroad to be in violation . . . shall be deemed a\nviolation\u201d).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR apparently agrees that petitioners\u2019 failure-to\u00ad\n\nwarn claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives. Post, at 5\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Yet, she argues,\nthose claims affect locomotive equipment only \u201c \u2018tangentially.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(quoting English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990)). Not\nso. A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of\nlocomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state\nlaw are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of\nliability will inevitably influence a manufacturer\u2019s choice whether to\nuse that particular design. By influencing design decisions in that\nmanner, failure-to-warn liability has a \u201c \u2018direct and substantial effect\u2019 \u201d\non the \u201cphysical elements\u201d of a locomotive. Post, at 5 (quoting English,\nsupra, at 85).\n10     KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  This argument fails for the same reason as the two\npreceding arguments: It is inconsistent with Napier.\nNapier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the\nbasis of the physical elements regulated\u2014\u201cthe equipment\nof locomotives\u201d\u2014not on the basis of the entity directly\nsubject to regulation. 272 U. S., at 612. Because petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,\nthey fall within the pre-empted field.\n  Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is also contrary to common\nsense. Under petitioners\u2019 approach, a State could not\nrequire railroads to equip their locomotives with parts\nmeeting state-imposed specifications, but could require\nmanufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts\nmeeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a\nsimilar approach in an express pre-emption context in\nEngine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Manage-\nment Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004). There, a state entity\nargued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of\nvehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions require\u00ad\nments were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a77543(a), because the rules in question were\naimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manu\u00ad\nfacture or sale. 541 U. S., at 248. We observed, however,\nthat \u201ctreating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions\ndifferently for pre-emption purposes would make no\nsense,\u201d because the \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s right to sell federally\napproved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur\u00ad\nchaser\u2019s right to buy them.\u201d Id., at 255. Similarly, a\nrailroad\u2019s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli\u00ad\nance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur\u00ad\ners are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive\nparts that meet those standards. Petitioners\u2019 claims thus\ndo not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at\nthe manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners note\nthat \u201ca preempted field does not necessarily include state\ncommon law.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 38\u201339 (citing Silkwood\nv. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984); Sprietsma v.\nMercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002)).

That categorical conclusion admits\nof no exception for state common-law duties and standards\nof care. As we have recognized, state \u201cregulation can be\n. . . effectively exerted through an award of damages,\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is\ndesigned to be, a potent method of governing conduct and\ncontrolling policy.\u201d San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605\n(1926), in the same way today. The Napier Court conclud-\ned that Congress had \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy\nthe entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d based\non nothing more than a statute granting regulatory au-\nthority over that subject matter to a federal agency. Id.,\nat 611. Under our more recent cases, Congress must do\nmuch more to oust all of state law from a field. See, e.g.,\nNew York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S.\n405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Con-\ngress had enacted a \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d regu-\nlatory scheme). Viewed through the lens of modern\npreemption law, Napier is an anachronism.\n  But Napier governs so long as Congress lets it\u2014and\nthat decision provides a straightforward way to determine\nwhether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are\npreempted. According to Napier, the scope of the agency\u2019s\npower under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) deter-\nmines the boundaries of the preempted field. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nthey fell \u201cwithin the scope of the authority delegated to the\nCommission\u201d); see also ante, at 5 (the \u201c \u2018broad scope of the\nauthority\u2019 \u201d given to the agency \u201cled to [Napier\u2019s] conclu-\nsion\u201d); post, at 7\u20138 (\u201c[T]he pre-empted field is congruent\nwith the regulated field\u201d). And under that test, none of\nthe state-law claims at issue here can survive.\n   All of us agree that the petitioners\u2019 defective-design\nclaims are preempted. Napier recognized the federal\nagency\u2019s delegated authority over \u201cthe design, the con-\nstruction and the material of every part of the locomotive.\u201d\n272 U. S., at 611. In doing so, Napier did not distinguish\nbetween \u201chazards arising from repair and maintenance\u201d of\nthe parts and hazards stemming from their \u201cuse on the\nline.\u201d Ante, at 7. The agency thus has authority to regu-\nlate the design of locomotive equipment\u2014like the asbetos-\ncontaining brakeshoes here\u2014to prevent either danger.\nAnd that fact resolves the preemption question. Because\nthe agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as\ndesigned, the petitioners\u2019 defective-design claims\u2014which\nwould effectively accomplish the identical result\u2014fall\nwithin the preempted field.\n   So too the petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims, and for\nthe same reason. Napier did not specifically address\nwarnings, because the case in no way involved them. But\nif an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomo-\ntive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use\nof that equipment on proper warnings. (And that is so,\ncontrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s view, see post, at 8, n. 3,\nwhether the warning is engraved into the part itself or\nposted on the workshop wall.) Here, for example, the\nagency need not have chosen between banning asbestos-\ncontaining brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregu-\nlated. It could instead have required a warning about how\nto handle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would\nhave protected a worker from risk, then the agency could\nhave demanded a notice to that effect. See, e.g., Law v.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The\nagency draws a line not between mandating design changes and man-\ndating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous\nto repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the\nrailroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that\nthe petitioners\u2019 design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted\nfield because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous\nonly their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313. The agency\u2019s understanding of its author-\nity therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s position. As the\nagency agrees, the petitioners\u2019 claims must stand or fall together if\nviewed through the lens of the agency\u2019s regulatory authority. In my\nview, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency\u2019s proffered\ndistinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and\nregulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,\n331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such\nindications of Congress\u2019 intent to oust state law, Napier\nimplied field pre-emption from the LIA\u2019s mere delegation\nof regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com\u00ad\nmission. Compare 272 U. S., at 612\u2013613, with, e.g., Hills-\nborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,\n471 U. S. 707, 717 (1985), and New York State Dept. of\nSocial Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S. 405, 415 (1973). None\u00ad\ntheless, Napier\u2019s construction of the LIA has been settled\nlaw for 85 years, and \u201c \u2018[c]onsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation.\u2019 \u201d\nHilton v.

S. 197, 202 (1991).\n  Consistent with the values served by statutory stare\ndecisis, however, it is important to be precise about what\nNapier held: Napier defined the pre-empted field as the\nphysical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (\u201c[T]he power delegated . . . by the [LIA] . . .\nextends to the design, the construction, and the material\nof every part of the locomotive and tender and of all ap\u00ad\npurtenances\u201d); id., at 612 (\u201cThe federal and the state\nstatutes are directed to the same subject\u2014the equipment\nof locomotives.

See, e.g., Madden, The\nDuty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criti\u00ad\ncism, 89 W. Va. L.

Where a manufac\u00ad\nturer or seller has reason to anticipate that danger may\nresult from a particular use of his product, and he fails to\ngive adequate warning of such a danger, the product sold\nwithout such warning is in a defective condition within\nthe strict liability doctrine\u201d); Greiner v.

Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565 (2009). Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state\ndamages award based on a drug manufacturer\u2019s failure to\nprovide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intrave\u00ad\nnous administration of the drug, but noted that it was\nunnecessary to decide \u201cwhether a state rule proscribing\nintravenous administration would be pre-empted.\u201d Ibid.\nCf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.

That may be true at a high level of gener-\nality, but \u201c[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims . . . rest on\ndifferent factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.\u201d\nRestatement \u00a72, at 35, Comment n. For example, a manu\u00ad\nfacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasona\u00ad\nbly unsafe design merely by issuing a warning. See id., at\n33, Comment l (\u201cWarnings are not . . . a substitute for the\nprovision of a reasonably safe design\u201d). In a fundamental\nsense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak\u00ad\ning a product\u2019s physical design as a given. A failure-to\u00ad\nwarn claim alleges a \u201cdefect\u201d by asserting that a product,\nas designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a\nwarning\u2014not that a product must be designed differently.\n   The majority further conflates defective-design and\nfailure-to-warn claims by noting that each is \u201cdirected at\u201d\nlocomotive equipment. Ante, at 9. That is insufficient.\nNot every state law that \u201ccould be said to affect tangen\u00ad\ntially\u201d matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990).\nRather, \u201cfor a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone,\nit must have some direct and substantial effect\u201d on the\nprimary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.\nIbid. As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical\nequipment of locomotives. But petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn\nclaims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the\nphysical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents\nthemselves acknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55\n(petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims \u201cmay not themselves\nliterally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive\u2019s\ndesign or construction\u201d).\n   In the majority\u2019s view, a \u201cduty to warn and the accom\u00ad\npanying threat of liability will inevitably influence\u201d a\nmanufacturer\u2019s design choices. Ante, at 9, n. 4. But an\n\u201cinfluence\u201d is not the same as an \u201ceffect,\u201d and not every\nstate law with some imaginable impact on matters within\na federally regulated field is, for that reason alone, pre\u00ad\n6      KURNS v.

Indeed, the\nmajority elides the distinction between indirect and direct\nregulation, even though this Court has explained that\nthe two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes. See\nGoodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 186 (1988)\n(\u201cCongress may reasonably determine that incidental reg-\nulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory\nauthority is not\u201d). State wage-and-hour laws, work-\nplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology,\nfor example, could all \u201cinfluence\u201d the means and materials\nof locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing\ndirect obligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its\nassertion that the \u201cinfluence\u201d exerted by a duty to warn\nneed be \u201cinevitabl[e]\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d Ante, at 9, n. 4. To\nthe contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty\ncould be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,\nin comparison to the commercial value of retaining an\nexisting design.\n   Respondents could have complied with state-law duties\nto warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance\nof asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man\u00ad\nuals.

Neither the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first\ndelegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail\u00ad\nroad Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now\nbelongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte\u00ad\nnance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it\nlacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive\nmaintenance and repair facilities.

T.\n2010, No. 10\u2013272, p. 10 (\u201c[T]he field covered by the LIA\ndoes not include requirements concerning the repair of\nlocomotives that are not in use\u201d); Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 13 (\u201cThe preempted field . . . does not\ninclude tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo\u00ad\ntives are not in use\u201d). The FRA has determined that the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,\nbears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ\u00ad\ning with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.\n10583\u201310590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and\nn. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that\n8       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\naddress warnings specific to maintenance and repair.\nBecause the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu\u00ad\nlated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,\n112 (2000), the majority\u2019s decision sweeps far too broadly.3\n                        *     *     *\n  In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive\neffect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition\u00ad\ners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex\u00ad\nposure to asbestos in repair facilities. \u201cIt is difficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all\nmeans of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal\nconduct.\u201d Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true\nin light of the LIA\u2019s \u201cpurpose . . . of facilitating employee\nrecovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it\nimpossible.\u201d Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).\n  I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Disagreeing with the agency\u2019s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con\u00ad\n\ncludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an\nincident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,\n2\u20133 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22\u201323. Such power,\nif it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require\u00ad\nments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,\nsupra; 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,\nbut it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the\nauthority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See\nNapier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611\u2013612 (1926).\nAnd it is the line that separates petitioners\u2019 design-defect claims from\ntheir claims for failure to warn.\n</pre>",
