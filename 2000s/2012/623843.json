Argued November 9, 2011—Decided February 29, 2012\nGeorge Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.\n After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He and\n his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Prod-\n ucts Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from\n Corson’s exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts\n distributed by respondents. The Corsons alleged state-law claims of\n defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.\n After Corson died, petitioner Kurns, executrix of his estate, was sub-\n stituted as a party. Respondents removed the case to the Federal\n District Court, which granted them summary judgment, ruling that\n the state-law claims were pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection\n Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. §20701 et seq. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners’ state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims\n fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted\n by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line\n R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. Pp. 2−11.\n    (a) The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be\n used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomo-\n tive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition\n and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,\n have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations pre-\n scribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can with-\n stand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary.

National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372, or\n    when the federal statute’s scope indicates that Congress intended\n    federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. My-\n    rick, 514 U. S. 280, 287. This case involves only the latter, so-called\n    “field pre-emption.” Pp. 3–4.\n       (c) In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of\n    locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the\n    broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Com-\n    mission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIA’s\n    requirements) was a “general one” that “extends to the design, the\n    construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and\n    tender and of all appurtenances.” 272 U. S., at 611. The Court re-\n    jected the States’ contention that the scope of the pre-empted field\n    was to “be determined by the object sought through legislation, ra-\n    ther than the physical elements affected by it,” id., at 612, and found\n    it dispositive that “[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the\n    same subject―the equipment of locomotives.” Ibid. Pp. 4−5.\n       (d) The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter\n    the LIA’s pre-emptive scope. By its terms, the FRSA—which in-\n    structs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation . . . shall prescribe\n    regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supple-\n    menting laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970,” 49\n    U. S. C. §20103(a)—does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety\n    statutes. Rather, it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the\n    Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supple-\n    mental regulation. Because the LIA was already in effect when the\n    FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope\n    as defined by Napier, intact. P. 6.\n       (e) Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled. In-\n    stead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA’s\n    pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier. Petitioners’ arguments\n    are unpersuasive. First, the argument that the pre-empted field\n    does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or\n    maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier’s holding\n    that Congress, in enacting the LIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to oc-\n    cupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.” 272 U. S.,\n    at 611. Second, the argument that petitioners’ failure-to-warn\n    claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the\n    design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn\n    claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied\n    by sufficient warnings or instructions. Because petitioners’ failure-\n    to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomo-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Third,\n  the argument that petitioners’ claims are not pre-empted because\n  manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was\n  exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the\n  pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not\n  on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation. Finally, con-\n  trary to petitioners’ argument, the LIA’s pre-emptive scope is not lim-\n  ited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-\n  law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive\n  equipment.

S. C. §20701 et seq. The United States Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that petition­\ners’ claims fall within the field pre-empted by that Act, as\nthat field was defined by this Court’s decision in Napier v.\nAtlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605 (1926). We\nagree.\n                             I\n   George Corson was employed as a welder and machinist\nby the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad\nfrom 1947 until 1974. Corson worked in locomotive repair\nand maintenance facilities, where his duties included\ninstalling brakeshoes on locomotives and stripping insula­\ntion from locomotive boilers. In 2005, Corson was diag­\nnosed with malignant mesothelioma.\n   In 2007, Corson and his wife filed suit in Pennsylvania\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate court against 59 defendants, including respondents\nRailroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC) and Viad\nCorp (Viad). According to the complaint, RFPC distribut­\ned locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad\nwas the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac­\ntured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves\ncontaining asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this\nequipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes­\ntos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the\nequipment was defectively designed because it contained\nasbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan­\ngers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its\nsafe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed\naway, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was\nsubstituted as a party. Corson’s widow and the executrix\nare petitioners here.\n   Respondents removed the case to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nand moved for summary judgment. Respondents argued\nthat petitioners’ state-law claims were pre-empted by the\nLIA. The District Court agreed and granted summary\njudgment for respondents. See Kurns v. A. W. Chesterton,\nCiv. Action No. 08–2216 (ED Pa., Feb. 3, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 39a. The Third Circuit affirmed. See Kurns\nv. A. W. Chesterton, Inc., 620 F. 3d 392 (2010). We granted\ncertiorari. 563 U.

The BIA made it unlawful\nto use a steam locomotive “unless the boiler of said loco­\nmotive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition\nand safe to operate . . . without unnecessary peril to life or\nlimb.” Act of Feb. 17, 1911, ch. 103, §2, 36 Stat. 913–914.\nIn 1915, Congress amended the BIA to apply to “the entire\nlocomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

As relevant here, the LIA\nprovides:\n       “A railroad carrier may use or allow to be used\n     a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only\n     when the locomotive or tender and its parts and\n     appurtenances—\n       “(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate\n     without unnecessary danger of personal injury;\n       “(2) have been inspected as required under this\n     chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\n     Transportation under this chapter; and\n       “(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec­\n     retary under this chapter.” 49 U. S. C. §20701.2\n  The issue presented in this case is whether the LIA pre­\nempts petitioners’ state-law claims that respondents\ndefectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn\nCorson of dangers associated with those parts. In light of\nthis Court’s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude\nthat petitioners’ claims are pre-empted.\n                           III\n\n                              \n\n                            A\n\n  The Supremacy Clause provides that federal law “shall\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the\nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not­\nwithstanding.” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Pre-emption of\n\n——————\n  1 A “tender” is a “[a] car attached to a locomotive, for carrying a sup­\n\nply of fuel and water.” Webster’s New International Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 2126 (1917).\n  2 At the time of Corson’s employment, this provision of the LIA was\n\nworded somewhat differently. See 45 U. S. C. §23 (1946 ed.). Petition­\ners do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any\ndifference in this case.\n4           KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law thus occurs through the “direct operation of the\nSupremacy Clause.” Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S.\n491, 501 (1984). Congress may, of course, expressly pre­\nempt state law, but “[e]ven without an express provision\nfor preemption, we have found that state law must yield to\na congressional Act in at least two circumstances.” Crosby\nv. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\n(2000). First, “state law is naturally preempted to the\nextent of any conflict with a federal statute.” Ibid. Se­\ncond, we have deemed state law pre-empted “when the\nscope of a [federal] statute indicates that Congress intend­\ned federal law to occupy a field exclusively.” Freightliner\nCorp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995). We deal here\nonly with the latter, so-called field pre-emption.\n                             B\n  We do not, however, address the LIA’s pre-emptive ef-\nfect on a clean slate, because this Court addressed that\nissue 85 years ago in Napier. In that case, railroads chal­\nlenged two state laws that “prohibit[ed] use within the\nState of locomotives not equipped with” certain prescribed\ndevices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au­\nthority to carry out the LIA’s requirements, had not re­\nquired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In\nresponse, the States argued that their requirements were\nnot pre-empted because they were directed at a different\nobjective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the\nStates, their regulations were intended to protect railroad\nworkers from sickness and disease, whereas “the federal\nregulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in\n\n——————\n    3 Act\n       of Feb. 17, 1911, §6, 36 Stat. 915. That authority has since\nbeen transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. Department of\nTransportation Act, §§6(e)(1)(E) and (F), 80 Stat. 939; see 49 U. S. C.\n§§20701–20702.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe operation of trains.” Ibid.\n   To determine whether the state requirements were pre­\nempted, this Court asked whether the LIA “manifest[s]\nthe intention to occupy the entire field of regulating loco­\nmotive equipment[.]” Id., at 611. The Court answered\nthat question in the affirmative, stating that “[t]he broad\nscope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]” by Con­\ngress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The\npower delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a\n“general one” that “extends to the design, the construction\nand the material of every part of the locomotive and ten­\nder and of all appurtenances.” Id., at 611.\n   The Court rejected the States’ contention that the scope\nof the pre-empted field was to “be determined by the object\nsought through the legislation, rather than the physical\nelements affected by it.” Id., at 612. The Court found it\ndispositive that “[t]he federal and the state statutes are\ndirected to the same subject—the equipment of locomo­\ntives.” Ibid. Because the States’ requirements operated\nupon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court\nheld that the state laws, “however commendable or how­\never different their purpose,” id., at 613, fell within the\nLIA’s pre-empted field.\n                            IV\n   Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two\narguments in support of their position that their state-law\nclaims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip­\nment do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field. Peti­\ntioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the\nscope of the LIA’s pre-empted field because that field has\nbeen narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.\nAlternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not\nfall within the LIA’s pre-empted field, even as that field\nwas defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners’\narguments in turn.\n6       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n    First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad\nSafety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49\nU. S. C. §20102 et seq.), altered the LIA’s pre-emptive\nscope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation\nbroad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See\n§20103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA’s pre-emption\nprovision, which provides in part that “[a] State may adopt\nor continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to\nrailroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation\n. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the\nsubject matter of the State requirement.” §20106(a)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA’s\npre-emption provision supplanted the LIA’s pre-emption of\nthe field, with the result that petitioners’ claims are not\npre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula­\ntion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives\nor locomotive parts.\n    Petitioners’ reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The\nFRSA instructs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation,\nas necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders\nfor every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and\nregulations in effect on October 16, 1970.” §20103(a) (2006\ned.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does\nnot alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.\n“Rather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author­\nizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety\nwith supplemental regulation.” Marshall v. Burlington\nNorthern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152–1153 (CA9 1983)\n(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect\nwhen the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA\nleft the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Na-\npier, intact.\n                            B\n    Since the LIA’s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners must contend with Napier. Petitioners do not\nask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over­\ncome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this\n85-year-old precedent. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.\nSEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting\nthe “special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re­\ngard to questions of statutory interpretation” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance\nseveral arguments aimed at demonstrating that their\nclaims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it\nwas defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.\n                               1\n   Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus\ncuriae, first argue that petitioners’ claims do not fall with­\nin the LIA’s pre-empted field because the claims arise out\nof the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than\nthe use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they\ncontend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA\nis coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government’s\nregulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,\ndoes not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from\nthe repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the\nargument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or\nmaintenance—as opposed to claims arising from use on\nthe line—do not fall within the pre-empted field.\n   We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.\nIn Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the\nLIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field\nof regulating locomotive equipment,” and the Court did\nnot distinguish between hazards arising from repair and\nmaintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the\nline. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined\nby Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.\nPetitioners’ common-law claims for defective design and\nfailure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.\n8      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause those claims “are directed to the same subject” as\nthe LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre­\nempted field. Id., at 612.\n                              2\n  Petitioners further argue that, even if their design­\ndefect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims\ndo not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners\nalleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents\nnegligently failed to warn of the risks associated with\nasbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe­\nguards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestos-\ncontaining products were defective because respondents\nfailed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con­\ncerning the “risks, dangers, and harm inherent in said\nasbestos products.” See App. 20–27 (¶¶7–10, 12), 42 (¶8);\nsee also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,\nthese claims do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field\nbecause “[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is\nnot the ‘design’ or ‘manufacture’ of a product,” but is in­\nstead “the failure to provide adequate warnings regarding\nthe product’s risks.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.\n  We disagree.

Because petition­\ners’ failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the\nequipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted\nfield defined by Napier. 272 U. S., at 612.4\n                               3\n  Petitioners also contend that their state-law claims\nagainst manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts\nfall outside of the LIA’s pre-empted field because manufac­\nturers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that\nCorson was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Petitioners\npoint out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA,\nsubjected only common carriers to civil penalties. Act of\nFeb. 17, 1911, §9, 36 Stat. 916. It was not until 1988, well\nafter the events of this case, that the LIA’s penalty provi­\nsion was revised to apply to “[a]ny person” violating the\nLIA. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, §14(7)(A), 102\nStat. 633; see also §14(7)(B) (amending penalty provision\nto provide that “an act by an individual that causes\na railroad to be in violation . . . shall be deemed a\nviolation”).\n\n\n——————\n   4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR apparently agrees that petitioners’ failure-to­\n\nwarn claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives. Post, at 5\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Yet, she argues,\nthose claims affect locomotive equipment only “ ‘tangentially.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990)). Not\nso. A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of\nlocomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state\nlaw are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of\nliability will inevitably influence a manufacturer’s choice whether to\nuse that particular design. By influencing design decisions in that\nmanner, failure-to-warn liability has a “ ‘direct and substantial effect’ ”\non the “physical elements” of a locomotive. Post, at 5 (quoting English,\nsupra, at 85).\n10     KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  This argument fails for the same reason as the two\npreceding arguments: It is inconsistent with Napier.\nNapier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the\nbasis of the physical elements regulated—“the equipment\nof locomotives”—not on the basis of the entity directly\nsubject to regulation. 272 U. S., at 612. Because petition­\ners’ claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,\nthey fall within the pre-empted field.\n  Petitioners’ proposed rule is also contrary to common\nsense. Under petitioners’ approach, a State could not\nrequire railroads to equip their locomotives with parts\nmeeting state-imposed specifications, but could require\nmanufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts\nmeeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a\nsimilar approach in an express pre-emption context in\nEngine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Manage-\nment Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004). There, a state entity\nargued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of\nvehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions require­\nments were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42\nU. S. C. §7543(a), because the rules in question were\naimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manu­\nfacture or sale. 541 U. S., at 248. We observed, however,\nthat “treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions\ndifferently for pre-emption purposes would make no\nsense,” because the “manufacturer’s right to sell federally\napproved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur­\nchaser’s right to buy them.” Id., at 255. Similarly, a\nrailroad’s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli­\nance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur­\ners are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive\nparts that meet those standards. Petitioners’ claims thus\ndo not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at\nthe manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                4\n    Finally, petitioners contend that the LIA’s pre-emptive\nscope does not extend to state common-law claims, as\nopposed to state legislation or regulation. Petitioners note\nthat “a preempted field does not necessarily include state\ncommon law.” Brief for Petitioners 38–39 (citing Silkwood\nv. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984); Sprietsma v.\nMercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002)). Napier, however,\nheld that the LIA “occup[ied] the entire field of regulating\nlocomotive equipment” to the exclusion of state regulation.\n272 U. S., at 611–612. That categorical conclusion admits\nof no exception for state common-law duties and standards\nof care. As we have recognized, state “regulation can be\n. . . effectively exerted through an award of damages,” and\n“[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is\ndesigned to be, a potent method of governing conduct and\ncontrolling policy.” San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959). Cf. Riegel v. Med-\ntronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 324 (2008) (“Absent other in-\ndication, reference to a State’s ‘requirements’ [in a federal\nexpress pre-emption provision] includes its common-law\nduties”). We therefore conclude that state common-law\nduties and standards of care directed to the subject of\nlocomotive equipment are pre-empted by the LIA.\n                        *   *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that petitioners’\nstate-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims fall\nwithin the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre­\nempted by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605\n(1926), in the same way today. The Napier Court conclud-\ned that Congress had “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy\nthe entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,” based\non nothing more than a statute granting regulatory au-\nthority over that subject matter to a federal agency. Id.,\nat 611. Under our more recent cases, Congress must do\nmuch more to oust all of state law from a field. See, e.g.,\nNew York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S.\n405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Con-\ngress had enacted a “detailed” and “comprehensive” regu-\nlatory scheme). Viewed through the lens of modern\npreemption law, Napier is an anachronism.\n  But Napier governs so long as Congress lets it—and\nthat decision provides a straightforward way to determine\nwhether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are\npreempted. According to Napier, the scope of the agency’s\npower under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) deter-\nmines the boundaries of the preempted field. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nthey fell “within the scope of the authority delegated to the\nCommission”); see also ante, at 5 (the “ ‘broad scope of the\nauthority’ ” given to the agency “led to [Napier’s] conclu-\nsion”); post, at 7–8 (“[T]he pre-empted field is congruent\nwith the regulated field”). And under that test, none of\nthe state-law claims at issue here can survive.\n   All of us agree that the petitioners’ defective-design\nclaims are preempted. Napier recognized the federal\nagency’s delegated authority over “the design, the con-\nstruction and the material of every part of the locomotive.”\n272 U. S., at 611. In doing so, Napier did not distinguish\nbetween “hazards arising from repair and maintenance” of\nthe parts and hazards stemming from their “use on the\nline.” Ante, at 7. The agency thus has authority to regu-\nlate the design of locomotive equipment—like the asbetos-\ncontaining brakeshoes here—to prevent either danger.\nAnd that fact resolves the preemption question. Because\nthe agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as\ndesigned, the petitioners’ defective-design claims—which\nwould effectively accomplish the identical result—fall\nwithin the preempted field.\n   So too the petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims, and for\nthe same reason. Napier did not specifically address\nwarnings, because the case in no way involved them. But\nif an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomo-\ntive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use\nof that equipment on proper warnings. (And that is so,\ncontrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s view, see post, at 8, n. 3,\nwhether the warning is engraved into the part itself or\nposted on the workshop wall.) Here, for example, the\nagency need not have chosen between banning asbestos-\ncontaining brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregu-\nlated. It could instead have required a warning about how\nto handle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would\nhave protected a worker from risk, then the agency could\nhave demanded a notice to that effect. See, e.g., Law v.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The\nagency draws a line not between mandating design changes and man-\ndating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous\nto repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the\nrailroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that\nthe petitioners’ design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted\nfield because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous\nonly their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12–13. The agency’s understanding of its author-\nity therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s position. As the\nagency agrees, the petitioners’ claims must stand or fall together if\nviewed through the lens of the agency’s regulatory authority. In my\nview, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency’s proffered\ndistinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and\nregulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.

Town of Harrison,\n520 U. S. 564, 617 (1997) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). The\n2      KURNS v.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,\n331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such\nindications of Congress’ intent to oust state law, Napier\nimplied field pre-emption from the LIA’s mere delegation\nof regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com­\nmission. Compare 272 U. S., at 612–613, with, e.g., Hills-\nborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,\n471 U. S. 707, 717 (1985), and New York State Dept. of\nSocial Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.

None­\ntheless, Napier’s construction of the LIA has been settled\nlaw for 85 years, and “ ‘[c]onsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation.’ ”\nHilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502\nU. S. 197, 202 (1991).\n  Consistent with the values served by statutory stare\ndecisis, however, it is important to be precise about what\nNapier held: Napier defined the pre-empted field as the\nphysical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (“[T]he power delegated . . . by the [LIA] . . .\nextends to the design, the construction, and the material\nof every part of the locomotive and tender and of all ap­\npurtenances”); id., at 612 (“The federal and the state\nstatutes are directed to the same subject—the equipment\nof locomotives.

See, e.g., Madden, The\nDuty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criti­\ncism, 89 W. Va. L. Rev. 221 (1987) (“Although a product is\nunerringly designed, manufactured and assembled, injury\nor damage occasioned by its intended or reasonably fore­\nseeable use may subject the seller to liability.

Where a manufac­\nturer or seller has reason to anticipate that danger may\nresult from a particular use of his product, and he fails to\ngive adequate warning of such a danger, the product sold\nwithout such warning is in a defective condition within\nthe strict liability doctrine”); Greiner v.

Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565 (2009). Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state\ndamages award based on a drug manufacturer’s failure to\nprovide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intrave­\nnous administration of the drug, but noted that it was\nunnecessary to decide “whether a state rule proscribing\nintravenous administration would be pre-empted.” Ibid.\nCf.

That may be true at a high level of gener-\nality, but “[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims . . . rest on\ndifferent factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.”\nRestatement §2, at 35, Comment n. For example, a manu­\nfacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasona­\nbly unsafe design merely by issuing a warning. See id., at\n33, Comment l (“Warnings are not . . . a substitute for the\nprovision of a reasonably safe design”). In a fundamental\nsense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak­\ning a product’s physical design as a given. A failure-to­\nwarn claim alleges a “defect” by asserting that a product,\nas designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a\nwarning—not that a product must be designed differently.\n   The majority further conflates defective-design and\nfailure-to-warn claims by noting that each is “directed at”\nlocomotive equipment. Ante, at 9. That is insufficient.\nNot every state law that “could be said to affect tangen­\ntially” matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990).\nRather, “for a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone,\nit must have some direct and substantial effect” on the\nprimary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.\nIbid. As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical\nequipment of locomotives. But petitioners’ failure-to-warn\nclaims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the\nphysical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents\nthemselves acknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55\n(petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims “may not themselves\nliterally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive’s\ndesign or construction”).\n   In the majority’s view, a “duty to warn and the accom­\npanying threat of liability will inevitably influence” a\nmanufacturer’s design choices.

Nor does the majority substantiate its\nassertion that the “influence” exerted by a duty to warn\nneed be “inevitabl[e]” or “substantial.” Ante, at 9, n. 4. To\nthe contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty\ncould be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,\nin comparison to the commercial value of retaining an\nexisting design.\n   Respondents could have complied with state-law duties\nto warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance\nof asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man­\nuals. See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine\nManual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at\nhttp://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html        (last\nvisited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Or respondents could have ensured that repair\nshops posted signs. See Restatement §2, at 29–30, Com­\nment i (duty to warn “may require that instructions and\nwarnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and\nconsumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller\nshould know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the\nrisk of harm”); see also, e.g., Patch v.

Neither\nstep would encroach on the pre-empted field of locomo­\ntives’ “physical elements.” Napier, 272 U. S., at 612. The\nmajority is therefore wrong to say that “the ‘gravamen’ of\npetitioners’ failure-to-warn claims ‘is still that [Corson]\nsuffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure\nto asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurte­\nnances.’ ” Ante, at 8–9 (quoting Kurns v. A. W. Chesteron,\nInc., 620 F. 3d 392, 398, n. 8 (CA3 2010)). Rather, the\n“gravamen” of these claims is that petitioners’ decedent\nGeorge Corson could have avoided the harmful conse­\nquences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely\nthe same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him,\nfor example, to wear a mask.\n   Finally, preserving petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims\ncoheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime. Neither the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first\ndelegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail­\nroad Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now\nbelongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte­\nnance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it\nlacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive\nmaintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae in John Crane, Inc. v. Atwell, O. T.\n2010, No. 10–272, p. 10 (“[T]he field covered by the LIA\ndoes not include requirements concerning the repair of\nlocomotives that are not in use”); Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 13 (“The preempted field . . . does not\ninclude tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo­\ntives are not in use”). The FRA has determined that the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,\nbears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ­\ning with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.\n10583–10590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and\nn. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that\n8       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\naddress warnings specific to maintenance and repair.\nBecause the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu­\nlated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,\n112 (2000), the majority’s decision sweeps far too broadly.3\n                        *     *     *\n  In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive\neffect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition­\ners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex­\nposure to asbestos in repair facilities. “It is difficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all\nmeans of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal\nconduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true\nin light of the LIA’s “purpose . . . of facilitating employee\nrecovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it\nimpossible.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).\n  I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 Disagreeing with the agency’s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con­\n\ncludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an\nincident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,\n2–3 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. Such power,\nif it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require­\nments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,\nsupra; 49 CFR §§229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,\nbut it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the\nauthority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See\nNapier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611–612 (1926).\nAnd it is the line that separates petitioners’ design-defect claims from\ntheir claims for failure to warn.\n</pre>", "id": 623843, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/02/29/Kurns_v._Railroad_Friction_Products_Corp.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 9, 2011—Decided February 29, 2012\nGeorge Corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.\n After retirement, Corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He and\n his wife, a petitioner here, sued respondents Railroad Friction Prod-\n ucts Corporation and Viad Corp in state court, claiming injury from\n Corson’s exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts\n distributed by respondents. The Corsons alleged state-law claims of\n defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.\n After Corson died, petitioner Kurns, executrix of his estate, was sub-\n stituted as a party. Respondents removed the case to the Federal\n District Court, which granted them summary judgment, ruling that\n the state-law claims were pre-empted by the Locomotive Inspection\n Act (LIA), 49 U. S. C. §20701 et seq. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners’ state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims\n fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted\n by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line\n R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. Pp. 2−11.\n    (a) The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be\n used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomo-\n tive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition\n and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,\n have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations pre-\n scribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can with-\n stand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary.

National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372, or\n    when the federal statute’s scope indicates that Congress intended\n    federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. My-\n    rick, 514 U. S. 280, 287. This case involves only the latter, so-called\n    “field pre-emption.” Pp. 3–4.\n       (c) In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of\n    locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the\n    broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Com-\n    mission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIA’s\n    requirements) was a “general one” that “extends to the design, the\n    construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and\n    tender and of all appurtenances.” 272 U. S., at 611. The Court re-\n    jected the States’ contention that the scope of the pre-empted field\n    was to “be determined by the object sought through legislation, ra-\n    ther than the physical elements affected by it,” id., at 612, and found\n    it dispositive that “[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the\n    same subject―the equipment of locomotives.” Ibid. Pp. 4−5.\n       (d) The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter\n    the LIA’s pre-emptive scope. By its terms, the FRSA—which in-\n    structs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation . . . shall prescribe\n    regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supple-\n    menting laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970,” 49\n    U. S. C. §20103(a)—does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety\n    statutes. Rather, it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the\n    Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supple-\n    mental regulation. Because the LIA was already in effect when the\n    FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope\n    as defined by Napier, intact. P. 6.\n       (e) Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled. In-\n    stead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA’s\n    pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier. Petitioners’ arguments\n    are unpersuasive. First, the argument that the pre-empted field\n    does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or\n    maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier’s holding\n    that Congress, in enacting the LIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to oc-\n    cupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.” 272 U. S.,\n    at 611. Second, the argument that petitioners’ failure-to-warn\n    claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the\n    design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn\n    claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied\n    by sufficient warnings or instructions. Because petitioners’ failure-\n    to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomo-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Third,\n  the argument that petitioners’ claims are not pre-empted because\n  manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was\n  exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the\n  pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not\n  on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation. Finally, con-\n  trary to petitioners’ argument, the LIA’s pre-emptive scope is not lim-\n  ited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state common-\n  law duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive\n  equipment.

S. C. §20701 et seq. The United States Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that petition­\ners’ claims fall within the field pre-empted by that Act, as\nthat field was defined by this Court’s decision in Napier v.\nAtlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605 (1926). We\nagree.\n                             I\n   George Corson was employed as a welder and machinist\nby the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad\nfrom 1947 until 1974. Corson worked in locomotive repair\nand maintenance facilities, where his duties included\ninstalling brakeshoes on locomotives and stripping insula­\ntion from locomotive boilers. In 2005, Corson was diag­\nnosed with malignant mesothelioma.\n   In 2007, Corson and his wife filed suit in Pennsylvania\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate court against 59 defendants, including respondents\nRailroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC) and Viad\nCorp (Viad). According to the complaint, RFPC distribut­\ned locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad\nwas the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac­\ntured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves\ncontaining asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this\nequipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes­\ntos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the\nequipment was defectively designed because it contained\nasbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan­\ngers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its\nsafe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed\naway, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was\nsubstituted as a party. Corson’s widow and the executrix\nare petitioners here.\n   Respondents removed the case to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\nand moved for summary judgment. Respondents argued\nthat petitioners’ state-law claims were pre-empted by the\nLIA. The District Court agreed and granted summary\njudgment for respondents. See Kurns v. A. W. Chesterton,\nCiv. Action No. 08–2216 (ED Pa., Feb. 3, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 39a. The Third Circuit affirmed. See Kurns\nv. A. W. Chesterton, Inc., 620 F. 3d 392 (2010). We granted\ncertiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  Congress enacted the predecessor to the LIA, the Boiler\nInspection Act (BIA), in 1911. The BIA made it unlawful\nto use a steam locomotive “unless the boiler of said loco­\nmotive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition\nand safe to operate . . . without unnecessary peril to life or\nlimb.” Act of Feb. 17, 1911, ch. 103, §2, 36 Stat. 913–914.\nIn 1915, Congress amended the BIA to apply to “the entire\nlocomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

As relevant here, the LIA\nprovides:\n       “A railroad carrier may use or allow to be used\n     a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only\n     when the locomotive or tender and its parts and\n     appurtenances—\n       “(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate\n     without unnecessary danger of personal injury;\n       “(2) have been inspected as required under this\n     chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\n     Transportation under this chapter; and\n       “(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec­\n     retary under this chapter.” 49 U. S. C. §20701.2\n  The issue presented in this case is whether the LIA pre­\nempts petitioners’ state-law claims that respondents\ndefectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn\nCorson of dangers associated with those parts. In light of\nthis Court’s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude\nthat petitioners’ claims are pre-empted.\n                           III\n\n                              \n\n                            A\n\n  The Supremacy Clause provides that federal law “shall\nbe the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the\nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not­\nwithstanding.” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Pre-emption of\n\n——————\n  1 A “tender” is a “[a] car attached to a locomotive, for carrying a sup­\n\nply of fuel and water.” Webster’s New International Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language 2126 (1917).\n  2 At the time of Corson’s employment, this provision of the LIA was\n\nworded somewhat differently. See 45 U. S. C. §23 (1946 ed.). Petition­\ners do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any\ndifference in this case.\n4           KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law thus occurs through the “direct operation of the\nSupremacy Clause.” Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S.\n491, 501 (1984). Congress may, of course, expressly pre­\nempt state law, but “[e]ven without an express provision\nfor preemption, we have found that state law must yield to\na congressional Act in at least two circumstances.” Crosby\nv. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\n(2000). First, “state law is naturally preempted to the\nextent of any conflict with a federal statute.” Ibid. Se­\ncond, we have deemed state law pre-empted “when the\nscope of a [federal] statute indicates that Congress intend­\ned federal law to occupy a field exclusively.” Freightliner\nCorp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995). We deal here\nonly with the latter, so-called field pre-emption.\n                             B\n  We do not, however, address the LIA’s pre-emptive ef-\nfect on a clean slate, because this Court addressed that\nissue 85 years ago in Napier. In that case, railroads chal­\nlenged two state laws that “prohibit[ed] use within the\nState of locomotives not equipped with” certain prescribed\ndevices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au­\nthority to carry out the LIA’s requirements, had not re­\nquired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In\nresponse, the States argued that their requirements were\nnot pre-empted because they were directed at a different\nobjective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the\nStates, their regulations were intended to protect railroad\nworkers from sickness and disease, whereas “the federal\nregulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in\n\n——————\n    3 Act\n       of Feb. 17, 1911, §6, 36 Stat. 915. That authority has since\nbeen transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. Department of\nTransportation Act, §§6(e)(1)(E) and (F), 80 Stat. 939; see 49 U. S.

The Court answered\nthat question in the affirmative, stating that “[t]he broad\nscope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]” by Con­\ngress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The\npower delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a\n“general one” that “extends to the design, the construction\nand the material of every part of the locomotive and ten­\nder and of all appurtenances.” Id., at 611.\n   The Court rejected the States’ contention that the scope\nof the pre-empted field was to “be determined by the object\nsought through the legislation, rather than the physical\nelements affected by it.” Id., at 612. The Court found it\ndispositive that “[t]he federal and the state statutes are\ndirected to the same subject—the equipment of locomo­\ntives.” Ibid. Because the States’ requirements operated\nupon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court\nheld that the state laws, “however commendable or how­\never different their purpose,” id., at 613, fell within the\nLIA’s pre-empted field.\n                            IV\n   Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two\narguments in support of their position that their state-law\nclaims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip­\nment do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field. Peti­\ntioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the\nscope of the LIA’s pre-empted field because that field has\nbeen narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.\nAlternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not\nfall within the LIA’s pre-empted field, even as that field\nwas defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners’\narguments in turn.\n6       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n    First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad\nSafety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49\nU. S. C. §20102 et seq.), altered the LIA’s pre-emptive\nscope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation\nbroad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See\n§20103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA’s pre-emption\nprovision, which provides in part that “[a] State may adopt\nor continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to\nrailroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation\n. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the\nsubject matter of the State requirement.” §20106(a)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA’s\npre-emption provision supplanted the LIA’s pre-emption of\nthe field, with the result that petitioners’ claims are not\npre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula­\ntion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives\nor locomotive parts.\n    Petitioners’ reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The\nFRSA instructs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation,\nas necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders\nfor every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and\nregulations in effect on October 16, 1970.” §20103(a) (2006\ned.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does\nnot alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.\n“Rather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author­\nizes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety\nwith supplemental regulation.” Marshall v. Burlington\nNorthern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152–1153 (CA9 1983)\n(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect\nwhen the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA\nleft the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Na-\npier, intact.\n                            B\n    Since the LIA’s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Petitioners do not\nask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over­\ncome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this\n85-year-old precedent. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.\nSEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting\nthe “special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re­\ngard to questions of statutory interpretation” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance\nseveral arguments aimed at demonstrating that their\nclaims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it\nwas defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.\n                               1\n   Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus\ncuriae, first argue that petitioners’ claims do not fall with­\nin the LIA’s pre-empted field because the claims arise out\nof the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than\nthe use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they\ncontend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA\nis coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government’s\nregulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,\ndoes not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from\nthe repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the\nargument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or\nmaintenance—as opposed to claims arising from use on\nthe line—do not fall within the pre-empted field.\n   We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.\nIn Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the\nLIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field\nof regulating locomotive equipment,” and the Court did\nnot distinguish between hazards arising from repair and\nmaintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the\nline. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined\nby Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.\nPetitioners’ common-law claims for defective design and\nfailure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.\n8      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBecause those claims “are directed to the same subject” as\nthe LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre­\nempted field. Id., at 612.\n                              2\n  Petitioners further argue that, even if their design­\ndefect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims\ndo not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners\nalleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents\nnegligently failed to warn of the risks associated with\nasbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe­\nguards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestos-\ncontaining products were defective because respondents\nfailed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con­\ncerning the “risks, dangers, and harm inherent in said\nasbestos products.” See App. 20–27 (¶¶7–10, 12), 42 (¶8);\nsee also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,\nthese claims do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field\nbecause “[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is\nnot the ‘design’ or ‘manufacture’ of a product,” but is in­\nstead “the failure to provide adequate warnings regarding\nthe product’s risks.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.\n  We disagree. A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the\nproduct itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied\nby sufficient warnings or instructions.         Restatement\n(Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2(c) (1997) (A failure­\nto-warn claim alleges that a product is defective “when the\nforeseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have\nbeen reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable\ninstructions or warnings by the seller or other distribu­\ntor, . . . and the omission of the instructions or warnings\nrenders the product not reasonably safe”); see also id.,\nComment l, at 33 (“Reasonable designs and instructions\nor warnings both play important roles in the production\nand distribution of reasonably safe products”). Thus, the\n“gravamen” of petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims “is still\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

Because petition­\ners’ failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the\nequipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted\nfield defined by Napier. 272 U. S., at 612.4\n                               3\n  Petitioners also contend that their state-law claims\nagainst manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts\nfall outside of the LIA’s pre-empted field because manufac­\nturers were not regulated under the LIA at the time that\nCorson was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Petitioners\npoint out that the LIA, as originally enacted in the BIA,\nsubjected only common carriers to civil penalties. Act of\nFeb. 17, 1911, §9, 36 Stat. 916. It was not until 1988, well\nafter the events of this case, that the LIA’s penalty provi­\nsion was revised to apply to “[a]ny person” violating the\nLIA. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, §14(7)(A), 102\nStat. 633; see also §14(7)(B) (amending penalty provision\nto provide that “an act by an individual that causes\na railroad to be in violation . . . shall be deemed a\nviolation”).\n\n\n——————\n   4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR apparently agrees that petitioners’ failure-to­\n\nwarn claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives. Post, at 5\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Yet, she argues,\nthose claims affect locomotive equipment only “ ‘tangentially.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990)). Not\nso. A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of\nlocomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state\nlaw are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of\nliability will inevitably influence a manufacturer’s choice whether to\nuse that particular design. By influencing design decisions in that\nmanner, failure-to-warn liability has a “ ‘direct and substantial effect’ ”\non the “physical elements” of a locomotive. Post, at 5 (quoting English,\nsupra, at 85).\n10     KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  This argument fails for the same reason as the two\npreceding arguments: It is inconsistent with Napier.\nNapier defined the field pre-empted by the LIA on the\nbasis of the physical elements regulated—“the equipment\nof locomotives”—not on the basis of the entity directly\nsubject to regulation. 272 U. S., at 612. Because petition­\ners’ claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,\nthey fall within the pre-empted field.\n  Petitioners’ proposed rule is also contrary to common\nsense. Under petitioners’ approach, a State could not\nrequire railroads to equip their locomotives with parts\nmeeting state-imposed specifications, but could require\nmanufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts\nmeeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a\nsimilar approach in an express pre-emption context in\nEngine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Manage-\nment Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004). There, a state entity\nargued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of\nvehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions require­\nments were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42\nU. S. C. §7543(a), because the rules in question were\naimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manu­\nfacture or sale. 541 U. S., at 248. We observed, however,\nthat “treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions\ndifferently for pre-emption purposes would make no\nsense,” because the “manufacturer’s right to sell federally\napproved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur­\nchaser’s right to buy them.” Id., at 255. Similarly, a\nrailroad’s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli­\nance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur­\ners are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive\nparts that meet those standards. Petitioners’ claims thus\ndo not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at\nthe manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                4\n    Finally, petitioners contend that the LIA’s pre-emptive\nscope does not extend to state common-law claims, as\nopposed to state legislation or regulation. Petitioners note\nthat “a preempted field does not necessarily include state\ncommon law.” Brief for Petitioners 38–39 (citing Silkwood\nv. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238 (1984); Sprietsma v.\nMercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002)). Napier, however,\nheld that the LIA “occup[ied] the entire field of regulating\nlocomotive equipment” to the exclusion of state regulation.\n272 U. S., at 611–612. That categorical conclusion admits\nof no exception for state common-law duties and standards\nof care. As we have recognized, state “regulation can be\n. . . effectively exerted through an award of damages,” and\n“[t]he obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is\ndesigned to be, a potent method of governing conduct and\ncontrolling policy.” San Diego Building Trades Council v.\nGarmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959). Cf. Riegel v. Med-\ntronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 324 (2008) (“Absent other in-\ndication, reference to a State’s ‘requirements’ [in a federal\nexpress pre-emption provision] includes its common-law\nduties”). We therefore conclude that state common-law\nduties and standards of care directed to the subject of\nlocomotive equipment are pre-empted by the LIA.\n                        *   *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that petitioners’\nstate-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims fall\nwithin the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre­\nempted by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605\n(1926), in the same way today. The Napier Court conclud-\ned that Congress had “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy\nthe entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,” based\non nothing more than a statute granting regulatory au-\nthority over that subject matter to a federal agency. Id.,\nat 611. Under our more recent cases, Congress must do\nmuch more to oust all of state law from a field. See, e.g.,\nNew York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S.\n405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Con-\ngress had enacted a “detailed” and “comprehensive” regu-\nlatory scheme). Viewed through the lens of modern\npreemption law, Napier is an anachronism.\n  But Napier governs so long as Congress lets it—and\nthat decision provides a straightforward way to determine\nwhether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are\npreempted. According to Napier, the scope of the agency’s\npower under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) deter-\nmines the boundaries of the preempted field. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because\n2      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nthey fell “within the scope of the authority delegated to the\nCommission”); see also ante, at 5 (the “ ‘broad scope of the\nauthority’ ” given to the agency “led to [Napier’s] conclu-\nsion”); post, at 7–8 (“[T]he pre-empted field is congruent\nwith the regulated field”). And under that test, none of\nthe state-law claims at issue here can survive.\n   All of us agree that the petitioners’ defective-design\nclaims are preempted. Napier recognized the federal\nagency’s delegated authority over “the design, the con-\nstruction and the material of every part of the locomotive.”\n272 U. S., at 611. In doing so, Napier did not distinguish\nbetween “hazards arising from repair and maintenance” of\nthe parts and hazards stemming from their “use on the\nline.” Ante, at 7. The agency thus has authority to regu-\nlate the design of locomotive equipment—like the asbetos-\ncontaining brakeshoes here—to prevent either danger.\nAnd that fact resolves the preemption question. Because\nthe agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as\ndesigned, the petitioners’ defective-design claims—which\nwould effectively accomplish the identical result—fall\nwithin the preempted field.\n   So too the petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims, and for\nthe same reason. Napier did not specifically address\nwarnings, because the case in no way involved them. But\nif an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomo-\ntive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use\nof that equipment on proper warnings. (And that is so,\ncontrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s view, see post, at 8, n. 3,\nwhether the warning is engraved into the part itself or\nposted on the workshop wall.) Here, for example, the\nagency need not have chosen between banning asbestos-\ncontaining brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregu-\nlated. It could instead have required a warning about how\nto handle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would\nhave protected a worker from risk, then the agency could\nhave demanded a notice to that effect. See, e.g., Law v.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nGeneral Motors Corp., 114 F. 3d 908, 911 (CA9 1997) (“As\nfor warning requirements, these too are within the scope\nof the [agency’s] authority”); Scheiding v. General Motors\nCorp., 22 Cal. 4th 471, 484, 993 P. 2d 996, 1004 (2000)\n(same).* And because the agency could have required\nwarnings about the equipment’s use, the petitioners’\nfailure-to-warn claims, no less than their defective-design\nclaims, are preempted under Napier.\n  I understand these views to comport with the Court’s\nopinion in this case, and I accordingly join it in full.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that “preserving petitioners’ failure-to-\nwarn claims coheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime” because the\nagency disclaims authority over locomotive repair and maintenance.\nPost, at 7. But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The\nagency draws a line not between mandating design changes and man-\ndating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous\nto repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the\nrailroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that\nthe petitioners’ design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted\nfield because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous\nonly their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12–13. The agency’s understanding of its author-\nity therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s position. As the\nagency agrees, the petitioners’ claims must stand or fall together if\nviewed through the lens of the agency’s regulatory authority. In my\nview, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency’s proffered\ndistinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and\nregulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,\n331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). Instead of relying on such\nindications of Congress’ intent to oust state law, Napier\nimplied field pre-emption from the LIA’s mere delegation\nof regulatory authority to the Interstate Commerce Com­\nmission. Compare 272 U. S., at 612–613, with, e.g., Hills-\nborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,\n471 U. S. 707, 717 (1985), and New York State Dept. of\nSocial Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.

None­\ntheless, Napier’s construction of the LIA has been settled\nlaw for 85 years, and “ ‘[c]onsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation.’ ”\nHilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502\nU. S. 197, 202 (1991).\n  Consistent with the values served by statutory stare\ndecisis, however, it is important to be precise about what\nNapier held: Napier defined the pre-empted field as the\nphysical composition of locomotive equipment. See 272\nU. S., at 611 (“[T]he power delegated . . . by the [LIA] . . .\nextends to the design, the construction, and the material\nof every part of the locomotive and tender and of all ap­\npurtenances”); id., at 612 (“The federal and the state\nstatutes are directed to the same subject—the equipment\nof locomotives.

See, e.g., Madden, The\nDuty To Warn in Products Liability: Contours and Criti­\ncism, 89 W. Va. L. Rev. 221 (1987) (“Although a product is\nunerringly designed, manufactured and assembled, injury\nor damage occasioned by its intended or reasonably fore­\nseeable use may subject the seller to liability.

Volkswagenwerk\nAktiengeselleschaft, 540 F. 2d 85, 92–93 (CA3 1976) (find­\ning that “failure to adequately warn of inherent or latent\nlimitations in a product, which do not necessarily amount\nto a design defect” is “an independent basis of liability”\nunder Pennsylvania law).2\n   Similarly, this Court has explained that a failure-to­\nwarn claim is “narrower” than a claim that alleges a defect\nin the underlying product. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565 (2009). Thus in Wyeth, this Court affirmed a state\ndamages award based on a drug manufacturer’s failure to\nprovide sufficient warnings to clinicians against intrave­\nnous administration of the drug, but noted that it was\nunnecessary to decide “whether a state rule proscribing\nintravenous administration would be pre-empted.” Ibid.\nCf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 444\n(2005) (“Rules that require manufacturers to design rea­\nsonably safe products . . . plainly do not qualify as re­\nquirements for ‘labeling or packaging.’ None of these\ncommon-law rules requires that manufacturers label or\npackage their products in any particular way”).\n   The majority treats defective-design and failure-to-warn\nclaims as congruent, reasoning that each asserts a product\ndefect. See ante, at 8–9 (citing Restatement §2(c) and\n——————\n  2 Petitioners brought suit in Pennsylvania, but alleged that their\n\ndecedent, George Corson, was exposed to asbestos at railroad mainte­\nnance and repair shops in Montana and South Dakota. Id., at 42, ¶¶6–\n7. Because the District Court granted summary judgment on the issue\nof pre-emption, it performed no choice-of-law analysis to identify the\napplicable substantive state law. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a–39a.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nComment l). That may be true at a high level of gener-\nality, but “[d]esign and failure-to-warn claims . . . rest on\ndifferent factual allegations and distinct legal concepts.”\nRestatement §2, at 35, Comment n. For example, a manu­\nfacturer or seller cannot escape liability for an unreasona­\nbly unsafe design merely by issuing a warning. See id., at\n33, Comment l (“Warnings are not . . . a substitute for the\nprovision of a reasonably safe design”). In a fundamental\nsense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak­\ning a product’s physical design as a given. A failure-to­\nwarn claim alleges a “defect” by asserting that a product,\nas designed, is safe for use only when accompanied by a\nwarning—not that a product must be designed differently.\n   The majority further conflates defective-design and\nfailure-to-warn claims by noting that each is “directed at”\nlocomotive equipment. Ante, at 9. That is insufficient.\nNot every state law that “could be said to affect tangen­\ntially” matters within the regulated field is pre-empted.\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 85 (1990).\nRather, “for a state law to fall within the pre-empted zone,\nit must have some direct and substantial effect” on the\nprimary conduct of entities subject to federal regulation.\nIbid. As explained above, the LIA regulates the physical\nequipment of locomotives. But petitioners’ failure-to-warn\nclaims, if successful, would have no necessary effect on the\nphysical equipment of locomotives at all, as respondents\nthemselves acknowledge. See Brief for Respondents 55\n(petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims “may not themselves\nliterally mandate physical alteration of the locomotive’s\ndesign or construction”).\n   In the majority’s view, a “duty to warn and the accom­\npanying threat of liability will inevitably influence” a\nmanufacturer’s design choices. Ante, at 9, n. 4. But an\n“influence” is not the same as an “effect,” and not every\nstate law with some imaginable impact on matters within\na federally regulated field is, for that reason alone, pre­\n6      KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nempted. See English, 496 U. S., at 85–86; Silkwood v.\nKerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984). Indeed, the\nmajority elides the distinction between indirect and direct\nregulation, even though this Court has explained that\nthe two are not equivalent for pre-emption purposes. See\nGoodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 186 (1988)\n(“Congress may reasonably determine that incidental reg-\nulatory pressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory\nauthority is not”). State wage-and-hour laws, work-\nplace safety standards, or tax credits for green technology,\nfor example, could all “influence” the means and materials\nof locomotive equipment manufacture without imposing\ndirect obligations. Nor does the majority substantiate its\nassertion that the “influence” exerted by a duty to warn\nneed be “inevitabl[e]” or “substantial.” Ante, at 9, n. 4. To\nthe contrary, the requirements imposed by such a duty\ncould be light, and the corresponding liability negligible,\nin comparison to the commercial value of retaining an\nexisting design.\n   Respondents could have complied with state-law duties\nto warn by providing instructions for the safe maintenance\nof asbestos-containing locomotive parts in equipment man­\nuals. See, e.g., Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., Engine\nManual for 600 Series Diesel Engines (1951), online at\nhttp://www.rr-fallenflags.org/manual/blh-6em.html        (last\nvisited Feb. 27, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Or respondents could have ensured that repair\nshops posted signs. See Restatement §2, at 29–30, Com­\nment i (duty to warn “may require that instructions and\nwarnings be given not only to purchasers, users, and\nconsumers, but also to others who a reasonable seller\nshould know will be in a position to reduce or avoid the\nrisk of harm”); see also, e.g., Patch v. Hillerich & Bradsby\nCo., 361 Mont. 241, 246, 257 P. 3d 383, 388 (2011) (“While\nplacing a warning directly on a product is one method of\nwarning, other methods of warning exist, including, but\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nnot limited to, issuing oral warnings and placing warnings\nin advertisements, posters, and media releases”). Neither\nstep would encroach on the pre-empted field of locomo­\ntives’ “physical elements.” Napier, 272 U. S., at 612. The\nmajority is therefore wrong to say that “the ‘gravamen’ of\npetitioners’ failure-to-warn claims ‘is still that [Corson]\nsuffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure\nto asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurte­\nnances.’ ” Ante, at 8–9 (quoting Kurns v. A. W. Chesteron,\nInc., 620 F. 3d 392, 398, n. 8 (CA3 2010)). Rather, the\n“gravamen” of these claims is that petitioners’ decedent\nGeorge Corson could have avoided the harmful conse­\nquences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely\nthe same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him,\nfor example, to wear a mask.\n   Finally, preserving petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims\ncoheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime. Neither the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first\ndelegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail­\nroad Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now\nbelongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte­\nnance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it\nlacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive\nmaintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae in John Crane, Inc. v. Atwell, O. T.\n2010, No. 10–272, p. 10 (“[T]he field covered by the LIA\ndoes not include requirements concerning the repair of\nlocomotives that are not in use”); Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 13 (“The preempted field . . . does not\ninclude tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo­\ntives are not in use”). The FRA has determined that the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,\nbears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ­\ning with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.\n10583–10590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and\nn. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that\n8       KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\naddress warnings specific to maintenance and repair.\nBecause the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu­\nlated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,\n112 (2000), the majority’s decision sweeps far too broadly.3\n                        *     *     *\n  In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive\neffect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition­\ners without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex­\nposure to asbestos in repair facilities. “It is difficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all\nmeans of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal\nconduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true\nin light of the LIA’s “purpose . . . of facilitating employee\nrecovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it\nimpossible.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).\n  I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 Disagreeing with the agency’s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con­\n\ncludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an\nincident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,\n2–3 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. Such power,\nif it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require­\nments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,\nsupra; 49 CFR §§229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,\nbut it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the\nauthority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See\nNapier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611–612 (1926).\nAnd it is the line that separates petitioners’ design-defect claims from\ntheir claims for failure to warn.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/623843/", "sha1": "619aad75a21dfba2a274765109e5b2f0bd8f9d9d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-02-29T17:00:05"}
