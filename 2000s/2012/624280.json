CLAIR\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–1265. Argued December 6, 2011—Decided March 5, 2012\nRespondent Clair was charged with capital murder for the 1984 slaying\n  of Linda Rodgers. The main evidence at his trial in California state\n  court came from statements Clair made to his former girlfriend in a\n  conversation that she secretly recorded for the police. He was con-\n  victed and sentenced to death, and his verdict was upheld on direct\n  review.\n     In 1994, Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a\n  request for appointment of counsel, which the District Court granted\n  under 18 U. S. C. §3599. That statute entitles indigent capital habe-\n  as petitioners like Clair to appointed counsel. It also contemplates\n  that appointed counsel may be “replaced . . . upon motion of the de-\n  fendant,” §3599(e), but it does not specify a standard for district\n  courts to use in evaluating those motions. Clair’s counsel filed his in-\n  itial habeas petition in 1994, and in the late 1990’s, when two associ-\n  ates from the firm representing Clair moved to the Office of the Fed-\n  eral Public Defender (FPD), the FPD was substituted as counsel of\n  record. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Clair’s ha-\n  beas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted their post-\n  hearing briefs by February 2005. The court subsequently told the\n  parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the peti-\n  tion. In March, Clair moved to substitute counsel, claiming that his\n  attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, not to\n  prove his innocence. After the court asked the parties to address the\n  motion, Clair’s counsel informed it that they had met with Clair and\n  that he wanted the FPD to continue representing him. The court ac-\n  cordingly decided that it would take no action. Six weeks later, how-\n  ever, Clair filed another substitution motion, adding one more charge\n  to his earlier claims: that his private investigator had discovered that\n2                            MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully\n    tested, but that Clair’s attorneys had done nothing to analyze this ev-\n    idence or follow up on its discovery. The court denied the renewed\n    motion without further inquiry. On the same day, it also denied\n    Clair’s habeas petition.\n       Clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se, and the FPD\n    appealed the habeas ruling. The Ninth Circuit asked the FPD to ad-\n    dress whether substitution was now warranted, and after the FPD\n    informed the court that the attorney-client relationship had broken\n    down, the court provided Clair with a new lawyer. Clair then asked\n    the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under\n    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be al-\n    lowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his\n    case. The District Court rejected his request, and Clair appealed.\n    Consolidating his appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District\n    Court’s denial of both his substitution request and his habeas peti-\n    tion. Holding that the “interests of justice” standard used in non-\n    capital cases, see 18 U. S. C. §3006A, should govern substitution mo-\n    tions like Clair’s, it ruled that the District Court abused its discretion\n    by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clair’s second letter. Be-\n    cause Clair had already received new counsel on appeal, the court de-\n    cided the best remedy was to treat Clair’s new counsel as though he\n    had been appointed in June 2005 and to allow him to make whatever\n    submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend\n    Clair’s habeas petition in light of new evidence.\nHeld:\n    1. When evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases\n under 18 U. S. C. §3599, courts should employ the same “interests of\n justice” standard that applies in non-capital cases under §3006A.\n Pp. 6–12.\n       (a) Although §3599 guarantees that indigent capital defendants\n and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will re-\n ceive the assistance of counsel, see, e.g., §§3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e), and\n contemplates that an appointed attorney may be “replaced by simi-\n larly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s own motion or upon mo-\n tion of the defendant,” §3599(e), the statute fails to specify how a\n court should decide such a motion. Clair argues, and the Ninth Cir-\n cuit agreed, that district courts should use the “in the interests of\n justice” standard of §3006A, which governs the appointment and sub-\n stitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation. By contrast, the\n State contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when\n the defendant has suffered an “actual or constructive denial” of coun-\n sel—that is, when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifica-\n tions, has a conflict of interest, or has completely abandoned the\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclient.\n   The Court adopts Clair’s approach, based on the history of §3599.\nBefore 1988, §3006A governed both capital and non-capital cases, au-\nthorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and\nproviding that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel,\nsubstitution motions should be decided “in the interests of justice.”\n§3006A(c). Thus, a court in those days would have used that stand-\nard to evaluate a request like Clair’s. In 1988, Congress enacted\nwhat is now §3599, thus displacing §3006A for persons facing execu-\ntion. The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital\nhabeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation. Habeas peti-\ntioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, see\n§3599(a)(2), and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the\nquality of their representation: it provides them with more experi-\nenced counsel than §3006A demands, authorizes higher rates of com-\npensation, and provides more money for investigative and expert\nservices. These measures “reflec[t] a determination that quality legal\nrepresentation is necessary” in all capital proceedings to foster “fun-\ndamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.” McFar-\nland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 855, 859. Given this context, the Court\ncannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution\nstandard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital\npunishment to substitute counsel. Adopting a more stringent test\nthan §3006A’s would deprive capital defendants of a tool they former-\nly had, and non-capital defendants still have, to handle serious rep-\nresentational problems. By contrast, utilizing §3006A’s standard\ncomports with the myriad ways that §3599 seeks to promote effective\nrepresentation for persons facing capital punishment. Pp. 6–9.\n     (b) The dearth of support for the State’s alternative standard re-\ninforces this conclusion. The State concedes that Congress has not\nconsidered its standard in any context; neither has a federal court\nused it in any case. The Court prefers to use a familiar standard, al-\nready known to work, than to try out a new one. Moreover, the\nState’s proposed test would gut §3599’s substitution provision, be-\ncause even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to\nensure that the defendant’s statutory right to counsel was satisfied\nthroughout the litigation. The State counters that only its approach\ncomports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no\nSixth Amendment right to counsel. But Congress declined to track\nthat Amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both\n§3006A and §3599. Thus, the scope of the Amendment cannot an-\nswer the statutory question presented here. The State also contends\nthat the “interests of justice” standard will permit substitution mo-\ntions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sen-\n4                           MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tence. But the “interests of justice” standard takes into account\n    whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay. Pp. 9–12.\n       2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clair’s\n    second request for new counsel under §3599’s “interests of justice”\n    standard. In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals\n    have pointed to several relevant considerations, including: the time-\n    liness of the motion; the adequacy of the district court’s inquiry into\n    the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\n    including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\n    between lawyer and client. Because a trial court’s decision on substi-\n    tution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference and may be overturned\n    only for an abuse of discretion.\n       Here, the District Court received Clair’s second substitution motion\n    on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition. Just three\n    months earlier, Clair had written the court to complain about his at-\n    torneys. After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair\n    and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to\n    ruling on Clair’s habeas petition, only to receive a second letter six\n    weeks later. In it Clair maintained his general assertion that his\n    lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, but he also alleged a\n    new and significant charge of attorney error: that counsel had re-\n    fused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.\n    Such a charge normally would require the court to make further in-\n    quiry; a district court cannot usually rule on a substitution motion\n    without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel. But here, the\n    motion’s timing precludes a holding that the District Court abused its\n    discretion. The court received the letter while putting the finishing\n    touches on its denial of Clair’s habeas petition. After years of litiga-\n    tion, an evidentiary hearing, and post-hearing briefing, the court had\n    instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.\n    All proceedings had therefore come to a close, and a new attorney\n    could have done nothing further in the District Court. In those cir-\n    cumstances, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying\n    Clair’s substitution motion. Pp. 13–16.\n403 Fed.

The statute con-\ntemplates that appointed counsel may be “replaced . . .\nupon motion of the defendant,” §3599(e), but it does not\nspecify the standard that district courts should use in\nevaluating those motions. We hold that courts should\nemploy the same “interests of justice” standard that they\napply in non-capital cases under a related statute, §3006A\nof Title 18. We also hold that the District Court here did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying respondent Kenneth\nClair’s motion to change counsel.\n                              I\n  This case arises from the murder of Linda Rodgers in\n1984. Rodgers resided at the home of Kai Henriksen and\nMargaret Hessling in Santa Ana, California. Clair was a\nsquatter in a vacant house next door. About a week prior\nto the murder, police officers arrested Clair for burglariz-\ning the Henriksen-Hessling home, relying on information\nHenriksen had provided. On the night the police released\n2                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClair from custody, Hessling returned from an evening out\nto find Rodgers’ dead body in the master bedroom, naked\nfrom the waist down and beaten, stabbed, and strangled.\nSome jewelry and household items were missing from the\nhouse. See People v. Clair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171441\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171441/people-v-clair/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644–647, 828\nP. 2d 705, 713–714 (1992); App. to Pet. for Cert. 23–24.\n   The district attorney charged Clair with Rodgers’ mur-\nder and sought the death penalty. No forensic evidence\nlinked Clair to the crime; instead, the main evidence\nagainst Clair came from his former girlfriend, Pauline\nFlores. Although she later recanted her testimony, see\nApp. 36–42, Flores stated at trial that she and Clair were\nwalking in the neighborhood on the night of the murder\nand split up near the Henriksen-Hessling house. When\nthey reunited about an hour later, Flores recounted, Clair\nwas carrying jewelry and other items and had blood on his\nright hand. According to Flores, Clair explained to her\nthat he had “just finished beating up a woman.” Clair, 2\nCal. 4th, at 647, 828 P. 2d, at 714. The prosecution then\nintroduced a tape recording of a talk between Flores and\nClair several months after the murder, which Flores had\nmade in cooperation with the police. On that tape, Clair\nat one point denied committing the murder, but also made\nseveral inculpatory statements. For example, when Flores\ntold Clair that she had seen blood on him, he replied “Ain’t\non me no more” and “They can’t prove nothing.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). And\nin response to her continued probing, Clair explained\n“[W]hat you fail to realize, how . . . they gonna prove I was\nthere . . . ? There ain’t no . . . fingerprints, ain’t no . . .\nbody seen me go in there and leave out there.” Id., at 53–\n54 (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury convicted\nClair and sentenced him to death. The California Su-\npreme Court upheld the verdict, and this Court denied\nreview, Clair v. California, 506 U. S. 1063 (1993).\n   Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest for appointment of counsel, which the District\nCourt granted under §3599. Clair and his counsel filed an\ninitial petition for habeas relief in 1994 and, after exhaust-\ning state remedies, an amended petition the following\nyear. The petition alleged more than 40 claims, involving\nsuch matters as jury selection and composition, sufficiency\nof the evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, nondisclosure\nof exculpatory materials relating to state witnesses, and\nineffectiveness of trial counsel. In the late 1990’s, two\nassociates from the firm representing Clair took jobs at\nthe Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), and the\ncourt substituted that office as counsel of record. The\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on Clair’s habeas peti-\ntion in August 2004, and the parties submitted post-\nhearing briefs by February 2005. The court subsequently\ninformed the parties that it viewed the briefing “to be\ncomplete and d[id] not wish to receive any additional\nmaterial” about the petition. App. 3–4.\n   On March 16, 2005, Clair sent a letter to the court\nstating that the FPD attorneys “no longer . . . ha[d] [his]\nbest interest at hand” and that he did not want them to\ncontinue to represent him. Id., at 24; see id., at 18–25.\nClair alleged that the lawyers had repeatedly dismissed\nhis efforts to participate in his own defense. Prior to the\nevidentiary hearing, Clair wrote, he had become so frus-\ntrated with the attorneys that he enlisted a private detec-\ntive to look into his case. But the lawyers, Clair charged,\nrefused to cooperate with the investigator; they were\nseeking only to overturn his death sentence, rather than to\nprove his innocence. As a result, Clair felt that he and his\ncounsel were not “on the same team.” Id., at 23.\n   The District Court responded by asking both parties to\naddress Clair’s motion to substitute counsel. See id., at\n18. The State noted that “[w]hat the trial court does with\nrespect to appointing counsel is within its discretion,\nproviding the interests of justice are served.” Id., at 29.\n4                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State further advised the court that “nothing in\n[Clair’s] letter require[d] a change” of counsel because the\nFPD lawyers had provided appropriate representation and\nsubstitution would delay the case. Ibid. Clair replied to\nthe court’s request through his FPD attorneys on April 26,\n2005. Their letter stated: “After meeting with Mr. Clair,\ncounsel understands that Mr. Clair wants the [FPD] to\ncontinue to serve as his counsel in this case at this time.”\nId., at 27. On the basis of that representation, the court\ndetermined that it would “take no further action on the\nmatter at this time.” Id., at 33.\n   But the issue resurfaced just six weeks after the court’s\ndecision. On June 16, 2005, Clair wrote a second letter to\nthe court asking for substitution of counsel. That letter\nagain asserted a “total break down of communication”\nbetween Clair and the FPD; according to Clair, he was “no\nlonger able to trust anybody within that office.” Id., at 62–\n63. In explaining the source of the problem, Clair reiter-\nated each of the points made in his prior complaint. And\nthen he added one more. Clair recounted that his private\ninvestigator had recently learned that the police and dis-\ntrict attorney’s office were in possession of fingerprints\nand other physical evidence from the crime scene that had\nnever been fully tested. The FPD lawyers, Clair asserted,\nwere doing nothing to analyze this evidence or otherwise\nfollow up on its discovery. Clair attributed this failure,\ntoo, to the FPD’s decision to focus on his sentence, rather\nthan on questions of guilt.\n   Two weeks later, the District Court denied Clair’s re-\nnewed request for substitution without further inquiry.\nThe court stated: “It does not appear to the Court that a\nchange of counsel is appropriate. It appears that [Clair’s]\ncounsel is doing a proper job. No conflict of interest or\ninadequacy of counsel is shown.” Id., at 61. On the same\nday, the court denied Clair’s habeas petition in a detailed\nopinion. Clair v. Brown, Case No. CV 93–1133 GLT (CD\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit instructed the FPD to address whether substitu-\ntion of counsel was now warranted, and in October 2005,\nthe FPD informed the court that “the attorney-client\nrelationship ha[d] broken down to such an extent that sub-\nstitution of counsel [would be] appropriate.” Attorney\nfor Appellant’s Response to Court’s Sept. 15, 2005 Order,\nin No. 05–99005 (CA9), Record, Doc. 9, p. 1. The State did\nnot comment or object, and the Court of Appeals provided\nClair with a new lawyer going forward. Clair then asked\nthe District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas peti-\ntion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing\nthat he should be allowed to explore the significance of\nthe new physical evidence for his case. The District Court\n(with a new judge assigned, because the judge previously\nhandling the case had retired) rejected that request on the\nground that the new evidence did not pertain to any of the\nclaims presented in Clair’s habeas petition. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 9–10. Clair appealed that decision as well.1\n   After consolidating Clair’s appeals, the Ninth Circuit\nvacated the trial court’s denial of both Clair’s request for\nnew counsel and his habeas petition. See Clair v. Ayers,\n403 Fed. Appx. 276 (2010). The Court of Appeals’ opinion\nfocused on Clair’s substitution motion. Holding that the\n“interests of justice” standard should apply to that motion,\n——————\n  1 While  litigating his Rule 60(b) motion in the District Court, Clair\nalso pursued discovery in the California state courts relating to the\nnewly found physical evidence. On the basis of material he obtained,\nClair filed another petition for state habeas relief, alleging (among\nother claims) actual innocence and improper suppression of exculpatory\nmaterial under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The California\nSupreme Court summarily denied that petition. See In re Clair, No.\nS169188 (Aug. 24, 2011).\n6                        MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in\nClair’s second letter. See id., at 278. The Court of Ap-\npeals then considered how to remedy that error, given that\nClair had received new counsel while on appeal. It decid-\ned that “the most reasonable solution” was to “treat Clair’s\ncurrent counsel as if he were the counsel who might have\nbeen appointed” in June 2005, and to allow him to make\nwhatever submissions he would have made then, includ-\ning a motion to amend Clair’s habeas petition in light of\nnew evidence. Id., at 279.\n  We granted certiorari to review this judgment, 564 U. S.\n__ (2011), and now reverse.\n                             II\n   We first consider the standard that district courts\nshould use to adjudicate federal habeas petitioners’ mo-\ntions to substitute counsel in capital cases. The question\narises because the relevant statute, 18 U. S. C. §3599,\ncontains a notable gap. Section 3599 first guarantees that\nindigent defendants in federal capital cases will receive\nthe assistance of counsel, from pretrial proceedings\nthrough stay applications. See §§3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e). It\nnext grants a corresponding right to people like Clair who\nseek federal habeas relief from a state death sentence, for\nall post-conviction proceedings and related activities. See\n§§3599(a)(2), (e); McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 854–\n855 (1994); Harbison v. Bell, 556 U. S. 180, 183–185\n(2009). And the statute contemplates that both sets of\nlitigants may sometimes substitute counsel; it notes that\nan attorney appointed under the section may be “replaced\nby similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s own\nmotion or upon motion of the defendant.” §3599(e).2 But\n——————\n    2 Section\n          3599(e) provides in full:\n  “Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s\nown motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appoint-\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhere lies the rub: The statute fails to specify how a court\nshould decide such a motion. Section 3599 says not a word\nabout the standard a court should apply when addressing\na request for a new lawyer.\n   The parties offer us two alternative ways to fill this\nstatutory hole. Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit\nagreed, that district courts should decide substitution\nmotions brought under §3599 “in the interests of justice.”\nThat standard derives from 18 U. S. C. §3006A, which\ngoverns the appointment and substitution of counsel in\nfederal non-capital litigation. By contrast, the State con-\ntends that district courts may replace an appointed lawyer\nunder §3599 only when the defendant has suffered an\n“actual or constructive denial” of counsel. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 33. That denial occurs, the State asserts, in just\nthree situations: when the lawyer lacks the qualifications\nnecessary for appointment under the statute; when he has\na “disabling conflict of interest”; or when he has “complete-\nly abandoned” the client. Id., at 34. On this matter, we\nthink Clair, not the State, gets it right.\n   A trip back in time begins to show why. Prior to 1988,\n§3006A governed the appointment of counsel in all federal\ncriminal cases and habeas litigation, regardless whether\nthe matter involved a capital or a non-capital offense.\nThat section provided counsel as a matter of right to most\nindigent criminal defendants, from pre-trial proceedings\nthrough appeal. See §§3006A(a)(1), (c) (1982 ed.). In\n\n——————\ned shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial,\nsentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of\ncertiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available\npost-conviction process, together with applications for stays of exe-\ncution and other appropriate motions and procedures, and shall also\nrepresent the defendant in such competency proceedings and pro-\nceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the\ndefendant.”\n8                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naddition, the statute authorized courts to appoint counsel\nfor federal habeas petitioners when “the interests of\njustice so require[d],” §3006A(g); and under that provi-\nsion, courts almost always appointed counsel to represent\npetitioners convicted of capital offenses, see Ruthenbeck,\nDueling with Death in Federal Courts, 4 ABA Criminal\nJustice, No. 3, pp. 2, 42 (Fall, 1989). In all cases in which\na court had appointed counsel, §3006A further provided\n(as it continues to do) that substitution motions should be\ndecided “in the interests of justice.” §3006A(c). So in\nthose days, a court would have used that standard to\nevaluate a request like Clair’s.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted the legislation now known as\n§3599 to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases,\nthus displacing §3006A for persons facing execution (but\nretaining that section for all others). See Anti-Drug Abuse\nAct, 102 Stat. 4393–4394, 21 U. S. C. §§848(q)(4)–(10)\n(1988 ed.) (recodified at 18 U. S. C. §3599 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV)). The new statute grants federal capital defend-\nants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of\nrepresentation, in light of what it calls “the seriousness\nof the possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex\nnature of the litigation.” §3599(d) (2006 ed.). Habeas\npetitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a\nmatter of right, not an exercise of the court’s discretion.\nSee §3599(a)(2). And the statute aims in multiple ways to\nimprove the quality of representation afforded to capital\npetitioners and defendants alike. Section 3599 requires\nlawyers in capital cases to have more legal experience\nthan §3006A demands.          Compare §§3599(b)–(d) with\n§3006A(b). Similarly, §3599 authorizes higher rates of\ncompensation, in part to attract better counsel. Compare\n§3599(g)(1) with §3006A(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). And\n§3599 provides more money for investigative and expert\nservices. Compare §§3599(f) (2006 ed.), (g)(2) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV), with §3006A(e) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). As we\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave previously noted, those measures “reflec[t] a deter-\nmination that quality legal representation is necessary” in\nall capital proceedings to foster “fundamental fairness\nin the imposition of the death penalty.” McFarland, 512\nU. S., at 855, 859.\n   That understanding of §3599’s terms and origins goes\nfar toward resolving the parties’ dispute over what stand-\nard should apply. We know that before §3599’s passage,\ncourts used an “interests of justice” standard to decide\nsubstitution motions in all cases—and that today, they\ncontinue to do so in all non-capital proceedings. We know,\ntoo, that in spinning off §3599, Congress enacted a set of\nreforms to improve the quality of lawyering in capital\nlitigation. With all those measures pointing in one direc-\ntion, we cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed\na substitution standard that would head the opposite way.\nAdopting a more stringent test than §3006A’s would de-\nprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and\ndefendants facing lesser penalties still have, to handle\nserious representational problems. That result clashes\nwith everything else §3599 does. By contrast, utilizing\n§3006A’s standard comports with the myriad ways that\n§3599 seeks to promote effective representation for per-\nsons threatened with capital punishment.\n   The dearth of support for the State’s alternative stand-\nard reinforces the case for borrowing from §3006A. Recall\nthat the State thinks substitution proper “only when . . .\ncounsel is completely denied”—which, the State says,\noccurs when counsel lacks the requisite experience; “ac-\ntively represents conflicting interests”; or has “total[ly]\ndesert[ed]” the client. Brief for Petitioner 15, 35, 38. As\nthe State acknowledges, this test comes from . . . well,\nfrom nowhere. The State conceded during argument that\nCongress has not considered (much less adopted) the\nstandard in any context; neither has a federal court used\nit in any case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Indeed, the stand-\n10                    MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nard is new to the State’s own attorneys. As noted earlier,\nwhen Clair first requested a change of counsel, the State\nresponded that substitution is a “matter . . . of trial court\ndiscretion,” based on “the interests of justice.” App. 29;\nsee supra, at 3–4. Only later did the State devise its\npresent proposal. Inventiveness is often an admirable\nquality, but here we think the State overdoes it. To be\nsure, we must infer a substitution standard for §3599; in\nthat sense, we are writing on a blank slate. But in under-\ntaking that task, we prefer to copy something familiar\nthan concoct something novel. That enables courts to rely\non experience and precedent, with a standard already\nknown to work effectively.\n   Still worse, the State’s proposed test guts §3599’s pro-\nvision for substitution motions. See §3599(e) (2006 ed.)\n(appointed counsel may be “replaced . . . upon motion of\nthe defendant”). According to the State, a court may not\nchange counsel under §3599 even if the attorney-client\nrelationship has broken down, so long as the lawyer has\nthe required qualifications and is “act[ing] as an advo-\ncate.” Brief for Petitioner 35. And that is so, continues\nthe State, even when substitution will not cause delay or\nother prejudice—because again, the defendant retains a\nfunctioning lawyer. See id., at 34. That approach, as\nalready noted, undermines Congress’s efforts in §3599 to\nenhance representation in capital cases. See supra, at 8–\n9. And beyond that, it renders §3599’s substitution provi-\nsion superfluous. Even in the absence of that provision, a\ncourt would have to ensure that the defendant’s statutory\nright to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation; for\nexample, the court would have to appoint new counsel if\nthe first lawyer developed a conflict with or abandoned the\nclient. So by confining substitution to cases in which the\ndefendant has no counsel at all, the State’s proposal effec-\ntively deletes §3599’s substitution clause.\n   The State counters that only its approach comports with\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“this Court’s long-established jurisprudence that habeas\nprisoners, including capital prisoners,” have no right to\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment. Brief for Petitioner\n18; see Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10, 12 (1989)\n(plurality opinion); id., at 14–15 (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 755\n(1991) (reserving question of whether the Sixth Amend-\nment guarantees counsel when a habeas proceeding pro-\nvides the first opportunity to raise a claim). But we do not\nunderstand the State’s basis for linking use of the “inter-\nests of justice” standard to cases in which an individual\nhas a Sixth Amendment right. A statute need not draw\nthe same lines as the Constitution, and neither §3006A\nnor §3599 does so in addressing the substitution of\ncounsel. Section 3006A applies the “interests of justice”\nstandard to substitution motions even when the Sixth\nAmendment does not require representation; that is\npresumptively so, for example, when a court provides\ncounsel to a non-capital habeas petitioner.              See\n§§3006A(a)(2)(B), (c). And whatever standard we adopt for\n§3599 will likewise apply both to litigants who have and to\nlitigants who lack a Sixth Amendment right, because the\nsection offers counsel on the same terms to capital defend-\nants and habeas petitioners. In providing statutory rights\nto counsel, Congress declined to track the Sixth Amend-\nment; accordingly, the scope of that Amendment cannot\nanswer the statutory question presented here.\n   The State’s stronger argument relates to delay in capital\nproceedings. Under the “interests of justice” standard, the\nState contends, substitution motions will become a mech-\nanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence, contrary\nto historic restrictions on “abuse of the writ” and to the\ngoals of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA). See Brief for Petitioner 19–22. But this\nargument, like the last, forgets that §3599 reaches not just\nhabeas petitioners but also criminal defendants, who have\n12                         MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot been convicted or sentenced and therefore have no\nincentive to delay. Moreover, the State’s claim misjudges\nthe capacity of the “interests of justice” standard to deal\nwith such issues. Protecting against abusive delay is an\ninterest of justice. Because that is so, courts addressing\nsubstitution motions in both capital and non-capital cases\nroutinely consider issues of timeliness. See, e.g., Hunter v.\nDelo, 62 F. 3d 271, 274 (CA8 1995) (citing “the need to\nthwart abusive delay” in affirming the denial of a habeas\npetitioner’s substitution motion); United States v. White,\n451 F. 2d 1225, 1226 (CA6 1971) (per curiam) (approving a\nDistrict Court’s refusal to change counsel under §3006A(c)\n“on the morning of the trial”). Indeed, we will do so, just\nparagraphs from here, in this very case. See infra, at 15–\n16. The standard we adopt thus takes account of, rather\nthan ignores or opposes, the State’s interest in avoiding\nundue delay.3\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 The State also makes a more specific argument based on AEDPA,\n\nsee Brief for Petitioner 26–29, but we think it is not well taken. The\nState notes that the “interests of justice” standard enables a court,\nwhen ruling on a substitution motion, to take account of a lawyer’s\neffectiveness. That consideration, according to the State, conflicts\nwith AEDPA’s injunction that “[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of\ncounsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings\nshall not be a ground for relief in a [habeas] proceeding arising under\nsection 2254.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(i); see §2261(e) (using similar lan-\nguage). But most naturally read, §2254(i) prohibits a court from\ngranting substantive habeas relief on the basis of a lawyer’s ineffec-\ntiveness in post-conviction proceedings, not from substituting counsel\non that ground. Cf. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 18) (holding that §2254(i) does not preclude equitable tolling of a\nstatute of limitations based on attorney misconduct in habeas proceed-\nings). Indeed, if the State were right, we would also have to find that\nAEDPA silently repealed §3006A’s instruction to courts to apply the\n“interests of justice” standard in non-capital habeas cases. We see\nnothing to suggest that Congress had that result in mind.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   The remaining question is whether the District Court\nabused its discretion in denying Clair’s second request for\nnew counsel under §3599’s “interests of justice” standard.\nWe do not think the court did so, although the court’s\nfailure to make any inquiry into Clair’s allegations makes\nthis decision harder than necessary.\n   As its name betrays, the “interests of justice” standard\ncontemplates a peculiarly context-specific inquiry. So we\ndoubt that any attempt to provide a general definition of\nthe standard would prove helpful. In reviewing substitu-\ntion motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several\nrelevant considerations. Those factors may vary a bit from\ncircuit to circuit, but generally include: the timeliness of\nthe motion; the adequacy of the district court’s inquiry\ninto the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for\nthat complaint, including the extent of the conflict or\nbreakdown in communication between lawyer and client\n(and the client’s own responsibility, if any, for that con-\nflict). See, e.g., United States v. Prime, 431 F. 3d 1147,\n1154 (CA9 2005); United States v. Doe, 272 F. 3d 116, 122–\n123 (CA2 2001); Hunter, 62 F. 3d, at 274; United States v.\nWelty, 674 F. 2d 185, 188 (CA3 1982). Because a trial\ncourt’s decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it de-\nserves deference; a reviewing court may overturn it only\nfor an abuse of discretion.\n   The District Court here received Clair’s second substitu-\ntion motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas\npetition. Recall that three months earlier, following an\nevidentiary hearing and post-hearing briefing, Clair had\nwritten the court to complain about his attorneys. In that\nfirst letter, Clair accused his lawyers of refusing to co-\noperate with a private detective and, more generally, of\nforgoing efforts to prove his innocence. After making\nproper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his attor-\nneys had worked through their dispute and Clair no long-\n14                    MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ner wanted to substitute counsel. The court thus turned its\nattention once again to ruling on Clair’s habeas petition—\nonly to receive another letter requesting a change in\nrepresentation.\n   If that second letter had merely recapitulated the\ncharges in the first, this case would be relatively simple.\nEven then, the court might have done well to make further\ninquiry of Clair and his counsel. As all Circuits agree,\ncourts cannot properly resolve substitution motions with-\nout probing why a defendant wants a new lawyer. See,\ne.g., United States v. Iles, 906 F. 2d 1122, 1130 (CA6 1990)\n(“It is hornbook law that ‘[w]hen an indigent defendant\nmakes a timely and good faith motion requesting that\nappointed counsel be discharged and new counsel appoint-\ned, the trial court clearly has a responsibility to determine\nthe reasons for defendant’s dissatisfaction . . .’ ” (quoting 2\nW. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure §11.4, p. 36\n(1984))). Moreover, an on-the-record inquiry into the\ndefendant’s allegations “permit[s] meaningful appellate\nreview” of a trial court’s exercise of discretion. United\nStates v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 336–337 (1988). But here\nthe court had inquired, just a short time earlier, into\nClair’s relationship with his lawyers. The court knew that\nClair had responded to that inquiry by dropping his initial\ncomplaints. And the court had reason to think, based on\n10 years of handling the case, that those charges lacked\nmerit: Perhaps most important, the court knew that the\nlawyers had raised many challenges not just to Clair’s\nsentence, but to his conviction, including to the sufficiency\nof the State’s evidence. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 27–\n69. Especially at this stage of the litigation, those factors\nwould have provided ample basis to reject a simple reprise\nof Clair’s allegations.\n   What complicates this case is that in his second letter,\nClair added a new and significant charge of attorney error.\nBeyond asserting generally that his lawyers were not\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrying to prove his innocence, Clair now alleged that coun-\nsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located\nphysical evidence. That evidence, according to Clair,\nmight have shown that the police had suppressed Brady\nmaterial, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in\ninvestigating the murder, or that he had not committed\nthe offense. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–46. Especially in a\ncase lacking physical evidence, built in part on since-\nrecanted witness testimony, those possibilities cannot be\nblithely dismissed. In the mine run of circumstances,\nClair’s new charge would have required the court to make\nfurther inquiry before ruling on his motion for a new\nattorney.\n   But here, the timing of that motion precludes a holding\nthat the District Court abused its discretion. The court\nreceived Clair’s second letter while putting the finishing\ntouches on its denial of his habeas petition. (That lengthy\ndecision issued just two weeks later.) After many years\nof litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and substantial post-\nhearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that\nit would accept no further submissions. See App. 3–4; Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 4–5. The case was all over but the deciding;\ncounsel, whether old or new, could do nothing more in the\ntrial court proceedings. At that point and in that forum,\nClair’s conflict with his lawyers no longer mattered.\n   Clair, to be sure, wanted to press his case further in the\nDistrict Court. He desired a new lawyer, after examining\nthe physical evidence, to make whatever claims followed\nfrom it. But, notably, all of those claims would have been\nnew; as the District Court later found in ruling on Clair’s\nRule 60(b) motion, the physical evidence did not relate to\nany of the claims Clair had previously made in his habeas\npetition. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 9–10. A substitute\nlawyer thus would have had to seek an amendment of that\npetition, as well as an evidentiary hearing or, more likely,\na stay to allow exhaustion of remedies in state court. See\n16                        MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n403 Fed. Appx., at 279. The District Court could properly\nhave rejected that motion, consistent with its order pre-\ncluding further submissions (effectively remitting Clair to\nstate court to pursue the matter). See Mayle v. Felix, 545\nU. S. 644, 663 (2005). And if that is so, the court also\nacted within its discretion in denying Clair’s request to\nsubstitute counsel, even without the usually appropriate\ninquiry. The court was not required to appoint a new\nlawyer just so Clair could file a futile motion. We accord-\ningly find that the Court of Appeals erred in overturning\nthe District Court’s decision.4\n  The judgment below is reversed, and the case is re-\nmanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  4 We note as well that the Court of Appeals ordered the wrong remedy\n\neven assuming the District Court had abused its discretion in denying\nClair’s substitution motion without inquiry. The way to cure that error\nwould have been to remand to the District Court to decide whether\nsubstitution was appropriate at the time of Clair’s letter. Unless that\ncourt determined that counsel should have been changed, the Court of\nAppeals had no basis for vacating the denial of Clair’s habeas petition.\n</pre>", "id": 624280, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/05/Martel_v._Clair.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

CLAIR\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–1265. Argued December 6, 2011—Decided March 5, 2012\nRespondent Clair was charged with capital murder for the 1984 slaying\n  of Linda Rodgers. The main evidence at his trial in California state\n  court came from statements Clair made to his former girlfriend in a\n  conversation that she secretly recorded for the police. He was con-\n  victed and sentenced to death, and his verdict was upheld on direct\n  review.\n     In 1994, Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a\n  request for appointment of counsel, which the District Court granted\n  under 18 U. S. C. §3599. That statute entitles indigent capital habe-\n  as petitioners like Clair to appointed counsel. It also contemplates\n  that appointed counsel may be “replaced . . . upon motion of the de-\n  fendant,” §3599(e), but it does not specify a standard for district\n  courts to use in evaluating those motions. Clair’s counsel filed his in-\n  itial habeas petition in 1994, and in the late 1990’s, when two associ-\n  ates from the firm representing Clair moved to the Office of the Fed-\n  eral Public Defender (FPD), the FPD was substituted as counsel of\n  record. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Clair’s ha-\n  beas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted their post-\n  hearing briefs by February 2005. The court subsequently told the\n  parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the peti-\n  tion. In March, Clair moved to substitute counsel, claiming that his\n  attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, not to\n  prove his innocence. After the court asked the parties to address the\n  motion, Clair’s counsel informed it that they had met with Clair and\n  that he wanted the FPD to continue representing him. The court ac-\n  cordingly decided that it would take no action. Six weeks later, how-\n  ever, Clair filed another substitution motion, adding one more charge\n  to his earlier claims: that his private investigator had discovered that\n2                            MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully\n    tested, but that Clair’s attorneys had done nothing to analyze this ev-\n    idence or follow up on its discovery. The court denied the renewed\n    motion without further inquiry. On the same day, it also denied\n    Clair’s habeas petition.\n       Clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se, and the FPD\n    appealed the habeas ruling. The Ninth Circuit asked the FPD to ad-\n    dress whether substitution was now warranted, and after the FPD\n    informed the court that the attorney-client relationship had broken\n    down, the court provided Clair with a new lawyer. Clair then asked\n    the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under\n    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be al-\n    lowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his\n    case. The District Court rejected his request, and Clair appealed.\n    Consolidating his appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District\n    Court’s denial of both his substitution request and his habeas peti-\n    tion. Holding that the “interests of justice” standard used in non-\n    capital cases, see 18 U. S. C. §3006A, should govern substitution mo-\n    tions like Clair’s, it ruled that the District Court abused its discretion\n    by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clair’s second letter. Be-\n    cause Clair had already received new counsel on appeal, the court de-\n    cided the best remedy was to treat Clair’s new counsel as though he\n    had been appointed in June 2005 and to allow him to make whatever\n    submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend\n    Clair’s habeas petition in light of new evidence.\nHeld:\n    1. When evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases\n under 18 U. S. C. §3599, courts should employ the same “interests of\n justice” standard that applies in non-capital cases under §3006A.\n Pp. 6–12.\n       (a) Although §3599 guarantees that indigent capital defendants\n and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will re-\n ceive the assistance of counsel, see, e.g., §§3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e), and\n contemplates that an appointed attorney may be “replaced by simi-\n larly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s own motion or upon mo-\n tion of the defendant,” §3599(e), the statute fails to specify how a\n court should decide such a motion. Clair argues, and the Ninth Cir-\n cuit agreed, that district courts should use the “in the interests of\n justice” standard of §3006A, which governs the appointment and sub-\n stitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation. By contrast, the\n State contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when\n the defendant has suffered an “actual or constructive denial” of coun-\n sel—that is, when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifica-\n tions, has a conflict of interest, or has completely abandoned the\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclient.\n   The Court adopts Clair’s approach, based on the history of §3599.\nBefore 1988, §3006A governed both capital and non-capital cases, au-\nthorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and\nproviding that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel,\nsubstitution motions should be decided “in the interests of justice.”\n§3006A(c). Thus, a court in those days would have used that stand-\nard to evaluate a request like Clair’s. In 1988, Congress enacted\nwhat is now §3599, thus displacing §3006A for persons facing execu-\ntion. The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital\nhabeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation. Habeas peti-\ntioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, see\n§3599(a)(2), and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the\nquality of their representation: it provides them with more experi-\nenced counsel than §3006A demands, authorizes higher rates of com-\npensation, and provides more money for investigative and expert\nservices. These measures “reflec[t] a determination that quality legal\nrepresentation is necessary” in all capital proceedings to foster “fun-\ndamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.” McFar-\nland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 855, 859. Given this context, the Court\ncannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution\nstandard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital\npunishment to substitute counsel. Adopting a more stringent test\nthan §3006A’s would deprive capital defendants of a tool they former-\nly had, and non-capital defendants still have, to handle serious rep-\nresentational problems. By contrast, utilizing §3006A’s standard\ncomports with the myriad ways that §3599 seeks to promote effective\nrepresentation for persons facing capital punishment. Pp. 6–9.\n     (b) The dearth of support for the State’s alternative standard re-\ninforces this conclusion. The State concedes that Congress has not\nconsidered its standard in any context; neither has a federal court\nused it in any case. The Court prefers to use a familiar standard, al-\nready known to work, than to try out a new one. Moreover, the\nState’s proposed test would gut §3599’s substitution provision, be-\ncause even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to\nensure that the defendant’s statutory right to counsel was satisfied\nthroughout the litigation. The State counters that only its approach\ncomports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no\nSixth Amendment right to counsel. But Congress declined to track\nthat Amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both\n§3006A and §3599. Thus, the scope of the Amendment cannot an-\nswer the statutory question presented here. The State also contends\nthat the “interests of justice” standard will permit substitution mo-\ntions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sen-\n4                           MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tence. But the “interests of justice” standard takes into account\n    whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay. Pp. 9–12.\n       2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Clair’s\n    second request for new counsel under §3599’s “interests of justice”\n    standard. In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals\n    have pointed to several relevant considerations, including: the time-\n    liness of the motion; the adequacy of the district court’s inquiry into\n    the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint,\n    including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication\n    between lawyer and client. Because a trial court’s decision on substi-\n    tution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference and may be overturned\n    only for an abuse of discretion.\n       Here, the District Court received Clair’s second substitution motion\n    on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition. Just three\n    months earlier, Clair had written the court to complain about his at-\n    torneys. After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair\n    and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to\n    ruling on Clair’s habeas petition, only to receive a second letter six\n    weeks later. In it Clair maintained his general assertion that his\n    lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, but he also alleged a\n    new and significant charge of attorney error: that counsel had re-\n    fused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.\n    Such a charge normally would require the court to make further in-\n    quiry; a district court cannot usually rule on a substitution motion\n    without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel. But here, the\n    motion’s timing precludes a holding that the District Court abused its\n    discretion. The court received the letter while putting the finishing\n    touches on its denial of Clair’s habeas petition. After years of litiga-\n    tion, an evidentiary hearing, and post-hearing briefing, the court had\n    instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.\n    All proceedings had therefore come to a close, and a new attorney\n    could have done nothing further in the District Court. In those cir-\n    cumstances, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying\n    Clair’s substitution motion. Pp. 13–16.\n403 Fed.

The statute con-\ntemplates that appointed counsel may be “replaced . . .\nupon motion of the defendant,” §3599(e), but it does not\nspecify the standard that district courts should use in\nevaluating those motions. We hold that courts should\nemploy the same “interests of justice” standard that they\napply in non-capital cases under a related statute, §3006A\nof Title 18. We also hold that the District Court here did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying respondent Kenneth\nClair’s motion to change counsel.\n                              I\n  This case arises from the murder of Linda Rodgers in\n1984. Rodgers resided at the home of Kai Henriksen and\nMargaret Hessling in Santa Ana, California. Clair was a\nsquatter in a vacant house next door. About a week prior\nto the murder, police officers arrested Clair for burglariz-\ning the Henriksen-Hessling home, relying on information\nHenriksen had provided. On the night the police released\n2                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClair from custody, Hessling returned from an evening out\nto find Rodgers’ dead body in the master bedroom, naked\nfrom the waist down and beaten, stabbed, and strangled.\nSome jewelry and household items were missing from the\nhouse. See People v. Clair, 2 Cal. 4th 629, 644–647, 828\nP. 2d 705, 713–714 (1992); App. to Pet. for Cert. 23–24.\n   The district attorney charged Clair with Rodgers’ mur-\nder and sought the death penalty. No forensic evidence\nlinked Clair to the crime; instead, the main evidence\nagainst Clair came from his former girlfriend, Pauline\nFlores. Although she later recanted her testimony, see\nApp. 36–42, Flores stated at trial that she and Clair were\nwalking in the neighborhood on the night of the murder\nand split up near the Henriksen-Hessling house. When\nthey reunited about an hour later, Flores recounted, Clair\nwas carrying jewelry and other items and had blood on his\nright hand. According to Flores, Clair explained to her\nthat he had “just finished beating up a woman.” Clair, 2\nCal. 4th, at 647, 828 P. 2d, at 714. The prosecution then\nintroduced a tape recording of a talk between Flores and\nClair several months after the murder, which Flores had\nmade in cooperation with the police. On that tape, Clair\nat one point denied committing the murder, but also made\nseveral inculpatory statements. For example, when Flores\ntold Clair that she had seen blood on him, he replied “Ain’t\non me no more” and “They can’t prove nothing.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). And\nin response to her continued probing, Clair explained\n“[W]hat you fail to realize, how . . . they gonna prove I was\nthere . . . ? There ain’t no . . . fingerprints, ain’t no . . .\nbody seen me go in there and leave out there.” Id., at 53–\n54 (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury convicted\nClair and sentenced him to death. The California Su-\npreme Court upheld the verdict, and this Court denied\nreview, Clair v. California, 506 U. S. 1063 (1993).\n   Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest for appointment of counsel, which the District\nCourt granted under §3599. Clair and his counsel filed an\ninitial petition for habeas relief in 1994 and, after exhaust-\ning state remedies, an amended petition the following\nyear. The petition alleged more than 40 claims, involving\nsuch matters as jury selection and composition, sufficiency\nof the evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, nondisclosure\nof exculpatory materials relating to state witnesses, and\nineffectiveness of trial counsel. In the late 1990’s, two\nassociates from the firm representing Clair took jobs at\nthe Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), and the\ncourt substituted that office as counsel of record. The\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on Clair’s habeas peti-\ntion in August 2004, and the parties submitted post-\nhearing briefs by February 2005. The court subsequently\ninformed the parties that it viewed the briefing “to be\ncomplete and d[id] not wish to receive any additional\nmaterial” about the petition. App. 3–4.\n   On March 16, 2005, Clair sent a letter to the court\nstating that the FPD attorneys “no longer . . . ha[d] [his]\nbest interest at hand” and that he did not want them to\ncontinue to represent him. Id., at 24; see id., at 18–25.\nClair alleged that the lawyers had repeatedly dismissed\nhis efforts to participate in his own defense. Prior to the\nevidentiary hearing, Clair wrote, he had become so frus-\ntrated with the attorneys that he enlisted a private detec-\ntive to look into his case. But the lawyers, Clair charged,\nrefused to cooperate with the investigator; they were\nseeking only to overturn his death sentence, rather than to\nprove his innocence. As a result, Clair felt that he and his\ncounsel were not “on the same team.” Id., at 23.\n   The District Court responded by asking both parties to\naddress Clair’s motion to substitute counsel. See id., at\n18. The State noted that “[w]hat the trial court does with\nrespect to appointing counsel is within its discretion,\nproviding the interests of justice are served.” Id., at 29.\n4                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State further advised the court that “nothing in\n[Clair’s] letter require[d] a change” of counsel because the\nFPD lawyers had provided appropriate representation and\nsubstitution would delay the case. Ibid. Clair replied to\nthe court’s request through his FPD attorneys on April 26,\n2005. Their letter stated: “After meeting with Mr. Clair,\ncounsel understands that Mr. Clair wants the [FPD] to\ncontinue to serve as his counsel in this case at this time.”\nId., at 27. On the basis of that representation, the court\ndetermined that it would “take no further action on the\nmatter at this time.” Id., at 33.\n   But the issue resurfaced just six weeks after the court’s\ndecision. On June 16, 2005, Clair wrote a second letter to\nthe court asking for substitution of counsel. That letter\nagain asserted a “total break down of communication”\nbetween Clair and the FPD; according to Clair, he was “no\nlonger able to trust anybody within that office.” Id., at 62–\n63. In explaining the source of the problem, Clair reiter-\nated each of the points made in his prior complaint. And\nthen he added one more. Clair recounted that his private\ninvestigator had recently learned that the police and dis-\ntrict attorney’s office were in possession of fingerprints\nand other physical evidence from the crime scene that had\nnever been fully tested. The FPD lawyers, Clair asserted,\nwere doing nothing to analyze this evidence or otherwise\nfollow up on its discovery. Clair attributed this failure,\ntoo, to the FPD’s decision to focus on his sentence, rather\nthan on questions of guilt.\n   Two weeks later, the District Court denied Clair’s re-\nnewed request for substitution without further inquiry.\nThe court stated: “It does not appear to the Court that a\nchange of counsel is appropriate. It appears that [Clair’s]\ncounsel is doing a proper job. No conflict of interest or\ninadequacy of counsel is shown.” Id., at 61. On the same\nday, the court denied Clair’s habeas petition in a detailed\nopinion. Clair v. Brown, Case No. CV 93–1133 GLT (CD\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit instructed the FPD to address whether substitu-\ntion of counsel was now warranted, and in October 2005,\nthe FPD informed the court that “the attorney-client\nrelationship ha[d] broken down to such an extent that sub-\nstitution of counsel [would be] appropriate.” Attorney\nfor Appellant’s Response to Court’s Sept. 15, 2005 Order,\nin No. 05–99005 (CA9), Record, Doc. 9, p. 1. The State did\nnot comment or object, and the Court of Appeals provided\nClair with a new lawyer going forward. Clair then asked\nthe District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas peti-\ntion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing\nthat he should be allowed to explore the significance of\nthe new physical evidence for his case. The District Court\n(with a new judge assigned, because the judge previously\nhandling the case had retired) rejected that request on the\nground that the new evidence did not pertain to any of the\nclaims presented in Clair’s habeas petition. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 9–10. Clair appealed that decision as well.1\n   After consolidating Clair’s appeals, the Ninth Circuit\nvacated the trial court’s denial of both Clair’s request for\nnew counsel and his habeas petition. See Clair v. Ayers,\n403 Fed. Appx. 276 (2010). The Court of Appeals’ opinion\nfocused on Clair’s substitution motion. Holding that the\n“interests of justice” standard should apply to that motion,\n——————\n  1 While  litigating his Rule 60(b) motion in the District Court, Clair\nalso pursued discovery in the California state courts relating to the\nnewly found physical evidence. On the basis of material he obtained,\nClair filed another petition for state habeas relief, alleging (among\nother claims) actual innocence and improper suppression of exculpatory\nmaterial under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The California\nSupreme Court summarily denied that petition. See In re Clair, No.\nS169188 (Aug. 24, 2011).\n6                        MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in\nClair’s second letter. See id., at 278. The Court of Ap-\npeals then considered how to remedy that error, given that\nClair had received new counsel while on appeal. It decid-\ned that “the most reasonable solution” was to “treat Clair’s\ncurrent counsel as if he were the counsel who might have\nbeen appointed” in June 2005, and to allow him to make\nwhatever submissions he would have made then, includ-\ning a motion to amend Clair’s habeas petition in light of\nnew evidence. Id., at 279.\n  We granted certiorari to review this judgment, 564 U. S.\n__ (2011), and now reverse.\n                             II\n   We first consider the standard that district courts\nshould use to adjudicate federal habeas petitioners’ mo-\ntions to substitute counsel in capital cases. The question\narises because the relevant statute, 18 U. S. C. §3599,\ncontains a notable gap. Section 3599 first guarantees that\nindigent defendants in federal capital cases will receive\nthe assistance of counsel, from pretrial proceedings\nthrough stay applications. See §§3599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e). It\nnext grants a corresponding right to people like Clair who\nseek federal habeas relief from a state death sentence, for\nall post-conviction proceedings and related activities. See\n§§3599(a)(2), (e); McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 854–\n855 (1994); Harbison v. Bell, 556 U. S. 180, 183–185\n(2009). And the statute contemplates that both sets of\nlitigants may sometimes substitute counsel; it notes that\nan attorney appointed under the section may be “replaced\nby similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s own\nmotion or upon motion of the defendant.” §3599(e).2 But\n——————\n    2 Section\n          3599(e) provides in full:\n  “Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney’s\nown motion or upon motion of the defendant, each attorney so appoint-\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhere lies the rub: The statute fails to specify how a court\nshould decide such a motion. Section 3599 says not a word\nabout the standard a court should apply when addressing\na request for a new lawyer.\n   The parties offer us two alternative ways to fill this\nstatutory hole. Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit\nagreed, that district courts should decide substitution\nmotions brought under §3599 “in the interests of justice.”\nThat standard derives from 18 U. S. C. §3006A, which\ngoverns the appointment and substitution of counsel in\nfederal non-capital litigation. By contrast, the State con-\ntends that district courts may replace an appointed lawyer\nunder §3599 only when the defendant has suffered an\n“actual or constructive denial” of counsel. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 33. That denial occurs, the State asserts, in just\nthree situations: when the lawyer lacks the qualifications\nnecessary for appointment under the statute; when he has\na “disabling conflict of interest”; or when he has “complete-\nly abandoned” the client. Id., at 34. On this matter, we\nthink Clair, not the State, gets it right.\n   A trip back in time begins to show why. Prior to 1988,\n§3006A governed the appointment of counsel in all federal\ncriminal cases and habeas litigation, regardless whether\nthe matter involved a capital or a non-capital offense.\nThat section provided counsel as a matter of right to most\nindigent criminal defendants, from pre-trial proceedings\nthrough appeal. See §§3006A(a)(1), (c) (1982 ed.). In\n\n——————\ned shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceedings, including pretrial proceedings, trial,\nsentencing, motions for new trial, appeals, applications for writ of\ncertiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States, and all available\npost-conviction process, together with applications for stays of exe-\ncution and other appropriate motions and procedures, and shall also\nrepresent the defendant in such competency proceedings and pro-\nceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the\ndefendant.”\n8                     MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naddition, the statute authorized courts to appoint counsel\nfor federal habeas petitioners when “the interests of\njustice so require[d],” §3006A(g); and under that provi-\nsion, courts almost always appointed counsel to represent\npetitioners convicted of capital offenses, see Ruthenbeck,\nDueling with Death in Federal Courts, 4 ABA Criminal\nJustice, No. 3, pp. 2, 42 (Fall, 1989). In all cases in which\na court had appointed counsel, §3006A further provided\n(as it continues to do) that substitution motions should be\ndecided “in the interests of justice.” §3006A(c). So in\nthose days, a court would have used that standard to\nevaluate a request like Clair’s.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted the legislation now known as\n§3599 to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases,\nthus displacing §3006A for persons facing execution (but\nretaining that section for all others). See Anti-Drug Abuse\nAct, 102 Stat. 4393–4394, 21 U. S. C. §§848(q)(4)–(10)\n(1988 ed.) (recodified at 18 U. S. C. §3599 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV)). The new statute grants federal capital defend-\nants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of\nrepresentation, in light of what it calls “the seriousness\nof the possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex\nnature of the litigation.” §3599(d) (2006 ed.). Habeas\npetitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a\nmatter of right, not an exercise of the court’s discretion.\nSee §3599(a)(2). And the statute aims in multiple ways to\nimprove the quality of representation afforded to capital\npetitioners and defendants alike. Section 3599 requires\nlawyers in capital cases to have more legal experience\nthan §3006A demands.          Compare §§3599(b)–(d) with\n§3006A(b). Similarly, §3599 authorizes higher rates of\ncompensation, in part to attract better counsel. Compare\n§3599(g)(1) with §3006A(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). And\n§3599 provides more money for investigative and expert\nservices. Compare §§3599(f) (2006 ed.), (g)(2) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV), with §3006A(e) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). As we\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave previously noted, those measures “reflec[t] a deter-\nmination that quality legal representation is necessary” in\nall capital proceedings to foster “fundamental fairness\nin the imposition of the death penalty.” McFarland, 512\nU. S., at 855, 859.\n   That understanding of §3599’s terms and origins goes\nfar toward resolving the parties’ dispute over what stand-\nard should apply. We know that before §3599’s passage,\ncourts used an “interests of justice” standard to decide\nsubstitution motions in all cases—and that today, they\ncontinue to do so in all non-capital proceedings. We know,\ntoo, that in spinning off §3599, Congress enacted a set of\nreforms to improve the quality of lawyering in capital\nlitigation. With all those measures pointing in one direc-\ntion, we cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed\na substitution standard that would head the opposite way.\nAdopting a more stringent test than §3006A’s would de-\nprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and\ndefendants facing lesser penalties still have, to handle\nserious representational problems. That result clashes\nwith everything else §3599 does. By contrast, utilizing\n§3006A’s standard comports with the myriad ways that\n§3599 seeks to promote effective representation for per-\nsons threatened with capital punishment.\n   The dearth of support for the State’s alternative stand-\nard reinforces the case for borrowing from §3006A. Recall\nthat the State thinks substitution proper “only when . . .\ncounsel is completely denied”—which, the State says,\noccurs when counsel lacks the requisite experience; “ac-\ntively represents conflicting interests”; or has “total[ly]\ndesert[ed]” the client. Brief for Petitioner 15, 35, 38. As\nthe State acknowledges, this test comes from . . . well,\nfrom nowhere. The State conceded during argument that\nCongress has not considered (much less adopted) the\nstandard in any context; neither has a federal court used\nit in any case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. Indeed, the stand-\n10                    MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nard is new to the State’s own attorneys. As noted earlier,\nwhen Clair first requested a change of counsel, the State\nresponded that substitution is a “matter . . . of trial court\ndiscretion,” based on “the interests of justice.” App. 29;\nsee supra, at 3–4. Only later did the State devise its\npresent proposal. Inventiveness is often an admirable\nquality, but here we think the State overdoes it. To be\nsure, we must infer a substitution standard for §3599; in\nthat sense, we are writing on a blank slate. But in under-\ntaking that task, we prefer to copy something familiar\nthan concoct something novel. That enables courts to rely\non experience and precedent, with a standard already\nknown to work effectively.\n   Still worse, the State’s proposed test guts §3599’s pro-\nvision for substitution motions. See §3599(e) (2006 ed.)\n(appointed counsel may be “replaced . . . upon motion of\nthe defendant”). According to the State, a court may not\nchange counsel under §3599 even if the attorney-client\nrelationship has broken down, so long as the lawyer has\nthe required qualifications and is “act[ing] as an advo-\ncate.” Brief for Petitioner 35. And that is so, continues\nthe State, even when substitution will not cause delay or\nother prejudice—because again, the defendant retains a\nfunctioning lawyer. See id., at 34. That approach, as\nalready noted, undermines Congress’s efforts in §3599 to\nenhance representation in capital cases. See supra, at 8–\n9. And beyond that, it renders §3599’s substitution provi-\nsion superfluous. Even in the absence of that provision, a\ncourt would have to ensure that the defendant’s statutory\nright to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation; for\nexample, the court would have to appoint new counsel if\nthe first lawyer developed a conflict with or abandoned the\nclient. So by confining substitution to cases in which the\ndefendant has no counsel at all, the State’s proposal effec-\ntively deletes §3599’s substitution clause.\n   The State counters that only its approach comports with\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“this Court’s long-established jurisprudence that habeas\nprisoners, including capital prisoners,” have no right to\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment. Brief for Petitioner\n18; see Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10, 12 (1989)\n(plurality opinion); id., at 14–15 (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 755\n(1991) (reserving question of whether the Sixth Amend-\nment guarantees counsel when a habeas proceeding pro-\nvides the first opportunity to raise a claim). But we do not\nunderstand the State’s basis for linking use of the “inter-\nests of justice” standard to cases in which an individual\nhas a Sixth Amendment right. A statute need not draw\nthe same lines as the Constitution, and neither §3006A\nnor §3599 does so in addressing the substitution of\ncounsel. Section 3006A applies the “interests of justice”\nstandard to substitution motions even when the Sixth\nAmendment does not require representation; that is\npresumptively so, for example, when a court provides\ncounsel to a non-capital habeas petitioner.              See\n§§3006A(a)(2)(B), (c). And whatever standard we adopt for\n§3599 will likewise apply both to litigants who have and to\nlitigants who lack a Sixth Amendment right, because the\nsection offers counsel on the same terms to capital defend-\nants and habeas petitioners. In providing statutory rights\nto counsel, Congress declined to track the Sixth Amend-\nment; accordingly, the scope of that Amendment cannot\nanswer the statutory question presented here.\n   The State’s stronger argument relates to delay in capital\nproceedings. Under the “interests of justice” standard, the\nState contends, substitution motions will become a mech-\nanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence, contrary\nto historic restrictions on “abuse of the writ” and to the\ngoals of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA). See Brief for Petitioner 19–22. But this\nargument, like the last, forgets that §3599 reaches not just\nhabeas petitioners but also criminal defendants, who have\n12                         MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot been convicted or sentenced and therefore have no\nincentive to delay. Moreover, the State’s claim misjudges\nthe capacity of the “interests of justice” standard to deal\nwith such issues. Protecting against abusive delay is an\ninterest of justice. Because that is so, courts addressing\nsubstitution motions in both capital and non-capital cases\nroutinely consider issues of timeliness. See, e.g., Hunter v.\nDelo, 62 F. 3d 271, 274 (CA8 1995) (citing “the need to\nthwart abusive delay” in affirming the denial of a habeas\npetitioner’s substitution motion); United States v. White,\n451 F. 2d 1225, 1226 (CA6 1971) (per curiam) (approving a\nDistrict Court’s refusal to change counsel under §3006A(c)\n“on the morning of the trial”). Indeed, we will do so, just\nparagraphs from here, in this very case. See infra, at 15–\n16. The standard we adopt thus takes account of, rather\nthan ignores or opposes, the State’s interest in avoiding\nundue delay.3\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 The State also makes a more specific argument based on AEDPA,\n\nsee Brief for Petitioner 26–29, but we think it is not well taken. The\nState notes that the “interests of justice” standard enables a court,\nwhen ruling on a substitution motion, to take account of a lawyer’s\neffectiveness. That consideration, according to the State, conflicts\nwith AEDPA’s injunction that “[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of\ncounsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings\nshall not be a ground for relief in a [habeas] proceeding arising under\nsection 2254.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(i); see §2261(e) (using similar lan-\nguage). But most naturally read, §2254(i) prohibits a court from\ngranting substantive habeas relief on the basis of a lawyer’s ineffec-\ntiveness in post-conviction proceedings, not from substituting counsel\non that ground. Cf. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 18) (holding that §2254(i) does not preclude equitable tolling of a\nstatute of limitations based on attorney misconduct in habeas proceed-\nings). Indeed, if the State were right, we would also have to find that\nAEDPA silently repealed §3006A’s instruction to courts to apply the\n“interests of justice” standard in non-capital habeas cases. We see\nnothing to suggest that Congress had that result in mind.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n   The remaining question is whether the District Court\nabused its discretion in denying Clair’s second request for\nnew counsel under §3599’s “interests of justice” standard.\nWe do not think the court did so, although the court’s\nfailure to make any inquiry into Clair’s allegations makes\nthis decision harder than necessary.\n   As its name betrays, the “interests of justice” standard\ncontemplates a peculiarly context-specific inquiry. So we\ndoubt that any attempt to provide a general definition of\nthe standard would prove helpful. In reviewing substitu-\ntion motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several\nrelevant considerations. Those factors may vary a bit from\ncircuit to circuit, but generally include: the timeliness of\nthe motion; the adequacy of the district court’s inquiry\ninto the defendant’s complaint; and the asserted cause for\nthat complaint, including the extent of the conflict or\nbreakdown in communication between lawyer and client\n(and the client’s own responsibility, if any, for that con-\nflict). See, e.g., United States v. Prime, 431 F. 3d 1147,\n1154 (CA9 2005); United States v. Doe, 272 F. 3d 116, 122–\n123 (CA2 2001); Hunter, 62 F. 3d, at 274; United States v.\nWelty, 674 F. 2d 185, 188 (CA3 1982). Because a trial\ncourt’s decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it de-\nserves deference; a reviewing court may overturn it only\nfor an abuse of discretion.\n   The District Court here received Clair’s second substitu-\ntion motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas\npetition. Recall that three months earlier, following an\nevidentiary hearing and post-hearing briefing, Clair had\nwritten the court to complain about his attorneys. In that\nfirst letter, Clair accused his lawyers of refusing to co-\noperate with a private detective and, more generally, of\nforgoing efforts to prove his innocence. After making\nproper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his attor-\nneys had worked through their dispute and Clair no long-\n14                    MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ner wanted to substitute counsel. The court thus turned its\nattention once again to ruling on Clair’s habeas petition—\nonly to receive another letter requesting a change in\nrepresentation.\n   If that second letter had merely recapitulated the\ncharges in the first, this case would be relatively simple.\nEven then, the court might have done well to make further\ninquiry of Clair and his counsel. As all Circuits agree,\ncourts cannot properly resolve substitution motions with-\nout probing why a defendant wants a new lawyer. See,\ne.g., United States v. Iles, 906 F. 2d 1122, 1130 (CA6 1990)\n(“It is hornbook law that ‘[w]hen an indigent defendant\nmakes a timely and good faith motion requesting that\nappointed counsel be discharged and new counsel appoint-\ned, the trial court clearly has a responsibility to determine\nthe reasons for defendant’s dissatisfaction . . .’ ” (quoting 2\nW. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure §11.4, p. 36\n(1984))). Moreover, an on-the-record inquiry into the\ndefendant’s allegations “permit[s] meaningful appellate\nreview” of a trial court’s exercise of discretion. United\nStates v. Taylor, 487 U. S. 326, 336–337 (1988). But here\nthe court had inquired, just a short time earlier, into\nClair’s relationship with his lawyers. The court knew that\nClair had responded to that inquiry by dropping his initial\ncomplaints. And the court had reason to think, based on\n10 years of handling the case, that those charges lacked\nmerit: Perhaps most important, the court knew that the\nlawyers had raised many challenges not just to Clair’s\nsentence, but to his conviction, including to the sufficiency\nof the State’s evidence. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 27–\n69. Especially at this stage of the litigation, those factors\nwould have provided ample basis to reject a simple reprise\nof Clair’s allegations.\n   What complicates this case is that in his second letter,\nClair added a new and significant charge of attorney error.\nBeyond asserting generally that his lawyers were not\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrying to prove his innocence, Clair now alleged that coun-\nsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located\nphysical evidence. That evidence, according to Clair,\nmight have shown that the police had suppressed Brady\nmaterial, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in\ninvestigating the murder, or that he had not committed\nthe offense. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–46. Especially in a\ncase lacking physical evidence, built in part on since-\nrecanted witness testimony, those possibilities cannot be\nblithely dismissed. In the mine run of circumstances,\nClair’s new charge would have required the court to make\nfurther inquiry before ruling on his motion for a new\nattorney.\n   But here, the timing of that motion precludes a holding\nthat the District Court abused its discretion. The court\nreceived Clair’s second letter while putting the finishing\ntouches on its denial of his habeas petition. (That lengthy\ndecision issued just two weeks later.) After many years\nof litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and substantial post-\nhearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that\nit would accept no further submissions. See App. 3–4; Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 4–5. The case was all over but the deciding;\ncounsel, whether old or new, could do nothing more in the\ntrial court proceedings. At that point and in that forum,\nClair’s conflict with his lawyers no longer mattered.\n   Clair, to be sure, wanted to press his case further in the\nDistrict Court. He desired a new lawyer, after examining\nthe physical evidence, to make whatever claims followed\nfrom it. But, notably, all of those claims would have been\nnew; as the District Court later found in ruling on Clair’s\nRule 60(b) motion, the physical evidence did not relate to\nany of the claims Clair had previously made in his habeas\npetition. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 9–10. A substitute\nlawyer thus would have had to seek an amendment of that\npetition, as well as an evidentiary hearing or, more likely,\na stay to allow exhaustion of remedies in state court. See\n16                        MARTEL v. CLAIR\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n403 Fed. Appx., at 279. The District Court could properly\nhave rejected that motion, consistent with its order pre-\ncluding further submissions (effectively remitting Clair to\nstate court to pursue the matter). See Mayle v. Felix, 545\nU. S. 644, 663 (2005). And if that is so, the court also\nacted within its discretion in denying Clair’s request to\nsubstitute counsel, even without the usually appropriate\ninquiry. The court was not required to appoint a new\nlawyer just so Clair could file a futile motion. We accord-\ningly find that the Court of Appeals erred in overturning\nthe District Court’s decision.4\n  The judgment below is reversed, and the case is re-\nmanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  4 We note as well that the Court of Appeals ordered the wrong remedy\n\neven assuming the District Court had abused its discretion in denying\nClair’s substitution motion without inquiry. The way to cure that error\nwould have been to remand to the District Court to decide whether\nsubstitution was appropriate at the time of Clair’s letter. Unless that\ncourt determined that counsel should have been changed, the Court of\nAppeals had no basis for vacating the denial of Clair’s habeas petition.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/624280/", "sha1": "b3264a088847570af920cb071ebbf79684d79681", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-05T09:10:36"}
