SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–1399. Argued January 11, 2012—Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA) cre-\n  ates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible em-\n  ployee’s disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the\n  navigable waters of the United States. Benefits for most types of dis-\n  abilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the\n  fiscal year in which an injured employee is “newly awarded compen-\n  sation.” 33 U. S. C. §906(c). The LHWCA requires employers to pay\n  benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.\n  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no\n  compensation orders are issued. However, if an employer contro-\n  verts liability, or an employee contests his employer’s actions with\n  respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of La-\n  bor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be re-\n  solved, if possible, through informal procedures. An informal disposi-\n  tion may result in a compensation order. If not resolved informally,\n  the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who\n  conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.\n     In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska\n  marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services,\n  Inc. Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts\n  benefits until fiscal year 2005. Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim,\n  and Sea-Land controverted. In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded\n  Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.\n  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should\n  have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year\n  2007, when, he argued, he was “newly awarded compensation” by or-\n  der of the ALJ. The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of\n  Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the perti-\n2              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    nent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is “newly awarded compensation” when he first be-\n comes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,\n no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his be-\n half. Pp. 5−18.\n    (a) Roberts contends that the statutory term “awarded compensa-\n tion” means “awarded compensation in a formal order,” while Sea-\n Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means “statutorily\n entitled to compensation because of disability.” Although §906 can be\n interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director’s interpreta-\n tion makes §906 a working part of the statutory scheme. Under Rob-\n erts’ interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has\n been “awarded compensation,” so none is subject to an identifiable\n maximum rate of compensation. That result is incompatible with the\n LHWCA’s design. Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the\n applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Sec-\n retary of Labor. Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to\n determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it\n becomes the “applicable national average weekly wage” for the com-\n ing fiscal year. And §906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary’s\n determination shall apply to those “newly awarded compensation”\n during such fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\n three provisions work together to cap disability benefits. By its\n terms, and subject to one express exception, §906(b)(1) specifies that\n the cap applies globally, to all disability claims. Because all three\n provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if\n §906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. Roberts’ interpreta-\n tion would give §906(c) no application in the many cases in which no\n formal orders issue.\n    Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in\n which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA’s ad-\n ministrative structure. An employer must be able to calculate the\n cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee’s\n disability, see §914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of\n Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid. Similarly, an OWCP\n claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the\n applicable cap. It is difficult to see how an employer or claims exam-\n iner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in ef-\n fect at the time an employee becomes disabled. Moreover, applying\n the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an em-\n ployee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA’s purpose to compen-\n sate disability, defined as “incapacity because of injury to earn the\n wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.”\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  §902(10). It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated\n  employees; Roberts’ reading would permit two employees who earn\n  the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to re-\n  ceive different maximum compensation rates based on the happen-\n  stance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years. Finally, ap-\n  plying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which\n  disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims pro-\n  cess. If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the\n  cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with in-\n  flation would be unduly significant. Roberts’ rule would reward em-\n  ployees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating\n  unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate,\n  while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully\n  with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments. Pp.\n  5−13.\n     (b) Roberts’ counterarguments are unconvincing. First, although\n  the LHWCA sometimes uses “award” to mean “award in a formal or-\n  der,” the presumption that identical words used in different parts of\n  the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields\n  whenever, as here, the variation in the word’s use in the LHWCA\n  reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different\n  parts of the Act with different intent. See General Dynamics Land\n  Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595.\n     Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to\n  read the statutory phrase “person entitled to compensation” in\n  §933(g) to mean “person awarded compensation,” Estate of Cowart v.\n  Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477, the converse must also be\n  true: “awarded compensation” in §906(c) cannot mean “entitled to\n  compensation.” But Cowart’s reasoning does not work in reverse.\n  Cowart did not construe §906(c) or “award,” see id., at 478–479, and\n  it did not hold that the groups of “employees entitled to compensa-\n  tion” and “employees awarded compensation” were mutually exclu-\n  sive, see id., at 477.\n     Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the\n  LHWCA’s purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation\n  by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative\n  proceedings. But his remedy would also punish employers who vol-\n  untarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their em-\n  ployees’ injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher\n  cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to\n  file claims. The more measured deterrent to employer delay is inter-\n  est that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due. Pp. 13–\n  18.\n625 F. 3d 1204, affirmed.\n4             ROBERTS v.

S. C. §901 et seq., caps benefits for most types of dis-\nability at twice the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which an injured employee is “newly award­\ned compensation.” §906(c). We hold that an employee is\n“newly awarded compensation” when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene­\nfits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order\nissues on his behalf.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The LHWCA “is a comprehensive scheme to provide\ncompensation ‘in respect of disability or death of an em­\nployee . . . if the disability or death results from an in-\njury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United\nStates.’ ” Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S.\n291, 294 (1995) (quoting §903(a)). An employee’s compen­\nsation depends on the severity of his disability and his\npreinjury pay. A totally disabled employee, for example, is\n2             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to two-thirds of his preinjury average weekly\nwage as long as he remains disabled. §§908(a)–(b), 910.\n  Section 906, however, sets a cap on compensation.1\nDisability benefits “shall not exceed” twice “the applicable\nnational average weekly wage.” §906(b)(1). The national\naverage weekly wage—“the national average weekly earn­\nings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private\nnonagricultural payrolls,” §902(19)—is recalculated by the\nSecretary of Labor each fiscal year. §906(b)(3). For most\ntypes of disability, the “applicable” national average week­\nly wage is the figure for the fiscal year in which a benefi­\nciary is “newly awarded compensation,” and the cap re­\nmains constant as long as benefits continue. §906(c).2\n——————\n   1 Section 906 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n“(b) Maximum rate of compensation\n   “(1) Compensation for disability or death (other than compensation\nfor death required . . . to be paid in a lump sum) shall not exceed an\namount equal to 200 per centum of the applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3).\n              .           .           .           .           .\n   “(3) As soon as practicable after June 30 of each year, and in any\nevent prior to October 1 of such year, the Secretary shall determine\nthe national average weekly wage for the three consecutive calendar\nquarters ending June 30. Such determination shall be the applicable\nnational average weekly wage for the period beginning with October 1\nof that year and ending with September 30 of the next year. . . .\n“(c) Applicability of determinations\n   “Determinations under subsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to a period\nshall apply to employees or survivors currently receiving compensation\nfor permanent total disability or death benefits during such period, as\nwell as those newly awarded compensation during such period.”\n   2 For those “currently receiving compensation for permanent total\n\ndisability or death benefits,” §906(c), the cap is adjusted each fiscal\nyear—and typically increases, in step with the usual inflation-driven\nrise in the national average weekly wage. See Dept. of Labor, Division\nof Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation (DLHWC), NAWW\nInformation, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/NAWWinfo.htm\n(all Internet materials as visited Mar. 16, 2012, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file).

S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Consistent with the central bargain of workers’ compen­\nsation regimes—limited liability for employers; certain,\nprompt recovery for employees—the LHWCA requires that\nemployers pay benefits voluntarily, without formal admin­\nistrative proceedings. Once an employee provides notice of\na disabling injury, his employer must pay compensation\n“periodically, promptly, and directly . . . without an award,\nexcept where liability to pay compensation is controvert­\ned.” §914(a). In general, employers pay benefits without\ncontesting liability. See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v.\nDuris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983). In the mine run of cases,\ntherefore, no compensation orders issue.\n   If an employer controverts, or if an employee contests\nhis employer’s actions with respect to his benefits, the\ndispute advances to the Department of Labor’s Office of\nWorkers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP). See 20 CFR\n§§702.251–702.262 (2011). The OWCP district directors\n“are empowered to amicably and promptly resolve such\nproblems by informal procedures.” §702.301. A district\ndirector’s informal disposition may result in a compen-\nsation order. §702.315(a). In practice, however, “many\npending claims are amicably settled through voluntary\npayments without the necessity of a formal order.” Inter-\ncounty Constr. Corp. v. Walter, 422 U. S. 1, 4, n. 4 (1975).\nIf informal resolution fails, the district director refers the\ndispute to an administrative law judge (ALJ). See 20 CFR\n§§702.316, 702.331–702.351. An ALJ’s decision after a\nhearing culminates in the entry of a compensation order.\n33 U. S.

SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Dana Roberts slipped and\nfell on a patch of ice while employed at respondent Sea-\nLand Services’ marine terminal in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.\nRoberts injured his neck and shoulder and did not return\nto work. On receiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land\n(except for a six-week period in 2003) voluntarily paid\nRoberts benefits absent a compensation order until fiscal\nyear 2005. When Sea-Land discontinued voluntary pay­\nments, Roberts filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land\ncontroverted. In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ\nawarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate\nof $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average\nweekly wage for fiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when\nRoberts became disabled.\n   Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the “ap­\nplicable” national average weekly wage was the figure\nfor fiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was “newly\nawarded compensation” by the ALJ’s order. The latter\nfigure would have entitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week.\nThe ALJ denied reconsideration, and the Department of\nLabor’s Benefits Review Board (or BRB) affirmed, conclud­\ning that “the pertinent maximum rate is determined by\nthe date the disability commences.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding\nthat an employee “is ‘newly awarded compensation’ within\nthe meaning of [§906(c)] when he first becomes entitled to\ncompensation.” Roberts v. Director, OWCP, 625 F. 3d\n1204, 1208 (2010) (per curiam). We granted certiorari, 564\nU.

But “our task is to\nfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.” FTC\nv. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only\nthe interpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director\nmakes §906 a working part of the statutory scheme; sup­\nplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment\nof similarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesman­\nship in the claims process. In light of these contextual\nand structural considerations, we hold that an employee\nis “newly awarded compensation” when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene­\nfits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compen­\nsation order issues on his behalf.\n                               A\n   We first consider “whether the language at issue has\na plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the par-\nticular dispute in the case.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not define\n“awarded,” but in construing the Act, as with any statute,\n“ ‘we look first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.’ ” Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,\nOffice of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248,\n255 (1997) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). At first blush, Roberts’ position is ap­\npealing. In ordinary usage, “award” most often means\n“give by judicial decree” or “assign after careful judgment.”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002);\nsee also, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009)\n(“grant by formal process or by judicial decree”).\n6           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   But “award” can also mean “grant,” or “confer or bestow\nupon.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, at\n152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA “grants”\nbenefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to\n“award” compensation by force of its entitlement-creating\nprovisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes\n“award” entitlements. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to “statutes that\naward attorney’s fees to a prevailing party”); Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (appendix to majority\nopinion) (slip op., at 19) (statute “awards” good-time cred­\nits to federal prisoners); New Energy Co. of Ind. v.\nLimbach, 486 U. S. 269, 271 (1988) (Ohio statute “awards\na tax credit”); Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial\nAccident Comm’n, 306 U. S. 493, 500 (1939) (California\nworkers’ compensation statute “award[s] compensation for\ninjuries to an employee”); see also, e.g., Connecticut v.\nDoehr, 501 U. S. 1, 28 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment) (“Materialman’s and\nmechanic’s lien statutes award an interest in real property\nto workers”). Similarly, this Court has described an em­\nployee’s survivors as “having been ‘newly awarded’ death\nbenefits” by virtue of the employee’s death, without any\nreference to a formal order. Director, Office of Workers’\nCompensation Programs v. Rasmussen, 440 U. S. 29, 44,\nn. 16 (1979) (quoting §906(c)’s predecessor provision, 33\nU. S. C. §906(d) (1976 ed.)).\n   In short, the text of §906(c), in isolation, is indetermi­\nnate.\n                            B\n   Statutory language, however, “cannot be construed in a\nvacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construc­\ntion that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statu­\ntory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 803, 809 (1989). In the context of the LHWCA’s\ncomprehensive, reticulated regime for worker benefits—in\nwhich §906 plays a pivotal role—“awarded compensation”\nis much more sensibly interpreted to mean “statutorily\nentitled to compensation because of disability.”5\n                               1\n  Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA cases.\nAs explained above, see supra, at 3, the LHWCA requires\nemployers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast\nmajority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts’\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE GINSBURG’s view, not advanced by any party, is that an\n\nemployee is “awarded compensation” when his employer “voluntarily\npays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.” Post, at 3 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But reading “awarded\ncompensation” as synonymous with “receiving compensation” is farther\nfrom the ordinary meaning of “award” than the Court’s approach: A\nperson who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk\nwould not say that she had been “awarded money damages” if the\nbusiness responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills.\nCf. post, at 3–4.\n   Moreover, if Congress had intended “awarded compensation” to mean\n“receiving compensation,” it could have said so—as, in fact, it did\nin §906(c)’s parallel clause, which pertains to beneficiaries “currently\nreceiving compensation for permanent total disability or death.” See\nnn. 1–2, supra. JUSTICE GINSBURG’s reading denies effect to Congress’\ntextual shift, and therefore “runs afoul of the usual rule that ‘when the\nlegislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and differ­\nent language in another, the court assumes different meanings were\nintended.’ ” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004).\n   Nor is JUSTICE GINSBURG’s reliance on a single sentence of legislative\nhistory persuasive. See post, at 4–5. True, a Senate committee report\ndescribed those “newly awarded compensation” as those “who begin\nreceiving compensation.” S. Rep. No. 92–1125, p. 18 (1972). But a\nsubsequent House committee report did not. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 92–\n1441, p. 15 (1972) (statute provides a “method for determining maxi­\nmum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to persons currently\nreceiving compensation as well as those newly awarded compensa­\ntion)”). The legislative materials are a push.\n8           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of §906(c), no employee receiving voluntary\npayments has been “awarded compensation,” so none is\nsubject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.\nThat result is incompatible with the Act’s design. Sec-\ntion 906(b)(1) caps “[c]ompensation for disability or death\n(other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid\nin a lump sum)” at twice “the applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under para­\ngraph (3).” Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary\nto “determine” the national average weekly wage before\neach fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that\n“[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national\naverage weekly wage” for the coming fiscal year. And\n§906(c), in its turn, provides that “[d]eterminations under\nsubsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to” a fiscal year “shall\napply to . . . those newly awarded compensation during\nsuch” fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\nthree provisions work together to cap disability benefits.\n   By its terms, and subject to one express exception,\n§906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all\ndisability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the\ncap functions as Congress intended only if §906(c) also\napplies globally, to all such cases. See, e.g., FDA v. Brown\n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (“A\ncourt must . . . interpret the statute ‘as a symmetrical and\ncoherent regulatory scheme’ ” (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd\nCo., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts’ interpretation\nwere correct, §906(c) would have no application at all in\nthe many cases in which no formal orders issue, because\nemployers make voluntary payments or the parties reach\ninformal settlements. We will not construe §906(c) in a\nmanner that renders it “entirely superfluous in all but the\nmost unusual circumstances.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 29 (2001).\n   Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of §906(c),\nRoberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their\nemployees become disabled. This is a solution in search of\na problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are\nrare. Roberts’ interpretation would set needless adminis­\ntrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the con­\ngressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation\nand informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Rob­\nerts’ proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a\nvehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.\nSection 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an\nemployee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR §702.315(a)\napplies only in the case of a claim or an employer’s no-\ntice of controversion. See §702.301. We doubt that an em-\nployee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his\nemployer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read\n§906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of\ncontroversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. §§928(a), (d) (providing for\nassessment of attorney’s fees and costs against employers\nwho controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that\nemployers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to\ninduce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the\nadministrative process. Construing any workers’ compen­\nsation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation be­\ntween employers and employees strikes us as unsound.\n                              2\n   Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal\nyear in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with\nthe LHWCA’s administrative structure. Section 914(b)\nrequires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of\nnotice of an employee’s disability. To do so, an employer\nmust be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also\nnotify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by\nfiling a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the “maxi­\nmum rate is being paid.” Dept. of Labor, Form LS–206,\nPayment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online\n10            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf. On receipt of\nthis form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the\nrate of compensation in light of the applicable cap. See\nDept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual\n§2–201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Man-\nual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2­\n201.htm. It is difficult to see how an employer can apply\nor certify a national average weekly wage other than the\none in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.\nAn employer is powerless to predict when an employee\nmight file a claim, when a compensation order might\nissue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at\nthat later time. Likewise for a claims examiner.6\n  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage\nfor the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled\nadvances the LHWCA’s purpose to compensate disability,\ndefined as “incapacity because of injury to earn the wages\nwhich the employee was receiving at the time of injury.”\n33 U. S. C. §902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the\nLHWCA takes “the average weekly wage of the injured\nemployee at the time of the injury” as the “basis upon\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach is either easily circumvented or un­\n\nworkable. For example, JUSTICE GINSBURG determines that Roberts is\nentitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to\nJuly 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments\nduring that time. Post, at 6. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts\n$933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts\nwas entitled to receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at\n107, Order ¶1. If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an\nemployee’s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a\nlater finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act\nmight entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remain­\nder. See, e.g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730\n(2007). An employer who controverts is not subject to the Act’s delin­\nquency penalty. See 33 U. S. C. §914(e). Perhaps JUSTICE GINSBURG\ngives Sea-Land the benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments\nwere close to Roberts’ actual entitlement. But if that is so, then how\nclose is close enough?\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich to compute compensation,” §910, it is logical to\napply the national average weekly wage for the same point\nin time. Administrative practice has long treated the\ntime of injury as the relevant date. See, e.g., Dept. of\nLabor, Pamphlet LS–560, Workers’ Compensation Under\nthe Longshoremen’s Act (rev. Dec. 2003) (“Compensation\npayable under the Act may not exceed 200% of the nation­\nal average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury”),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm;\nDept. of Labor, Workers’ Compensation Under the Long­\nshoremen’s Act, Pamphlet LS–560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same);\nsee also, e.g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11–01,\np. 2 (2010) (national average weekly wage for particular\nfiscal year applies to “disability incurred during” that\nfiscal year).7\n   Applying the national average weekly wage at the time\nof onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi-\nlarly situated employees. Under Roberts’ reading, two em-\nployees who earn the same salary and suffer the same\ninjury on the same day could be entitled to different rates\n——————\n  7 Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and\nthe time of onset of disability differ. We have observed that “the\nLHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the disability\nproduced by that injury.” Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515\nU. S. 291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly\nconcluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the\nlatter is the relevant date for determining the applicable national\naverage weekly wage. See, e.g., Service Employees International, Inc. v.\nDirector, OWCP, 595 F. 3d 447, 456 (CA2 2010); Kubin v. Pro-Football,\nInc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per curiam).\n   Likewise, in a small group of cases—those in which disability lasts\nmore than 3 but less than 15 days—the time of onset of disability and\nthe time of entitlement will differ. See §906(a) (“No compensation shall\nbe allowed for the first three days of the disability . . . Provided, how-\never, That in case the injury results in disability of more than fourteen\ndays the compensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability”).\nIn these cases, the relevant date is that on which disability and enti­\ntlement coincide: the fourth day after the onset of disability.\n12            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nof compensation based on the happenstance of their ob­\ntaining orders in different fiscal years. We can imagine no\nreason why Congress would have intended, by choosing\nthe words “newly awarded compensation,” to differentiate\nbetween employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.\n                             3\n   Finally, using the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which disability commences discourages\ngamesmanship in the claims process. If the fiscal year in\nwhich an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact\nthat the national average weekly wage typically rises\nevery year with inflation, see n. 2, supra, would become\nunduly significant. Every employee affected by the cap\nwould seek the entry of a compensation order in a later\nfiscal year. Even an employee who has been receiving\ncompensation at the proper rate for years would be well\nadvised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to\nobtain an order at a later time. Likewise, an employee\nmight delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of\nan order. And even in an adjudicated case where an em­\nployer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate, an\nALJ would adopt the later fiscal year’s national average\nweekly wage, making the increased cap retroactively\napplicable to all of the employer’s payments. Roberts\ncandidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such\nperverse incentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58–59. We de­\ncline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with\nwindfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative pro­\nceedings, while simultaneously punishing employers who\nhave complied fully with their statutory obligations.\n                              III\n\n     We find Roberts’ counterarguments unconvincing. \n\n                             A\n     First, Roberts observes that some provisions of the\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nLHWCA clearly use “award” to mean “award in a formal\norder,” and contends that the same must be true of\n“awarded compensation” in §906(c). We agree that the Act\nsometimes uses “award” as Roberts urges. Section 914(a),\nfor example, refers to the payment of compensation “to the\nperson entitled thereto, without an award,” foreclosing the\nequation of “entitlement” and “award” that we adopt with\nrespect to §906(c) today.8 But the presumption that “iden­\ntical words used in different parts of the same act are\nintended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields\nwhenever there is such variation in the connection in\nwhich the words are used as reasonably to warrant the\nconclusion that they were employed in different parts of\nthe act with different intent.” General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.\n200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome\nbecause several provisions of the Act would make no sense\nif “award” were read as Roberts proposes. Those provi­\nsions confirm today’s holding because they too, in context,\nuse “award” to denote a statutory entitlement to compen­\nsation because of disability.\n   For example, §908(c)(20) provides that “[p]roper and\nequitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be\nawarded for serious disfigurement.” Roberts argues that\n§908(c)(20) “necessarily contemplates administrative\naction to fix the amount of the liability and direct its\n——————\n  8 Other LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean\n“award in a formal order.” For example, §§913(a) and 928(b), like\n§914(a), refer to the payment of compensation “without an award.” And\nthe LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due\nunder an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency.\nCompare §914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of “compensation\npayable without an award”) with §914(f) (20 percent penalty for late\npayment of “compensation, payable under the terms of an award”).\n14             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts’ view,\nno disfigured employee may receive benefits without in-\nvoking the administrative claims process. That argu-\nment, however, runs counter to §908’s preface, which\ndirects that “[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to\nthe employee,” and to §914(a), which requires the payment\nof compensation “without an award.” It is also belied by\nemployers’ practice of paying §908(c)(20) benefits volun­\ntarily. See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News\nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99–0627 etc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">35928576</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v.\nBergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98–1641, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35135283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the\nLHWCA’s interest in prompt payment and settled prac­\ntice, “awarded” in §908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in\n§906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee’s entitlement to\nbenefits.\n   Likewise, §908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is\nreceiving compensation for a scheduled disability9 dies\nbefore receiving the full amount of compensation to which\nthe schedule entitles him, “the total amount of the award\nunpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the\nbenefit of his survivors.” See also §908(d)(2). Roberts’\ninterpretation of “award” would introduce an odd gap:\nOnly survivors of those employees who were receiving\nschedule benefits pursuant to orders—not survivors of\nemployees who were receiving voluntary payments—\nwould be entitled to the unpaid balances due their dece­\ndents. There is no reason why Congress would have cho­\n——————\n  9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a “schedule” of particular injuries\n\nthat entitle an employee “to receive two-thirds of his average weekly\nwages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning\ncapacity has actually been impaired.” Potomac Elec. Power Co. v.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269\n(1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two­\nthirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. §908(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsen to distinguish between survivors in this manner. And\nthe Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted\n§908(d) to mean that “an employee has a vested interest in\nbenefits which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he\ndies, his estate is entitled to those benefits, regardless of\nwhen an award is made.” Wood v. Ingalls Shipbuilding,\nInc., 28 BRBS 27, 36 (1994) (per curiam).10\n  Finally, §933(b) provides: “For the purpose of this sub­\nsection, the term ‘award’ with respect to a compensation\norder means a formal order issued by the deputy commis­\nsioner, an administrative law judge, or Board.” Unless\naward may mean something other than “award in a com­\n——————\n  10 Roberts’ interpretation also would afford unwarranted significance\nto the entry of an order in other circumstances, resulting in arbi-\ntrary distinctions within other classes of beneficiaries. For example,\n§908(c)(22) provides that if an employee suffers from more than one\nscheduled disability, the “awards” for each “shall run consecutively.”\nUnder Roberts’ interpretation, §908(c)(22) would require consecutive\npayments only for employees who were receiving scheduled disability\nbenefits pursuant to orders; those receiving voluntary payments pre­\nsumably would be entitled to concurrent payments. See §§914(a)–(b).\nThat result would conflict with §908(c)(22)’s text, which states that\nconsecutive payments must be made “[i]n any case” involving multiple\nscheduled disabilities. See, e.g., Thornton v. Northrop Grumman\nShipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per curiam).\n  Similarly, §910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benefits\nfor pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress\nprovided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments. The first applies to those\nreceiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the\nsecond applies to those “awarded compensation . . . at less than the\nmaximum rate.” See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10–73, Ad­\njustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death\nPrior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp. 2–4 (1973). Roberts’ inter­\npretation would make the second formula applicable only to beneficiar­\nies receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all\nsuch beneficiaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress\nintended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. See ibid. (prescrib­\ning a “uniform” method for computing the increase in all “[c]ases being\ncompensated at less than the maximum rate,” with no reference to the\nexistence of an order).\n16          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npensation order,” this specific definition would be unnec­\nessary. Roberts contends that this provision, enacted in\n1984, “was indeed ‘unnecessary’ ” in light of Pallas Ship-\nping. Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U. S., at 534 (“The\nterm ‘compensation order’ in the LHWCA refers specifi­\ncally to an administrative award of compensation following\nproceedings with respect to the claim”). Roberts’ argu­\nment offends the canon against superfluity and neglects\nthat §933(b) defines the term “award,” whereas Pallas\nShipping defines the term “compensation order.” Moreo­\nver, Congress’ definition of “award,” which tracks Roberts’\npreferred interpretation, was carefully limited to §933(b).\nHad Congress intended to adopt a universal definition of\n“award,” it could have done so in §902, the LHWCA’s\nglossary. Read in light of the “duty to give effect, if possi­\nble, to every clause and word of a statute,” Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), §933(b) debunks Roberts’ argument that\nthe Act always uses “award” to mean “award in a formal\norder” and confirms that “award” has other meanings.\n                             B\n  Next, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read\nthe statutory phrase “person entitled to compensation” in\n§933(g) to mean “person awarded compensation.” See\nEstate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477\n(1992) (“[A] person entitled to compensation need not be\nreceiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his\nfavor”). In Roberts’ view, the converse must also be true:\n“awarded compensation” in §906(c) cannot mean “entitled\nto compensation.” But Cowart’s reasoning does not work\nin reverse. Cowart did not construe §906(c) or the term\n“award,” but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase\n“person entitled to compensation” in the LHWCA. See id.,\nat 478–479. As just explained, the LHWCA contains no\nuniform meaning of the term “award.” Moreover, Cowart\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not hold that the groups of “employees entitled to\ncompensation” and “employees awarded compensation”\nwere mutually exclusive. The former group includes the\nlatter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient\nbut not necessary condition for membership in the former.\nSee id., at 477.\n                               C\n   Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation fur­\nthers the LHWCA’s purpose of providing employees with\nprompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid\ndelay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Rob­\nerts’ remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily\npay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their\nemployees’ injuries. These employers would owe benefits\nunder the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year\nwhen their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts’\nremedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiar­\nies entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.\n   The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is\ninterest that “accrues from the date a benefit came due,\nrather than from the date of the ALJ’s award.” Matulic v.\nDirector, OWCP, 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The\nDirector has long taken the position that “interest is a\nnecessary and inherent component of ‘compensation’\nbecause it ensures that the delay in payment of compensa­\ntion does not diminish the amount of compensation to\nwhich the employee is entitled.” Sproull v. Director,\nOWCP, 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e.g., Stra-\nchan Shipping Co. v. Wedemeyer, 452 F. 2d 1225, 1229\n(CA5 1971). Moreover, “[t]imely controversion does not\nrelieve the responsible party from paying interest on\nunpaid compensation.” Longshore Procedure Manual §8­\n201, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8­\n201.htm. Indeed, the ALJ awarded Roberts interest “on\neach unpaid installment of compensation from the date\nthe compensation became due.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 108,\n18            ROBERTS v.

Specifically, §906 states that an injured\nemployee may receive, at most, twice the national average\nweekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee\nis “newly awarded compensation.” 33 U. S. C. §906(c).\nThe Court granted review in this case to answer the\nfollowing question: When is an employee “newly awarded\ncompensation”?\n   Petitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is\n“newly awarded compensation” in the year she receives\na formal compensation award. For the reasons cogently\nexplained by the majority, that argument is untenable.\nSee ante, at 5–17. Unlike the Court, however, I do not\nregard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services’ view\nthat an employee is “newly awarded compensation” in the\nyear she becomes “statutorily entitled to compensation.”\nAnte, at 5–6. Applying the common meaning of the verb\n“award” and recognizing the Act’s distinction between\nbenefits paid voluntarily, and those paid pursuant to a\ncompensation order, see ante, at 2–3, I would hold that an\ninjured worker is “newly awarded compensation” when (1)\n2          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to\nthe employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the\nBenefits Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders\nthe employer to pay such benefits.\n                               I\n   In determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, “we\nlook first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the verb\n“award” ordinarily means “to give by judicial decree” or\n“[to] assign after careful judgment.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 152 (2002). See also Black’s Law\nDictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (defining the verb “award”\nas “[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree”).\nGiving “award” this usual meaning, an employee is “newly\nawarded compensation,” if not voluntarily paid, in the fis-\ncal year in which payment is directed by administrative\norder or judicial decree.\n   Under the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee\nis provided compensation voluntarily or in contested pro-\nceedings. See ante, at 3. Most commonly, an employer\npays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employ-\nee’s notice of disabling injury. See Pallas Shipping Agen-\ncy, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983); 33 U. S. C.\n§912 (describing the form, content, and timing of the\nnecessary notice and requiring employers to designate a\nrepresentative to receive the notice); §914(b). If an em-\nployer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an in-\njured employee can file a claim with the Department of\nLabor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs\n(OWCP). For employees with valid claims, OWCP pro-\nceedings culminate with an administrative or court deci-\nsion ordering the employer to pay benefits. §919(c). Thus,\nan injured worker is given—or “awarded”—compensation\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthrough one of two means contemplated by the Act: either\nthe employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially\nordered to do so. Logically, then, the worker is “newly\nawarded compensation” when one of those two events\noccurs.\n   The Court does not take this approach. After acknowl-\nedging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the\nword “award,” see ante, at 5, the Court adopts Sea-Land’s\nview that “awarded compensation” is synonymous with\n“[became] statutorily entitled to benefits,” ante, at 18. As\na result, a person is “newly awarded compensation” in the\nyear in which she becomes entitled to benefits—i.e., in the\nyear the employee “first becomes disabled.” Ibid. Such a\nreading is plausible, the Court asserts, because “this Court\nhas often said that statutes ‘award’ entitlements.” Ante,\nat 6 (citing cases).\n   I do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as\n“awarding” relief to persons falling within their compass.\nBut “a statute must be read in [its] context.” Ante, at 7\n(quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.\n803, 809 (1989)). Section 906 does not address whether\nthe LHWCA, as a general matter, “awards” disability ben-\nefits to injured longshore workers. Rather, it concerns\na more specific question: when has a particular employee\nbeen “newly awarded compensation.” In that context,\nequating “awarded compensation” with “statutorily enti-\ntled to compensation” is not plausible. A person covered\nby the Act would not likely say he was “awarded com-\npensation” the moment he became disabled, if, in fact, his\nemployer contests liability. Only after some entity—the\nemployer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court—\nrecognizes the employee’s right to compensation would he\ncomprehend that he had been “awarded compensation.”\nTo borrow THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s example: No person who\nslips and injures herself on a negligently maintained\nsidewalk would tell her friends the next day, “Guess what,\n4              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nI was newly awarded money damages yesterday.” See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 28.\n   The inconsistency between the Court’s interpretation of\n“newly awarded compensation” and my reading of the\nphrase is best illustrated by contextual example. Assume\nan employee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses\nto pay compensation voluntarily. Then, five years later,\nan ALJ finds in favor of the employee and orders the\nemployer to pay benefits to the employee. Under the\nCourt’s view, the employee was “newly awarded compen-\nsation” in 2002, even though the employee did not receive\na penny—and the employer was not obligated to pay a\npenny—until 2007. Only the most strained interpretation\nof “newly awarded” could demand that result.1\n   The Court’s view, moreover, does not fit the Act’s design.\nAs explained supra, at 2–3, the Act envisions that an\neligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either\nof two ways. The Court’s interpretation disregards this\ndesign, assuming instead that all employees are awarded\nbenefits in the same way: by the Act at the time they\nbecome disabled.\n   Section 906(c)’s legislative history further confirms that\nCongress intended “newly awarded compensation” to have\nits commonsense meaning. In describing §906, the Senate\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare reported:\n——————\n   1 As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given fiscal year applies\n\nto two groups of injured workers: those who are “newly awarded com-\npensation during such [year],” and those who are “currently receiving\ncompensation for permanent total disability or death benefits during\nsuch [year].” 33 U. S. C. §906(c). Ante, at 7, n. 5. Contrary to the\nCourt’s charge, I do not read “newly awarded compensation” as synon-\nymous with “currently receiving compensation.” See ibid. An injured\nworker who is “currently receiving compensation” in a given fiscal year\nwas “newly awarded compensation” in a previous year. My interpreta-\ntion therefore gives “effect to Congress’ textual shift,” ibid.: It identifies\ntwo distinct groups of workers who are entitled to a given year’s maxi-\nmum rate.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n    “[Section 906(c)] states that determinations of nation-\n    al average weekly wage made with respect to a [fiscal\n    year] apply to employees or survivors currently receiv-\n    ing compensation for permanent total disability or\n    death benefits, as well as those who begin receiving\n    compensation for the first time during the [fiscal\n    year].” S. Rep. No. 92–1125, p. 18 (1972) (emphasis\n    added).\nCongress therefore believed an injured worker is “newly\nawarded compensation” in the year in which she “begin[s]\nreceiving compensation for the first time.” Ibid. Again,\nan employee begins receiving compensation either when an\nemployer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits\nor when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer\nto do so. See supra, at 2–3. When the employer resists\npayment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving\ncompensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.\n  Finally, interpreting “newly awarded compensation” to\nmean awarded through an employer’s voluntary decision\nor an official order is consistent with the Act’s goal of\nencouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.\nSee 33 U. S. C. §914(a) (requiring employers to pay com-\npensation “periodically, promptly, and directly”); Estate of\nCowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 498 (1992)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Act presumes that em-\nployers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA\nobligations and commence payments immediately.”).\nUnder my interpretation, an employer who chooses to\ncontest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim\nvoluntarily, runs the risk that it may ultimately have to\npay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit. For\nexample, if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a work-\ner injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding\ncompensation to the employee in 2015, the fiscal year 2015\nmaximum rate would apply to the employee’s claim. Had\n6            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in 2012,\non the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply.\nUnder the Court’s reading, by contrast, an employer pays\nthe prevailing rate for the year the employee became\ndisabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays\nbenefits immediately or years down the road.2\n                            II\n  In this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002\nand stopped working two weeks later. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 4. Sea-Land and its insurer paid benefits to Roberts\nfrom March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003. Id., at 101. Sea-\nLand then resumed paying benefits on September 1, 2003\nand continued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17,\n2005, when it ceased making payments for good. Ibid.\nAfter Roberts filed a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ,\nin October 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to\ncompensation from March 11, 2002 onwards. Id., at 107–\n108.\n  Applying my interpretation of §906, Roberts was newly\nawarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when\nSea-Land voluntarily began paying benefits; in September\n2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it\nhad stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an\nALJ ordered Sea-Land to pay benefits to Roberts for the\nuncompensated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 on-\nwards. Roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year\n2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002 until July 15,\n2003; the fiscal year 2003 maximum rate from September\n1, 2003 until May 17, 2005; and the fiscal year 2007 rate3\n——————\n  2 Employers may have a particularly strong financial incentive to\n\npostpone paying claims that implicate §906. That section applies only\nto injured workers who qualify for the maximum rate of compensation\nunder the Act—i.e., to those claimants who are owed the largest possi-\nble benefit.\n  3 For §906 purposes, a year runs from October 1 to September 30.

S. C. §906(b)(3). The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all\nemployees “newly awarded compensation” between October 1, 2006 and\nSeptember 30, 2007.\n  4 The Court asserts that an employer could “easily circumven[t]” my\n\napproach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are\nsubstantially below the employee’s “actual entitlement.” Ante, at 10,\nn. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or\nwould even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who\nmake voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report\nwith the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee’s\ninjury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 9–\n10; 33 U. S. C. §930(a). The employer must also submit the results of\na medical evaluation of the employee’s condition. Dept. of Labor,\nLongshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual §2–201(2)(b) (hereinafter Long-\nshore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/\nlspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar. 14, 2012, and in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Upon receiving the employer’s report, a DOL claims examin-\ner verifies “the compensation rate for accuracy” and must follow-\nup with the employer “[i]f the compensation rate appears low.” Long-\nshore Procedure Manual §2–201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a\nclaims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employ-\ners who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to\n10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. §914(e);\nLongshore Procedure Manual §8–202(3)(c) (“If partial payments are\nmade by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference\nbetween the amount owed and the amount paid.”). Employers would\nthus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to “circumven[t]”\nmy approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers. And\nwhile it is true that an employer who controverts an employee’s right to\ncompensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10,\nn. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes\nand controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. §914(a) (requiring\nemployers either to pay benefits in full or to controvert “liability to pay\ncompensation” at all).\n8          ROBERTS v.

Argued January 11, 2012—Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA) cre-\n  ates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible em-\n  ployee’s disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the\n  navigable waters of the United States. Benefits for most types of dis-\n  abilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the\n  fiscal year in which an injured employee is “newly awarded compen-\n  sation.” 33 U. S. C. §906(c). The LHWCA requires employers to pay\n  benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.\n  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no\n  compensation orders are issued. However, if an employer contro-\n  verts liability, or an employee contests his employer’s actions with\n  respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of La-\n  bor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be re-\n  solved, if possible, through informal procedures. An informal disposi-\n  tion may result in a compensation order. If not resolved informally,\n  the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who\n  conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.\n     In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska\n  marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services,\n  Inc. Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts\n  benefits until fiscal year 2005. Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim,\n  and Sea-Land controverted. In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded\n  Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.\n  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should\n  have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year\n  2007, when, he argued, he was “newly awarded compensation” by or-\n  der of the ALJ. The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of\n  Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the perti-\n2              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    nent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is “newly awarded compensation” when he first be-\n comes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,\n no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his be-\n half. Pp. 5−18.\n    (a) Roberts contends that the statutory term “awarded compensa-\n tion” means “awarded compensation in a formal order,” while Sea-\n Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means “statutorily\n entitled to compensation because of disability.” Although §906 can be\n interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director’s interpreta-\n tion makes §906 a working part of the statutory scheme. Under Rob-\n erts’ interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has\n been “awarded compensation,” so none is subject to an identifiable\n maximum rate of compensation. That result is incompatible with the\n LHWCA’s design. Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the\n applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Sec-\n retary of Labor. Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to\n determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it\n becomes the “applicable national average weekly wage” for the com-\n ing fiscal year. And §906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary’s\n determination shall apply to those “newly awarded compensation”\n during such fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\n three provisions work together to cap disability benefits. By its\n terms, and subject to one express exception, §906(b)(1) specifies that\n the cap applies globally, to all disability claims. Because all three\n provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if\n §906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. Roberts’ interpreta-\n tion would give §906(c) no application in the many cases in which no\n formal orders issue.\n    Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in\n which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA’s ad-\n ministrative structure. An employer must be able to calculate the\n cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee’s\n disability, see §914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of\n Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid. Similarly, an OWCP\n claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the\n applicable cap. It is difficult to see how an employer or claims exam-\n iner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in ef-\n fect at the time an employee becomes disabled. Moreover, applying\n the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an em-\n ployee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA’s purpose to compen-\n sate disability, defined as “incapacity because of injury to earn the\n wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.”\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  §902(10). It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated\n  employees; Roberts’ reading would permit two employees who earn\n  the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to re-\n  ceive different maximum compensation rates based on the happen-\n  stance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years. Finally, ap-\n  plying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which\n  disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims pro-\n  cess. If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the\n  cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with in-\n  flation would be unduly significant. Roberts’ rule would reward em-\n  ployees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating\n  unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate,\n  while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully\n  with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments. Pp.\n  5−13.\n     (b) Roberts’ counterarguments are unconvincing. First, although\n  the LHWCA sometimes uses “award” to mean “award in a formal or-\n  der,” the presumption that identical words used in different parts of\n  the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields\n  whenever, as here, the variation in the word’s use in the LHWCA\n  reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different\n  parts of the Act with different intent. See General Dynamics Land\n  Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595.\n     Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to\n  read the statutory phrase “person entitled to compensation” in\n  §933(g) to mean “person awarded compensation,” Estate of Cowart v.\n  Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477, the converse must also be\n  true: “awarded compensation” in §906(c) cannot mean “entitled to\n  compensation.” But Cowart’s reasoning does not work in reverse.\n  Cowart did not construe §906(c) or “award,” see id., at 478–479, and\n  it did not hold that the groups of “employees entitled to compensa-\n  tion” and “employees awarded compensation” were mutually exclu-\n  sive, see id., at 477.\n     Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the\n  LHWCA’s purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation\n  by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative\n  proceedings. But his remedy would also punish employers who vol-\n  untarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their em-\n  ployees’ injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher\n  cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to\n  file claims. The more measured deterrent to employer delay is inter-\n  est that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due. Pp. 13–\n  18.\n625 F. 3d 1204, affirmed.\n4             ROBERTS v.

C. §901 et seq., caps benefits for most types of dis-\nability at twice the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which an injured employee is “newly award­\ned compensation.” §906(c). We hold that an employee is\n“newly awarded compensation” when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene­\nfits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order\nissues on his behalf.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The LHWCA “is a comprehensive scheme to provide\ncompensation ‘in respect of disability or death of an em­\nployee . . . if the disability or death results from an in-\njury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United\nStates.’ ” Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S.\n291, 294 (1995) (quoting §903(a)). An employee’s compen­\nsation depends on the severity of his disability and his\npreinjury pay. A totally disabled employee, for example, is\n2             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to two-thirds of his preinjury average weekly\nwage as long as he remains disabled. §§908(a)–(b), 910.\n  Section 906, however, sets a cap on compensation.1\nDisability benefits “shall not exceed” twice “the applicable\nnational average weekly wage.” §906(b)(1). The national\naverage weekly wage—“the national average weekly earn­\nings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private\nnonagricultural payrolls,” §902(19)—is recalculated by the\nSecretary of Labor each fiscal year. §906(b)(3). For most\ntypes of disability, the “applicable” national average week­\nly wage is the figure for the fiscal year in which a benefi­\nciary is “newly awarded compensation,” and the cap re­\nmains constant as long as benefits continue. §906(c).2\n——————\n   1 Section 906 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n“(b) Maximum rate of compensation\n   “(1) Compensation for disability or death (other than compensation\nfor death required . . . to be paid in a lump sum) shall not exceed an\namount equal to 200 per centum of the applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3).\n              .           .           .           .           .\n   “(3) As soon as practicable after June 30 of each year, and in any\nevent prior to October 1 of such year, the Secretary shall determine\nthe national average weekly wage for the three consecutive calendar\nquarters ending June 30. Such determination shall be the applicable\nnational average weekly wage for the period beginning with October 1\nof that year and ending with September 30 of the next year. . . .\n“(c) Applicability of determinations\n   “Determinations under subsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to a period\nshall apply to employees or survivors currently receiving compensation\nfor permanent total disability or death benefits during such period, as\nwell as those newly awarded compensation during such period.”\n   2 For those “currently receiving compensation for permanent total\n\ndisability or death benefits,” §906(c), the cap is adjusted each fiscal\nyear—and typically increases, in step with the usual inflation-driven\nrise in the national average weekly wage. See Dept. of Labor, Division\nof Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation (DLHWC), NAWW\nInformation, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/NAWWinfo.htm\n(all Internet materials as visited Mar. 16, 2012, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file).

S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Consistent with the central bargain of workers’ compen­\nsation regimes—limited liability for employers; certain,\nprompt recovery for employees—the LHWCA requires that\nemployers pay benefits voluntarily, without formal admin­\nistrative proceedings. Once an employee provides notice of\na disabling injury, his employer must pay compensation\n“periodically, promptly, and directly . . . without an award,\nexcept where liability to pay compensation is controvert­\ned.” §914(a). In general, employers pay benefits without\ncontesting liability. See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v.\nDuris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983). In the mine run of cases,\ntherefore, no compensation orders issue.\n   If an employer controverts, or if an employee contests\nhis employer’s actions with respect to his benefits, the\ndispute advances to the Department of Labor’s Office of\nWorkers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP). See 20 CFR\n§§702.251–702.262 (2011). The OWCP district directors\n“are empowered to amicably and promptly resolve such\nproblems by informal procedures.” §702.301. A district\ndirector’s informal disposition may result in a compen-\nsation order. §702.315(a). In practice, however, “many\npending claims are amicably settled through voluntary\npayments without the necessity of a formal order.” Inter-\ncounty Constr. Corp. v. Walter, 422 U. S. 1, 4, n. 4 (1975).\nIf informal resolution fails, the district director refers the\ndispute to an administrative law judge (ALJ). See 20 CFR\n§§702.316, 702.331–702.351. An ALJ’s decision after a\nhearing culminates in the entry of a compensation order.\n33 U. S. C. §§919(c)–(e).3\n——————\n  3 In fiscal year 1971, only 209 cases out of the 17,784 in which com­\n\npensation was paid resulted in orders. Hearings on S. 2318 et al. before\nthe Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and\nPublic Welfare, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 757–758 (1972). Congress enacted\n§906’s predecessor provision, which included the “newly awarded\ncompensation” clause, in 1972. Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’\nCompensation Act Amendments of 1972, §5, 86 Stat. 1253.\n4            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Dana Roberts slipped and\nfell on a patch of ice while employed at respondent Sea-\nLand Services’ marine terminal in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.\nRoberts injured his neck and shoulder and did not return\nto work. On receiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land\n(except for a six-week period in 2003) voluntarily paid\nRoberts benefits absent a compensation order until fiscal\nyear 2005. When Sea-Land discontinued voluntary pay­\nments, Roberts filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land\ncontroverted. In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ\nawarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate\nof $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average\nweekly wage for fiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when\nRoberts became disabled.\n   Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the “ap­\nplicable” national average weekly wage was the figure\nfor fiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was “newly\nawarded compensation” by the ALJ’s order. The latter\nfigure would have entitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week.\nThe ALJ denied reconsideration, and the Department of\nLabor’s Benefits Review Board (or BRB) affirmed, conclud­\ning that “the pertinent maximum rate is determined by\nthe date the disability commences.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding\nthat an employee “is ‘newly awarded compensation’ within\nthe meaning of [§906(c)] when he first becomes entitled to\ncompensation.” Roberts v. Director, OWCP, 625 F. 3d\n1204, 1208 (2010) (per curiam). We granted certiorari, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits\nwith respect to the time when a beneficiary is “newly\nawarded compensation,” and now affirm.4\n——————\n  4 Compare 625 F. 3d 1204 (time of entitlement), with Wilkerson v.\n\nIngalls Shipbuilding, Inc., 125 F. 3d 904 (CA5 1997) (time of order),\nand Boroski v. DynCorp Int’l, 662 F. 3d 1197 (CA11 2011) (same).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                II\n   Roberts contends that “awarded compensation” means\n“awarded compensation in a formal order.” Sea-Land,\nsupported by the Director, OWCP, responds that “awarded\ncompensation” means “statutorily entitled to compensa­\ntion because of disability.” The text of §906(c), standing\nalone, admits of either interpretation. But “our task is to\nfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.” FTC\nv. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only\nthe interpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director\nmakes §906 a working part of the statutory scheme; sup­\nplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment\nof similarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesman­\nship in the claims process. In light of these contextual\nand structural considerations, we hold that an employee\nis “newly awarded compensation” when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene­\nfits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compen­\nsation order issues on his behalf.\n                               A\n   We first consider “whether the language at issue has\na plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the par-\nticular dispute in the case.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not define\n“awarded,” but in construing the Act, as with any statute,\n“ ‘we look first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.’ ” Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,\nOffice of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248,\n255 (1997) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). At first blush, Roberts’ position is ap­\npealing. In ordinary usage, “award” most often means\n“give by judicial decree” or “assign after careful judgment.”\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002);\nsee also, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009)\n(“grant by formal process or by judicial decree”).\n6           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   But “award” can also mean “grant,” or “confer or bestow\nupon.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, at\n152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA “grants”\nbenefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to\n“award” compensation by force of its entitlement-creating\nprovisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes\n“award” entitlements. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to “statutes that\naward attorney’s fees to a prevailing party”); Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (appendix to majority\nopinion) (slip op., at 19) (statute “awards” good-time cred­\nits to federal prisoners); New Energy Co. of Ind. v.\nLimbach, 486 U. S. 269, 271 (1988) (Ohio statute “awards\na tax credit”); Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial\nAccident Comm’n, 306 U. S. 493, 500 (1939) (California\nworkers’ compensation statute “award[s] compensation for\ninjuries to an employee”); see also, e.g., Connecticut v.\nDoehr, 501 U. S. 1, 28 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment) (“Materialman’s and\nmechanic’s lien statutes award an interest in real property\nto workers”). Similarly, this Court has described an em­\nployee’s survivors as “having been ‘newly awarded’ death\nbenefits” by virtue of the employee’s death, without any\nreference to a formal order. Director, Office of Workers’\nCompensation Programs v. Rasmussen, 440 U. S. 29, 44,\nn. 16 (1979) (quoting §906(c)’s predecessor provision, 33\nU. S. C. §906(d) (1976 ed.)).\n   In short, the text of §906(c), in isolation, is indetermi­\nnate.\n                            B\n   Statutory language, however, “cannot be construed in a\nvacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construc­\ntion that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statu­\ntory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 803, 809 (1989). In the context of the LHWCA’s\ncomprehensive, reticulated regime for worker benefits—in\nwhich §906 plays a pivotal role—“awarded compensation”\nis much more sensibly interpreted to mean “statutorily\nentitled to compensation because of disability.”5\n                               1\n  Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA cases.\nAs explained above, see supra, at 3, the LHWCA requires\nemployers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast\nmajority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts’\n——————\n   5 JUSTICE GINSBURG’s view, not advanced by any party, is that an\n\nemployee is “awarded compensation” when his employer “voluntarily\npays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.” Post, at 3 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But reading “awarded\ncompensation” as synonymous with “receiving compensation” is farther\nfrom the ordinary meaning of “award” than the Court’s approach: A\nperson who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk\nwould not say that she had been “awarded money damages” if the\nbusiness responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills.\nCf. post, at 3–4.\n   Moreover, if Congress had intended “awarded compensation” to mean\n“receiving compensation,” it could have said so—as, in fact, it did\nin §906(c)’s parallel clause, which pertains to beneficiaries “currently\nreceiving compensation for permanent total disability or death.” See\nnn. 1–2, supra. JUSTICE GINSBURG’s reading denies effect to Congress’\ntextual shift, and therefore “runs afoul of the usual rule that ‘when the\nlegislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and differ­\nent language in another, the court assumes different meanings were\nintended.’ ” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004).\n   Nor is JUSTICE GINSBURG’s reliance on a single sentence of legislative\nhistory persuasive. See post, at 4–5. True, a Senate committee report\ndescribed those “newly awarded compensation” as those “who begin\nreceiving compensation.” S. Rep. No. 92–1125, p. 18 (1972). But a\nsubsequent House committee report did not. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 92–\n1441, p. 15 (1972) (statute provides a “method for determining maxi­\nmum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to persons currently\nreceiving compensation as well as those newly awarded compensa­\ntion)”). The legislative materials are a push.\n8           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of §906(c), no employee receiving voluntary\npayments has been “awarded compensation,” so none is\nsubject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.\nThat result is incompatible with the Act’s design. Sec-\ntion 906(b)(1) caps “[c]ompensation for disability or death\n(other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid\nin a lump sum)” at twice “the applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under para­\ngraph (3).” Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary\nto “determine” the national average weekly wage before\neach fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that\n“[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national\naverage weekly wage” for the coming fiscal year. And\n§906(c), in its turn, provides that “[d]eterminations under\nsubsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to” a fiscal year “shall\napply to . . . those newly awarded compensation during\nsuch” fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\nthree provisions work together to cap disability benefits.\n   By its terms, and subject to one express exception,\n§906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all\ndisability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the\ncap functions as Congress intended only if §906(c) also\napplies globally, to all such cases. See, e.g., FDA v. Brown\n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (“A\ncourt must . . . interpret the statute ‘as a symmetrical and\ncoherent regulatory scheme’ ” (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd\nCo., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts’ interpretation\nwere correct, §906(c) would have no application at all in\nthe many cases in which no formal orders issue, because\nemployers make voluntary payments or the parties reach\ninformal settlements. We will not construe §906(c) in a\nmanner that renders it “entirely superfluous in all but the\nmost unusual circumstances.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 29 (2001).\n   Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of §906(c),\nRoberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their\nemployees become disabled. This is a solution in search of\na problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are\nrare. Roberts’ interpretation would set needless adminis­\ntrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the con­\ngressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation\nand informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Rob­\nerts’ proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a\nvehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.\nSection 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an\nemployee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR §702.315(a)\napplies only in the case of a claim or an employer’s no-\ntice of controversion. See §702.301. We doubt that an em-\nployee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his\nemployer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read\n§906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of\ncontroversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. §§928(a), (d) (providing for\nassessment of attorney’s fees and costs against employers\nwho controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that\nemployers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to\ninduce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the\nadministrative process. Construing any workers’ compen­\nsation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation be­\ntween employers and employees strikes us as unsound.\n                              2\n   Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal\nyear in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with\nthe LHWCA’s administrative structure. Section 914(b)\nrequires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of\nnotice of an employee’s disability. To do so, an employer\nmust be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also\nnotify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by\nfiling a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the “maxi­\nmum rate is being paid.” Dept. of Labor, Form LS–206,\nPayment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online\n10            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf. On receipt of\nthis form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the\nrate of compensation in light of the applicable cap. See\nDept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual\n§2–201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Man-\nual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2­\n201.htm. It is difficult to see how an employer can apply\nor certify a national average weekly wage other than the\none in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.\nAn employer is powerless to predict when an employee\nmight file a claim, when a compensation order might\nissue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at\nthat later time. Likewise for a claims examiner.6\n  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage\nfor the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled\nadvances the LHWCA’s purpose to compensate disability,\ndefined as “incapacity because of injury to earn the wages\nwhich the employee was receiving at the time of injury.”\n33 U. S. C. §902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the\nLHWCA takes “the average weekly wage of the injured\nemployee at the time of the injury” as the “basis upon\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach is either easily circumvented or un­\n\nworkable. For example, JUSTICE GINSBURG determines that Roberts is\nentitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to\nJuly 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments\nduring that time. Post, at 6. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts\n$933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts\nwas entitled to receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at\n107, Order ¶1. If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an\nemployee’s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a\nlater finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act\nmight entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remain­\nder. See, e.g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730\n(2007). An employer who controverts is not subject to the Act’s delin­\nquency penalty. See 33 U. S. C. §914(e). Perhaps JUSTICE GINSBURG\ngives Sea-Land the benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments\nwere close to Roberts’ actual entitlement. But if that is so, then how\nclose is close enough?\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich to compute compensation,” §910, it is logical to\napply the national average weekly wage for the same point\nin time. Administrative practice has long treated the\ntime of injury as the relevant date. See, e.g., Dept. of\nLabor, Pamphlet LS–560, Workers’ Compensation Under\nthe Longshoremen’s Act (rev. Dec. 2003) (“Compensation\npayable under the Act may not exceed 200% of the nation­\nal average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury”),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm;\nDept. of Labor, Workers’ Compensation Under the Long­\nshoremen’s Act, Pamphlet LS–560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same);\nsee also, e.g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11–01,\np. 2 (2010) (national average weekly wage for particular\nfiscal year applies to “disability incurred during” that\nfiscal year).7\n   Applying the national average weekly wage at the time\nof onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi-\nlarly situated employees. Under Roberts’ reading, two em-\nployees who earn the same salary and suffer the same\ninjury on the same day could be entitled to different rates\n——————\n  7 Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and\nthe time of onset of disability differ. We have observed that “the\nLHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the disability\nproduced by that injury.” Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515\nU. S. 291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly\nconcluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the\nlatter is the relevant date for determining the applicable national\naverage weekly wage. See, e.g., Service Employees International, Inc. v.\nDirector, OWCP, 595 F. 3d 447, 456 (CA2 2010); Kubin v. Pro-Football,\nInc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per curiam).\n   Likewise, in a small group of cases—those in which disability lasts\nmore than 3 but less than 15 days—the time of onset of disability and\nthe time of entitlement will differ. See §906(a) (“No compensation shall\nbe allowed for the first three days of the disability . . . Provided, how-\never, That in case the injury results in disability of more than fourteen\ndays the compensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability”).\nIn these cases, the relevant date is that on which disability and enti­\ntlement coincide: the fourth day after the onset of disability.\n12            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nof compensation based on the happenstance of their ob­\ntaining orders in different fiscal years. We can imagine no\nreason why Congress would have intended, by choosing\nthe words “newly awarded compensation,” to differentiate\nbetween employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.\n                             3\n   Finally, using the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which disability commences discourages\ngamesmanship in the claims process. If the fiscal year in\nwhich an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact\nthat the national average weekly wage typically rises\nevery year with inflation, see n. 2, supra, would become\nunduly significant. Every employee affected by the cap\nwould seek the entry of a compensation order in a later\nfiscal year. Even an employee who has been receiving\ncompensation at the proper rate for years would be well\nadvised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to\nobtain an order at a later time. Likewise, an employee\nmight delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of\nan order. And even in an adjudicated case where an em­\nployer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate, an\nALJ would adopt the later fiscal year’s national average\nweekly wage, making the increased cap retroactively\napplicable to all of the employer’s payments. Roberts\ncandidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such\nperverse incentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58–59. We de­\ncline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with\nwindfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative pro­\nceedings, while simultaneously punishing employers who\nhave complied fully with their statutory obligations.\n                              III\n\n     We find Roberts’ counterarguments unconvincing. \n\n                             A\n     First, Roberts observes that some provisions of the\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

We agree that the Act\nsometimes uses “award” as Roberts urges. Section 914(a),\nfor example, refers to the payment of compensation “to the\nperson entitled thereto, without an award,” foreclosing the\nequation of “entitlement” and “award” that we adopt with\nrespect to §906(c) today.8 But the presumption that “iden­\ntical words used in different parts of the same act are\nintended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields\nwhenever there is such variation in the connection in\nwhich the words are used as reasonably to warrant the\nconclusion that they were employed in different parts of\nthe act with different intent.” General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.\n200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome\nbecause several provisions of the Act would make no sense\nif “award” were read as Roberts proposes. Those provi­\nsions confirm today’s holding because they too, in context,\nuse “award” to denote a statutory entitlement to compen­\nsation because of disability.\n   For example, §908(c)(20) provides that “[p]roper and\nequitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be\nawarded for serious disfigurement.” Roberts argues that\n§908(c)(20) “necessarily contemplates administrative\naction to fix the amount of the liability and direct its\n——————\n  8 Other LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean\n“award in a formal order.” For example, §§913(a) and 928(b), like\n§914(a), refer to the payment of compensation “without an award.” And\nthe LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due\nunder an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency.\nCompare §914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of “compensation\npayable without an award”) with §914(f) (20 percent penalty for late\npayment of “compensation, payable under the terms of an award”).\n14             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts’ view,\nno disfigured employee may receive benefits without in-\nvoking the administrative claims process. That argu-\nment, however, runs counter to §908’s preface, which\ndirects that “[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to\nthe employee,” and to §914(a), which requires the payment\nof compensation “without an award.” It is also belied by\nemployers’ practice of paying §908(c)(20) benefits volun­\ntarily. See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News\nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99–0627 etc., 2000 WL\n35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v.\nBergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98–1641, 1999 WL 35135283,\n*1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the\nLHWCA’s interest in prompt payment and settled prac­\ntice, “awarded” in §908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in\n§906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee’s entitlement to\nbenefits.\n   Likewise, §908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is\nreceiving compensation for a scheduled disability9 dies\nbefore receiving the full amount of compensation to which\nthe schedule entitles him, “the total amount of the award\nunpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the\nbenefit of his survivors.” See also §908(d)(2). Roberts’\ninterpretation of “award” would introduce an odd gap:\nOnly survivors of those employees who were receiving\nschedule benefits pursuant to orders—not survivors of\nemployees who were receiving voluntary payments—\nwould be entitled to the unpaid balances due their dece­\ndents. There is no reason why Congress would have cho­\n——————\n  9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a “schedule” of particular injuries\n\nthat entitle an employee “to receive two-thirds of his average weekly\nwages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning\ncapacity has actually been impaired.” Potomac Elec. Power Co. v.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269\n(1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two­\nthirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. §908(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

And\nthe Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted\n§908(d) to mean that “an employee has a vested interest in\nbenefits which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he\ndies, his estate is entitled to those benefits, regardless of\nwhen an award is made.” Wood v. Ingalls Shipbuilding,\nInc., 28 BRBS 27, 36 (1994) (per curiam).10\n  Finally, §933(b) provides: “For the purpose of this sub­\nsection, the term ‘award’ with respect to a compensation\norder means a formal order issued by the deputy commis­\nsioner, an administrative law judge, or Board.” Unless\naward may mean something other than “award in a com­\n——————\n  10 Roberts’ interpretation also would afford unwarranted significance\nto the entry of an order in other circumstances, resulting in arbi-\ntrary distinctions within other classes of beneficiaries. For example,\n§908(c)(22) provides that if an employee suffers from more than one\nscheduled disability, the “awards” for each “shall run consecutively.”\nUnder Roberts’ interpretation, §908(c)(22) would require consecutive\npayments only for employees who were receiving scheduled disability\nbenefits pursuant to orders; those receiving voluntary payments pre­\nsumably would be entitled to concurrent payments. See §§914(a)–(b).\nThat result would conflict with §908(c)(22)’s text, which states that\nconsecutive payments must be made “[i]n any case” involving multiple\nscheduled disabilities. See, e.g., Thornton v. Northrop Grumman\nShipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per curiam).\n  Similarly, §910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benefits\nfor pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress\nprovided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments. The first applies to those\nreceiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the\nsecond applies to those “awarded compensation . . . at less than the\nmaximum rate.” See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10–73, Ad­\njustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death\nPrior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp. 2–4 (1973). Roberts’ inter­\npretation would make the second formula applicable only to beneficiar­\nies receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all\nsuch beneficiaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress\nintended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. See ibid. (prescrib­\ning a “uniform” method for computing the increase in all “[c]ases being\ncompensated at less than the maximum rate,” with no reference to the\nexistence of an order).\n16          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npensation order,” this specific definition would be unnec­\nessary. Roberts contends that this provision, enacted in\n1984, “was indeed ‘unnecessary’ ” in light of Pallas Ship-\nping. Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U. S., at 534 (“The\nterm ‘compensation order’ in the LHWCA refers specifi­\ncally to an administrative award of compensation following\nproceedings with respect to the claim”). Roberts’ argu­\nment offends the canon against superfluity and neglects\nthat §933(b) defines the term “award,” whereas Pallas\nShipping defines the term “compensation order.” Moreo­\nver, Congress’ definition of “award,” which tracks Roberts’\npreferred interpretation, was carefully limited to §933(b).\nHad Congress intended to adopt a universal definition of\n“award,” it could have done so in §902, the LHWCA’s\nglossary. Read in light of the “duty to give effect, if possi­\nble, to every clause and word of a statute,” Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), §933(b) debunks Roberts’ argument that\nthe Act always uses “award” to mean “award in a formal\norder” and confirms that “award” has other meanings.\n                             B\n  Next, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read\nthe statutory phrase “person entitled to compensation” in\n§933(g) to mean “person awarded compensation.” See\nEstate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477\n(1992) (“[A] person entitled to compensation need not be\nreceiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his\nfavor”). In Roberts’ view, the converse must also be true:\n“awarded compensation” in §906(c) cannot mean “entitled\nto compensation.” But Cowart’s reasoning does not work\nin reverse. Cowart did not construe §906(c) or the term\n“award,” but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase\n“person entitled to compensation” in the LHWCA. See id.,\nat 478–479. As just explained, the LHWCA contains no\nuniform meaning of the term “award.” Moreover, Cowart\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not hold that the groups of “employees entitled to\ncompensation” and “employees awarded compensation”\nwere mutually exclusive. The former group includes the\nlatter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient\nbut not necessary condition for membership in the former.\nSee id., at 477.\n                               C\n   Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation fur­\nthers the LHWCA’s purpose of providing employees with\nprompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid\ndelay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Rob­\nerts’ remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily\npay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their\nemployees’ injuries. These employers would owe benefits\nunder the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year\nwhen their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts’\nremedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiar­\nies entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.\n   The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is\ninterest that “accrues from the date a benefit came due,\nrather than from the date of the ALJ’s award.” Matulic v.\nDirector, OWCP, 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The\nDirector has long taken the position that “interest is a\nnecessary and inherent component of ‘compensation’\nbecause it ensures that the delay in payment of compensa­\ntion does not diminish the amount of compensation to\nwhich the employee is entitled.” Sproull v. Director,\nOWCP, 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e.g., Stra-\nchan Shipping Co. v. Wedemeyer, 452 F. 2d 1225, 1229\n(CA5 1971). Moreover, “[t]imely controversion does not\nrelieve the responsible party from paying interest on\nunpaid compensation.” Longshore Procedure Manual §8­\n201, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8­\n201.htm. Indeed, the ALJ awarded Roberts interest “on\neach unpaid installment of compensation from the date\nthe compensation became due.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 108,\n18            ROBERTS v.

Specifically, §906 states that an injured\nemployee may receive, at most, twice the national average\nweekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee\nis “newly awarded compensation.” 33 U. S. C. §906(c).\nThe Court granted review in this case to answer the\nfollowing question: When is an employee “newly awarded\ncompensation”?\n   Petitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is\n“newly awarded compensation” in the year she receives\na formal compensation award. For the reasons cogently\nexplained by the majority, that argument is untenable.\nSee ante, at 5–17. Unlike the Court, however, I do not\nregard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services’ view\nthat an employee is “newly awarded compensation” in the\nyear she becomes “statutorily entitled to compensation.”\nAnte, at 5–6. Applying the common meaning of the verb\n“award” and recognizing the Act’s distinction between\nbenefits paid voluntarily, and those paid pursuant to a\ncompensation order, see ante, at 2–3, I would hold that an\ninjured worker is “newly awarded compensation” when (1)\n2          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to\nthe employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the\nBenefits Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders\nthe employer to pay such benefits.\n                               I\n   In determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, “we\nlook first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the verb\n“award” ordinarily means “to give by judicial decree” or\n“[to] assign after careful judgment.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 152 (2002). See also Black’s Law\nDictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (defining the verb “award”\nas “[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree”).\nGiving “award” this usual meaning, an employee is “newly\nawarded compensation,” if not voluntarily paid, in the fis-\ncal year in which payment is directed by administrative\norder or judicial decree.\n   Under the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee\nis provided compensation voluntarily or in contested pro-\nceedings. See ante, at 3. Most commonly, an employer\npays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employ-\nee’s notice of disabling injury. See Pallas Shipping Agen-\ncy, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983); 33 U. S. C.\n§912 (describing the form, content, and timing of the\nnecessary notice and requiring employers to designate a\nrepresentative to receive the notice); §914(b). If an em-\nployer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an in-\njured employee can file a claim with the Department of\nLabor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs\n(OWCP). For employees with valid claims, OWCP pro-\nceedings culminate with an administrative or court deci-\nsion ordering the employer to pay benefits. §919(c). Thus,\nan injured worker is given—or “awarded”—compensation\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthrough one of two means contemplated by the Act: either\nthe employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially\nordered to do so. Logically, then, the worker is “newly\nawarded compensation” when one of those two events\noccurs.\n   The Court does not take this approach. After acknowl-\nedging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the\nword “award,” see ante, at 5, the Court adopts Sea-Land’s\nview that “awarded compensation” is synonymous with\n“[became] statutorily entitled to benefits,” ante, at 18. As\na result, a person is “newly awarded compensation” in the\nyear in which she becomes entitled to benefits—i.e., in the\nyear the employee “first becomes disabled.” Ibid. Such a\nreading is plausible, the Court asserts, because “this Court\nhas often said that statutes ‘award’ entitlements.” Ante,\nat 6 (citing cases).\n   I do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as\n“awarding” relief to persons falling within their compass.\nBut “a statute must be read in [its] context.” Ante, at 7\n(quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.\n803, 809 (1989)). Section 906 does not address whether\nthe LHWCA, as a general matter, “awards” disability ben-\nefits to injured longshore workers. Rather, it concerns\na more specific question: when has a particular employee\nbeen “newly awarded compensation.” In that context,\nequating “awarded compensation” with “statutorily enti-\ntled to compensation” is not plausible. A person covered\nby the Act would not likely say he was “awarded com-\npensation” the moment he became disabled, if, in fact, his\nemployer contests liability. Only after some entity—the\nemployer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court—\nrecognizes the employee’s right to compensation would he\ncomprehend that he had been “awarded compensation.”\nTo borrow THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s example: No person who\nslips and injures herself on a negligently maintained\nsidewalk would tell her friends the next day, “Guess what,\n4              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nI was newly awarded money damages yesterday.” See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 28.\n   The inconsistency between the Court’s interpretation of\n“newly awarded compensation” and my reading of the\nphrase is best illustrated by contextual example. Assume\nan employee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses\nto pay compensation voluntarily. Then, five years later,\nan ALJ finds in favor of the employee and orders the\nemployer to pay benefits to the employee. Under the\nCourt’s view, the employee was “newly awarded compen-\nsation” in 2002, even though the employee did not receive\na penny—and the employer was not obligated to pay a\npenny—until 2007. Only the most strained interpretation\nof “newly awarded” could demand that result.1\n   The Court’s view, moreover, does not fit the Act’s design.\nAs explained supra, at 2–3, the Act envisions that an\neligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either\nof two ways. The Court’s interpretation disregards this\ndesign, assuming instead that all employees are awarded\nbenefits in the same way: by the Act at the time they\nbecome disabled.\n   Section 906(c)’s legislative history further confirms that\nCongress intended “newly awarded compensation” to have\nits commonsense meaning. In describing §906, the Senate\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare reported:\n——————\n   1 As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given fiscal year applies\n\nto two groups of injured workers: those who are “newly awarded com-\npensation during such [year],” and those who are “currently receiving\ncompensation for permanent total disability or death benefits during\nsuch [year].” 33 U. S. C. §906(c). Ante, at 7, n. 5. Contrary to the\nCourt’s charge, I do not read “newly awarded compensation” as synon-\nymous with “currently receiving compensation.” See ibid. An injured\nworker who is “currently receiving compensation” in a given fiscal year\nwas “newly awarded compensation” in a previous year. My interpreta-\ntion therefore gives “effect to Congress’ textual shift,” ibid.: It identifies\ntwo distinct groups of workers who are entitled to a given year’s maxi-\nmum rate.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n    “[Section 906(c)] states that determinations of nation-\n    al average weekly wage made with respect to a [fiscal\n    year] apply to employees or survivors currently receiv-\n    ing compensation for permanent total disability or\n    death benefits, as well as those who begin receiving\n    compensation for the first time during the [fiscal\n    year].” S. Rep. No. 92–1125, p. 18 (1972) (emphasis\n    added).\nCongress therefore believed an injured worker is “newly\nawarded compensation” in the year in which she “begin[s]\nreceiving compensation for the first time.” Ibid. Again,\nan employee begins receiving compensation either when an\nemployer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits\nor when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer\nto do so. See supra, at 2–3. When the employer resists\npayment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving\ncompensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.\n  Finally, interpreting “newly awarded compensation” to\nmean awarded through an employer’s voluntary decision\nor an official order is consistent with the Act’s goal of\nencouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.\nSee 33 U. S. C. §914(a) (requiring employers to pay com-\npensation “periodically, promptly, and directly”); Estate of\nCowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 498 (1992)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Act presumes that em-\nployers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA\nobligations and commence payments immediately.”).\nUnder my interpretation, an employer who chooses to\ncontest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim\nvoluntarily, runs the risk that it may ultimately have to\npay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit. For\nexample, if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a work-\ner injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding\ncompensation to the employee in 2015, the fiscal year 2015\nmaximum rate would apply to the employee’s claim. Had\n6            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in 2012,\non the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply.\nUnder the Court’s reading, by contrast, an employer pays\nthe prevailing rate for the year the employee became\ndisabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays\nbenefits immediately or years down the road.2\n                            II\n  In this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002\nand stopped working two weeks later. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 4. Sea-Land and its insurer paid benefits to Roberts\nfrom March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003. Id., at 101. Sea-\nLand then resumed paying benefits on September 1, 2003\nand continued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17,\n2005, when it ceased making payments for good. Ibid.\nAfter Roberts filed a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ,\nin October 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to\ncompensation from March 11, 2002 onwards. Id., at 107–\n108.\n  Applying my interpretation of §906, Roberts was newly\nawarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when\nSea-Land voluntarily began paying benefits; in September\n2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it\nhad stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an\nALJ ordered Sea-Land to pay benefits to Roberts for the\nuncompensated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 on-\nwards. Roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year\n2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002 until July 15,\n2003; the fiscal year 2003 maximum rate from September\n1, 2003 until May 17, 2005; and the fiscal year 2007 rate3\n——————\n  2 Employers may have a particularly strong financial incentive to\n\npostpone paying claims that implicate §906. That section applies only\nto injured workers who qualify for the maximum rate of compensation\nunder the Act—i.e., to those claimants who are owed the largest possi-\nble benefit.\n  3 For §906 purposes, a year runs from October 1 to September 30.

S. C. §906(b)(3). The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all\nemployees “newly awarded compensation” between October 1, 2006 and\nSeptember 30, 2007.\n  4 The Court asserts that an employer could “easily circumven[t]” my\n\napproach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are\nsubstantially below the employee’s “actual entitlement.” Ante, at 10,\nn. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or\nwould even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who\nmake voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report\nwith the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee’s\ninjury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 9–\n10; 33 U. S. C. §930(a). The employer must also submit the results of\na medical evaluation of the employee’s condition.

Upon receiving the employer’s report, a DOL claims examin-\ner verifies “the compensation rate for accuracy” and must follow-\nup with the employer “[i]f the compensation rate appears low.” Long-\nshore Procedure Manual §2–201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a\nclaims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employ-\ners who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to\n10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. §914(e);\nLongshore Procedure Manual §8–202(3)(c) (“If partial payments are\nmade by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference\nbetween the amount owed and the amount paid.”). Employers would\nthus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to “circumven[t]”\nmy approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers. And\nwhile it is true that an employer who controverts an employee’s right to\ncompensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10,\nn. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes\nand controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. §914(a) (requiring\nemployers either to pay benefits in full or to controvert “liability to pay\ncompensation” at all).\n8          ROBERTS v.
