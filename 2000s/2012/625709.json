SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10\u20131399. Argued January 11, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) cre-\n  ates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible em-\n  ployee\u2019s disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the\n  navigable waters of the United States. Benefits for most types of dis-\n  abilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the\n  fiscal year in which an injured employee is \u201cnewly awarded compen-\n  sation.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(c). The LHWCA requires employers to pay\n  benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.\n  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no\n  compensation orders are issued. However, if an employer contro-\n  verts liability, or an employee contests his employer\u2019s actions with\n  respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of La-\n  bor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be re-\n  solved, if possible, through informal procedures. An informal disposi-\n  tion may result in a compensation order. If not resolved informally,\n  the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who\n  conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.\n     In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska\n  marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services,\n  Inc. Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts\n  benefits until fiscal year 2005. Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim,\n  and Sea-Land controverted. In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded\n  Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.\n  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should\n  have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year\n  2007, when, he argued, he was \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d by or-\n  der of the ALJ. The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of\n  Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the perti-\n2              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    nent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when he first be-\n comes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,\n no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his be-\n half. Pp. 5\u221218.\n    (a) Roberts contends that the statutory term \u201cawarded compensa-\n tion\u201d means \u201cawarded compensation in a formal order,\u201d while Sea-\n Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means \u201cstatutorily\n entitled to compensation because of disability.\u201d Although \u00a7906 can be\n interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director\u2019s interpreta-\n tion makes \u00a7906 a working part of the statutory scheme. Under Rob-\n erts\u2019 interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has\n been \u201cawarded compensation,\u201d so none is subject to an identifiable\n maximum rate of compensation. That result is incompatible with the\n LHWCA\u2019s design. Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the\n applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Sec-\n retary of Labor. Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to\n determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it\n becomes the \u201capplicable national average weekly wage\u201d for the com-\n ing fiscal year. And \u00a7906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary\u2019s\n determination shall apply to those \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d\n during such fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\n three provisions work together to cap disability benefits. By its\n terms, and subject to one express exception, \u00a7906(b)(1) specifies that\n the cap applies globally, to all disability claims. Because all three\n provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if\n \u00a7906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. Roberts\u2019 interpreta-\n tion would give \u00a7906(c) no application in the many cases in which no\n formal orders issue.\n    Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in\n which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA\u2019s ad-\n ministrative structure. An employer must be able to calculate the\n cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee\u2019s\n disability, see \u00a7914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of\n Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid. Similarly, an OWCP\n claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the\n applicable cap. It is difficult to see how an employer or claims exam-\n iner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in ef-\n fect at the time an employee becomes disabled. Moreover, applying\n the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an em-\n ployee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA\u2019s purpose to compen-\n sate disability, defined as \u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the\n wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a7902(10). It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated\n  employees; Roberts\u2019 reading would permit two employees who earn\n  the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to re-\n  ceive different maximum compensation rates based on the happen-\n  stance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years. Finally, ap-\n  plying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which\n  disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims pro-\n  cess. If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the\n  cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with in-\n  flation would be unduly significant. Roberts\u2019 rule would reward em-\n  ployees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating\n  unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate,\n  while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully\n  with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments. Pp.\n  5\u221213.\n     (b) Roberts\u2019 counterarguments are unconvincing. First, although\n  the LHWCA sometimes uses \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal or-\n  der,\u201d the presumption that identical words used in different parts of\n  the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields\n  whenever, as here, the variation in the word\u2019s use in the LHWCA\n  reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different\n  parts of the Act with different intent. See General Dynamics Land\n  Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595.\n     Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to\n  read the statutory phrase \u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in\n  \u00a7933(g) to mean \u201cperson awarded compensation,\u201d Estate of Cowart v.\n  Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477, the converse must also be\n  true: \u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c) cannot mean \u201centitled to\n  compensation.\u201d But Cowart\u2019s reasoning does not work in reverse.\n  Cowart did not construe \u00a7906(c) or \u201caward,\u201d see id., at 478\u2013479, and\n  it did not hold that the groups of \u201cemployees entitled to compensa-\n  tion\u201d and \u201cemployees awarded compensation\u201d were mutually exclu-\n  sive, see id., at 477.\n     Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the\n  LHWCA\u2019s purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation\n  by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative\n  proceedings. But his remedy would also punish employers who vol-\n  untarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their em-\n  ployees\u2019 injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher\n  cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to\n  file claims. The more measured deterrent to employer delay is inter-\n  est that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due. Pp. 13\u2013\n  18.\n625 F. 3d 1204, affirmed.\n4             ROBERTS v.

S. C. \u00a7901 et seq., caps benefits for most types of dis-\nability at twice the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which an injured employee is \u201cnewly award\u00ad\ned compensation.\u201d \u00a7906(c). We hold that an employee is\n\u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene\u00ad\nfits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order\nissues on his behalf.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The LHWCA \u201cis a comprehensive scheme to provide\ncompensation \u2018in respect of disability or death of an em\u00ad\nployee . . . if the disability or death results from an in-\njury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United\nStates.\u2019 \u201d Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U. S.\n291, 294 (1995) (quoting \u00a7903(a)). An employee\u2019s compen\u00ad\nsation depends on the severity of his disability and his\npreinjury pay. A totally disabled employee, for example, is\n2             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to two-thirds of his preinjury average weekly\nwage as long as he remains disabled. \u00a7\u00a7908(a)\u2013(b), 910.\n  Section 906, however, sets a cap on compensation.1\nDisability benefits \u201cshall not exceed\u201d twice \u201cthe applicable\nnational average weekly wage.\u201d \u00a7906(b)(1).

In general, employers pay benefits without\ncontesting liability. See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v.\nDuris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983). In the mine run of cases,\ntherefore, no compensation orders issue.\n   If an employer controverts, or if an employee contests\nhis employer\u2019s actions with respect to his benefits, the\ndispute advances to the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP).

On receiving notice of his disability, Sea-Land\n(except for a six-week period in 2003) voluntarily paid\nRoberts benefits absent a compensation order until fiscal\nyear 2005. When Sea-Land discontinued voluntary pay\u00ad\nments, Roberts filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land\ncontroverted. In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ\nawarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate\nof $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average\nweekly wage for fiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when\nRoberts became disabled.\n   Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the \u201cap\u00ad\nplicable\u201d national average weekly wage was the figure\nfor fiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s order. The latter\nfigure would have entitled Roberts to $1,114.44 per week.\nThe ALJ denied reconsideration, and the Department of\nLabor\u2019s Benefits Review Board (or BRB) affirmed, conclud\u00ad\ning that \u201cthe pertinent maximum rate is determined by\nthe date the disability commences.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n20.

But \u201cour task is to\nfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\u201d FTC\nv. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only\nthe interpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director\nmakes \u00a7906 a working part of the statutory scheme; sup\u00ad\nplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment\nof similarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesman\u00ad\nship in the claims process. In light of these contextual\nand structural considerations, we hold that an employee\nis \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene\u00ad\nfits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compen\u00ad\nsation order issues on his behalf.\n                               A\n   We first consider \u201cwhether the language at issue has\na plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the par-\nticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v.

In ordinary usage, \u201caward\u201d most often means\n\u201cgive by judicial decree\u201d or \u201cassign after careful judgment.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002);\nsee also, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009)\n(\u201cgrant by formal process or by judicial decree\u201d).\n6           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   But \u201caward\u201d can also mean \u201cgrant,\u201d or \u201cconfer or bestow\nupon.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at\n152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA \u201cgrants\u201d\nbenefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to\n\u201caward\u201d compensation by force of its entitlement-creating\nprovisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes\n\u201caward\u201d entitlements. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to \u201cstatutes that\naward attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party\u201d); Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U.

Similarly, this Court has described an em\u00ad\nployee\u2019s survivors as \u201chaving been \u2018newly awarded\u2019 death\nbenefits\u201d by virtue of the employee\u2019s death, without any\nreference to a formal order.

C. \u00a7906(d) (1976 ed.)).\n   In short, the text of \u00a7906(c), in isolation, is indetermi\u00ad\nnate.\n                            B\n   Statutory language, however, \u201ccannot be construed in a\nvacuum. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construc\u00ad\ntion that the words of a statute must be read in their\ncontext and with a view to their place in the overall statu\u00ad\ntory scheme.\u201d Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 803, 809 (1989). In the context of the LHWCA\u2019s\ncomprehensive, reticulated regime for worker benefits\u2014in\nwhich \u00a7906 plays a pivotal role\u2014\u201cawarded compensation\u201d\nis much more sensibly interpreted to mean \u201cstatutorily\nentitled to compensation because of disability.\u201d5\n                               1\n  Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA cases.\nAs explained above, see supra, at 3, the LHWCA requires\nemployers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast\nmajority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s view, not advanced by any party, is that an\n\nemployee is \u201cawarded compensation\u201d when his employer \u201cvoluntarily\npays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But reading \u201cawarded\ncompensation\u201d as synonymous with \u201creceiving compensation\u201d is farther\nfrom the ordinary meaning of \u201caward\u201d than the Court\u2019s approach: A\nperson who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk\nwould not say that she had been \u201cawarded money damages\u201d if the\nbusiness responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills.\nCf. post, at 3\u20134.\n   Moreover, if Congress had intended \u201cawarded compensation\u201d to mean\n\u201creceiving compensation,\u201d it could have said so\u2014as, in fact, it did\nin \u00a7906(c)\u2019s parallel clause, which pertains to beneficiaries \u201ccurrently\nreceiving compensation for permanent total disability or death.\u201d See\nnn. 1\u20132, supra. JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s reading denies effect to Congress\u2019\ntextual shift, and therefore \u201cruns afoul of the usual rule that \u2018when the\nlegislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and differ\u00ad\nent language in another, the court assumes different meanings were\nintended.\u2019 \u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004).\n   Nor is JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s reliance on a single sentence of legislative\nhistory persuasive. See post, at 4\u20135. True, a Senate committee report\ndescribed those \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d as those \u201cwho begin\nreceiving compensation.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u20131125, p. 18 (1972). But a\nsubsequent House committee report did not. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 92\u2013\n1441, p. 15 (1972) (statute provides a \u201cmethod for determining maxi\u00ad\nmum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to persons currently\nreceiving compensation as well as those newly awarded compensa\u00ad\ntion)\u201d). The legislative materials are a push.\n8           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of \u00a7906(c), no employee receiving voluntary\npayments has been \u201cawarded compensation,\u201d so none is\nsubject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.\nThat result is incompatible with the Act\u2019s design. Sec-\ntion 906(b)(1) caps \u201c[c]ompensation for disability or death\n(other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid\nin a lump sum)\u201d at twice \u201cthe applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under para\u00ad\ngraph (3).\u201d Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary\nto \u201cdetermine\u201d the national average weekly wage before\neach fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that\n\u201c[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national\naverage weekly wage\u201d for the coming fiscal year. And\n\u00a7906(c), in its turn, provides that \u201c[d]eterminations under\nsubsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to\u201d a fiscal year \u201cshall\napply to . . . those newly awarded compensation during\nsuch\u201d fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\nthree provisions work together to cap disability benefits.\n   By its terms, and subject to one express exception,\n\u00a7906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all\ndisability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the\ncap functions as Congress intended only if \u00a7906(c) also\napplies globally, to all such cases. See, e.g., FDA v. Brown\n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (\u201cA\ncourt must . . . interpret the statute \u2018as a symmetrical and\ncoherent regulatory scheme\u2019 \u201d (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd\nCo., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts\u2019 interpretation\nwere correct, \u00a7906(c) would have no application at all in\nthe many cases in which no formal orders issue, because\nemployers make voluntary payments or the parties reach\ninformal settlements. We will not construe \u00a7906(c) in a\nmanner that renders it \u201centirely superfluous in all but the\nmost unusual circumstances.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 29 (2001).\n   Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of \u00a7906(c),\nRoberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their\nemployees become disabled. This is a solution in search of\na problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are\nrare. Roberts\u2019 interpretation would set needless adminis\u00ad\ntrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the con\u00ad\ngressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation\nand informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Rob\u00ad\nerts\u2019 proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a\nvehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.\nSection 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an\nemployee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR \u00a7702.315(a)\napplies only in the case of a claim or an employer\u2019s no-\ntice of controversion. See \u00a7702.301. We doubt that an em-\nployee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his\nemployer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read\n\u00a7906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of\ncontroversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7928(a), (d) (providing for\nassessment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs against employers\nwho controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that\nemployers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to\ninduce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the\nadministrative process. Construing any workers\u2019 compen\u00ad\nsation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation be\u00ad\ntween employers and employees strikes us as unsound.\n                              2\n   Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal\nyear in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with\nthe LHWCA\u2019s administrative structure. Section 914(b)\nrequires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of\nnotice of an employee\u2019s disability. To do so, an employer\nmust be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also\nnotify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by\nfiling a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the \u201cmaxi\u00ad\nmum rate is being paid.\u201d Dept. of Labor, Form LS\u2013206,\nPayment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online\n10            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf. On receipt of\nthis form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the\nrate of compensation in light of the applicable cap. See\nDept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual\n\u00a72\u2013201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Man-\nual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2\u00ad\n201.htm. It is difficult to see how an employer can apply\nor certify a national average weekly wage other than the\none in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.\nAn employer is powerless to predict when an employee\nmight file a claim, when a compensation order might\nissue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at\nthat later time. Likewise for a claims examiner.6\n  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage\nfor the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled\nadvances the LHWCA\u2019s purpose to compensate disability,\ndefined as \u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages\nwhich the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\u201d\n33 U. S. C. \u00a7902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the\nLHWCA takes \u201cthe average weekly wage of the injured\nemployee at the time of the injury\u201d as the \u201cbasis upon\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach is either easily circumvented or un\u00ad\n\nworkable. For example, JUSTICE GINSBURG determines that Roberts is\nentitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to\nJuly 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments\nduring that time. Post, at 6. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts\n$933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts\nwas entitled to receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at\n107, Order \u00b61. If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an\nemployee\u2019s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a\nlater finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act\nmight entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remain\u00ad\nder. See, e.g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730\n(2007). An employer who controverts is not subject to the Act\u2019s delin\u00ad\nquency penalty. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(e). Perhaps JUSTICE GINSBURG\ngives Sea-Land the benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments\nwere close to Roberts\u2019 actual entitlement. But if that is so, then how\nclose is close enough?\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich to compute compensation,\u201d \u00a7910, it is logical to\napply the national average weekly wage for the same point\nin time. Administrative practice has long treated the\ntime of injury as the relevant date. See, e.g., Dept. of\nLabor, Pamphlet LS\u2013560, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under\nthe Longshoremen\u2019s Act (rev. Dec. 2003) (\u201cCompensation\npayable under the Act may not exceed 200% of the nation\u00ad\nal average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury\u201d),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm;\nDept. of Labor, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under the Long\u00ad\nshoremen\u2019s Act, Pamphlet LS\u2013560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same);\nsee also, e.g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11\u201301,\np. 2 (2010) (national average weekly wage for particular\nfiscal year applies to \u201cdisability incurred during\u201d that\nfiscal year).7\n   Applying the national average weekly wage at the time\nof onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi-\nlarly situated employees. Under Roberts\u2019 reading, two em-\nployees who earn the same salary and suffer the same\ninjury on the same day could be entitled to different rates\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and\nthe time of onset of disability differ. We have observed that \u201cthe\nLHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the disability\nproduced by that injury.\u201d Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515\nU. S. 291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly\nconcluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the\nlatter is the relevant date for determining the applicable national\naverage weekly wage. See, e.g., Service Employees International, Inc. v.\nDirector, OWCP, 595 F. 3d 447, 456 (CA2 2010); Kubin v. Pro-Football,\nInc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per curiam).\n   Likewise, in a small group of cases\u2014those in which disability lasts\nmore than 3 but less than 15 days\u2014the time of onset of disability and\nthe time of entitlement will differ. See \u00a7906(a) (\u201cNo compensation shall\nbe allowed for the first three days of the disability . . . Provided, how-\never, That in case the injury results in disability of more than fourteen\ndays the compensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability\u201d).\nIn these cases, the relevant date is that on which disability and enti\u00ad\ntlement coincide: the fourth day after the onset of disability.\n12            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nof compensation based on the happenstance of their ob\u00ad\ntaining orders in different fiscal years. We can imagine no\nreason why Congress would have intended, by choosing\nthe words \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d to differentiate\nbetween employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.\n                             3\n   Finally, using the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which disability commences discourages\ngamesmanship in the claims process. If the fiscal year in\nwhich an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact\nthat the national average weekly wage typically rises\nevery year with inflation, see n. 2, supra, would become\nunduly significant. Every employee affected by the cap\nwould seek the entry of a compensation order in a later\nfiscal year. Even an employee who has been receiving\ncompensation at the proper rate for years would be well\nadvised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to\nobtain an order at a later time. Likewise, an employee\nmight delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of\nan order. And even in an adjudicated case where an em\u00ad\nployer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate, an\nALJ would adopt the later fiscal year\u2019s national average\nweekly wage, making the increased cap retroactively\napplicable to all of the employer\u2019s payments. Roberts\ncandidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such\nperverse incentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\u201359. We de\u00ad\ncline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with\nwindfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative pro\u00ad\nceedings, while simultaneously punishing employers who\nhave complied fully with their statutory obligations.\n                              III\n\n     We find Roberts\u2019 counterarguments unconvincing. \n\n                             A\n     First, Roberts observes that some provisions of the\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nLHWCA clearly use \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal\norder,\u201d and contends that the same must be true of\n\u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c). We agree that the Act\nsometimes uses \u201caward\u201d as Roberts urges. Section 914(a),\nfor example, refers to the payment of compensation \u201cto the\nperson entitled thereto, without an award,\u201d foreclosing the\nequation of \u201centitlement\u201d and \u201caward\u201d that we adopt with\nrespect to \u00a7906(c) today.8 But the presumption that \u201ciden\u00ad\ntical words used in different parts of the same act are\nintended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields\nwhenever there is such variation in the connection in\nwhich the words are used as reasonably to warrant the\nconclusion that they were employed in different parts of\nthe act with different intent.\u201d General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.\n200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome\nbecause several provisions of the Act would make no sense\nif \u201caward\u201d were read as Roberts proposes. Those provi\u00ad\nsions confirm today\u2019s holding because they too, in context,\nuse \u201caward\u201d to denote a statutory entitlement to compen\u00ad\nsation because of disability.\n   For example, \u00a7908(c)(20) provides that \u201c[p]roper and\nequitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be\nawarded for serious disfigurement.\u201d Roberts argues that\n\u00a7908(c)(20) \u201cnecessarily contemplates administrative\naction to fix the amount of the liability and direct its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Other LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean\n\u201caward in a formal order.\u201d For example, \u00a7\u00a7913(a) and 928(b), like\n\u00a7914(a), refer to the payment of compensation \u201cwithout an award.\u201d And\nthe LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due\nunder an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency.\nCompare \u00a7914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of \u201ccompensation\npayable without an award\u201d) with \u00a7914(f) (20 percent penalty for late\npayment of \u201ccompensation, payable under the terms of an award\u201d).\n14             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts\u2019 view,\nno disfigured employee may receive benefits without in-\nvoking the administrative claims process. That argu-\nment, however, runs counter to \u00a7908\u2019s preface, which\ndirects that \u201c[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to\nthe employee,\u201d and to \u00a7914(a), which requires the payment\nof compensation \u201cwithout an award.\u201d It is also belied by\nemployers\u2019 practice of paying \u00a7908(c)(20) benefits volun\u00ad\ntarily. See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News\nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99\u20130627 etc., 2000 WL\n35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v.\nBergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98\u20131641, 1999 WL 35135283,\n*1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the\nLHWCA\u2019s interest in prompt payment and settled prac\u00ad\ntice, \u201cawarded\u201d in \u00a7908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in\n\u00a7906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee\u2019s entitlement to\nbenefits.\n   Likewise, \u00a7908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is\nreceiving compensation for a scheduled disability9 dies\nbefore receiving the full amount of compensation to which\nthe schedule entitles him, \u201cthe total amount of the award\nunpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the\nbenefit of his survivors.\u201d See also \u00a7908(d)(2). Roberts\u2019\ninterpretation of \u201caward\u201d would introduce an odd gap:\nOnly survivors of those employees who were receiving\nschedule benefits pursuant to orders\u2014not survivors of\nemployees who were receiving voluntary payments\u2014\nwould be entitled to the unpaid balances due their dece\u00ad\ndents. There is no reason why Congress would have cho\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a \u201cschedule\u201d of particular injuries\n\nthat entitle an employee \u201cto receive two-thirds of his average weekly\nwages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning\ncapacity has actually been impaired.\u201d Potomac Elec. Power Co. v.\nDirector, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269\n(1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two\u00ad\nthirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. \u00a7908(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

And\nthe Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted\n\u00a7908(d) to mean that \u201can employee has a vested interest in\nbenefits which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he\ndies, his estate is entitled to those benefits, regardless of\nwhen an award is made.\u201d Wood v. Ingalls Shipbuilding,\nInc., 28 BRBS 27, 36 (1994) (per curiam).10\n  Finally, \u00a7933(b) provides: \u201cFor the purpose of this sub\u00ad\nsection, the term \u2018award\u2019 with respect to a compensation\norder means a formal order issued by the deputy commis\u00ad\nsioner, an administrative law judge, or Board.\u201d Unless\naward may mean something other than \u201caward in a com\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Roberts\u2019 interpretation also would afford unwarranted significance\nto the entry of an order in other circumstances, resulting in arbi-\ntrary distinctions within other classes of beneficiaries. For example,\n\u00a7908(c)(22) provides that if an employee suffers from more than one\nscheduled disability, the \u201cawards\u201d for each \u201cshall run consecutively.\u201d\nUnder Roberts\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7908(c)(22) would require consecutive\npayments only for employees who were receiving scheduled disability\nbenefits pursuant to orders; those receiving voluntary payments pre\u00ad\nsumably would be entitled to concurrent payments. See \u00a7\u00a7914(a)\u2013(b).\nThat result would conflict with \u00a7908(c)(22)\u2019s text, which states that\nconsecutive payments must be made \u201c[i]n any case\u201d involving multiple\nscheduled disabilities. See, e.g., Thornton v. Northrop Grumman\nShipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per curiam).\n  Similarly, \u00a7910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benefits\nfor pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress\nprovided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments. The first applies to those\nreceiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the\nsecond applies to those \u201cawarded compensation . . . at less than the\nmaximum rate.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10\u201373, Ad\u00ad\njustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death\nPrior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp. 2\u20134 (1973). Roberts\u2019 inter\u00ad\npretation would make the second formula applicable only to beneficiar\u00ad\nies receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all\nsuch beneficiaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress\nintended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. See ibid. (prescrib\u00ad\ning a \u201cuniform\u201d method for computing the increase in all \u201c[c]ases being\ncompensated at less than the maximum rate,\u201d with no reference to the\nexistence of an order).\n16          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npensation order,\u201d this specific definition would be unnec\u00ad\nessary. Roberts contends that this provision, enacted in\n1984, \u201cwas indeed \u2018unnecessary\u2019 \u201d in light of Pallas Ship-\nping. Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U. S., at 534 (\u201cThe\nterm \u2018compensation order\u2019 in the LHWCA refers specifi\u00ad\ncally to an administrative award of compensation following\nproceedings with respect to the claim\u201d). Roberts\u2019 argu\u00ad\nment offends the canon against superfluity and neglects\nthat \u00a7933(b) defines the term \u201caward,\u201d whereas Pallas\nShipping defines the term \u201ccompensation order.\u201d Moreo\u00ad\nver, Congress\u2019 definition of \u201caward,\u201d which tracks Roberts\u2019\npreferred interpretation, was carefully limited to \u00a7933(b).\nHad Congress intended to adopt a universal definition of\n\u201caward,\u201d it could have done so in \u00a7902, the LHWCA\u2019s\nglossary. Read in light of the \u201cduty to give effect, if possi\u00ad\nble, to every clause and word of a statute,\u201d Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), \u00a7933(b) debunks Roberts\u2019 argument that\nthe Act always uses \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal\norder\u201d and confirms that \u201caward\u201d has other meanings.\n                             B\n  Next, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read\nthe statutory phrase \u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in\n\u00a7933(g) to mean \u201cperson awarded compensation.\u201d See\nEstate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477\n(1992) (\u201c[A] person entitled to compensation need not be\nreceiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his\nfavor\u201d). In Roberts\u2019 view, the converse must also be true:\n\u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c) cannot mean \u201centitled\nto compensation.\u201d But Cowart\u2019s reasoning does not work\nin reverse. Cowart did not construe \u00a7906(c) or the term\n\u201caward,\u201d but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase\n\u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in the LHWCA. See id.,\nat 478\u2013479. As just explained, the LHWCA contains no\nuniform meaning of the term \u201caward.\u201d Moreover, Cowart\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

The former group includes the\nlatter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient\nbut not necessary condition for membership in the former.\nSee id., at 477.\n                               C\n   Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation fur\u00ad\nthers the LHWCA\u2019s purpose of providing employees with\nprompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid\ndelay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Rob\u00ad\nerts\u2019 remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily\npay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their\nemployees\u2019 injuries. These employers would owe benefits\nunder the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year\nwhen their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts\u2019\nremedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiar\u00ad\nies entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.\n   The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is\ninterest that \u201caccrues from the date a benefit came due,\nrather than from the date of the ALJ\u2019s award.\u201d Matulic v.\nDirector, OWCP, 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The\nDirector has long taken the position that \u201cinterest is a\nnecessary and inherent component of \u2018compensation\u2019\nbecause it ensures that the delay in payment of compensa\u00ad\ntion does not diminish the amount of compensation to\nwhich the employee is entitled.\u201d Sproull v. Director,\nOWCP, 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e.g., Stra-\nchan Shipping Co. v. Wedemeyer, 452 F. 2d 1225, 1229\n(CA5 1971). Moreover, \u201c[t]imely controversion does not\nrelieve the responsible party from paying interest on\nunpaid compensation.\u201d Longshore Procedure Manual \u00a78\u00ad\n201, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8\u00ad\n201.htm. Indeed, the ALJ awarded Roberts interest \u201con\neach unpaid installment of compensation from the date\nthe compensation became due.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 108,\n18            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nOrder \u00b65.11\n                        *   *     *\n   We hold that an employee is \u201cnewly awarded compensa\u00ad\ntion\u201d when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes\nstatutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or\nwhen, a compensation order issues on his behalf.12 The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is\naffirmed.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Thus,  as under JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach, an employer who\ncontroverts still \u201cruns the risk\u201d of greater liability if an ALJ awards an\nemployee compensation at some point subsequent to the onset of\ndisability. See post, at 5.\n  12 Because \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d read in context, is unam\u00ad\n\nbiguous, we do not reach respondents\u2019 argument that the Director\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a7906(c) is entitled to deference under Chevron U.

Specifically, \u00a7906 states that an injured\nemployee may receive, at most, twice the national average\nweekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee\nis \u201cnewly awarded compensation.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(c).\nThe Court granted review in this case to answer the\nfollowing question: When is an employee \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d?\n   Petitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is\n\u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the year she receives\na formal compensation award. For the reasons cogently\nexplained by the majority, that argument is untenable.\nSee ante, at 5\u201317. Unlike the Court, however, I do not\nregard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services\u2019 view\nthat an employee is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the\nyear she becomes \u201cstatutorily entitled to compensation.\u201d\nAnte, at 5\u20136. Applying the common meaning of the verb\n\u201caward\u201d and recognizing the Act\u2019s distinction between\nbenefits paid voluntarily, and those paid pursuant to a\ncompensation order, see ante, at 2\u20133, I would hold that an\ninjured worker is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when (1)\n2          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to\nthe employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the\nBenefits Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders\nthe employer to pay such benefits.\n                               I\n   In determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, \u201cwe\nlook first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.\u201d Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the verb\n\u201caward\u201d ordinarily means \u201cto give by judicial decree\u201d or\n\u201c[to] assign after careful judgment.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 152 (2002). See also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (defining the verb \u201caward\u201d\nas \u201c[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree\u201d).\nGiving \u201caward\u201d this usual meaning, an employee is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation,\u201d if not voluntarily paid, in the fis-\ncal year in which payment is directed by administrative\norder or judicial decree.\n   Under the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee\nis provided compensation voluntarily or in contested pro-\nceedings. See ante, at 3. Most commonly, an employer\npays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employ-\nee\u2019s notice of disabling injury. See Pallas Shipping Agen-\ncy, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983); 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a7912 (describing the form, content, and timing of the\nnecessary notice and requiring employers to designate a\nrepresentative to receive the notice); \u00a7914(b). If an em-\nployer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an in-\njured employee can file a claim with the Department of\nLabor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs\n(OWCP). For employees with valid claims, OWCP pro-\nceedings culminate with an administrative or court deci-\nsion ordering the employer to pay benefits. \u00a7919(c). Thus,\nan injured worker is given\u2014or \u201cawarded\u201d\u2014compensation\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthrough one of two means contemplated by the Act: either\nthe employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially\nordered to do so. Logically, then, the worker is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d when one of those two events\noccurs.\n   The Court does not take this approach. After acknowl-\nedging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the\nword \u201caward,\u201d see ante, at 5, the Court adopts Sea-Land\u2019s\nview that \u201cawarded compensation\u201d is synonymous with\n\u201c[became] statutorily entitled to benefits,\u201d ante, at 18. As\na result, a person is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the\nyear in which she becomes entitled to benefits\u2014i.e., in the\nyear the employee \u201cfirst becomes disabled.\u201d Ibid. Such a\nreading is plausible, the Court asserts, because \u201cthis Court\nhas often said that statutes \u2018award\u2019 entitlements.\u201d Ante,\nat 6 (citing cases).\n   I do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as\n\u201cawarding\u201d relief to persons falling within their compass.\nBut \u201ca statute must be read in [its] context.\u201d Ante, at 7\n(quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.\n803, 809 (1989)). Section 906 does not address whether\nthe LHWCA, as a general matter, \u201cawards\u201d disability ben-\nefits to injured longshore workers. Rather, it concerns\na more specific question: when has a particular employee\nbeen \u201cnewly awarded compensation.\u201d In that context,\nequating \u201cawarded compensation\u201d with \u201cstatutorily enti-\ntled to compensation\u201d is not plausible. A person covered\nby the Act would not likely say he was \u201cawarded com-\npensation\u201d the moment he became disabled, if, in fact, his\nemployer contests liability. Only after some entity\u2014the\nemployer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court\u2014\nrecognizes the employee\u2019s right to compensation would he\ncomprehend that he had been \u201cawarded compensation.\u201d\nTo borrow THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s example: No person who\nslips and injures herself on a negligently maintained\nsidewalk would tell her friends the next day, \u201cGuess what,\n4              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nI was newly awarded money damages yesterday.\u201d See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 28.\n   The inconsistency between the Court\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d and my reading of the\nphrase is best illustrated by contextual example. Assume\nan employee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses\nto pay compensation voluntarily. Then, five years later,\nan ALJ finds in favor of the employee and orders the\nemployer to pay benefits to the employee. Under the\nCourt\u2019s view, the employee was \u201cnewly awarded compen-\nsation\u201d in 2002, even though the employee did not receive\na penny\u2014and the employer was not obligated to pay a\npenny\u2014until 2007. Only the most strained interpretation\nof \u201cnewly awarded\u201d could demand that result.1\n   The Court\u2019s view, moreover, does not fit the Act\u2019s design.\nAs explained supra, at 2\u20133, the Act envisions that an\neligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either\nof two ways. The Court\u2019s interpretation disregards this\ndesign, assuming instead that all employees are awarded\nbenefits in the same way: by the Act at the time they\nbecome disabled.\n   Section 906(c)\u2019s legislative history further confirms that\nCongress intended \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d to have\nits commonsense meaning. In describing \u00a7906, the Senate\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare reported:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given fiscal year applies\n\nto two groups of injured workers: those who are \u201cnewly awarded com-\npensation during such [year],\u201d and those who are \u201ccurrently receiving\ncompensation for permanent total disability or death benefits during\nsuch [year].\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(c). Ante, at 7, n. 5. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s charge, I do not read \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d as synon-\nymous with \u201ccurrently receiving compensation.\u201d See ibid. An injured\nworker who is \u201ccurrently receiving compensation\u201d in a given fiscal year\nwas \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in a previous year. My interpreta-\ntion therefore gives \u201ceffect to Congress\u2019 textual shift,\u201d ibid.: It identifies\ntwo distinct groups of workers who are entitled to a given year\u2019s maxi-\nmum rate.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n    \u201c[Section 906(c)] states that determinations of nation-\n    al average weekly wage made with respect to a [fiscal\n    year] apply to employees or survivors currently receiv-\n    ing compensation for permanent total disability or\n    death benefits, as well as those who begin receiving\n    compensation for the first time during the [fiscal\n    year].\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u20131125, p. 18 (1972) (emphasis\n    added).\nCongress therefore believed an injured worker is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d in the year in which she \u201cbegin[s]\nreceiving compensation for the first time.\u201d Ibid. Again,\nan employee begins receiving compensation either when an\nemployer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits\nor when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer\nto do so. See supra, at 2\u20133. When the employer resists\npayment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving\ncompensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.\n  Finally, interpreting \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d to\nmean awarded through an employer\u2019s voluntary decision\nor an official order is consistent with the Act\u2019s goal of\nencouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.\nSee 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(a) (requiring employers to pay com-\npensation \u201cperiodically, promptly, and directly\u201d); Estate of\nCowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 498 (1992)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Act presumes that em-\nployers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA\nobligations and commence payments immediately.\u201d).\nUnder my interpretation, an employer who chooses to\ncontest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim\nvoluntarily, runs the risk that it may ultimately have to\npay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit. For\nexample, if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a work-\ner injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding\ncompensation to the employee in 2015, the fiscal year 2015\nmaximum rate would apply to the employee\u2019s claim. Had\n6            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in 2012,\non the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply.\nUnder the Court\u2019s reading, by contrast, an employer pays\nthe prevailing rate for the year the employee became\ndisabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays\nbenefits immediately or years down the road.2\n                            II\n  In this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002\nand stopped working two weeks later. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 4. Sea-Land and its insurer paid benefits to Roberts\nfrom March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003. Id., at 101. Sea-\nLand then resumed paying benefits on September 1, 2003\nand continued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17,\n2005, when it ceased making payments for good. Ibid.\nAfter Roberts filed a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ,\nin October 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to\ncompensation from March 11, 2002 onwards. Id., at 107\u2013\n108.\n  Applying my interpretation of \u00a7906, Roberts was newly\nawarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when\nSea-Land voluntarily began paying benefits; in September\n2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it\nhad stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an\nALJ ordered Sea-Land to pay benefits to Roberts for the\nuncompensated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 on-\nwards. Roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year\n2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002 until July 15,\n2003; the fiscal year 2003 maximum rate from September\n1, 2003 until May 17, 2005; and the fiscal year 2007 rate3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Employers may have a particularly strong financial incentive to\n\npostpone paying claims that implicate \u00a7906.

The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all\nemployees \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d between October 1, 2006 and\nSeptember 30, 2007.\n  4 The Court asserts that an employer could \u201ceasily circumven[t]\u201d my\n\napproach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are\nsubstantially below the employee\u2019s \u201cactual entitlement.\u201d Ante, at 10,\nn. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or\nwould even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who\nmake voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report\nwith the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee\u2019s\ninjury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 9\u2013\n10; 33 U. S. C. \u00a7930(a). The employer must also submit the results of\na medical evaluation of the employee\u2019s condition. Dept. of Labor,\nLongshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \u00a72\u2013201(2)(b) (hereinafter Long-\nshore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/\nlspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar. 14, 2012, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). Upon receiving the employer\u2019s report, a DOL claims examin-\ner verifies \u201cthe compensation rate for accuracy\u201d and must follow-\nup with the employer \u201c[i]f the compensation rate appears low.\u201d Long-\nshore Procedure Manual \u00a72\u2013201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a\nclaims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employ-\ners who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to\n10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(e);\nLongshore Procedure Manual \u00a78\u2013202(3)(c) (\u201cIf partial payments are\nmade by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference\nbetween the amount owed and the amount paid.\u201d). Employers would\nthus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to \u201ccircumven[t]\u201d\nmy approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers. And\nwhile it is true that an employer who controverts an employee\u2019s right to\ncompensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10,\nn. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes\nand controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(a) (requiring\nemployers either to pay benefits in full or to controvert \u201cliability to pay\ncompensation\u201d at all).\n8          ROBERTS v.

SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10\u20131399. Argued January 11, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA) cre-\n  ates a comprehensive scheme to pay compensation for an eligible em-\n  ployee\u2019s disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the\n  navigable waters of the United States. Benefits for most types of dis-\n  abilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the\n  fiscal year in which an injured employee is \u201cnewly awarded compen-\n  sation.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(c). The LHWCA requires employers to pay\n  benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.\n  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no\n  compensation orders are issued. However, if an employer contro-\n  verts liability, or an employee contests his employer\u2019s actions with\n  respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of La-\n  bor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be re-\n  solved, if possible, through informal procedures. An informal disposi-\n  tion may result in a compensation order. If not resolved informally,\n  the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who\n  conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.\n     In fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska\n  marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services,\n  Inc. Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts\n  benefits until fiscal year 2005. Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim,\n  and Sea-Land controverted. In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded\n  Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.\n  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should\n  have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year\n  2007, when, he argued, he was \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d by or-\n  der of the ALJ. The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of\n  Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the perti-\n2              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    nent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when he first be-\n comes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits,\n no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his be-\n half. Pp. 5\u221218.\n    (a) Roberts contends that the statutory term \u201cawarded compensa-\n tion\u201d means \u201cawarded compensation in a formal order,\u201d while Sea-\n Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means \u201cstatutorily\n entitled to compensation because of disability.\u201d Although \u00a7906 can be\n interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director\u2019s interpreta-\n tion makes \u00a7906 a working part of the statutory scheme. Under Rob-\n erts\u2019 interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has\n been \u201cawarded compensation,\u201d so none is subject to an identifiable\n maximum rate of compensation. That result is incompatible with the\n LHWCA\u2019s design. Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the\n applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Sec-\n retary of Labor. Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to\n determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it\n becomes the \u201capplicable national average weekly wage\u201d for the com-\n ing fiscal year. And \u00a7906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary\u2019s\n determination shall apply to those \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d\n during such fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\n three provisions work together to cap disability benefits. By its\n terms, and subject to one express exception, \u00a7906(b)(1) specifies that\n the cap applies globally, to all disability claims. Because all three\n provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if\n \u00a7906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases. Roberts\u2019 interpreta-\n tion would give \u00a7906(c) no application in the many cases in which no\n formal orders issue.\n    Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in\n which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA\u2019s ad-\n ministrative structure. An employer must be able to calculate the\n cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee\u2019s\n disability, see \u00a7914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of\n Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid. Similarly, an OWCP\n claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the\n applicable cap. It is difficult to see how an employer or claims exam-\n iner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in ef-\n fect at the time an employee becomes disabled. Moreover, applying\n the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an em-\n ployee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA\u2019s purpose to compen-\n sate disability, defined as \u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the\n wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a7902(10). It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated\n  employees; Roberts\u2019 reading would permit two employees who earn\n  the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to re-\n  ceive different maximum compensation rates based on the happen-\n  stance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years. Finally, ap-\n  plying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which\n  disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims pro-\n  cess. If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the\n  cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with in-\n  flation would be unduly significant. Roberts\u2019 rule would reward em-\n  ployees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating\n  unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate,\n  while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully\n  with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments. Pp.\n  5\u221213.\n     (b) Roberts\u2019 counterarguments are unconvincing. First, although\n  the LHWCA sometimes uses \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal or-\n  der,\u201d the presumption that identical words used in different parts of\n  the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields\n  whenever, as here, the variation in the word\u2019s use in the LHWCA\n  reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different\n  parts of the Act with different intent. See General Dynamics Land\n  Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595.\n     Second, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to\n  read the statutory phrase \u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in\n  \u00a7933(g) to mean \u201cperson awarded compensation,\u201d Estate of Cowart v.\n  Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477, the converse must also be\n  true: \u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c) cannot mean \u201centitled to\n  compensation.\u201d But Cowart\u2019s reasoning does not work in reverse.\n  Cowart did not construe \u00a7906(c) or \u201caward,\u201d see id., at 478\u2013479, and\n  it did not hold that the groups of \u201cemployees entitled to compensa-\n  tion\u201d and \u201cemployees awarded compensation\u201d were mutually exclu-\n  sive, see id., at 477.\n     Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the\n  LHWCA\u2019s purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation\n  by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative\n  proceedings. But his remedy would also punish employers who vol-\n  untarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their em-\n  ployees\u2019 injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher\n  cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to\n  file claims. The more measured deterrent to employer delay is inter-\n  est that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due. Pp. 13\u2013\n  18.\n625 F. 3d 1204, affirmed.\n4             ROBERTS v.

In fiscal year 2007, after a hearing, an ALJ\nawarded Roberts benefits at the statutory maximum rate\nof $966.08 per week. This was twice the national average\nweekly wage for fiscal year 2002, the fiscal year when\nRoberts became disabled.\n   Roberts moved for reconsideration, arguing that the \u201cap\u00ad\nplicable\u201d national average weekly wage was the figure\nfor fiscal year 2007, the fiscal year when he was \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d by the ALJ\u2019s order.

But \u201cour task is to\nfit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.\u201d FTC\nv. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389 (1959). Only\nthe interpretation advanced by Sea-Land and the Director\nmakes \u00a7906 a working part of the statutory scheme; sup\u00ad\nplies an administrable rule that results in equal treatment\nof similarly situated beneficiaries; and avoids gamesman\u00ad\nship in the claims process. In light of these contextual\nand structural considerations, we hold that an employee\nis \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when he first becomes\ndisabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to bene\u00ad\nfits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compen\u00ad\nsation order issues on his behalf.\n                               A\n   We first consider \u201cwhether the language at issue has\na plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the par-\nticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 340 (1997). The LHWCA does not define\n\u201cawarded,\u201d but in construing the Act, as with any statute,\n\u201c \u2018we look first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,\nOffice of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248,\n255 (1997) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990)). At first blush, Roberts\u2019 position is ap\u00ad\npealing. In ordinary usage, \u201caward\u201d most often means\n\u201cgive by judicial decree\u201d or \u201cassign after careful judgment.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002);\nsee also, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009)\n(\u201cgrant by formal process or by judicial decree\u201d).\n6           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   But \u201caward\u201d can also mean \u201cgrant,\u201d or \u201cconfer or bestow\nupon.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at\n152; see also ibid. (1971 ed.) (same). The LHWCA \u201cgrants\u201d\nbenefits to disabled employees, and so can be said to\n\u201caward\u201d compensation by force of its entitlement-creating\nprovisions. Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes\n\u201caward\u201d entitlements. See, e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (referring to \u201cstatutes that\naward attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party\u201d); Barber v.\nThomas, 560 U.

S. 493, 500 (1939) (California\nworkers\u2019 compensation statute \u201caward[s] compensation for\ninjuries to an employee\u201d); see also, e.g., Connecticut v.\nDoehr, 501 U.

Similarly, this Court has described an em\u00ad\nployee\u2019s survivors as \u201chaving been \u2018newly awarded\u2019 death\nbenefits\u201d by virtue of the employee\u2019s death, without any\nreference to a formal order. Director, Office of Workers\u2019\nCompensation Programs v. Rasmussen, 440 U. S. 29, 44,\nn. 16 (1979) (quoting \u00a7906(c)\u2019s predecessor provision, 33\nU. S.

In the context of the LHWCA\u2019s\ncomprehensive, reticulated regime for worker benefits\u2014in\nwhich \u00a7906 plays a pivotal role\u2014\u201cawarded compensation\u201d\nis much more sensibly interpreted to mean \u201cstatutorily\nentitled to compensation because of disability.\u201d5\n                               1\n  Section 906 governs compensation in all LHWCA cases.\nAs explained above, see supra, at 3, the LHWCA requires\nemployers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast\nmajority of cases, that is just what occurs. Under Roberts\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s view, not advanced by any party, is that an\n\nemployee is \u201cawarded compensation\u201d when his employer \u201cvoluntarily\npays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). But reading \u201cawarded\ncompensation\u201d as synonymous with \u201creceiving compensation\u201d is farther\nfrom the ordinary meaning of \u201caward\u201d than the Court\u2019s approach: A\nperson who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk\nwould not say that she had been \u201cawarded money damages\u201d if the\nbusiness responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills.\nCf. post, at 3\u20134.\n   Moreover, if Congress had intended \u201cawarded compensation\u201d to mean\n\u201creceiving compensation,\u201d it could have said so\u2014as, in fact, it did\nin \u00a7906(c)\u2019s parallel clause, which pertains to beneficiaries \u201ccurrently\nreceiving compensation for permanent total disability or death.\u201d See\nnn. 1\u20132, supra. JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s reading denies effect to Congress\u2019\ntextual shift, and therefore \u201cruns afoul of the usual rule that \u2018when the\nlegislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and differ\u00ad\nent language in another, the court assumes different meanings were\nintended.\u2019 \u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004).\n   Nor is JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s reliance on a single sentence of legislative\nhistory persuasive. See post, at 4\u20135. True, a Senate committee report\ndescribed those \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d as those \u201cwho begin\nreceiving compensation.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u20131125, p. 18 (1972). But a\nsubsequent House committee report did not. Cf. H. R. Rep. No. 92\u2013\n1441, p. 15 (1972) (statute provides a \u201cmethod for determining maxi\u00ad\nmum and minimum compensation (to be applicable to persons currently\nreceiving compensation as well as those newly awarded compensa\u00ad\ntion)\u201d). The legislative materials are a push.\n8           ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation of \u00a7906(c), no employee receiving voluntary\npayments has been \u201cawarded compensation,\u201d so none is\nsubject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.\nThat result is incompatible with the Act\u2019s design. Sec-\ntion 906(b)(1) caps \u201c[c]ompensation for disability or death\n(other than compensation for death required . . . to be paid\nin a lump sum)\u201d at twice \u201cthe applicable national average\nweekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under para\u00ad\ngraph (3).\u201d Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary\nto \u201cdetermine\u201d the national average weekly wage before\neach fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that\n\u201c[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national\naverage weekly wage\u201d for the coming fiscal year. And\n\u00a7906(c), in its turn, provides that \u201c[d]eterminations under\nsubsection (b)(3) . . . with respect to\u201d a fiscal year \u201cshall\napply to . . . those newly awarded compensation during\nsuch\u201d fiscal year. Through a series of cross-references, the\nthree provisions work together to cap disability benefits.\n   By its terms, and subject to one express exception,\n\u00a7906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all\ndisability claims. But all three provisions interlock, so the\ncap functions as Congress intended only if \u00a7906(c) also\napplies globally, to all such cases. See, e.g., FDA v. Brown\n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (\u201cA\ncourt must . . . interpret the statute \u2018as a symmetrical and\ncoherent regulatory scheme\u2019 \u201d (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd\nCo., 513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995))). If Roberts\u2019 interpretation\nwere correct, \u00a7906(c) would have no application at all in\nthe many cases in which no formal orders issue, because\nemployers make voluntary payments or the parties reach\ninformal settlements. We will not construe \u00a7906(c) in a\nmanner that renders it \u201centirely superfluous in all but the\nmost unusual circumstances.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 29 (2001).\n   Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of \u00a7906(c),\nRoberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their\nemployees become disabled. This is a solution in search of\na problem. Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are\nrare. Roberts\u2019 interpretation would set needless adminis\u00ad\ntrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the con\u00ad\ngressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation\nand informal dispute resolution. The incongruity of Rob\u00ad\nerts\u2019 proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a\nvehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.\nSection 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an\nemployee has filed a claim. Likewise, 20 CFR \u00a7702.315(a)\napplies only in the case of a claim or an employer\u2019s no-\ntice of controversion. See \u00a7702.301. We doubt that an em-\nployee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his\nemployer in securing a lower cap. And we will not read\n\u00a7906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of\ncontroversion. Cf. 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7928(a), (d) (providing for\nassessment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs against employers\nwho controvert unsuccessfully). Roberts suggests that\nemployers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to\ninduce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the\nadministrative process. Construing any workers\u2019 compen\u00ad\nsation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation be\u00ad\ntween employers and employees strikes us as unsound.\n                              2\n   Using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal\nyear in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with\nthe LHWCA\u2019s administrative structure. Section 914(b)\nrequires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of\nnotice of an employee\u2019s disability. To do so, an employer\nmust be able to calculate the cap. An employer must also\nnotify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by\nfiling a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the \u201cmaxi\u00ad\nmum rate is being paid.\u201d Dept. of Labor, Form LS\u2013206,\nPayment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online\n10            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nat http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf. On receipt of\nthis form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the\nrate of compensation in light of the applicable cap. See\nDept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual\n\u00a72\u2013201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Man-\nual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2\u00ad\n201.htm. It is difficult to see how an employer can apply\nor certify a national average weekly wage other than the\none in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.\nAn employer is powerless to predict when an employee\nmight file a claim, when a compensation order might\nissue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at\nthat later time. Likewise for a claims examiner.6\n  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage\nfor the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled\nadvances the LHWCA\u2019s purpose to compensate disability,\ndefined as \u201cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages\nwhich the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\u201d\n33 U. S. C. \u00a7902(10) (emphasis added). Just as the\nLHWCA takes \u201cthe average weekly wage of the injured\nemployee at the time of the injury\u201d as the \u201cbasis upon\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s approach is either easily circumvented or un\u00ad\n\nworkable. For example, JUSTICE GINSBURG determines that Roberts is\nentitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to\nJuly 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments\nduring that time. Post, at 6. But Sea-Land was paying Roberts\n$933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts\nwas entitled to receive. Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at\n107, Order \u00b61. If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an\nemployee\u2019s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a\nlater finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act\nmight entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remain\u00ad\nder. See, e.g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730\n(2007). An employer who controverts is not subject to the Act\u2019s delin\u00ad\nquency penalty. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(e). Perhaps JUSTICE GINSBURG\ngives Sea-Land the benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments\nwere close to Roberts\u2019 actual entitlement. But if that is so, then how\nclose is close enough?\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich to compute compensation,\u201d \u00a7910, it is logical to\napply the national average weekly wage for the same point\nin time. Administrative practice has long treated the\ntime of injury as the relevant date. See, e.g., Dept. of\nLabor, Pamphlet LS\u2013560, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under\nthe Longshoremen\u2019s Act (rev. Dec. 2003) (\u201cCompensation\npayable under the Act may not exceed 200% of the nation\u00ad\nal average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury\u201d),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm;\nDept. of Labor, Workers\u2019 Compensation Under the Long\u00ad\nshoremen\u2019s Act, Pamphlet LS\u2013560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same);\nsee also, e.g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11\u201301,\np. 2 (2010) (national average weekly wage for particular\nfiscal year applies to \u201cdisability incurred during\u201d that\nfiscal year).7\n   Applying the national average weekly wage at the time\nof onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi-\nlarly situated employees. Under Roberts\u2019 reading, two em-\nployees who earn the same salary and suffer the same\ninjury on the same day could be entitled to different rates\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and\nthe time of onset of disability differ. We have observed that \u201cthe\nLHWCA does not compensate physical injury alone but the disability\nproduced by that injury.\u201d Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515\nU. S. 291, 297 (1995). From that principle, lower courts have rightly\nconcluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the\nlatter is the relevant date for determining the applicable national\naverage weekly wage. See, e.g., Service Employees International, Inc. v.\nDirector, OWCP, 595 F. 3d 447, 456 (CA2 2010); Kubin v. Pro-Football,\nInc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per curiam).\n   Likewise, in a small group of cases\u2014those in which disability lasts\nmore than 3 but less than 15 days\u2014the time of onset of disability and\nthe time of entitlement will differ. See \u00a7906(a) (\u201cNo compensation shall\nbe allowed for the first three days of the disability . . . Provided, how-\never, That in case the injury results in disability of more than fourteen\ndays the compensation shall be allowed from the date of the disability\u201d).\nIn these cases, the relevant date is that on which disability and enti\u00ad\ntlement coincide: the fourth day after the onset of disability.\n12            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nof compensation based on the happenstance of their ob\u00ad\ntaining orders in different fiscal years. We can imagine no\nreason why Congress would have intended, by choosing\nthe words \u201cnewly awarded compensation,\u201d to differentiate\nbetween employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.\n                             3\n   Finally, using the national average weekly wage for the\nfiscal year in which disability commences discourages\ngamesmanship in the claims process. If the fiscal year in\nwhich an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact\nthat the national average weekly wage typically rises\nevery year with inflation, see n. 2, supra, would become\nunduly significant. Every employee affected by the cap\nwould seek the entry of a compensation order in a later\nfiscal year. Even an employee who has been receiving\ncompensation at the proper rate for years would be well\nadvised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to\nobtain an order at a later time. Likewise, an employee\nmight delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of\nan order. And even in an adjudicated case where an em\u00ad\nployer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate, an\nALJ would adopt the later fiscal year\u2019s national average\nweekly wage, making the increased cap retroactively\napplicable to all of the employer\u2019s payments. Roberts\ncandidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such\nperverse incentives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\u201359. We de\u00ad\ncline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with\nwindfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative pro\u00ad\nceedings, while simultaneously punishing employers who\nhave complied fully with their statutory obligations.\n                              III\n\n     We find Roberts\u2019 counterarguments unconvincing. \n\n                             A\n     First, Roberts observes that some provisions of the\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nLHWCA clearly use \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal\norder,\u201d and contends that the same must be true of\n\u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c). We agree that the Act\nsometimes uses \u201caward\u201d as Roberts urges. Section 914(a),\nfor example, refers to the payment of compensation \u201cto the\nperson entitled thereto, without an award,\u201d foreclosing the\nequation of \u201centitlement\u201d and \u201caward\u201d that we adopt with\nrespect to \u00a7906(c) today.8 But the presumption that \u201ciden\u00ad\ntical words used in different parts of the same act are\nintended to have the same meaning . . . readily yields\nwhenever there is such variation in the connection in\nwhich the words are used as reasonably to warrant the\nconclusion that they were employed in different parts of\nthe act with different intent.\u201d General Dynamics Land\nSystems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S.\n200, 213 (2001). Here, we find the presumption overcome\nbecause several provisions of the Act would make no sense\nif \u201caward\u201d were read as Roberts proposes. Those provi\u00ad\nsions confirm today\u2019s holding because they too, in context,\nuse \u201caward\u201d to denote a statutory entitlement to compen\u00ad\nsation because of disability.\n   For example, \u00a7908(c)(20) provides that \u201c[p]roper and\nequitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be\nawarded for serious disfigurement.\u201d Roberts argues that\n\u00a7908(c)(20) \u201cnecessarily contemplates administrative\naction to fix the amount of the liability and direct its\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Other LHWCA provisions, read in context, also use award to mean\n\u201caward in a formal order.\u201d For example, \u00a7\u00a7913(a) and 928(b), like\n\u00a7914(a), refer to the payment of compensation \u201cwithout an award.\u201d And\nthe LHWCA distinguishes between voluntary payments and those due\nunder an order for purposes of punishing employer delinquency.\nCompare \u00a7914(e) (10 percent penalty for late payment of \u201ccompensation\npayable without an award\u201d) with \u00a7914(f) (20 percent penalty for late\npayment of \u201ccompensation, payable under the terms of an award\u201d).\n14             ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 11. In Roberts\u2019 view,\nno disfigured employee may receive benefits without in-\nvoking the administrative claims process. That argu-\nment, however, runs counter to \u00a7908\u2019s preface, which\ndirects that \u201c[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to\nthe employee,\u201d and to \u00a7914(a), which requires the payment\nof compensation \u201cwithout an award.\u201d It is also belied by\nemployers\u2019 practice of paying \u00a7908(c)(20) benefits volun\u00ad\ntarily. See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News\nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., No. 99\u20130627 etc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">35928576</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per curiam); Evans v.\nBergeron Barges, Inc., No. 98\u20131641, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35135283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*1 (BRB, Sept. 3, 1999) (per curiam). In light of the\nLHWCA\u2019s interest in prompt payment and settled prac\u00ad\ntice, \u201cawarded\u201d in \u00a7908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in\n\u00a7906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee\u2019s entitlement to\nbenefits.\n   Likewise, \u00a7908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is\nreceiving compensation for a scheduled disability9 dies\nbefore receiving the full amount of compensation to which\nthe schedule entitles him, \u201cthe total amount of the award\nunpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the\nbenefit of his survivors.\u201d See also \u00a7908(d)(2). Roberts\u2019\ninterpretation of \u201caward\u201d would introduce an odd gap:\nOnly survivors of those employees who were receiving\nschedule benefits pursuant to orders\u2014not survivors of\nemployees who were receiving voluntary payments\u2014\nwould be entitled to the unpaid balances due their dece\u00ad\ndents. There is no reason why Congress would have cho\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Sections 908(c)(1) to (20) set forth a \u201cschedule\u201d of particular injuries\n\nthat entitle an employee \u201cto receive two-thirds of his average weekly\nwages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning\ncapacity has actually been impaired.\u201d Potomac Elec. Power Co. v.\nDirector, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 269\n(1980). For example, an employee who loses an arm is entitled to two\u00ad\nthirds of his average weekly wage for 312 weeks. \u00a7908(c)(1).\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

And\nthe Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted\n\u00a7908(d) to mean that \u201can employee has a vested interest in\nbenefits which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he\ndies, his estate is entitled to those benefits, regardless of\nwhen an award is made.\u201d Wood v. Ingalls Shipbuilding,\nInc., 28 BRBS 27, 36 (1994) (per curiam).10\n  Finally, \u00a7933(b) provides: \u201cFor the purpose of this sub\u00ad\nsection, the term \u2018award\u2019 with respect to a compensation\norder means a formal order issued by the deputy commis\u00ad\nsioner, an administrative law judge, or Board.\u201d Unless\naward may mean something other than \u201caward in a com\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Roberts\u2019 interpretation also would afford unwarranted significance\nto the entry of an order in other circumstances, resulting in arbi-\ntrary distinctions within other classes of beneficiaries. For example,\n\u00a7908(c)(22) provides that if an employee suffers from more than one\nscheduled disability, the \u201cawards\u201d for each \u201cshall run consecutively.\u201d\nUnder Roberts\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7908(c)(22) would require consecutive\npayments only for employees who were receiving scheduled disability\nbenefits pursuant to orders; those receiving voluntary payments pre\u00ad\nsumably would be entitled to concurrent payments. See \u00a7\u00a7914(a)\u2013(b).\nThat result would conflict with \u00a7908(c)(22)\u2019s text, which states that\nconsecutive payments must be made \u201c[i]n any case\u201d involving multiple\nscheduled disabilities. See, e.g., Thornton v. Northrop Grumman\nShipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per curiam).\n  Similarly, \u00a7910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benefits\nfor pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress\nprovided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments. The first applies to those\nreceiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the\nsecond applies to those \u201cawarded compensation . . . at less than the\nmaximum rate.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10\u201373, Ad\u00ad\njustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death\nPrior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp. 2\u20134 (1973). Roberts\u2019 inter\u00ad\npretation would make the second formula applicable only to beneficiar\u00ad\nies receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all\nsuch beneficiaries. Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress\nintended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it. See ibid. (prescrib\u00ad\ning a \u201cuniform\u201d method for computing the increase in all \u201c[c]ases being\ncompensated at less than the maximum rate,\u201d with no reference to the\nexistence of an order).\n16          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npensation order,\u201d this specific definition would be unnec\u00ad\nessary. Roberts contends that this provision, enacted in\n1984, \u201cwas indeed \u2018unnecessary\u2019 \u201d in light of Pallas Ship-\nping. Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U. S., at 534 (\u201cThe\nterm \u2018compensation order\u2019 in the LHWCA refers specifi\u00ad\ncally to an administrative award of compensation following\nproceedings with respect to the claim\u201d). Roberts\u2019 argu\u00ad\nment offends the canon against superfluity and neglects\nthat \u00a7933(b) defines the term \u201caward,\u201d whereas Pallas\nShipping defines the term \u201ccompensation order.\u201d Moreo\u00ad\nver, Congress\u2019 definition of \u201caward,\u201d which tracks Roberts\u2019\npreferred interpretation, was carefully limited to \u00a7933(b).\nHad Congress intended to adopt a universal definition of\n\u201caward,\u201d it could have done so in \u00a7902, the LHWCA\u2019s\nglossary. Read in light of the \u201cduty to give effect, if possi\u00ad\nble, to every clause and word of a statute,\u201d Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), \u00a7933(b) debunks Roberts\u2019 argument that\nthe Act always uses \u201caward\u201d to mean \u201caward in a formal\norder\u201d and confirms that \u201caward\u201d has other meanings.\n                             B\n  Next, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read\nthe statutory phrase \u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in\n\u00a7933(g) to mean \u201cperson awarded compensation.\u201d See\nEstate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 477\n(1992) (\u201c[A] person entitled to compensation need not be\nreceiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his\nfavor\u201d). In Roberts\u2019 view, the converse must also be true:\n\u201cawarded compensation\u201d in \u00a7906(c) cannot mean \u201centitled\nto compensation.\u201d But Cowart\u2019s reasoning does not work\nin reverse. Cowart did not construe \u00a7906(c) or the term\n\u201caward,\u201d but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase\n\u201cperson entitled to compensation\u201d in the LHWCA. See id.,\nat 478\u2013479. As just explained, the LHWCA contains no\nuniform meaning of the term \u201caward.\u201d Moreover, Cowart\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not hold that the groups of \u201cemployees entitled to\ncompensation\u201d and \u201cemployees awarded compensation\u201d\nwere mutually exclusive. The former group includes the\nlatter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient\nbut not necessary condition for membership in the former.\nSee id., at 477.\n                               C\n   Finally, Roberts contends that his interpretation fur\u00ad\nthers the LHWCA\u2019s purpose of providing employees with\nprompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid\ndelay and expedite administrative proceedings. But Rob\u00ad\nerts\u2019 remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily\npay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their\nemployees\u2019 injuries. These employers would owe benefits\nunder the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year\nwhen their employees chose to file claims. And Roberts\u2019\nremedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiar\u00ad\nies entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.\n   The more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is\ninterest that \u201caccrues from the date a benefit came due,\nrather than from the date of the ALJ\u2019s award.\u201d Matulic v.\nDirector, OWCP, 154 F. 3d 1052, 1059 (CA9 1998). The\nDirector has long taken the position that \u201cinterest is a\nnecessary and inherent component of \u2018compensation\u2019\nbecause it ensures that the delay in payment of compensa\u00ad\ntion does not diminish the amount of compensation to\nwhich the employee is entitled.\u201d Sproull v. Director,\nOWCP, 86 F. 3d 895, 900 (CA9 1996); see also, e.g., Stra-\nchan Shipping Co. v. Wedemeyer, 452 F. 2d 1225, 1229\n(CA5 1971). Moreover, \u201c[t]imely controversion does not\nrelieve the responsible party from paying interest on\nunpaid compensation.\u201d Longshore Procedure Manual \u00a78\u00ad\n201, online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm8\u00ad\n201.htm.

Specifically, \u00a7906 states that an injured\nemployee may receive, at most, twice the national average\nweekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee\nis \u201cnewly awarded compensation.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(c).\nThe Court granted review in this case to answer the\nfollowing question: When is an employee \u201cnewly awarded\ncompensation\u201d?\n   Petitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is\n\u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the year she receives\na formal compensation award. For the reasons cogently\nexplained by the majority, that argument is untenable.\nSee ante, at 5\u201317. Unlike the Court, however, I do not\nregard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services\u2019 view\nthat an employee is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the\nyear she becomes \u201cstatutorily entitled to compensation.\u201d\nAnte, at 5\u20136. Applying the common meaning of the verb\n\u201caward\u201d and recognizing the Act\u2019s distinction between\nbenefits paid voluntarily, and those paid pursuant to a\ncompensation order, see ante, at 2\u20133, I would hold that an\ninjured worker is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d when (1)\n2          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to\nthe employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the\nBenefits Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders\nthe employer to pay such benefits.\n                               I\n   In determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, \u201cwe\nlook first to its language, giving the words used their\nordinary meaning.\u201d Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the verb\n\u201caward\u201d ordinarily means \u201cto give by judicial decree\u201d or\n\u201c[to] assign after careful judgment.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 152 (2002). See also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (defining the verb \u201caward\u201d\nas \u201c[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree\u201d).\nGiving \u201caward\u201d this usual meaning, an employee is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation,\u201d if not voluntarily paid, in the fis-\ncal year in which payment is directed by administrative\norder or judicial decree.\n   Under the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee\nis provided compensation voluntarily or in contested pro-\nceedings. See ante, at 3. Most commonly, an employer\npays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employ-\nee\u2019s notice of disabling injury. See Pallas Shipping Agen-\ncy, Ltd. v. Duris, 461 U. S. 529, 532 (1983); 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a7912 (describing the form, content, and timing of the\nnecessary notice and requiring employers to designate a\nrepresentative to receive the notice); \u00a7914(b). If an em-\nployer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an in-\njured employee can file a claim with the Department of\nLabor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs\n(OWCP). For employees with valid claims, OWCP pro-\nceedings culminate with an administrative or court deci-\nsion ordering the employer to pay benefits. \u00a7919(c).

Logically, then, the worker is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d when one of those two events\noccurs.\n   The Court does not take this approach. After acknowl-\nedging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the\nword \u201caward,\u201d see ante, at 5, the Court adopts Sea-Land\u2019s\nview that \u201cawarded compensation\u201d is synonymous with\n\u201c[became] statutorily entitled to benefits,\u201d ante, at 18. As\na result, a person is \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in the\nyear in which she becomes entitled to benefits\u2014i.e., in the\nyear the employee \u201cfirst becomes disabled.\u201d Ibid. Such a\nreading is plausible, the Court asserts, because \u201cthis Court\nhas often said that statutes \u2018award\u2019 entitlements.\u201d Ante,\nat 6 (citing cases).\n   I do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as\n\u201cawarding\u201d relief to persons falling within their compass.\nBut \u201ca statute must be read in [its] context.\u201d Ante, at 7\n(quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S.\n803, 809 (1989)). Section 906 does not address whether\nthe LHWCA, as a general matter, \u201cawards\u201d disability ben-\nefits to injured longshore workers. Rather, it concerns\na more specific question: when has a particular employee\nbeen \u201cnewly awarded compensation.\u201d In that context,\nequating \u201cawarded compensation\u201d with \u201cstatutorily enti-\ntled to compensation\u201d is not plausible. A person covered\nby the Act would not likely say he was \u201cawarded com-\npensation\u201d the moment he became disabled, if, in fact, his\nemployer contests liability. Only after some entity\u2014the\nemployer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court\u2014\nrecognizes the employee\u2019s right to compensation would he\ncomprehend that he had been \u201cawarded compensation.\u201d\nTo borrow THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s example: No person who\nslips and injures herself on a negligently maintained\nsidewalk would tell her friends the next day, \u201cGuess what,\n4              ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nI was newly awarded money damages yesterday.\u201d See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 28.\n   The inconsistency between the Court\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d and my reading of the\nphrase is best illustrated by contextual example. Assume\nan employee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses\nto pay compensation voluntarily. Then, five years later,\nan ALJ finds in favor of the employee and orders the\nemployer to pay benefits to the employee. Under the\nCourt\u2019s view, the employee was \u201cnewly awarded compen-\nsation\u201d in 2002, even though the employee did not receive\na penny\u2014and the employer was not obligated to pay a\npenny\u2014until 2007. Only the most strained interpretation\nof \u201cnewly awarded\u201d could demand that result.1\n   The Court\u2019s view, moreover, does not fit the Act\u2019s design.\nAs explained supra, at 2\u20133, the Act envisions that an\neligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either\nof two ways. The Court\u2019s interpretation disregards this\ndesign, assuming instead that all employees are awarded\nbenefits in the same way: by the Act at the time they\nbecome disabled.\n   Section 906(c)\u2019s legislative history further confirms that\nCongress intended \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d to have\nits commonsense meaning. In describing \u00a7906, the Senate\nCommittee on Labor and Public Welfare reported:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given fiscal year applies\n\nto two groups of injured workers: those who are \u201cnewly awarded com-\npensation during such [year],\u201d and those who are \u201ccurrently receiving\ncompensation for permanent total disability or death benefits during\nsuch [year].\u201d 33 U.

An injured\nworker who is \u201ccurrently receiving compensation\u201d in a given fiscal year\nwas \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d in a previous year.

No. 92\u20131125, p. 18 (1972) (emphasis\n    added).\nCongress therefore believed an injured worker is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d in the year in which she \u201cbegin[s]\nreceiving compensation for the first time.\u201d Ibid. Again,\nan employee begins receiving compensation either when an\nemployer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits\nor when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer\nto do so. See supra, at 2\u20133. When the employer resists\npayment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving\ncompensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.\n  Finally, interpreting \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d to\nmean awarded through an employer\u2019s voluntary decision\nor an official order is consistent with the Act\u2019s goal of\nencouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.\nSee 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(a) (requiring employers to pay com-\npensation \u201cperiodically, promptly, and directly\u201d); Estate of\nCowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 498 (1992)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Act presumes that em-\nployers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA\nobligations and commence payments immediately.\u201d).\nUnder my interpretation, an employer who chooses to\ncontest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim\nvoluntarily, runs the risk that it may ultimately have to\npay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit. For\nexample, if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a work-\ner injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding\ncompensation to the employee in 2015, the fiscal year 2015\nmaximum rate would apply to the employee\u2019s claim. Had\n6            ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nthe employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in 2012,\non the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply.\nUnder the Court\u2019s reading, by contrast, an employer pays\nthe prevailing rate for the year the employee became\ndisabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays\nbenefits immediately or years down the road.2\n                            II\n  In this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002\nand stopped working two weeks later. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 4. Sea-Land and its insurer paid benefits to Roberts\nfrom March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003. Id., at 101. Sea-\nLand then resumed paying benefits on September 1, 2003\nand continued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17,\n2005, when it ceased making payments for good. Ibid.\nAfter Roberts filed a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ,\nin October 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to\ncompensation from March 11, 2002 onwards. Id., at 107\u2013\n108.\n  Applying my interpretation of \u00a7906, Roberts was newly\nawarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when\nSea-Land voluntarily began paying benefits; in September\n2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it\nhad stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an\nALJ ordered Sea-Land to pay benefits to Roberts for the\nuncompensated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 on-\nwards. Roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year\n2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002 until July 15,\n2003; the fiscal year 2003 maximum rate from September\n1, 2003 until May 17, 2005; and the fiscal year 2007 rate3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Employers may have a particularly strong financial incentive to\n\npostpone paying claims that implicate \u00a7906. That section applies only\nto injured workers who qualify for the maximum rate of compensation\nunder the Act\u2014i.e., to those claimants who are owed the largest possi-\nble benefit.\n  3 For \u00a7906 purposes, a year runs from October 1 to September 30.

S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                         Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\ngoing forward and for all uncompensated weeks covered by\nthe ALJ\u2019s order.4\n                      *    *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s judgment and hold that an employee is \u201cnewly\nawarded compensation\u201d when her employer either volun-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n33 U. S. C. \u00a7906(b)(3). The 2007 maximum rate therefore applies to all\nemployees \u201cnewly awarded compensation\u201d between October 1, 2006 and\nSeptember 30, 2007.\n  4 The Court asserts that an employer could \u201ceasily circumven[t]\u201d my\n\napproach by making voluntary payments to an injured worker that are\nsubstantially below the employee\u2019s \u201cactual entitlement.\u201d Ante, at 10,\nn. 6. The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or\nwould even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary. Employers who\nmake voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report\nwith the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee\u2019s\ninjury and stating the amount of the payments made. See ante, at 9\u2013\n10; 33 U. S. C. \u00a7930(a). The employer must also submit the results of\na medical evaluation of the employee\u2019s condition. Dept. of Labor,\nLongshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \u00a72\u2013201(2)(b) (hereinafter Long-\nshore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/\nlspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar. 14, 2012, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). Upon receiving the employer\u2019s report, a DOL claims examin-\ner verifies \u201cthe compensation rate for accuracy\u201d and must follow-\nup with the employer \u201c[i]f the compensation rate appears low.\u201d Long-\nshore Procedure Manual \u00a72\u2013201(3)(b)(1). The chances are slim that a\nclaims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment. Employ-\ners who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to\n10% of the amount of the underpayment. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(e);\nLongshore Procedure Manual \u00a78\u2013202(3)(c) (\u201cIf partial payments are\nmade by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] . . . to the difference\nbetween the amount owed and the amount paid.\u201d). Employers would\nthus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to \u201ccircumven[t]\u201d\nmy approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers. And\nwhile it is true that an employer who controverts an employee\u2019s right to\ncompensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10,\nn. 6, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes\nand controvert the remainder. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7914(a) (requiring\nemployers either to pay benefits in full or to controvert \u201cliability to pay\ncompensation\u201d at all).\n8          ROBERTS v. SEA-LAND SERVICES, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\ntarily agrees to pay compensation to her or is officially\nordered to do so.\n</pre>",
