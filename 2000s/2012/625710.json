Argued December 7, 2011—Decided March 20, 2012\nAlthough “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas” are\n  not patentable subject matter under §101 of the Patent Act, Diamond\n  v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185, “an application of a law of nature . . . to\n  a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection,” id., at\n  187. But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-\n  eligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply\n  state the law of nature while adding the words “apply it.” See, e.g.,\n  Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 71–72. It must limit its reach to a\n  particular, inventive application of the law.\n     Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the\n  sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern\n  the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. When in-\n  gested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the\n  bloodstream. Because patients metabolize these drugs differently,\n  doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular pa-\n  tient’s dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so\n  likely ineffective. The patent claims here set forth processes embody-\n  ing researchers’ findings that identify correlations between metabo-\n  lite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision. Each\n  claim recites (1) an “administering” step—instructing a doctor to ad-\n  minister the drug to his patient—(2) a “determining” step—telling\n  the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patient’s\n  blood—and (3) a “wherein” step—describing the metabolite concen-\n  trations above which there is a likelihood of harmful side-effects and\n  below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and in-\n  forming the doctor that metabolite concentrations above or below\n2        MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                    LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                          Syllabus\n\n\n    these thresholds “indicate a need” to decrease or increase (respective-\n    ly) the drug dosage.\n      Petitioners Mayo Collaborative Services and Mayo Clinic Rochester\n    (Mayo) bought and used diagnostic tests based on Prometheus’ pa-\n    tents. But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and mar-\n    ket its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus sued\n    Mayo contending that Mayo’s test infringed its patents. The District\n    Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary\n    judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the pa-\n    tents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena—namely,\n    the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity\n    and efficacy of thiopurine drugs—and therefore are not patentable.\n    The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligi-\n    ble under the Circuit’s “machine or transformation test.” On remand\n    from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561\n    U. S. ___, which clarified that the “machine or transformation test” is\n    not a definitive test of patent eligibility, id., at ___–___, the Federal\n    Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclusion.\nHeld: Prometheus’ process is not patent eligible. Pp. 8–24.\n    (a) Because the laws of nature recited by Prometheus’ patent\n claims—the relationships between concentrations of certain metabo-\n lites in the blood and the likelihood that a thiopurine drug dosage\n will prove ineffective or cause harm—are not themselves patentable,\n the claimed processes are not patentable unless they have additional\n features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genu-\n ine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to\n monopolize the correlations. The three additional steps in the\n claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither\n are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claims. The “ad-\n ministering” step simply identifies a group of people who will be in-\n terested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine\n drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Doc-\n tors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these pa-\n tents existed. And a “prohibition against patenting abstract ideas\n ‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula\n to a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra, at ___.\n The “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural\n laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test\n results when making their treatment decisions. The “determining”\n step tells a doctor to measure patients’ metabolite levels, through\n whatever process the doctor wishes to use. Because methods for\n making such determinations were well known in the art, this step\n simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conven-\n tional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.

S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nactivity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law\nof nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 590. Finally, considering the three steps as an\nordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not\nalready present when the steps are considered separately. Pp. 8–11.\n   (b) A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents rein-\nforces this conclusion. Pp. 11–19.\n     (1) Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both ad-\ndressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of na-\nture, are not themselves patentable. In Diehr, the overall process\nwas patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the pro-\ncess integrated the equation into the process as a whole. 450 U. S., at\n187. These additional steps transformed the process into an in-\nventive application of the formula. But in Flook, the additional steps\nof the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and\nthe particular chemical processes at issue were all “well known,” to\nthe point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no “in-\nventive concept” in the claimed application of the formula. 437 U. S.,\nat 594. Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is\nweaker than Diehr’s patent-eligible claim and no stronger than\nFlook’s unpatentable one. The three steps add nothing specific to the\nlaws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conven-\ntional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field. Pp. 11–13.\n     (2) Further support for the view that simply appending conven-\ntional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature,\nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws,\nphenomena, and ideas patentable is provided in O’Reilly v. Morse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86821\"><a href=\"/opinion/86821/oreilly-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114–115; Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases 295,\n371; Bilski, supra, at ___–___; and Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67.\nPp. 14–16.\n     (3) This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent\nlaw not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of\nlaws of nature and the like. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 67, 68.\nRewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might en-\ncourage their discovery. But because those laws and principles are\n“the basic tools of scientific and technological work,” id., at 67, there\nis a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit fu-\nture innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented pro-\ncess is no more than a general instruction to “apply the natural law,”\nor otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying\ndiscovery could reasonably justify. The patent claims at issue impli-\ncate this concern. In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels\nand to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correla-\ntions they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision re-\n4       MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                   LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    gardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the infer-\n    ence he draws using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit\n    the development of more refined treatment recommendations that\n    combine Prometheus’ correlations with later discoveries. This rein-\n    forces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligi-\n    ble, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law prece-\n    dent. Pp. 16–19.\n       (c) Additional arguments supporting Prometheus’ position—that\n    the process is patent eligible because it passes the “machine or trans-\n    formation test”; that, because the particular laws of nature that the\n    claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld;\n    that the Court should not invalidate these patents under §101 be-\n    cause the Patent Act’s other validity requirements will screen out\n    overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent cov-\n    erage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnos-\n    tic laws of nature—do not lead to a different conclusion.

It says:\n      “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.” 35 U.

Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s\nPatent Cases 295, 371 (1841) (English case discussing\nsame). Thus, the Court has written that “a new mineral\ndiscovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is\nnot patentable subject matter. Likewise, Einstein could\n2    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnot patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could New­\nton have patented the law of gravity. Such discoveries are\n‘manifestations of . . . nature, free to all men and reserved\nexclusively to none.’ ” Chakrabarty, supra, at 309 (quoting\nFunk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S.\n127, 130 (1948)).\n  “Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental\nprocesses, and abstract intellectual concepts are not pa­\ntentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and tech­\nnological work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67\n(1972). And monopolization of those tools through the\ngrant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more\nthan it would tend to promote it.\n  The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an\ninterpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscer­\nate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody,\nuse, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural\nphenomena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court\npointed out that “ ‘a process is not unpatentable simply\nbecause it contains a law of nature or a mathematical\nalgorithm.’ ” 450 U. S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook,\n437 U. S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that “an application\nof a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known\nstructure or process may well be deserving of patent pro­\ntection.” Diehr, supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice\nStone’s similar observation in Mackay Radio & Telegraph\nCo. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939):\n      “ ‘While a scientific truth, or the mathematical ex­\n    pression of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel\n    and useful structure created with the aid of\n    knowledge of scientific truth may be.’ ” 450 U. S., at\n    188 (quoting Mackay Radio, supra, at 94).\nSee also Funk Brothers, supra, at 130 (“If there is to be\ninvention from [a discovery of a law of nature], it must\ncome from the application of the law of nature to a new\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand useful end”).\n   Still, as the Court has also made clear, to transform an\nunpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible applica-\ntion of such a law, one must do more than simply state the\nlaw of nature while adding the words “apply it.” See, e.g.,\nBenson, supra, at 71–72.\n   The case before us lies at the intersection of these basic\nprinciples. It concerns patent claims covering processes\nthat help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat pa­\ntients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a\ngiven dosage level is too low or too high. The claims pur­\nport to apply natural laws describing the relationships\nbetween the concentration in the blood of certain thiopu­\nrine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage\nwill be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. We must\ndetermine whether the claimed processes have trans­\nformed these unpatentable natural laws into patent­\neligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they\nhave not done so and that therefore the processes are not\npatentable.\n   Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the partic­\nular claims before us in light of the Court’s precedents.\nThose cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes\nin ways that make patent eligibility “depend simply on the\ndraftsman’s art” without reference to the “principles un­\nderlying the prohibition against patents for [natural\nlaws].” Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against up­\nholding patents that claim processes that too broadly\npreempt the use of a natural law. Morse, supra, at 112–\n120; Benson, supra, at 71–72. And they insist that a\nprocess that focuses upon the use of a natural law also\ncontain other elements or a combination of elements,\nsometimes referred to as an “inventive concept,” sufficient\nto ensure that the patent in practice amounts to signifi­\ncantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself.\nFlook, supra, at 594; see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\n4     MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                 LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nat 14) (“[T]he prohibition against patenting abstract ideas\n‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of\nthe formula to a particular technological environment’ or\nadding ‘insignificant postsolution activity’ ” (quoting Diehr,\nsupra, at 191–192)).\n   We find that the process claims at issue here do not\nsatisfy these conditions. In particular, the steps in the\nclaimed processes (apart from the natural laws them­\nselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional\nactivity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.\nAt the same time, upholding the patents would risk dis­\nproportionately tying up the use of the underlying nat-\nural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further\ndiscoveries.\n                                I\n\n                               A\n\n  The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine\ndrugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as\nCrohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient\ningests a thiopurine compound, his body metabolizes the\ndrug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream.\nBecause the way in which people metabolize thiopurine\ncompounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug\naffects different people differently, and it has been difficult\nfor doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a\ngiven dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too\nlow, and so likely ineffective.\n  At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents\nwere made, scientists already understood that the levels\nin a patient’s blood of certain metabolites, including, in\nparticular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6–TG) and\n6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6–MMP), were correlated with\nthe likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine\ndrug could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U. S.\nPatent No. 6,355,623, col. 8, ll. 37–40, 2 App. 10. (“Previ­\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But those in the field did not know\nthe precise correlations between metabolite levels and\nlikely harm or ineffectiveness. The patent claims at issue\nhere set forth processes embodying researchers’ findings\nthat identified these correlations with some precision.\n   More specifically, the patents—U. S. Patent No.\n6,355,623 (’623 patent) and U. S. Patent No. 6,680,302\n(’302 patent)—embody findings that concentrations in a\npatient’s blood of 6–TG or of 6–MMP metabolite beyond a\ncertain level (400 and 7000 picomoles per 8x108 red blood\ncells, respectively) indicate that the dosage is likely too\nhigh for the patient, while concentrations in the blood of\n6–TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230\npicomoles per 8x108 red blood cells) indicate that the\ndosage is likely too low to be effective.\n   The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set\nof processes. Like the Federal Circuit we take as typical\nclaim 1 of the ’623 Patent, which describes one of the\nclaimed processes as follows:\n    “A method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for\n    treatment of an immune-mediated gastrointestinal\n    disorder, comprising:\n    “(a) administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine to\n    a subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­\n    nal disorder; and\n    “(b) determining the level of 6-thioguanine in said\n    subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­\n    nal disorder,\n    “wherein the level of 6-thioguanine less than about\n    230 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells indicates a need to\n6    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

(Prome­\ntheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the ’623 and\n’302 patents. It sells diagnostic tests that embody the\nprocesses the patents describe. For some time petitioners,\nMayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Collaborative Services\n(collectively Mayo), bought and used those tests. But in\n2004 Mayo announced that it intended to begin using and\nselling its own test—a test using somewhat higher metab­\nolite levels to determine toxicity (450 pmol per 8x108 for\n6–TG and 5700 pmol per 8x108 for 6–MMP). Prometheus\nthen brought this action claiming patent infringement.\n   The District Court found that Mayo’s test infringed\nclaim 7 of the ’623 patent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–\n115a. In interpreting the claim, the court accepted Prome­\ntheus’ view that the toxicity-risk level numbers in Mayo’s\ntest and the claim were too similar to render the tests\nsignificantly different. The number Mayo used (450) was\ntoo close to the number the claim used (400) to matter\ngiven appropriate margins of error. Id., at 98a–107a. The\nDistrict Court also accepted Prometheus’ view that a\ndoctor using Mayo’s test could violate the patent even if he\ndid not actually alter his treatment decision in the light of\nthe test. In doing so, the court construed the claim’s lan­\nguage, “indicates a need to decrease” (or “to increase”), as\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot limited to instances in which the doctor actually de­\ncreases (or increases) the dosage level where the test\nresults suggest that such an adjustment is advisable. Id.,\nat 107a–109a; see also Brief for Respondent i (describing\nclaimed processes as methods “for improving . . . treat­\nment . . . by using individualized metabolite measure­\nments to inform the calibration of . . . dosages of . . .\nthiopurines” (emphasis added)).\n   Nonetheless the District Court ultimately granted\nsummary judgment in Mayo’s favor. The court reasoned\nthat the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural\nphenomena—namely the correlations between thiopurine\nmetabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopu­\nrine drug dosages—and so are not patentable. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 50a–83a.\n   On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed. It pointed out\nthat in addition to these natural correlations, the claimed\nprocesses specify the steps of (1) “administering a [thiopu­\nrine] drug” to a patient and (2) “determining the [resulting\nmetabolite] level.” These steps, it explained, involve the\ntransformation of the human body or of blood taken from\nthe body. Thus, the patents satisfied the Circuit’s “ma­\nchine or transformation test,” which the court thought\nsufficient to “confine the patent monopoly within rather\ndefinite bounds,” thereby bringing the claims into compli­\nance with §101. 581 F. 3d 1336, 1345, 1346–1347 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Mayo filed a petition for certiorari. We granted the\npetition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for\nreconsideration in light of Bilski, 561 U. S. ___, which\nclarified that the “machine or transformation test” is not a\ndefinitive test of patent eligibility, but only an important\nand useful clue. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–8). On\nremand the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclu­\nsion. It thought that the “machine-or-transformation\ntest,” understood merely as an important and useful clue,\n8    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnonetheless led to the “clear and compelling conclusion . . .\nthat the . . . claims . . . do not encompass laws of nature or\npreempt natural correlations.” 628 F. 3d 1347, 1355\n(2010). Mayo again filed a petition for certiorari, which we\ngranted.\n                             II\n   Prometheus’ patents set forth laws of nature—namely,\nrelationships between concentrations of certain metabo­\nlites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a\nthiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.\nClaim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6–TG in\nthe blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopu­\nrine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells,\nthen the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side\neffects. While it takes a human action (the administration\nof a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this\nrelation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in\nprinciple apart from any human action. The relation is a\nconsequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds\nare metabolized by the body—entirely natural processes.\nAnd so a patent that simply describes that relation sets\nforth a natural law.\n   The question before us is whether the claims do signifi­\ncantly more than simply describe these natural relations.\nTo put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add\nenough to their statements of the correlations to allow the\nprocesses they describe to qualify as patent-eligible pro­\ncesses that apply natural laws? We believe that the an­\nswer to this question is no.\n                            A\n  If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a\nprocess reciting a law of nature, unless that process has\nadditional features that provide practical assurance that\nthe process is more than a drafting effort designed to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmonopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example,\ncould not simply recite a law of nature and then add the\ninstruction “apply the law.” Einstein, we assume, could\nnot have patented his famous law by claiming a process\nconsisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to\nrefer to the law to determine how much energy an amount\nof mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archime­\ndes have secured a patent for his famous principle of\nflotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling\nboat builders to refer to that principle in order to deter­\nmine whether an object will float.\n   What else is there in the claims before us? The process\nthat each claim recites tells doctors interested in the\nsubject about the correlations that the researchers discov­\nered. In doing so, it recites an “administering” step, a\n“determining” step, and a “wherein” step. These addition­\nal steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are\nthey sufficient to transform the nature of the claim.\n   First, the “administering” step simply refers to the\nrelevant audience, namely doctors who treat patients with\ncertain diseases with thiopurine drugs. That audience is\na pre-existing audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to\ntreat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long\nbefore anyone asserted these claims. In any event, the\n“prohibition against patenting abstract ideas ‘cannot be\ncircumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula\nto a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–\n192).\n   Second, the “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about\nthe relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion\nthat he should take those laws into account when treating\nhis patient. That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant\naudience about the laws while trusting them to use those\nlaws appropriately where they are relevant to their deci­\nsionmaking (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator\n10   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\noperators about his basic law and then trusting them to\nuse it where relevant).\n   Third, the “determining” step tells the doctor to deter­\nmine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood,\nthrough whatever process the doctor or the laboratory\nwishes to use. As the patents state, methods for determin­\ning metabolite levels were well known in the art. ’623\npatent, col. 9, ll. 12–65, 2 App. 11. Indeed, scientists\nroutinely measured metabolites as part of their investiga­\ntions into the relationships between metabolite levels and\nefficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds. ’623 patent,\ncol. 8, ll. 37–40, id., at 10. Thus, this step tells doctors\nto engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity\npreviously engaged in by scientists who work in the field.\nPurely “conventional or obvious” “[pre]-solution activity” is\nnormally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law\nof nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 590; see also Bilski, 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 14) (“[T]he prohibition against patenting ab­\nstract ideas ‘cannot be circumvented by’ . . . adding ‘insig­\nnificant post-solution activity’ ” (quoting Diehr, supra, at\n191–192)).\n   Fourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combi­\nnation adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not al­\nready present when the steps are considered separately.\nSee Diehr, supra, at 188 (“[A] new combination of steps in\na process may be patentable even though all the constitu­\nents of the combination were well known and in common\nuse before the combination was made”). Anyone who\nwants to make use of these laws must first administer a\nthiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite\nconcentrations, and so the combination amounts to noth­\ning significantly more than an instruction to doctors to\napply the applicable laws when treating their patients.\n   The upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to\ngather data from which they may draw an inference in\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of the correlations. To put the matter more suc­\ncinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about\ncertain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well­\nunderstood, routine, conventional activity already engaged\nin by the scientific community; and those steps, when\nviewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum\nof their parts taken separately. For these reasons we\nbelieve that the steps are not sufficient to transform un­\npatentable natural correlations into patentable applica­\ntions of those regularities.\n                             B\n                             1\n  A more detailed consideration of the controlling prece­\ndents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly\non point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court\nreached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of\nprocesses that embodied the equivalent of natural laws.\nThe Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method\nfor molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, mold­\ned products. The process used a known mathematical\nequation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when\n(depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the\ntime the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of\nthe rubber) to open the press. It consisted in effect of the\nsteps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on\nthe inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers\ninto a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation\nto continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3)\nconfiguring the computer so that at the appropriate mo­\nment it would signal “a device” to open the press. Diehr,\n450 U. S., at 177–179.\n  The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical\nequation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But\nit found the overall process patent eligible because of\nthe way the additional steps of the process integrated the\n12   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nequation into the process as a whole. Those steps included\n“installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly\ndetermining the temperature of the mold, constantly re-\ncalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of\nthe formula and a digital computer, and automatically\nopening the press at the proper time.” Id., at 187. It\nnowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the\ncombination of those steps, were in context obvious, al­\nready in use, or purely conventional. And so the patentees\ndid not “seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,” but\nsought “only to foreclose from others the use of that equa­\ntion in conjunction with all of the other steps in their\nclaimed process.” Ibid. These other steps apparently\nadded to the formula something that in terms of patent\nlaw’s objectives had significance—they transformed the\nprocess into an inventive application of the formula.\n   The process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a\nmethod for adjusting “alarm limits” in the catalytic con­\nversion of hydrocarbons. Certain operating conditions\n(such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are\ncontinuously monitored during the conversion process,\nsignal inefficiency or danger when they exceed certain\n“alarm limits.” The claimed process amounted to an im­\nproved system for updating those alarm limits through the\nsteps of: (1) measuring the current level of the variable,\ne.g., the temperature; (2) using an apparently novel math­\nematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits;\nand (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit\nvalues. 437 U. S., at 585–587.\n   The Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic math­\nematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patenta­\nble. But it characterized the claimed process as doing\nnothing other than “provid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula\nfor computing an updated alarm limit.” Flook, supra, at\n586. Unlike the process in Diehr, it did not “explain how\nthe variables used in the formula were to be selected, nor\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical\nprocesses at work or the means of setting off an alarm or\nadjusting the alarm limit.” Diehr, supra, at 192, n. 14; see\nalso Flook, 437 U. S., at 586. And so the other steps in the\nprocess did not limit the claim to a particular application.\nMoreover, “[t]he chemical processes involved in catalytic\nconversion of hydrocarbons[,] . . . the practice of monitor­\ning the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits\nto trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must\nbe recomputed and readjusted, and the use of comput-\ners for ‘automatic monitoring-alarming’ ” were all “well\nknown,” to the point where, putting the formula to the\nside, there was no “inventive concept” in the claimed\napplication of the formula. Id., at 594. “[P]ost-solution\nactivity” that is purely “conventional or obvious,” the\nCourt wrote, “can[not] transform an unpatentable princi­\nple into a patentable process.” Id., at 589, 590.\n  The claim before us presents a case for patentability\nthat is weaker than the (patent-eligible) claim in Diehr\nand no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook.\nBeyond picking out the relevant audience, namely those\nwho administer doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim sim-\nply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level\nof the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatenta­\nble) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate\nthe current toxicity/inefficacy limits, and (3) reconsider the\ndrug dosage in light of the law. These instructions add\nnothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is\nwell-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously\nengaged in by those in the field. And since they are steps\nthat must be taken in order to apply the laws in question,\nthe effect is simply to tell doctors to apply the law some­\nhow when treating their patients. The process in Diehr\nwas not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized\nin roughly this way.\n14    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                 LABORATORIES, INC.\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n                             2\n  Other cases offer further support for the view that simp­\nly appending conventional steps, specified at a high level\nof generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and\nideas patentable. This Court has previously discussed in\ndetail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent\nclaim that posed a legal problem very similar to the prob­\nlem now before us. The patent applicant there asserted a\nclaim\n     “for the improved application of air to produce heat in\n     fires, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus\n     is required. [The invention] was to be applied as\n     follows: The blast or current of air produced by the\n     blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into\n     an air-vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to\n     endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or\n     receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into\n     the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a\n     considerable temperature by heat externally applied.”\n     Morse, 15 How., at 114–115.\nThe English court concluded that the claimed process did\nmore than simply instruct users to use the principle that\nhot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it\nexplained how the principle could be implemented in an\ninventive way. Baron Parke wrote (for the court):\n     “It is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson’s claim]\n     from the specification of a patent for a principle, and\n     this at first created in the minds of some of the court\n     much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think\n     that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle,\n     but a machine embodying a principle, and a very val­\n     uable one. We think the case must be considered as if\n     the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical appa­\n    ratus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in\n    this—by interposing a receptacle for heated air be­\n    tween the blowing apparatus and the furnace. In this\n    receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the appli­\n    cation of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he\n    accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which\n    was before of cold air, in a heated state to the fur­\n    nace.” Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases, at\n    371.\nThus, the claimed process included not only a law of\nnature but also several unconventional steps (such as\ninserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle\nexternally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that\nconfined the claims to a particular, useful application of the\nprinciple.\n   In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process\nfor hedging risks of price changes by, for example, con­\ntracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed\nprice, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a\ndrop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a\nfixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge\nagainst a price increase. One claim described the process;\nanother reduced the process to a mathematical formula.\n561 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3). The Court held\nthat the described “concept of hedging” was “an unpatent­\nable abstract idea.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The fact\nthat some of the claims limited hedging to use in commod­\nities and energy markets and specified that “well-known\nrandom analysis techniques [could be used] to help estab­\nlish some of the inputs into the equation” did not under­\nmine this conclusion, for “Flook established that limiting\nan abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postso­\nlution components did not make the concept patentable.”\nId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 15).\n16    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                 LABORATORIES, INC.\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentabil­\nity of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded\ndecimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general\npurpose digital computer. The claims “purported to cover\nany use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital\ncomputer of any type.” 409 U. S., at 64, 65. The Court\nrecognized that “ ‘a novel and useful structure created with\nthe aid of knowledge of scientific truth’ ” might be patent­\nable. Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U. S., at 94).\nBut it held that simply implementing a mathematical\nprinciple on a physical machine, namely a computer, was\nnot a patentable application of that principle. For the\nmathematical formula had “no substantial practical appli­\ncation except in connection with a digital computer.”\nBenson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims\nbefore us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly\nfrom a claim that just said “apply the algorithm.”\n                               3\n   The Court has repeatedly emphasized this last men­\ntioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit\nfurther discovery by improperly tying up the future use of\nlaws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as\nunpatentable Samuel Morse’s general claim for “ ‘the use\nof the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . .\nhowever developed, for making or printing intelligible\ncharacters, letters, or signs, at any distances,’ ” 15 How., at\n86. \tThe Court explained:\n     “For aught that we now know some future inventor, in\n     the onward march of science, may discover a mode of\n     writing or printing at a distance by means of the elec­\n     tric or galvanic current, without using any part of the\n     process or combination set forth in the plaintiff ’s spec­\n     ification. His invention may be less complicated—less\n     liable to get out of order—less expensive in construc­\n     tion, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    this patent the inventor could not use it, nor the pub­\n    lic have the benefit of it without the permission of this\n    patentee.” Id., at 113.\n   Similarly, in Benson the Court said that the claims\nbefore it were “so abstract and sweeping as to cover both\nknown and unknown uses of the [mathematical formula].”\n409 U. S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that\nto allow “petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre­\nempt use of this approach in all fields.” 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 15). And in Flook the Court expressed concern\nthat the claimed process was simply “a formula for compu­\nting an updated alarm limit,” which might “cover a broad\nrange of potential uses.” 437 U. S., at 586.\n   These statements reflect the fact that, even though\nrewarding with patents those who discover new laws of\nnature and the like might well encourage their discovery,\nthose laws and principles, considered generally, are “the\nbasic tools of scientific and technological work.” Benson,\nsupra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of\npatents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation\npremised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a\npatented process amounts to no more than an instruction\nto “apply the natural law,” or otherwise forecloses more\nfuture invention than the underlying discovery could\nreasonably justify. See generally Lemley, Risch, Sichel­\nman, & Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1315\n(2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that §101 reflects\nthis kind of concern); see also C. Bohannan & H.\nHovenkamp, Creation without Restraint: Promoting Lib­\nerty and Rivalry in Innovation 112 (2012) (“One problem\nwith [process] patents is that the more abstractly their\nclaims are stated, the more difficult it is to determine\nprecisely what they cover.

PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nture of Intellectual Property Law 305–306 (2003) (The\nexclusion from patent law of basic truths reflects “both . . .\nthe enormous potential for rent seeking that would be\ncreated if property rights could be obtained in them and\n. . . the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed\non would-be users [of those truths]”).\n    The laws of nature at issue here are narrow laws that\nmay have limited applications, but the patent claims that\nembody them nonetheless implicate this concern. They\ntell a treating doctor to measure metabolite levels and to\nconsider the resulting measurements in light of the statis­\ntical relationships they describe. In doing so, they tie up\nthe doctor’s subsequent treatment decision whether that\ntreatment does, or does not, change in light of the infer­\nence he has drawn using the correlations. And they\nthreaten to inhibit the development of more refined treat­\nment recommendations (like that embodied in Mayo’s\ntest), that combine Prometheus’ correlations with later\ndiscovered features of metabolites, human physiology or\nindividual patient characteristics. The “determining” step\ntoo is set forth in highly general language covering all\nprocesses that make use of the correlations after measur­\ning metabolites, including later discovered processes that\nmeasure metabolite levels in new ways.\n    We need not, and do not, now decide whether were the\nsteps at issue here less conventional, these features of\nthe claims would prove sufficient to invalidate them. For\nhere, as we have said, the steps add nothing of signifi­\ncance to the natural laws themselves. Unlike, say, a\ntypical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an\nexisting drug, the patent claims do not confine their reach\nto particular applications of those laws. The presence here\nof the basic underlying concern that these patents tie up\ntoo much future use of laws of nature simply reinforces\nour conclusion that the processes described in the patents\nare not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto depart from case law precedent.\n                             III\n   We have considered several further arguments in sup­\nport of Prometheus’ position. But they do not lead us to\nadopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in\nupholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us,\nrelied on this Court’s determination that “[t]ransformation\nand reduction of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is\nthe clue to the patentability of a process claim that does\nnot include particular machines.” Benson, supra, at 70–71\n(emphasis added); see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n6–7); Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184; Flook, supra, at 588, n. 9;\nCochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877). It reasoned\nthat the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible,\nsince they involve transforming the human body by ad­\nministering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood\nby analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F. 3d,\nat 1356–1357.\n   The first of these transformations, however, is irrele­\nvant. As we have pointed out, the “administering” step\nsimply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are\nlikely interested in applying the law of nature. See supra,\nat 9. And the second step could be satisfied without trans­\nforming the blood, should science develop a totally differ­\nent system for determining metabolite levels that did not\ninvolve such a transformation. See supra, at 18. Regard­\nless, in stating that the “machine-or-transformation” test\nis an “important and useful clue” to patentability, we have\nneither said nor implied that the test trumps the “law of\nnature” exclusion. Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6–7)\n(emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here.\n   Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular\nlaws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow\nand specific, the patents should be upheld. Thus, it en­\ncourages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature\n20   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nbased on whether or not they will interfere significantly\nwith innovation in other fields now or in the future. Brief\nfor Respondent 42–46; see also Lemley 1342–1344 (mak­\ning similar argument).\n   But the underlying functional concern here is a relative\none: how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to\nthe contribution of the inventor. See supra, at 17. A\npatent upon a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future\nresearch as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein’s\nlaw of relativity, but the creative value of the discovery is\nalso considerably smaller. And, as we have previously\npointed out, even a narrow law of nature (such as the\none before us) can inhibit future research. See supra, at\n17–18.\n   In any event, our cases have not distinguished among\ndifferent laws of nature according to whether or not the\nprinciples they embody are sufficiently narrow. See, e.g.,\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584 (holding narrow mathematical formu­\nla unpatentable). And this is understandable. Courts and\njudges are not institutionally well suited to making the\nkinds of judgments needed to distinguish among differ-\nent laws of nature. And so the cases have endorsed a\nbright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature,\nmathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a\nsomewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying\n“building-block” concern.\n   Third, the Government argues that virtually any step\nbeyond a statement of a law of nature itself should trans­\nform an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially\npatentable application sufficient to satisfy §101’s de­\nmands. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae. The\nGovernment does not necessarily believe that claims that\n(like the claims before us) extend just minimally beyond a\nlaw of nature should receive patents.

In particular, it argues\nthat these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under §102.\n   This approach, however, would make the “law of nature”\nexception to §101 patentability a dead letter. The ap­\nproach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The\nrelevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not\nlater sections. Bilski, 561 U. S. ___; Diehr, supra; Flook,\nsupra; Benson, 409 U. S. 63. See also H. R. Rep. No. 1923,\n82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1952) (“A person may have ‘invent­\ned’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include any­\nthing under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi­\ntions of the title are fulfilled” (emphasis added)).\n   We recognize that, in evaluating the significance of\nadditional steps, the §101 patent-eligibility inquiry and,\nsay, the §102 novelty inquiry might sometimes overlap.\nBut that need not always be so. And to shift the patent­\neligibility inquiry entirely to these later sections risks\ncreating significantly greater legal uncertainty, while\nassuming that those sections can do work that they are\nnot equipped to do.\n   What role would laws of nature, including newly discov­\nered (and “novel”) laws of nature, play in the Govern­\nment’s suggested “novelty” inquiry? Intuitively, one would\nsuppose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel.\nThe Government, however, suggests in effect that the\nnovelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded\nwhen evaluating the novelty of the whole. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 27. But §§102 and 103\nsay nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were\npart of the prior art when applying those sections. Cf.\nDiehr, 450 U.

See Lemley 1329–1332 (outlining differences\nbetween §§101 and 112); Eisenberg, supra, at ___ (manu­\nscript, at 92–96) (similar). Compare Risch, Everything\nis Patentable, 75 Tenn. L.

That research, which includes\nresearch leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is\nexpensive; it “ha[s] made the United States the world\nleader in this field”; and it requires protection.

The American Medical Association, the\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics, the American\nHospital Association, the American Society of Human\nGenetics, the Association of American Medical Colleges,\nthe Association for Molecular Pathology, and other medi­\ncal organizations tell us that if “claims to exclusive rights\nover the body’s natural responses to illness and medical\ntreatment are permitted to stand, the result will be a vast\nthicket of exclusive rights over the use of critical scientific\ndata that must remain widely available if physicians are\nto provide sound medical care.” Brief for American Col­\nlege of Medical Genetics et al. as Amici Curiae 7; see also\nApp. to Brief for Association Internationale pour la Protec­\ntion de la Propriété Intellectuelle et al. as Amici Curiae\nA6, A16 (methods of medical treatment are not patentable\nin most of Western Europe).\n   We do not find this kind of difference of opinion surpris­\ning. Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword. On\nthe one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides\nmonetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and\ndiscovery. On the other hand, that very exclusivity can\nimpede the flow of information that might permit, indeed\nspur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using\nthe patented ideas once created, requiring potential users\nto conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing\npatents and pending patent applications, and requiring\nthe negotiation of complex licensing arrangements. At the\nsame time, patent law’s general rules must govern in­\nventive activity in many different fields of human endeav­\nor, with the result that the practical effects of rules that\nreflect a general effort to balance these considerations\nmay differ from one field to another. See Bohannan &\n24   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

And we must recognize the role of\nCongress in crafting more finely tailored rules where\nnecessary. Cf. 35 U. S. C. §§161–164 (special rules for\nplant patents).

Argued December 7, 2011—Decided March 20, 2012\nAlthough “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas” are\n  not patentable subject matter under §101 of the Patent Act, Diamond\n  v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185, “an application of a law of nature . . . to\n  a known structure or process may [deserve] patent protection,” id., at\n  187. But to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-\n  eligible application of such a law, a patent must do more than simply\n  state the law of nature while adding the words “apply it.” See, e.g.,\n  Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 71–72. It must limit its reach to a\n  particular, inventive application of the law.\n     Respondent, Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. (Prometheus), is the\n  sole and exclusive licensee of the two patents at issue, which concern\n  the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. When in-\n  gested, the body metabolizes the drugs, producing metabolites in the\n  bloodstream. Because patients metabolize these drugs differently,\n  doctors have found it difficult to determine whether a particular pa-\n  tient’s dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too low, and so\n  likely ineffective. The patent claims here set forth processes embody-\n  ing researchers’ findings that identify correlations between metabo-\n  lite levels and likely harm or ineffectiveness with precision. Each\n  claim recites (1) an “administering” step—instructing a doctor to ad-\n  minister the drug to his patient—(2) a “determining” step—telling\n  the doctor to measure the resulting metabolite levels in the patient’s\n  blood—and (3) a “wherein” step—describing the metabolite concen-\n  trations above which there is a likelihood of harmful side-effects and\n  below which it is likely that the drug dosage is ineffective, and in-\n  forming the doctor that metabolite concentrations above or below\n2        MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                    LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                          Syllabus\n\n\n    these thresholds “indicate a need” to decrease or increase (respective-\n    ly) the drug dosage.\n      Petitioners Mayo Collaborative Services and Mayo Clinic Rochester\n    (Mayo) bought and used diagnostic tests based on Prometheus’ pa-\n    tents. But in 2004 Mayo announced that it intended to sell and mar-\n    ket its own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus sued\n    Mayo contending that Mayo’s test infringed its patents. The District\n    Court found that the test infringed the patents but granted summary\n    judgment to Mayo, reasoning that the processes claimed by the pa-\n    tents effectively claim natural laws or natural phenomena—namely,\n    the correlations between thiopurine metabolite levels and the toxicity\n    and efficacy of thiopurine drugs—and therefore are not patentable.\n    The Federal Circuit reversed, finding the processes to be patent eligi-\n    ble under the Circuit’s “machine or transformation test.” On remand\n    from this Court for reconsideration in light of Bilski v. Kappos, 561\n    U. S. ___, which clarified that the “machine or transformation test” is\n    not a definitive test of patent eligibility, id., at ___–___, the Federal\n    Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclusion.\nHeld: Prometheus’ process is not patent eligible. Pp. 8–24.\n    (a) Because the laws of nature recited by Prometheus’ patent\n claims—the relationships between concentrations of certain metabo-\n lites in the blood and the likelihood that a thiopurine drug dosage\n will prove ineffective or cause harm—are not themselves patentable,\n the claimed processes are not patentable unless they have additional\n features that provide practical assurance that the processes are genu-\n ine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to\n monopolize the correlations. The three additional steps in the\n claimed processes here are not themselves natural laws but neither\n are they sufficient to transform the nature of the claims. The “ad-\n ministering” step simply identifies a group of people who will be in-\n terested in the correlations, namely, doctors who used thiopurine\n drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Doc-\n tors had been using these drugs for this purpose long before these pa-\n tents existed. And a “prohibition against patenting abstract ideas\n ‘cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula\n to a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra, at ___.\n The “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural\n laws, adding, at most, a suggestion that they should consider the test\n results when making their treatment decisions. The “determining”\n step tells a doctor to measure patients’ metabolite levels, through\n whatever process the doctor wishes to use. Because methods for\n making such determinations were well known in the art, this step\n simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conven-\n tional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.

S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nactivity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law\nof nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law. Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 590. Finally, considering the three steps as an\nordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not\nalready present when the steps are considered separately. Pp. 8–11.\n   (b) A more detailed consideration of the controlling precedents rein-\nforces this conclusion. Pp. 11–19.\n     (1) Diehr and Flook, the cases most directly on point, both ad-\ndressed processes using mathematical formulas that, like laws of na-\nture, are not themselves patentable. In Diehr, the overall process\nwas patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the pro-\ncess integrated the equation into the process as a whole. 450 U. S., at\n187. These additional steps transformed the process into an in-\nventive application of the formula. But in Flook, the additional steps\nof the process did not limit the claim to a particular application, and\nthe particular chemical processes at issue were all “well known,” to\nthe point where, putting the formula to the side, there was no “in-\nventive concept” in the claimed application of the formula. 437 U. S.,\nat 594. Here, the claim presents a case for patentability that is\nweaker than Diehr’s patent-eligible claim and no stronger than\nFlook’s unpatentable one. The three steps add nothing specific to the\nlaws of nature other than what is well-understood, routine, conven-\ntional activity, previously engaged in by those in the field. Pp. 11–13.\n     (2) Further support for the view that simply appending conven-\ntional steps, specified at a high level of generality, to laws of nature,\nnatural phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot make those laws,\nphenomena, and ideas patentable is provided in O’Reilly v. Morse, 15\nHow. 62, 114–115; Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases 295,\n371; Bilski, supra, at ___–___; and Benson, supra, at 64, 65, 67.\nPp. 14–16.\n     (3) This Court has repeatedly emphasized a concern that patent\nlaw not inhibit future discovery by improperly tying up the use of\nlaws of nature and the like. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 67, 68.\nRewarding with patents those who discover laws of nature might en-\ncourage their discovery. But because those laws and principles are\n“the basic tools of scientific and technological work,” id., at 67, there\nis a danger that granting patents that tie up their use will inhibit fu-\nture innovation, a danger that becomes acute when a patented pro-\ncess is no more than a general instruction to “apply the natural law,”\nor otherwise forecloses more future invention than the underlying\ndiscovery could reasonably justify. The patent claims at issue impli-\ncate this concern. In telling a doctor to measure metabolite levels\nand to consider the resulting measurements in light of the correla-\ntions they describe, they tie up his subsequent treatment decision re-\n4       MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                   LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    gardless of whether he changes his dosage in the light of the infer-\n    ence he draws using the correlations. And they threaten to inhibit\n    the development of more refined treatment recommendations that\n    combine Prometheus’ correlations with later discoveries. This rein-\n    forces the conclusion that the processes at issue are not patent eligi-\n    ble, while eliminating any temptation to depart from case law prece-\n    dent. Pp. 16–19.\n       (c) Additional arguments supporting Prometheus’ position—that\n    the process is patent eligible because it passes the “machine or trans-\n    formation test”; that, because the particular laws of nature that the\n    claims embody are narrow and specific, the patents should be upheld;\n    that the Court should not invalidate these patents under §101 be-\n    cause the Patent Act’s other validity requirements will screen out\n    overly broad patents; and that a principle of law denying patent cov-\n    erage here will discourage investment in discoveries of new diagnos-\n    tic laws of nature—do not lead to a different conclusion.

It says:\n      “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.” 35 U. S. C. §101.\nThe Court has long held that this provision contains an\nimportant implicit exception. “[L]aws of nature, natural\nphenomena, and abstract ideas” are not patentable. Dia-\nmond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981); see also Bilski v.\nKappos, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5); Diamond\nv. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980); Le Roy v. Tat-\nham, 14 How. 156, 175 (1853); O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How.\n62, 112–120 (1854); cf. Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s\nPatent Cases 295, 371 (1841) (English case discussing\nsame). Thus, the Court has written that “a new mineral\ndiscovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is\nnot patentable subject matter. Likewise, Einstein could\n2    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnot patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could New­\nton have patented the law of gravity. Such discoveries are\n‘manifestations of . . . nature, free to all men and reserved\nexclusively to none.’ ” Chakrabarty, supra, at 309 (quoting\nFunk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S.\n127, 130 (1948)).\n  “Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental\nprocesses, and abstract intellectual concepts are not pa­\ntentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and tech­\nnological work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67\n(1972). And monopolization of those tools through the\ngrant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more\nthan it would tend to promote it.\n  The Court has recognized, however, that too broad an\ninterpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscer­\nate patent law. For all inventions at some level embody,\nuse, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural\nphenomena, or abstract ideas. Thus, in Diehr the Court\npointed out that “ ‘a process is not unpatentable simply\nbecause it contains a law of nature or a mathematical\nalgorithm.’ ” 450 U. S., at 187 (quoting Parker v. Flook,\n437 U. S. 584, 590 (1978)). It added that “an application\nof a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known\nstructure or process may well be deserving of patent pro­\ntection.” Diehr, supra, at 187. And it emphasized Justice\nStone’s similar observation in Mackay Radio & Telegraph\nCo. v. Radio Corp. of America, 306 U. S. 86 (1939):\n      “ ‘While a scientific truth, or the mathematical ex­\n    pression of it, is not a patentable invention, a novel\n    and useful structure created with the aid of\n    knowledge of scientific truth may be.’ ” 450 U. S., at\n    188 (quoting Mackay Radio, supra, at 94).\nSee also Funk Brothers, supra, at 130 (“If there is to be\ninvention from [a discovery of a law of nature], it must\ncome from the application of the law of nature to a new\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

It concerns patent claims covering processes\nthat help doctors who use thiopurine drugs to treat pa­\ntients with autoimmune diseases determine whether a\ngiven dosage level is too low or too high. The claims pur­\nport to apply natural laws describing the relationships\nbetween the concentration in the blood of certain thiopu­\nrine metabolites and the likelihood that the drug dosage\nwill be ineffective or induce harmful side-effects. We must\ndetermine whether the claimed processes have trans­\nformed these unpatentable natural laws into patent­\neligible applications of those laws. We conclude that they\nhave not done so and that therefore the processes are not\npatentable.\n   Our conclusion rests upon an examination of the partic­\nular claims before us in light of the Court’s precedents.\nThose cases warn us against interpreting patent statutes\nin ways that make patent eligibility “depend simply on the\ndraftsman’s art” without reference to the “principles un­\nderlying the prohibition against patents for [natural\nlaws].” Flook, supra, at 593. They warn us against up­\nholding patents that claim processes that too broadly\npreempt the use of a natural law. Morse, supra, at 112–\n120; Benson, supra, at 71–72. And they insist that a\nprocess that focuses upon the use of a natural law also\ncontain other elements or a combination of elements,\nsometimes referred to as an “inventive concept,” sufficient\nto ensure that the patent in practice amounts to signifi­\ncantly more than a patent upon the natural law itself.\nFlook, supra, at 594; see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\n4     MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

In particular, the steps in the\nclaimed processes (apart from the natural laws them­\nselves) involve well-understood, routine, conventional\nactivity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.\nAt the same time, upholding the patents would risk dis­\nproportionately tying up the use of the underlying nat-\nural laws, inhibiting their use in the making of further\ndiscoveries.\n                                I\n\n                               A\n\n  The patents before us concern the use of thiopurine\ndrugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as\nCrohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. When a patient\ningests a thiopurine compound, his body metabolizes the\ndrug, causing metabolites to form in his bloodstream.\nBecause the way in which people metabolize thiopurine\ncompounds varies, the same dose of a thiopurine drug\naffects different people differently, and it has been difficult\nfor doctors to determine whether for a particular patient a\ngiven dose is too high, risking harmful side effects, or too\nlow, and so likely ineffective.\n  At the time the discoveries embodied in the patents\nwere made, scientists already understood that the levels\nin a patient’s blood of certain metabolites, including, in\nparticular, 6-thioguanine and its nucleotides (6–TG) and\n6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6–MMP), were correlated with\nthe likelihood that a particular dosage of a thiopurine\ndrug could cause harm or prove ineffective. See U. S.\nPatent No. 6,355,623, col. 8, ll. 37–40, 2 App. 10. (“Previ­\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But those in the field did not know\nthe precise correlations between metabolite levels and\nlikely harm or ineffectiveness. The patent claims at issue\nhere set forth processes embodying researchers’ findings\nthat identified these correlations with some precision.\n   More specifically, the patents—U. S. Patent No.\n6,355,623 (’623 patent) and U. S. Patent No. 6,680,302\n(’302 patent)—embody findings that concentrations in a\npatient’s blood of 6–TG or of 6–MMP metabolite beyond a\ncertain level (400 and 7000 picomoles per 8x108 red blood\ncells, respectively) indicate that the dosage is likely too\nhigh for the patient, while concentrations in the blood of\n6–TG metabolite lower than a certain level (about 230\npicomoles per 8x108 red blood cells) indicate that the\ndosage is likely too low to be effective.\n   The patent claims seek to embody this research in a set\nof processes. Like the Federal Circuit we take as typical\nclaim 1 of the ’623 Patent, which describes one of the\nclaimed processes as follows:\n    “A method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for\n    treatment of an immune-mediated gastrointestinal\n    disorder, comprising:\n    “(a) administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine to\n    a subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­\n    nal disorder; and\n    “(b) determining the level of 6-thioguanine in said\n    subject having said immune-mediated gastrointesti­\n    nal disorder,\n    “wherein the level of 6-thioguanine less than about\n    230 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells indicates a need to\n6    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

(Prome­\ntheus), is the sole and exclusive licensee of the ’623 and\n’302 patents. It sells diagnostic tests that embody the\nprocesses the patents describe. For some time petitioners,\nMayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Collaborative Services\n(collectively Mayo), bought and used those tests. But in\n2004 Mayo announced that it intended to begin using and\nselling its own test—a test using somewhat higher metab­\nolite levels to determine toxicity (450 pmol per 8x108 for\n6–TG and 5700 pmol per 8x108 for 6–MMP). Prometheus\nthen brought this action claiming patent infringement.\n   The District Court found that Mayo’s test infringed\nclaim 7 of the ’623 patent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a–\n115a. In interpreting the claim, the court accepted Prome­\ntheus’ view that the toxicity-risk level numbers in Mayo’s\ntest and the claim were too similar to render the tests\nsignificantly different. The number Mayo used (450) was\ntoo close to the number the claim used (400) to matter\ngiven appropriate margins of error. Id., at 98a–107a. The\nDistrict Court also accepted Prometheus’ view that a\ndoctor using Mayo’s test could violate the patent even if he\ndid not actually alter his treatment decision in the light of\nthe test. In doing so, the court construed the claim’s lan­\nguage, “indicates a need to decrease” (or “to increase”), as\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot limited to instances in which the doctor actually de­\ncreases (or increases) the dosage level where the test\nresults suggest that such an adjustment is advisable. Id.,\nat 107a–109a; see also Brief for Respondent i (describing\nclaimed processes as methods “for improving . . . treat­\nment . . . by using individualized metabolite measure­\nments to inform the calibration of . . . dosages of . . .\nthiopurines” (emphasis added)).\n   Nonetheless the District Court ultimately granted\nsummary judgment in Mayo’s favor. The court reasoned\nthat the patents effectively claim natural laws or natural\nphenomena—namely the correlations between thiopurine\nmetabolite levels and the toxicity and efficacy of thiopu­\nrine drug dosages—and so are not patentable. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 50a–83a.\n   On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed. It pointed out\nthat in addition to these natural correlations, the claimed\nprocesses specify the steps of (1) “administering a [thiopu­\nrine] drug” to a patient and (2) “determining the [resulting\nmetabolite] level.” These steps, it explained, involve the\ntransformation of the human body or of blood taken from\nthe body. Thus, the patents satisfied the Circuit’s “ma­\nchine or transformation test,” which the court thought\nsufficient to “confine the patent monopoly within rather\ndefinite bounds,” thereby bringing the claims into compli­\nance with §101. 581 F. 3d 1336, 1345, 1346–1347 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Mayo filed a petition for certiorari. We granted the\npetition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for\nreconsideration in light of Bilski, 561 U. S. ___, which\nclarified that the “machine or transformation test” is not a\ndefinitive test of patent eligibility, but only an important\nand useful clue. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–8). On\nremand the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its earlier conclu­\nsion. It thought that the “machine-or-transformation\ntest,” understood merely as an important and useful clue,\n8    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS \n\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnonetheless led to the “clear and compelling conclusion . . .\nthat the . . . claims . . . do not encompass laws of nature or\npreempt natural correlations.” 628 F. 3d 1347, 1355\n(2010). Mayo again filed a petition for certiorari, which we\ngranted.\n                             II\n   Prometheus’ patents set forth laws of nature—namely,\nrelationships between concentrations of certain metabo­\nlites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a\nthiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.\nClaim 1, for example, states that if the levels of 6–TG in\nthe blood (of a patient who has taken a dose of a thiopu­\nrine drug) exceed about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells,\nthen the administered dose is likely to produce toxic side\neffects. While it takes a human action (the administration\nof a thiopurine drug) to trigger a manifestation of this\nrelation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in\nprinciple apart from any human action. The relation is a\nconsequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds\nare metabolized by the body—entirely natural processes.\nAnd so a patent that simply describes that relation sets\nforth a natural law.\n   The question before us is whether the claims do signifi­\ncantly more than simply describe these natural relations.\nTo put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add\nenough to their statements of the correlations to allow the\nprocesses they describe to qualify as patent-eligible pro­\ncesses that apply natural laws? We believe that the an­\nswer to this question is no.\n                            A\n  If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a\nprocess reciting a law of nature, unless that process has\nadditional features that provide practical assurance that\nthe process is more than a drafting effort designed to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmonopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example,\ncould not simply recite a law of nature and then add the\ninstruction “apply the law.” Einstein, we assume, could\nnot have patented his famous law by claiming a process\nconsisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to\nrefer to the law to determine how much energy an amount\nof mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archime­\ndes have secured a patent for his famous principle of\nflotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling\nboat builders to refer to that principle in order to deter­\nmine whether an object will float.\n   What else is there in the claims before us? The process\nthat each claim recites tells doctors interested in the\nsubject about the correlations that the researchers discov­\nered. In doing so, it recites an “administering” step, a\n“determining” step, and a “wherein” step. These addition­\nal steps are not themselves natural laws but neither are\nthey sufficient to transform the nature of the claim.\n   First, the “administering” step simply refers to the\nrelevant audience, namely doctors who treat patients with\ncertain diseases with thiopurine drugs. That audience is\na pre-existing audience; doctors used thiopurine drugs to\ntreat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders long\nbefore anyone asserted these claims. In any event, the\n“prohibition against patenting abstract ideas ‘cannot be\ncircumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula\nto a particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–\n192).\n   Second, the “wherein” clauses simply tell a doctor about\nthe relevant natural laws, at most adding a suggestion\nthat he should take those laws into account when treating\nhis patient. That is to say, these clauses tell the relevant\naudience about the laws while trusting them to use those\nlaws appropriately where they are relevant to their deci­\nsionmaking (rather like Einstein telling linear accelerator\n10   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\noperators about his basic law and then trusting them to\nuse it where relevant).\n   Third, the “determining” step tells the doctor to deter­\nmine the level of the relevant metabolites in the blood,\nthrough whatever process the doctor or the laboratory\nwishes to use. As the patents state, methods for determin­\ning metabolite levels were well known in the art. ’623\npatent, col. 9, ll. 12–65, 2 App. 11. Indeed, scientists\nroutinely measured metabolites as part of their investiga­\ntions into the relationships between metabolite levels and\nefficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds. ’623 patent,\ncol. 8, ll. 37–40, id., at 10. Thus, this step tells doctors\nto engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity\npreviously engaged in by scientists who work in the field.\nPurely “conventional or obvious” “[pre]-solution activity” is\nnormally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law\nof nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 590; see also Bilski, 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 14) (“[T]he prohibition against patenting ab­\nstract ideas ‘cannot be circumvented by’ . . . adding ‘insig­\nnificant post-solution activity’ ” (quoting Diehr, supra, at\n191–192)).\n   Fourth, to consider the three steps as an ordered combi­\nnation adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not al­\nready present when the steps are considered separately.\nSee Diehr, supra, at 188 (“[A] new combination of steps in\na process may be patentable even though all the constitu­\nents of the combination were well known and in common\nuse before the combination was made”). Anyone who\nwants to make use of these laws must first administer a\nthiopurine drug and measure the resulting metabolite\nconcentrations, and so the combination amounts to noth­\ning significantly more than an instruction to doctors to\napply the applicable laws when treating their patients.\n   The upshot is that the three steps simply tell doctors to\ngather data from which they may draw an inference in\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of the correlations. To put the matter more suc­\ncinctly, the claims inform a relevant audience about\ncertain laws of nature; any additional steps consist of well­\nunderstood, routine, conventional activity already engaged\nin by the scientific community; and those steps, when\nviewed as a whole, add nothing significant beyond the sum\nof their parts taken separately. For these reasons we\nbelieve that the steps are not sufficient to transform un­\npatentable natural correlations into patentable applica­\ntions of those regularities.\n                             B\n                             1\n  A more detailed consideration of the controlling prece­\ndents reinforces our conclusion. The cases most directly\non point are Diehr and Flook, two cases in which the Court\nreached opposite conclusions about the patent eligibility of\nprocesses that embodied the equivalent of natural laws.\nThe Diehr process (held patent eligible) set forth a method\nfor molding raw, uncured rubber into various cured, mold­\ned products. The process used a known mathematical\nequation, the Arrhenius equation, to determine when\n(depending upon the temperature inside the mold, the\ntime the rubber had been in the mold, and the thickness of\nthe rubber) to open the press. It consisted in effect of the\nsteps of: (1) continuously monitoring the temperature on\nthe inside of the mold, (2) feeding the resulting numbers\ninto a computer, which would use the Arrhenius equation\nto continuously recalculate the mold-opening time, and (3)\nconfiguring the computer so that at the appropriate mo­\nment it would signal “a device” to open the press. Diehr,\n450 U. S., at 177–179.\n  The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical\nequation, like a law of nature, was not patentable. But\nit found the overall process patent eligible because of\nthe way the additional steps of the process integrated the\n12   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nequation into the process as a whole. Those steps included\n“installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly\ndetermining the temperature of the mold, constantly re-\ncalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of\nthe formula and a digital computer, and automatically\nopening the press at the proper time.” Id., at 187. It\nnowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the\ncombination of those steps, were in context obvious, al­\nready in use, or purely conventional. And so the patentees\ndid not “seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,” but\nsought “only to foreclose from others the use of that equa­\ntion in conjunction with all of the other steps in their\nclaimed process.” Ibid. These other steps apparently\nadded to the formula something that in terms of patent\nlaw’s objectives had significance—they transformed the\nprocess into an inventive application of the formula.\n   The process in Flook (held not patentable) provided a\nmethod for adjusting “alarm limits” in the catalytic con­\nversion of hydrocarbons. Certain operating conditions\n(such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates), which are\ncontinuously monitored during the conversion process,\nsignal inefficiency or danger when they exceed certain\n“alarm limits.” The claimed process amounted to an im­\nproved system for updating those alarm limits through the\nsteps of: (1) measuring the current level of the variable,\ne.g., the temperature; (2) using an apparently novel math­\nematical algorithm to calculate the current alarm limits;\nand (3) adjusting the system to reflect the new alarm-limit\nvalues. 437 U. S., at 585–587.\n   The Court, as in Diehr, pointed out that the basic math­\nematical equation, like a law of nature, was not patenta­\nble. But it characterized the claimed process as doing\nnothing other than “provid[ing] a[n unpatentable] formula\nfor computing an updated alarm limit.” Flook, supra, at\n586. Unlike the process in Diehr, it did not “explain how\nthe variables used in the formula were to be selected, nor\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid the [claim] contain any disclosure relating to chemical\nprocesses at work or the means of setting off an alarm or\nadjusting the alarm limit.” Diehr, supra, at 192, n. 14; see\nalso Flook, 437 U. S., at 586. And so the other steps in the\nprocess did not limit the claim to a particular application.\nMoreover, “[t]he chemical processes involved in catalytic\nconversion of hydrocarbons[,] . . . the practice of monitor­\ning the chemical process variables, the use of alarm limits\nto trigger alarms, the notion that alarm limit values must\nbe recomputed and readjusted, and the use of comput-\ners for ‘automatic monitoring-alarming’ ” were all “well\nknown,” to the point where, putting the formula to the\nside, there was no “inventive concept” in the claimed\napplication of the formula. Id., at 594. “[P]ost-solution\nactivity” that is purely “conventional or obvious,” the\nCourt wrote, “can[not] transform an unpatentable princi­\nple into a patentable process.” Id., at 589, 590.\n  The claim before us presents a case for patentability\nthat is weaker than the (patent-eligible) claim in Diehr\nand no stronger than the (unpatentable) claim in Flook.\nBeyond picking out the relevant audience, namely those\nwho administer doses of thiopurine drugs, the claim sim-\nply tells doctors to: (1) measure (somehow) the current level\nof the relevant metabolite, (2) use particular (unpatenta­\nble) laws of nature (which the claim sets forth) to calculate\nthe current toxicity/inefficacy limits, and (3) reconsider the\ndrug dosage in light of the law. These instructions add\nnothing specific to the laws of nature other than what is\nwell-understood, routine, conventional activity, previously\nengaged in by those in the field. And since they are steps\nthat must be taken in order to apply the laws in question,\nthe effect is simply to tell doctors to apply the law some­\nhow when treating their patients. The process in Diehr\nwas not so characterized; that in Flook was characterized\nin roughly this way.\n14    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                 LABORATORIES, INC.\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n                             2\n  Other cases offer further support for the view that simp­\nly appending conventional steps, specified at a high level\nof generality, to laws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas cannot make those laws, phenomena, and\nideas patentable. This Court has previously discussed in\ndetail an English case, Neilson, which involved a patent\nclaim that posed a legal problem very similar to the prob­\nlem now before us. The patent applicant there asserted a\nclaim\n     “for the improved application of air to produce heat in\n     fires, forges, and furnaces, where a blowing apparatus\n     is required. [The invention] was to be applied as\n     follows: The blast or current of air produced by the\n     blowing apparatus was to be passed from it into\n     an air-vessel or receptacle made sufficiently strong to\n     endure the blast; and through or from that vessel or\n     receptacle by means of a tube, pipe, or aperture into\n     the fire, the receptacle be kept artificially heated to a\n     considerable temperature by heat externally applied.”\n     Morse, 15 How., at 114–115.\nThe English court concluded that the claimed process did\nmore than simply instruct users to use the principle that\nhot air promotes ignition better than cold air, since it\nexplained how the principle could be implemented in an\ninventive way. Baron Parke wrote (for the court):\n     “It is very difficult to distinguish [Neilson’s claim]\n     from the specification of a patent for a principle, and\n     this at first created in the minds of some of the court\n     much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think\n     that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle,\n     but a machine embodying a principle, and a very val­\n     uable one. We think the case must be considered as if\n     the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical appa­\n    ratus to furnaces; and his invention then consists in\n    this—by interposing a receptacle for heated air be­\n    tween the blowing apparatus and the furnace. In this\n    receptacle he directs the air to be heated by the appli­\n    cation of heat externally to the receptacle, and thus he\n    accomplishes the object of applying the blast, which\n    was before of cold air, in a heated state to the fur­\n    nace.” Neilson v. Harford, Webster’s Patent Cases, at\n    371.\nThus, the claimed process included not only a law of\nnature but also several unconventional steps (such as\ninserting the receptacle, applying heat to the receptacle\nexternally, and blowing the air into the furnace) that\nconfined the claims to a particular, useful application of the\nprinciple.\n   In Bilski the Court considered claims covering a process\nfor hedging risks of price changes by, for example, con­\ntracting to purchase commodities from sellers at a fixed\nprice, reflecting the desire of sellers to hedge against a\ndrop in prices, while selling commodities to consumers at a\nfixed price, reflecting the desire of consumers to hedge\nagainst a price increase. One claim described the process;\nanother reduced the process to a mathematical formula.\n561 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3). The Court held\nthat the described “concept of hedging” was “an unpatent­\nable abstract idea.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The fact\nthat some of the claims limited hedging to use in commod­\nities and energy markets and specified that “well-known\nrandom analysis techniques [could be used] to help estab­\nlish some of the inputs into the equation” did not under­\nmine this conclusion, for “Flook established that limiting\nan abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postso­\nlution components did not make the concept patentable.”\nId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 15).\n16    MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                 LABORATORIES, INC.\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, in Benson the Court considered the patentabil­\nity of a mathematical process for converting binary-coded\ndecimal numerals into pure binary numbers on a general\npurpose digital computer. The claims “purported to cover\nany use of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital\ncomputer of any type.” 409 U. S., at 64, 65. The Court\nrecognized that “ ‘a novel and useful structure created with\nthe aid of knowledge of scientific truth’ ” might be patent­\nable. Id., at 67 (quoting Mackay Radio, 306 U. S., at 94).\nBut it held that simply implementing a mathematical\nprinciple on a physical machine, namely a computer, was\nnot a patentable application of that principle. For the\nmathematical formula had “no substantial practical appli­\ncation except in connection with a digital computer.”\nBenson, supra, at 71. Hence the claim (like the claims\nbefore us) was overly broad; it did not differ significantly\nfrom a claim that just said “apply the algorithm.”\n                               3\n   The Court has repeatedly emphasized this last men­\ntioned concern, a concern that patent law not inhibit\nfurther discovery by improperly tying up the future use of\nlaws of nature. Thus, in Morse the Court set aside as\nunpatentable Samuel Morse’s general claim for “ ‘the use\nof the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . .\nhowever developed, for making or printing intelligible\ncharacters, letters, or signs, at any distances,’ ” 15 How., at\n86. \tThe Court explained:\n     “For aught that we now know some future inventor, in\n     the onward march of science, may discover a mode of\n     writing or printing at a distance by means of the elec­\n     tric or galvanic current, without using any part of the\n     process or combination set forth in the plaintiff ’s spec­\n     ification. His invention may be less complicated—less\n     liable to get out of order—less expensive in construc­\n     tion, and in its operation. But yet if it is covered by\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

S., at 67, 68. In Bilski the Court pointed out that\nto allow “petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre­\nempt use of this approach in all fields.” 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 15). And in Flook the Court expressed concern\nthat the claimed process was simply “a formula for compu­\nting an updated alarm limit,” which might “cover a broad\nrange of potential uses.” 437 U. S., at 586.\n   These statements reflect the fact that, even though\nrewarding with patents those who discover new laws of\nnature and the like might well encourage their discovery,\nthose laws and principles, considered generally, are “the\nbasic tools of scientific and technological work.” Benson,\nsupra, at 67. And so there is a danger that the grant of\npatents that tie up their use will inhibit future innovation\npremised upon them, a danger that becomes acute when a\npatented process amounts to no more than an instruction\nto “apply the natural law,” or otherwise forecloses more\nfuture invention than the underlying discovery could\nreasonably justify. See generally Lemley, Risch, Sichel­\nman, & Wagner, Life After Bilski, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 1315\n(2011) (hereinafter Lemley) (arguing that §101 reflects\nthis kind of concern); see also C. Bohannan & H.\nHovenkamp, Creation without Restraint: Promoting Lib­\nerty and Rivalry in Innovation 112 (2012) (“One problem\nwith [process] patents is that the more abstractly their\nclaims are stated, the more difficult it is to determine\nprecisely what they cover. They risk being applied to a\nwide range of situations that were not anticipated by the\npatentee”); W. Landes & R. Posner, The Economic Struc­\n18   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nture of Intellectual Property Law 305–306 (2003) (The\nexclusion from patent law of basic truths reflects “both . . .\nthe enormous potential for rent seeking that would be\ncreated if property rights could be obtained in them and\n. . . the enormous transaction costs that would be imposed\non would-be users [of those truths]”).\n    The laws of nature at issue here are narrow laws that\nmay have limited applications, but the patent claims that\nembody them nonetheless implicate this concern. They\ntell a treating doctor to measure metabolite levels and to\nconsider the resulting measurements in light of the statis­\ntical relationships they describe. In doing so, they tie up\nthe doctor’s subsequent treatment decision whether that\ntreatment does, or does not, change in light of the infer­\nence he has drawn using the correlations. And they\nthreaten to inhibit the development of more refined treat­\nment recommendations (like that embodied in Mayo’s\ntest), that combine Prometheus’ correlations with later\ndiscovered features of metabolites, human physiology or\nindividual patient characteristics. The “determining” step\ntoo is set forth in highly general language covering all\nprocesses that make use of the correlations after measur­\ning metabolites, including later discovered processes that\nmeasure metabolite levels in new ways.\n    We need not, and do not, now decide whether were the\nsteps at issue here less conventional, these features of\nthe claims would prove sufficient to invalidate them. For\nhere, as we have said, the steps add nothing of signifi­\ncance to the natural laws themselves. Unlike, say, a\ntypical patent on a new drug or a new way of using an\nexisting drug, the patent claims do not confine their reach\nto particular applications of those laws. The presence here\nof the basic underlying concern that these patents tie up\ntoo much future use of laws of nature simply reinforces\nour conclusion that the processes described in the patents\nare not patent eligible, while eliminating any temptation\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto depart from case law precedent.\n                             III\n   We have considered several further arguments in sup­\nport of Prometheus’ position. But they do not lead us to\nadopt a different conclusion. First, the Federal Circuit, in\nupholding the patent eligibility of the claims before us,\nrelied on this Court’s determination that “[t]ransformation\nand reduction of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is\nthe clue to the patentability of a process claim that does\nnot include particular machines.” Benson, supra, at 70–71\n(emphasis added); see also Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n6–7); Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184; Flook, supra, at 588, n. 9;\nCochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788 (1877). It reasoned\nthat the claimed processes are therefore patent eligible,\nsince they involve transforming the human body by ad­\nministering a thiopurine drug and transforming the blood\nby analyzing it to determine metabolite levels. 628 F. 3d,\nat 1356–1357.\n   The first of these transformations, however, is irrele­\nvant. As we have pointed out, the “administering” step\nsimply helps to pick out the group of individuals who are\nlikely interested in applying the law of nature. See supra,\nat 9. And the second step could be satisfied without trans­\nforming the blood, should science develop a totally differ­\nent system for determining metabolite levels that did not\ninvolve such a transformation. See supra, at 18. Regard­\nless, in stating that the “machine-or-transformation” test\nis an “important and useful clue” to patentability, we have\nneither said nor implied that the test trumps the “law of\nnature” exclusion. Bilski, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6–7)\n(emphasis added). That being so, the test fails here.\n   Second, Prometheus argues that, because the particular\nlaws of nature that its patent claims embody are narrow\nand specific, the patents should be upheld. Thus, it en­\ncourages us to draw distinctions among laws of nature\n20   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nbased on whether or not they will interfere significantly\nwith innovation in other fields now or in the future. Brief\nfor Respondent 42–46; see also Lemley 1342–1344 (mak­\ning similar argument).\n   But the underlying functional concern here is a relative\none: how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to\nthe contribution of the inventor. See supra, at 17. A\npatent upon a narrow law of nature may not inhibit future\nresearch as seriously as would a patent upon Einstein’s\nlaw of relativity, but the creative value of the discovery is\nalso considerably smaller. And, as we have previously\npointed out, even a narrow law of nature (such as the\none before us) can inhibit future research. See supra, at\n17–18.\n   In any event, our cases have not distinguished among\ndifferent laws of nature according to whether or not the\nprinciples they embody are sufficiently narrow. See, e.g.,\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584 (holding narrow mathematical formu­\nla unpatentable). And this is understandable. Courts and\njudges are not institutionally well suited to making the\nkinds of judgments needed to distinguish among differ-\nent laws of nature. And so the cases have endorsed a\nbright-line prohibition against patenting laws of nature,\nmathematical formulas and the like, which serves as a\nsomewhat more easily administered proxy for the underlying\n“building-block” concern.\n   Third, the Government argues that virtually any step\nbeyond a statement of a law of nature itself should trans­\nform an unpatentable law of nature into a potentially\npatentable application sufficient to satisfy §101’s de­\nmands. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae. The\nGovernment does not necessarily believe that claims that\n(like the claims before us) extend just minimally beyond a\nlaw of nature should receive patents. But in its view,\nother statutory provisions—those that insist that a\nclaimed process be novel, 35 U. S. C. §102, that it not be\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“obvious in light of prior art,” §103, and that it be “full[y],\nclear[ly], concise[ly], and exact[ly]” described, §112—can\nperform this screening function. In particular, it argues\nthat these claims likely fail for lack of novelty under §102.\n   This approach, however, would make the “law of nature”\nexception to §101 patentability a dead letter. The ap­\nproach is therefore not consistent with prior law. The\nrelevant cases rest their holdings upon section 101, not\nlater sections. Bilski, 561 U. S. ___; Diehr, supra; Flook,\nsupra; Benson, 409 U. S. 63. See also H. R. Rep. No. 1923,\n82d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1952) (“A person may have ‘invent­\ned’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include any­\nthing under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi­\ntions of the title are fulfilled” (emphasis added)).\n   We recognize that, in evaluating the significance of\nadditional steps, the §101 patent-eligibility inquiry and,\nsay, the §102 novelty inquiry might sometimes overlap.\nBut that need not always be so. And to shift the patent­\neligibility inquiry entirely to these later sections risks\ncreating significantly greater legal uncertainty, while\nassuming that those sections can do work that they are\nnot equipped to do.\n   What role would laws of nature, including newly discov­\nered (and “novel”) laws of nature, play in the Govern­\nment’s suggested “novelty” inquiry? Intuitively, one would\nsuppose that a newly discovered law of nature is novel.\nThe Government, however, suggests in effect that the\nnovelty of a component law of nature may be disregarded\nwhen evaluating the novelty of the whole. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 27. But §§102 and 103\nsay nothing about treating laws of nature as if they were\npart of the prior art when applying those sections. Cf.\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 188 (patent claims “must be consid­\nered as a whole”). And studiously ignoring all laws of\nnature when evaluating a patent application under §§102\n22   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v.

Chisum, Patents §5.03[3] (2005).\n   Section 112 requires only a “written description of the\ninvention . . . in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms\nas to enable any person skilled in the art . . . to make and\nuse the same.” It does not focus on the possibility that a\nlaw of nature (or its equivalent) that meets these condi­\ntions will nonetheless create the kind of risk that under­\nlies the law of nature exception, namely the risk that a\npatent on the law would significantly impede future in-\nnovation. See Lemley 1329–1332 (outlining differences\nbetween §§101 and 112); Eisenberg, supra, at ___ (manu­\nscript, at 92–96) (similar). Compare Risch, Everything\nis Patentable, 75 Tenn. L. Rev. 591 (2008) (defending a\nminimalist approach to §101) with Lemley (reflecting\nRisch’s change of mind).\n   These considerations lead us to decline the Govern­\nment’s invitation to substitute §§102, 103, and 112 inquir­\nies for the better established inquiry under §101.\n   Fourth, Prometheus, supported by several amici, argues\nthat a principle of law denying patent coverage here will\ninterfere significantly with the ability of medical research­\ners to make valuable discoveries, particularly in the area\nof diagnostic research. That research, which includes\nresearch leading to the discovery of laws of nature, is\nexpensive; it “ha[s] made the United States the world\nleader in this field”; and it requires protection.

The American Medical Association, the\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics, the American\nHospital Association, the American Society of Human\nGenetics, the Association of American Medical Colleges,\nthe Association for Molecular Pathology, and other medi­\ncal organizations tell us that if “claims to exclusive rights\nover the body’s natural responses to illness and medical\ntreatment are permitted to stand, the result will be a vast\nthicket of exclusive rights over the use of critical scientific\ndata that must remain widely available if physicians are\nto provide sound medical care.” Brief for American Col­\nlege of Medical Genetics et al. as Amici Curiae 7; see also\nApp. to Brief for Association Internationale pour la Protec­\ntion de la Propriété Intellectuelle et al. as Amici Curiae\nA6, A16 (methods of medical treatment are not patentable\nin most of Western Europe).\n   We do not find this kind of difference of opinion surpris­\ning. Patent protection is, after all, a two-edged sword. On\nthe one hand, the promise of exclusive rights provides\nmonetary incentives that lead to creation, invention, and\ndiscovery. On the other hand, that very exclusivity can\nimpede the flow of information that might permit, indeed\nspur, invention, by, for example, raising the price of using\nthe patented ideas once created, requiring potential users\nto conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing\npatents and pending patent applications, and requiring\nthe negotiation of complex licensing arrangements. At the\nsame time, patent law’s general rules must govern in­\nventive activity in many different fields of human endeav­\nor, with the result that the practical effects of rules that\nreflect a general effort to balance these considerations\nmay differ from one field to another. See Bohannan &\n24   MAYO COLLABORATIVE SERVICES v. PROMETHEUS\n                LABORATORIES, INC.\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nHovenkamp, Creation without Restraint, at 98–100.\n  In consequence, we must hesitate before departing from\nestablished general legal rules lest a new protective rule\nthat seems to suit the needs of one field produce unfore­\nseen results in another. And we must recognize the role of\nCongress in crafting more finely tailored rules where\nnecessary. Cf. 35 U. S. C. §§161–164 (special rules for\nplant patents). We need not determine here whether,\nfrom a policy perspective, increased protection for discov­\neries of diagnostic laws of nature is desirable.\n                         *    *   *\n  For these reasons, we conclude that the patent claims at\nissue here effectively claim the underlying laws of nature\nthemselves. The claims are consequently invalid.
