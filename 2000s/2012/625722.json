Argued January 11, 2012—Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) entitles an employ-\n  ee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per year for (A) the\n  care of a newborn son or daughter; (B) the adoption or foster-care\n  placement of a child; (C) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or par-\n  ent with a serious medical condition; and (D) the employee’s own se-\n  rious health condition when the condition interferes with the employ-\n  ee’s ability to perform at work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The FMLA\n  also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages\n  “against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or\n  State court.” §2617(a)(2). For present purposes, subparagraphs (A),\n  (B), and (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and subpar-\n  agraph (D) as the self-care provision. In Nevada Dept. of Human Re-\n  sources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 730−732, this Court held that Con-\n  gress could subject States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C)\n  based on evidence of family-leave policies that discriminated on the\n  basis of sex.\n     Petitioner filed suit, alleging that his employer, the Maryland\n  Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the State, violated the FMLA\n  by denying him self-care leave. The Federal District Court dismissed\n  the suit on sovereign immunity grounds. The Fourth Circuit af-\n  firmed, holding that unlike the family-care provision in Hibbs, the\n  self-care provision was not directed at an identified pattern of gen-\n  der-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to\n  any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n626 F. 3d 187, affirmed.\n2              COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS,\n    and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded that suits against States under the\n    self-care provision are barred by sovereign immunity. Pp. 3−12.\n       (a) Under the federal system, States, as sovereigns, are immune\n    from damages suits, unless they waive that defense. See, e.g., Kimel\n    v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72−73. Congress may also ab-\n    rogate the States’ immunity pursuant to its powers under §5 of the\n    Fourteenth Amendment, but it must make that intention “unmistak-\n    ably clear in the language of the statute,” Hibbs, supra, at 726. It did\n    so in the FMLA. Congress also “must tailor” legislation enacted un-\n    der §5 “to remedy or prevent” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\n    Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid Postsecond-\n    ary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639.\n    “There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury\n    to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.”\n    City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520. Pp. 3−5.\n       (b) The sex-based discrimination that supported allowing subpara-\n    graph (C) suits against States is absent with respect to the self-care\n    provision. Petitioner’s three arguments to the contrary are unper-\n    suasive. Pp. 5–12.\n         (1) Petitioner maintains that the self-care provision addresses\n    sex discrimination and sex stereotyping. But the provision, standing\n    alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. At\n    the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such dis-\n    crimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies. Congress was con-\n    cerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss\n    on employees and their families and about discrimination based on\n    illness, not sex. Although the self-care provision offers some women\n    a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related ill-\n    nesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional\n    to any identified constitutional violations. When the FMLA was en-\n    acted, Congress had no evidence that States were excluding pregnan-\n    cy-related illnesses from their leave policies. Pp. 6–7.\n         (2) Petitioner also argues that the self-care provision is a neces-\n    sary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs. But his\n    claim—that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal avail-\n    ability of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their dif-\n    ferent leave-usage patterns―is unconvincing and does not comply\n    with the requirements of City of Boerne. Also, there are no congres-\n    sional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is nec-\n    essary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer dis-\n    crimination against women. Pp. 8–11.\n         (3) Finally, petitioner contends that the self-care provision helps\n    single parents keep their jobs when they get ill. The fact that most\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the\n  self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave re-\n  strictions that have a disparate effect on women.                However,\n  “[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of . . . discrim-\n  ination . . . such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional\n  violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state ac-\n  tion to strict scrutiny.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,\n  531 U. S. 356, 373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral\n  leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional,\n  the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed\n  remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 11−12.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA adhered to his view that the Court should abandon\n  the “congruence and proportionality” approach in favor of one that is\n  properly tied to the text of §5, which grants Congress the power “to\n  enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the other provisions of the Four-\n  teenth Amendment. Outside the context of racial discrimination,\n  Congress’s §5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct\n  that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not\n  reach a State’s failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.\n  Pp. 1−2.\n\n   KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an\nopinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

COURT OF\n\n         APPEALS OF MARYLAND ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [March 20, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE,\nJUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO joined.\n   The question in this case is whether a state employee\nis allowed to recover damages from the state entity that\nemploys him by invoking one of the provisions of a federal\nstatute that, in express terms, seeks to abrogate the\nStates’ immunity from suits for damages. The statute in\nquestion is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107\nStat. 6, 29 U. S. C. §2601 et seq. The provision at issue\nrequires employers, including state employers, to grant\nunpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition,\nprovided other statutory requisites are met, particularly\nrequirements that the total amount of annual leave taken\nunder all the Act’s provisions does not exceed a stated\nmaximum. §2612(a)(1)(d). In agreement with every Court\nof Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now\nholds that suits against States under this provision are\nbarred by the States’ immunity as sovereigns in our feder-\nal system. See 626 F. 3d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below);\nNelson v. University of Tex., 535 F. 3d 318 (CA5 2008);\n2          COLEMAN v.

An employee may take\nleave under the FMLA for: (A) “the birth of a son or\ndaughter . . . in order to care for such son or daughter,” (B)\nthe adoption or foster-care placement of a child with the\nemployee, (C) the care of a “spouse . . . son, daughter, or\nparent” with “a serious health condition,” and (D) the\nemployee’s own serious health condition when the condi-\ntion interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at\nwork. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The Act creates a private\nright of action to seek both equitable relief and money\ndamages “against any employer (including a public agen-\ncy) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdic-\ntion.” §2617(a)(2). As noted, subparagraph (D) is at issue\nhere.\n   This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003).\nSubparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for rea-\nsons related to family care, and those three provisions are\nreferred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held\nthat Congress could subject the States to suit for viola-\ntions of subparagraph (C), §2612(a)(1)(C). That holding\nrested on evidence that States had family-leave policies\nthat differentiated on the basis of sex and that States\nadministered even neutral family-leave policies in ways\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthat discriminated on the basis of sex. See id., at 730–732.\nSubparagraph (D), the self-care provision, was not at issue\nin Hibbs.\n                            B\n   Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the Court\nof Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman\nrequested sick leave, he was informed he would be termi-\nnated if he did not resign. Coleman then sued the state\ncourt in the United States District Court for the District of\nMaryland, alleging, inter alia, that his employer violated\nthe FMLA by failing to provide him with self-care leave.\n   The District Court dismissed the suit on the basis that\nthe Maryland Court of Appeals, as an entity of a sovereign\nState, was immune from the suit for damages. The parties\ndo not dispute the District Court’s ruling that the Mary-\nland Court of Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of\nthe State for purposes of sovereign immunity. The Dis-\ntrict Court concluded the FMLA’s self-care provision did\nnot validly abrogate the State’s immunity from suit. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 15–20. The Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that, unlike the family-\ncare provision at issue in Hibbs, the self-care provision\nwas not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based\ndiscrimination and was not congruent and proportional to\nany pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of\nStates. 626 F. 3d 187. Certiorari was granted. 564 U. S.\n___ (2011).\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  A foundational premise of the federal system is that\nStates, as sovereigns, are immune from suits for damages,\nsave as they elect to waive that defense. See Kimel v.\nFlorida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72–73 (2000); Alden\nv. Maine, 527 U. S. 706 (1999). As an exception to this\n4          COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nprinciple, Congress may abrogate the States’ immunity\nfrom suit pursuant to its powers under §5 of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU. S. 445 (1976).\n    Congress must “mak[e] its intention to abrogate unmis-\ntakably clear in the language of the statute.” Hibbs, 538\nU. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the clear\npurpose to abrogate the States’ immunity. Ibid. (“The\nclarity of Congress’ intent” to abrogate the States’ immun-\nity from suits for damages under the FMLA “is not fairly\ndebatable”). Congress subjected any “public agency” to\nsuit under the FMLA, 29 U. S. C. §2617(a)(2), and a “pub-\nlic agency” is defined to include both “the government of\na State or political subdivision thereof ” and “any agency of\n. . . a State, or a political subdivision of a State,” §§203(x),\n2611(4)(A)(iii).\n    The question then becomes whether the self-care provi-\nsion and its attempt to abrogate the States’ immunity are\na valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Section 5 grants Congress the\npower “to enforce” the substantive guarantees of §1 of\nthe Amendment by “appropriate legislation.” The power\nto enforce “ ‘includes the authority both to remedy and to\ndeter violation[s] of rights guaranteed’ ” by §1. See Board\nof Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365\n(2001) (quoting Kimel, supra, at 81). To ensure Congress’\nenforcement powers under §5 remain enforcement powers,\nas envisioned by the ratifiers of the Amendment, rather\nthan powers to redefine the substantive scope of §1, Con-\ngress “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “ ‘to rem-\nedy or prevent’ ” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,\n527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999).\n    Whether a congressional Act passed under §5 can im-\npose monetary liability upon States requires an assess-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nment of both the “ ‘evil’ or ‘wrong’ that Congress intended\nto remedy,” ibid., and the means Congress adopted to\naddress that evil, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.\n507, 520 (1997). Legislation enacted under §5 must be\ntargeted at “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid,\nsupra, at 639; see Kimel, supra, at 88; City of Boerne,\n521 U. S., at 525. And “[t]here must be a congruence\nand proportionality between the injury to be prevented or\nremedied and the means adopted to that end.” Id., at 520.\n   Under this analysis Hibbs permitted employees to re-\ncover damages from States for violations of subparagraph\n(C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence\nof a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination\nin family-leave policies. States had facially discriminatory\nleave policies that granted longer periods of leave to wom-\nen than to men. 538 U. S., at 730–731. States also admin-\nistered facially neutral family-leave policies in gender-\nbiased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what\nCongress found to be a “pervasive sex-role stereotype that\ncaring for family members is women’s work,” id., at 731,\na stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in\nearlier times, id., at 729. Faced with “the States’ record of\nunconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-\nbased discrimination in the administration of leave bene-\nfits,” Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to\ngive all employees the opportunity to take family-care\nleave was “narrowly targeted at the faultline between\nwork and family—precisely where sex-based overgenerali-\nzation has been and remains strongest.” Id., at 735, 738.\n                            B\n  The same cannot be said for requiring the States to give\nall employees the opportunity to take self-care leave.\nPetitioner advances three arguments for allowing employ-\nees to recover damages from States that violate the\n6         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nFMLA’s self-care provision: The self-care provision stand-\ning alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyp-\ning; the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care\nprovision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the\nburden on single parents. But what the family-care provi-\nsions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks,\nnamely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional viola-\ntions accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to\naddress or prevent those violations.\n                               1\n   Standing alone, the self-care provision is not a valid\nabrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. When the\nFMLA was enacted, “ninety-five percent of full-time state-\nand local-government employees were covered by paid sick\nleave plans and ninety-six percent of such employees\nlikewise enjoyed short-term disability protection.” Brief\nfor States of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (hereinaf-\nter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S.\nDept. of Labor, Employee Benefits in State and Local\nGovernments 17–26 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The\nevidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory\nself-care leave policies or that they administered neutral\nself-care leave policies in a discriminatory way. And there\nis scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported\nstereotype harbored by employers that women take self-\ncare leave more often than men. Congress considered\nevidence that “men and women are out on medical leave\napproximately equally.” H. R. Rep. No. 101–28, pt. 1, p.\n15 (1989) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record\nshows employers formulated self-care leave policies based\non a contrary view.\n   Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or\nsex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is\napparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the\nself-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThe legislative history of the self-care provision reveals a\nconcern for the economic burdens on the employee and the\nemployee’s family resulting from illness-related job loss\nand a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not\nsex. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, pp. 11–12 (1993); H. R.\nRep., at 23. In the findings pertinent to the self-care\nprovision, the statute makes no reference to any distinc-\ntion on the basis of sex. See 29 U. S. C. §2601(a)(4)\n(“[T]here is inadequate job security for employees who\nhave serious health conditions that prevent them from\nworking for temporary periods”). By contrast, with regard\nto family care Congress invoked concerns related to gen-\nder. See §2601(a)(5) (“[D]ue to the nature of the roles of\nmen and women in our society, the primary responsibility\nfor family caretaking often falls on women, and such\nresponsibility affects the working lives of women more\nthan it affects the working lives of men”).\n   It is true the self-care provision offers some women a\nbenefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not\ncongruent and proportional to any identified constitutional\nviolations. At the time of the FMLA’s enactment, “ninety-\nfive percent” of state employees had paid sick-leave plans\nat work, and “ninety-six percent” had short-term disability\nprotection. Texas Brief 13–14 (citing BLS Rept. 17–26).\nState employees presumably could take leave for pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses under these policies, and Congress did\nnot document any pattern of States excluding pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses from sick-leave or disability-leave poli-\ncies. “Congress . . . said nothing about the existence or\nadequacy of state remedies.” Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S.,\nat 644. It follows that abrogating the States’ immunity\nfrom suits for damages for failure to give self-care leave is\nnot a congruent and proportional remedy if the existing\nstate leave policies would have sufficed.\n8          COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                               2\n   As an alternative justification for the self-care provision,\nit has been suggested that the provision is a necessary\nadjunct to the family-care provisions. Petitioner argues\nthat employers may assume women are more likely to\ntake family-care leave than men and that the FMLA\ntherefore offers up to 12 weeks of leave for family care and\nself care combined. According to petitioner, when the self-\ncare provision is coupled with the family-care provisions,\nthe self-care provision could reduce the difference in the\nexpected number of weeks of FMLA leave that different\nemployees take for different reasons.\n   The fact that self-care leave could have this effect does\nnot mean that it would. If, for example, women are ex-\npected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and\nmen to take 10, and women and men are each expected to\ntake 5 days of self-care leave per year, the difference in the\nexpected number of days of leave and cost to the employer\nremains the same regardless of the availability of self-care\nleave. Congress made no findings, and received no specific\ntestimony, to suggest the availability of self-care leave\nequalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and\nwomen will take. Even if women take family-care leave\nmore often than men, men do not take self-care leave more\noften than women; and there is little evidence that em-\nployers assume they do. See H. R. Rep., at 15. Petitioner\nsuggests that some women will be expected to take all 12\nweeks of leave under the FMLA for family-care purposes,\nand therefore that any amount of self-care leave taken by\nmen will diminish the difference in the amount of FMLA\nleave taken by men and women. But there is little evi-\ndence to support petitioner’s assumption about the magni-\ntude of women’s expected FMLA leave for family-care\npurposes. And men are only expected to take five days of\nsick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision\ndiminishes the difference in expected leave time by a\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Petitioner’s overly complicated argument about\nhow the self-care provision works in tandem with the\nfamily-care provisions is unconvincing and in the end does\nnot comply with the clear requirements of City of Boerne.\n   In addition petitioner’s first defense of the self-care\nprovision contradicts his second defense of the provision.\nIn the first defense, the Court is told employers assume\nwomen take more self-care leave than men. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 10–12. In the second defense, the Court is told\nthe self-care provision provides an incentive to hire women\nthat will counteract the incentives created by the family-\ncare provisions because employers assume women take\nmore family-care leave than men. But if the first defense\nis correct, the second defense is wrong. In other words, if\nemployers assume women take self-care leave more often\nthan men (the first defense), a self-care provision will not\nprovide an incentive to hire women. To the contrary, the\nself-care provision would provide an incentive to discrimi-\nnate against women.\n   There is “little support in the record for the concerns\nthat supposedly animated” the self-care provision. Florida\nPrepaid, supra, at 639. Only supposition and conjecture\nsupport the contention that the self-care provision is\nnecessary to make the family-care provisions effective.\nThe evidence documented in support of the self-care provi-\nsion is, to a large degree, unrelated to sex discrimination,\nor to the administration of the family-care provisions. See\nsupra, at 7. Congress made no findings and did not cite\nspecific or detailed evidence to show how the self-care\nprovision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how\nit reduces an employer’s incentives to discriminate against\nwomen. And “Congress . . . said nothing about the exist-\nence or adequacy of state” sick-leave policies. Florida\nPrepaid, supra, at 644; see Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373.\n10         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nUnder this Court’s precedents, more is required to sub-\nject unconsenting States to suits for damages, particularly\nwhere, as here, it is for violations of a provision (the self-\ncare provision) that is a supposedly preventive step in aid\nof already preventive provisions (the family-care provi-\nsions). See Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 642 (“[T]he\nlegislative record still provides little support for the prop-\nosition that Congress sought to remedy a Fourteenth\nAmendment violation in enacting the Patent Remedy\nAct”); Kimel, 528 U. S., at 88 (“One means by which we\nhave made such a determination . . . is by examining the\nlegislative record containing the reasons for Congress’\naction”).\n   The “few fleeting references” to how self-care leave is\ninseparable from family-care leave fall short of what is\nrequired for a valid abrogation of States’ immunity from\nsuits for damages. Florida Prepaid, supra, at 644. These\n“isolated sentences clipped from floor debates” and testi-\nmony, Kimel, supra, at 89, are stated as conclusions,\nunsupported by evidence or findings about how the self-\ncare provision interrelates to the family-care provisions to\ncounteract employers’ incentives to discriminate against\nwomen. Congress must rely on more than abstract gener-\nalities to subject the States to suits for damages. Other-\nwise, Congress could choose to combat the purported\neffects of the family-care provisions by allowing employees\nto sue States that do not permit employees to take vaca-\ntion time under the FMLA. There is nothing in particular\nabout self-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal\nreason, that connects it to gender discrimination. And\nwhen the issue, as here, is whether subparagraph (D) can\nabrogate a State’s immunity from damages, there is no\nsufficient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated nexus, be-\ntween self-care leave and gender discrimination by state\nemployers. Documented discrimination against women in\nthe general workplace is a persistent, unfortunate reality,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nand, we must assume, a still prevalent wrong. An explicit\npurpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to\nimprove workplace conditions for women. See 29 U. S. C.\n§§2601(b)(4), (5). But States may not be subject to suits\nfor damages based on violations of a comprehensive stat-\nute unless Congress has identified a specific pattern of\nconstitutional violations by state employers. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U. S., at 532.\n                               3\n  The petitioner’s last defense of the self-care provision is\nthat the provision helps single parents retain their jobs\nwhen they become ill. This, however, does not explain\nhow the provision remedies or prevents constitutional\nviolations. The fact that most single parents happen to be\nwomen, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 7, demonstrates, at\nmost, that the self-care provision was directed at remedy-\ning employers’ neutral leave restrictions which have a\ndisparate effect on women. “Although disparate impact\nmay be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such\nevidence alone is insufficient [to prove a constitutional\nviolation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects\nstate action to strict scrutiny.” Garrett, supra, at 372–373;\nsee Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U. S. 53, 82–83 (2001)\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.\n229, 239 (1976). To the extent, then, that the self-care\nprovision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate\nimpact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of consti-\ntutional violations. Because, moreover, it is “unlikely that\nmany of the [neutral leave policies] . . . affected by” the\nself-care provision are unconstitutional, “the scope of the\n[self-care provision is] out of proportion to its supposed\nremedial or preventive objectives.” Kimel, supra, at 82;\nsee City of Boerne, supra, at 519.\n  Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity from suits for damages. See, e.g., Sossa-\n12         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmon v. Texas, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“A\nState . . . may choose to waive its immunity in federal\ncourt at its pleasure”). Discrimination against women is\ncontrary to the public policy of the State of Maryland, see,\ne.g., Maryland’s Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. State\nGovt. Code Ann. §20–606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has\nconceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 35. If the State agrees with petitioner that damages\nliability for violations of the self-care provision is neces-\nsary to combat discrimination against women, the State\nmay waive its immunity or create a parallel state law\ncause of action.\n                       *    *     *\n  As a consequence of our constitutional design, money\ndamages are the exception when sovereigns are defend-\nants. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 29 (1981). Subjecting States to\nsuits for damages pursuant to §5 requires more than a\ntheory for why abrogating the States’ immunity aids in, or\nadvances, a stated congressional purpose. To abrogate the\nStates’ immunity from suits for damages under §5, Con-\ngress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations\nand tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the\ndocumented violations. It failed to do so when it allowed\nemployees to sue States for violations of the FMLA’s self-\ncare provision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This grading of Congress’s homework\nis a task we are ill suited to perform and ill advised to\nundertake.\n   I adhere to my view that we should instead adopt an\napproach that is properly tied to the text of §5, which\ngrants Congress the power “to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation,” the other provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. (Emphasis added.) As I have explained in\ngreater detail elsewhere, see Lane, supra, at 558–560,\noutside of the context of racial discrimination (which is\ndifferent for stare decisis reasons), I would limit Con-\ngress’s §5 power to the regulation of conduct that itself\n2         COLEMAN v.

See, e.g.,\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 522 (2004). The FMLA’s\nself-care provision, Maryland asserts, trains not on the\nright to be free from gender discrimination, but on an\n“equal protection right to be free from irrational state\nemployment discrimination based on a medical condition.”\nBrief for Respondents 14. The plurality agrees, concluding\nthat the self-care provision reveals “a concern for discrim-\nination on the basis of illness, not sex.” Ante, at 7.

See\nSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 100 (1996) (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Beyond debate, 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1)(D) is valid Com-\nmerce Clause legislation. See infra, at 21.

As well, the\nplurality underplays the main theme of our decision in\nHibbs: “The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free\nfrom gender-based discrimination in the workplace.” 538\nU. S., at 728.\n  I begin with the text of the statute, which repeatedly\nemphasizes gender discrimination. One of the FMLA’s\nstated purposes is to “entitle employees to take reasonable\nleave,” 29 U. S. C. §2601(b)(2), “in a manner that, con-\nsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, minimizes the potential for employment dis-\ncrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally\nthat leave is available for eligible medical reasons (includ-\ning maternity-related disability) and for compelling family\nreasons, on a gender-neutral basis.” §2601(b)(4). Another\nidentified aim is “to promote the goal of equal employment\nopportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal\nProtection Clause].” §2601(b)(5). “[E]mployment stand-\nards that apply to one gender only,” Congress expressly\nfound, “have serious potential for encouraging employers\nto discriminate against employees and applicants for\nemployment who are of that gender.” §2601(a)(6).\n  The FMLA’s purpose and legislative history reinforce\nthe conclusion that the FMLA, in its entirety, is directed\nat sex discrimination. Indeed, the FMLA was originally\nenvisioned as a way to guarantee—without singling out\nwomen or pregnancy—that pregnant women would not\nlose their jobs when they gave birth. The self-care provi-\nsion achieves that aim.\n  A brief history is in order. In his 1982 congressional\ncampaign, then-candidate Howard Berman pledged to\nintroduce legislation similar to the California law chal-\nlenged in California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra,\n479 U. S. 272 (1987). S. Wisensale, Family Leave Policy:\nThe Political Economy of Work and Family in America 134\n4            COLEMAN v.

California’s law, enacted\nin 1978, made it unlawful for an employer to refuse to\ngrant female employees disabled by pregnancy or child-\nbirth up to four months’ unpaid, job-protected leave. See\n1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, §1, now codified at Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. §12945(a)(1) (West Supp. 2012).\n  The California law sharply divided women’s rights ad-\nvocates. “Equal-treatment” feminists asserted it violated\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act’s (PDA) commitment\nto treating pregnancy the same as other disabilities.2 It\ndid so by requiring leave only for disability caused by\npregnancy and childbirth, thereby treating pregnancy as\nsui generis. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union\net al. as Amici Curiae in California Fed., O. T. 1985,\nNo. 85–494, pp. 5–10. “Equal-opportunity” feminists dis-\nagreed, urging that the California law was consistent with\nthe PDA because it remedied the discriminatory burden\nthat inadequate leave policies placed on a woman’s right\nto procreate.

Section 2612(a)(1)(D)\ncan therefore “be understood as responsive to, or designed\nto prevent, unconstitutional behavior.” Id., at 532.\n   Although the PDA proscribed blatant discrimination on\nthe basis of pregnancy, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000e(k), 2000e–\n2, supra, at 4, n. 2, the Act is fairly described as a nec-\nessary, but not a sufficient measure. FMLA hearings\nconducted between 1986 and 1993 included illustrative testi-\nmony from women fired after becoming pregnant or giving\nbirth. For example, Beverly Wilkenson was granted seven\nweeks of leave upon the birth of her child. On the eve of\nher return to work, a superior informed her that her job\nhad been eliminated. He stated: “Beverly, the best thing\nfor you to do is stay home and take care of your baby and\ncollect your unemployment.” Hearing on H. R. 770 before\nthe Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the\nHouse Committee on Education and Labor, 101st Cong.,\n1st Sess., 12 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing)\n(statement of Beverly Wilkenson).

A spokeswoman for the Mayor’s\nCommission on Women’s Affairs in Chicago testified: “The\nlack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the\nworkplace has created an environment where discrimina-\ntion is rampant.

As summarized by the\nAmerican Bar Association:\n    “Historically, denial or curtailment of women’s em-\n    ployment opportunities has been traceable directly to\n    the pervasive presumption that women are mothers\n    first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology\n    about women’s roles has in turn justified discrimina-\n    tion against women when they are mothers or mothers-\n    to-be.” 1989 House Hearing 248 (American Bar\n    Association Background Report). See also Hibbs, 538\n    U. S., at 736 (quoting same language).\n  “Many pregnant women have been fired when their em-\nployer refused to provide an adequate leave of absence,”\nCongress had ample cause to conclude. See H. R. Rep. No.\n99–699, pt. 2, p. 22 (1986). Pregnancy, Congress also\nfound, has a marked impact on women’s earnings. One\nyear after childbirth, mothers’ earnings fell to $1.40 per\nhour less than those of women who had not given birth.\nSee 1991 Senate Report 28. See also 1989 House Hearing\n356–357 (Report of 9to5, National Association of Working\nWomen (citing same study)).\n  Congress heard evidence tying this pattern of discrimi-\nnation to the States. A 50-state survey by the Yale Bush\nCenter Infant Care Leave Project concluded that “[t]he\nproportion and construction of leave policies available to\npublic sector employees differs little from those offered\nprivate sector employees.” Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 730, n. 3\n(quoting 1986 House Hearing 33 (statement of Meryl\nFrank)). Roughly 28% of women employed in the public\nsector did not receive eight weeks of job-protected medical\nleave to recover from childbirth. See 1987 Senate Hear-\nings, pt. 1, pp. 31, 35, 39 (statement of James T. Bond,\n10         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nNational Counsel of Jewish Women). A South Carolina\nstate legislator testified: “[I]n South Carolina, as well as in\nother states . . . no unemployment compensation is paid\nto a woman who is necessarily absent from her place of\nemployment because of pregnancy or maternity.” See id.,\npt. 2, p. 361 (statement of Rep. Irene Rudnick). According\nto an employee of the State of Georgia, if state employees\ntook leave, it was held against them when they were\nconsidered for promotions: “It is common practice for my\nDepartment to compare the balance sheets of workers who\nhave and have not used [leave] benefits in determining\nwho should and should not be promoted.” Hearing on\nH. R. 2 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management\nRelations of the House Committee on Education and\nLabor, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1991) (statement of\nRobert E. Dawkins). See also id., at 33 (One type of leave\nfor Georgia state employees “boils down to whether your\nsupervisor wants you to come back or not.”). In short,\nCongress had every reason to believe that a pattern of\nworkplace discrimination against pregnant women existed\nin public-sector employment, just as it did in the private\nsector.\n                              B\n  “[A] state’s refusal to provide pregnancy leave to its\nemployees,” Maryland responds, is “not unconstitutional.”\nBrief for Respondents 23 (citing Geduldig v. Aiello, 417\nU. S. 484, 495 (1974)). Aiello’s footnote 20 proclaimed that\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimi-\nnation on the basis of sex. In my view, this case is a fit\noccasion to revisit that conclusion. Footnote 20 reads:\n         “The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is\n     . . . a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71\n     (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677\n     (1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as\n     such.

While it is true that only women can become\n    pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative\n    classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based\n    classification . . . .\n       “The lack of identity between the excluded disability\n    and gender as such under this insurance program\n    becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The\n    program divides potential recipients into two groups—\n    pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the\n    first group is exclusively female, the second includes\n    members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial bene-\n    fits of the program thus accrue to members of both\n    sexes.” 417 U. S., at 496, n. 20.\n    First, “[a]s an abstract statement,” it is “simply false”\nthat “a classification based on pregnancy is gender-\nneutral.” Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506\nU. S. 263, 327 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Rather,\ndiscriminating on the basis of pregnancy “[b]y definition\n. . . discriminates on account of sex; for it is the capacity\nto become pregnant which primarily differentiates the fe-\nmale from the male.” General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429\nU. S. 125, 161–162 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting). See\nalso Issacharoff & Rosenblum, Women and the Workplace:\nAccommodating the Demands of Pregnancy, 94 Colum.\nL. Rev. 2154, 2180 (1994) (“[I]t is precisely because\npregnancy is a condition unique to women that the exclu-\nsion of pregnancy from disability coverage is a sex-based\nclassification . . . .”).\n    This reality is well illustrated by the facts of Aiello. The\nCalifornia disability-insurance program at issue granted\ndisability benefits for virtually any conceivable work\ndisability, including those arising from cosmetic surgery,\n12        COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nskiing accidents, and alcoholism. See Brief for EEOC as\nAmicus Curiae in Aiello, O. T. 1973, No. 73–640, p. 7. It\nalso compensated men for disabilities caused by ailments\nand procedures that affected men alone: for example,\nvasectomies, circumcision, and prostatectomies. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae\nin id., at 17–18. Only pregnancy was excluded from the\ndefinition of disability. See Cal. Un. Ins. Code Ann. §2626\n(West 1972); Aiello, 417 U. S., at 489. As Justice Brennan\ninsightfully concluded in dissent, “a limitation is imposed\nupon the disabilities for which women workers may re-\ncover, while men receive full compensation for all disabili-\nties suffered . . . . Such dissimilar treatment of men and\nwomen, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably\nlinked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimina-\ntion.” Id., at 501.\n   Second, pregnancy provided a central justification for\nthe historic discrimination against women this Court\nchronicled in Hibbs. See 538 U. S., at 729 (“[A] proper\ndischarge of [a woman’s] maternal functions—having in\nview not merely her own health, but the well-being of the\nrace—justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed\nas well as the passion of man.” (quoting Muller v. Oregon,\n208 U. S. 412, 422 (1908); 2d and 3d alterations in Hibbs)).\nSee also Siegel, Employment Equality Under the Preg-\nnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 94 Yale L. J. 929, 942\n(1985) (Pregnancy “is a biological difference central to the\ndefinition of gender roles, one traditionally believed to\nrender women unfit for employment.”). Relatedly, dis-\ncrimination against pregnant employees was often “based\nnot on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning\nthe future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child\nwas born or on views about what her behavior should be.”\nWilliams 355. See also S. Rep. No. 95–331, p. 3 (1977)\n(“[T]he assumption that women will become pregnant and\nleave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyp-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

It is also inextricably intertwined with\nemployers’ “stereotypical views about women’s commit-\nment to work and their value as employees.” Hibbs, 538\nU. S., at 736. Because pregnancy discrimination is in-\nevitably sex discrimination, and because discrimination\nagainst women is tightly interwoven with society’s beliefs\nabout pregnancy and motherhood, I would hold that Aiello\nwas egregiously wrong to declare that discrimination on\nthe basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of\nsex.\n                              C\n   Boerne’s third step requires “ ‘a congruence and propor-\ntionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied\nand the means adopted to that end.’ ” Ante, at 5 (quoting\n521 U. S., at 520). Section 2612(a)(1)(D), I would conclude,\nis an appropriate response to pervasive discriminatory\ntreatment of pregnant women. In separating self-care\nleave for the physical disability following childbirth,\n§2612(a)(1)(D), which affects only women, from family-\ncare leave for parenting a newborn baby, §2612(a)(1)(A),\nfor which men and women are equally suited, Congress\ncould attack gender discrimination and challenge stereo-\ntypes of women as lone childrearers. Cf. Hibbs, 538 U. S.,\nat 731 (States’ extended “maternity” leaves, far exceeding\na woman’s physical disability following childbirth, were\nattributable “to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that\ncaring for family members is women’s work.”).\n   It would make scant sense to provide job-protected leave\nfor a woman to care for a newborn, but not for her recov-\nery from delivery, a miscarriage, or the birth of a stillborn\nbaby. And allowing States to provide no pregnancy-\ndisability leave at all, given that only women can become\n14         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\npregnant, would obviously “exclude far more women than\nmen from the workplace.” Id., at 738.\n   The plurality’s statement that Congress lacked “wide-\nspread evidence of sex discrimination . . . in the admin-\nistration of sick leave,” ante, at 6, misses the point. So too\ndoes the plurality’s observation that state employees likely\n“could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses”—\npresumably severe morning sickness, toxemia, etc.—under\npaid sick-leave plans, ante, at 7. Congress heard evidence\nthat existing sick-leave plans were inadequate to ensure\nthat women were not fired when they needed to take time\nout to recover their strength and stamina after childbirth.\nThe self-care provision responds to that evidence by re-\nquiring employers to allow leave for “ongoing pregnancy,\nmiscarriages, . . . the need for prenatal care, childbirth,\nand recovery from childbirth.” S. Rep. No. 103–3, p. 29\n(1993).\n   That §2612(a)(1)(D) entitles all employees to up to 12\nweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for a serious health\ncondition, rather than singling out pregnancy or child-\nbirth, does not mean that the provision lacks the requisite\ncongruence and proportionality to the identified constitu-\ntional violations. As earlier noted, supra, at 6–7, Congress\nmade plain its rationale for the prescription’s broader\ncompass: Congress sought to ward off the unconstitutional\ndiscrimination it believed would attend a pregnancy-only\nleave requirement. Under the caption “Equal protection\nand non-discrimination,” Congress explained:\n       “The FMLA addresses the basic leave needs of all\n     employees. . . . This is an important principle reflected\n     in the bill.\n       “A law providing special protection to women . . . ,\n     in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of caus-\n     ing discriminatory treatment. Employers might be\n     less inclined to hire women . . . . For example, legisla-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Legislation ad-\n     dressing the needs of all workers equally does not\n     have this effect. By addressing the serious leave\n     needs of all employees, the FMLA avoids providing\n     employers the temptation to discriminate [against\n     women].\n     .             .         .          .           .\n     “The legislation is [thus] based not only on the Com-\n     merce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal pro-\n     tection . . . embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n     H. R. Rep. No. 102–135, pt. 1, pp. 27–28 (1991) (here-\n     inafter 1991 House Report).\n  Congress’ concern was solidly grounded in workplace\nrealities. After this Court upheld California’s pregnancy-\nonly leave policy in California Fed., Don Butler, President\nof the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, one of\nthe plaintiffs in that case, told National Public Radio\nreporter Nina Totenberg that, as a result of the decision,\n“many employers will be prone to discriminate against\nwomen in hiring and hire males instead.” 1987 House\nHearing 36. Totenberg replied, “But that is illegal, too”—\nto which Butler responded, “Well, that is illegal, but try to\nprove it.” Ibid.\n  Finally, as in Hibbs, it is important to note the moderate\ncast of the FMLA, in particular, the considerable limi-\ntations Congress placed on §§2612(a)(1)(A)–(D)’s leave\nrequirement. See 538 U. S., at 738–739. FMLA leave is\nunpaid. It is limited to employees who have worked\nat least one year for the employer and at least 1,250\nhours during the past year. §§2611(2)(A), 2612(c)(1).\nHigh-ranking employees, including state elected officials\nand their staffs, are not within the Act’s compass.\n§§203(e)(2)(C), 2611(3). Employees must provide advance\nnotice of foreseeable leaves. §2612(e). Employers may\n16             COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nrequire a doctor’s certification of a serious health condi-\ntion. §2613(a). And, if an employer violates the FMLA,\nthe employees’ recoverable damages are “strictly defined\nand measured by actual monetary losses.” Hibbs, 538\nU. S., at 740 (citing §§2617(a)(1)(A)(i)–(iii)). The self-care\nprovision, I would therefore hold, is congruent and propor-\ntional to the injury to be prevented.\n                            III\n  But even if Aiello senselessly holds sway, and impedes\nthe conclusion that §2612(a)(1)(D) is an appropriate re-\nsponse to the States’ unconstitutional discrimination\nagainst pregnant women,6 I would nevertheless conclude\nthat the FMLA is valid §5 legislation. For it is a meet\nresponse to “the States’ record of unconstitutional partici-\n——————\n  6 Notably,    the plurality does not cite or discuss Geduldig v. Aiello, 417\nU.

Providing for self-\ncare would thus reduce employers’ corresponding incentive\nto discriminate against women in hiring and promotion.\nIn other words, “[t]he availability of self-care leave to men\nserves to blunt the force of stereotypes of women as prima-\nry caregivers by increasing the odds that men and women\nwill invoke the FMLA’s leave provisions in near-equal\nnumbers.” See Brief for National Partnership for Women\n& Families et al. as Amici Curiae 26. As Judge Lipez\nexplained:\n      “If Congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for\n    other family members, there is greater likelihood that\n    the FMLA would have been perceived as further rea-\n    son to avoid granting employment opportunities to\n    women. Heretofore, women have provided most of the\n    child and elder care, and legislation that focused on\n    these duties could have had a deleterious impact be-\n    cause of the prevalent notion that women take more\n    advantage of such leave policies. The inclusion of per-\n    sonal medical leave in the scheme, unrelated to any\n    need to care for another person, undermines the as-\n    sumption that women are the only ones taking leave\n    because men, presumably, are as likely as women to\n    get sick.” Laro v. New Hampshire, 259 F. 3d 1, 21\n    (CA1 2001) (dissenting opinion).\n  Senator Barbara Boxer advanced a similar point. Re-\nsponding to assertions that the FMLA would lead employ-\ners to discriminate against women, Senator Boxer stated:\n“[T]o say that women will not be hired by business is a\nspecious argument . . . . Men also get sick. They get\ncancer. They get heart disease. They have ailments. And\nthis bill applies to men and women.” 139 Cong. Rec. 1697\n(1993). See also 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 2, p. 536 (“I\n20         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njust think it’s wrong that there will be a perception that\nthis is something that only women will take and they are,\ntherefore, more expensive. Both men and women have\nmedical conditions . . . .” (statement of Prof. Susan Deller\nRoss, Georgetown University Law Center)).\n   The plurality therefore gets it wrong in concluding that\n“[o]nly supposition and conjecture support the contention\nthat the self-care provision is necessary to make the family-\ncare provisions effective.” Ante, at 9. Self-care leave, I\nwould hold, is a key part of Congress’ endeavor to make it\nfeasible for women to work and have families. See 1991\nSenate Report 25–26 (“This legislation is essential if the\nnation is to address the dramatic changes that have oc-\ncurred in the American workforce in recent years. . . . The\nonce-typical American family, where the father worked for\npay and the mother stayed at home with the children, is\nvanishing. . . . Today, more than one-half of all mothers\nwith infants under one year of age work outside the home.\nThat figure has doubled since 1970 . . . . By the year 2000,\nabout three out of every four American children will have\nmothers in the workforce.”). By reducing an employer’s\nperceived incentive to avoid hiring women, §2612(a)(1)(D)\nlessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise\nto the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart.\nThe plurality offers no legitimate ground to dilute the\nforce of the Act.\n                             IV\n   Two additional points. First, this Court reached a dif-\nferent conclusion than the one I reach here in Board of\nTrustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001),\nand Kimel, 528 U. S. 62. In those cases, as we observed in\nHibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age\ndiscrimination, respectively. Neither disability nor age is\na suspect classification under this Court’s Equal Protec-\ntion Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            21\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nbasis of disability or age as long as the classification is\nrationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Gar-\nrett, 531 U. S., at 366–367; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 83–84.\nTherefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed\nto prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress\nneeded to rely on a pattern of irrational state discrimina-\ntion on the basis of disability or age. See Garrett, 531\nU. S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89. Here, however,\nCongress homed in on gender discrimination, which trig-\ngers heightened review. See United States v. Virginia, 518\nU. S. 515, 531 (1996) (“Parties who seek to defend gender-\nbased government action must demonstrate an exceeding-\nly persuasive justification for that action.” (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)). “[I]t was [therefore] easier for\nCongress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.”\nHibbs, 538 U. S., at 736.\n   Finally, the plurality’s opinion does not authorize state\nemployers to violate the FMLA, although it does block\ninjured employees from suing for monetary relief. The\nself-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legis-\nlation, Maryland concedes, and consequently binds the\nstates, as well as the private sector. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25;\nBrief for Respondents 32–33. An employee wrongly denied\nself-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursu-\nant to Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), seek injunc-\ntive relief against the responsible state official. See Brief\nfor Respondents 33. Moreover, the U. S. Department of\nLabor may bring an action against a state for violating the\nself-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an\nemployee’s behalf. 29 U. S. C. §§2617(b)(2)–(3), (d).\n                           V\n  The plurality pays scant attention to the overarching\naim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work\nwhile sustaining family life. Over the course of eight\nyears, Congress considered the problem of workplace\n22        COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndiscrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to\nreduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs. Essen-\ntial to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legisla-\ntive package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared\nto women only. Congress thereby reduced employers’\nincentives to prefer men over women, advanced women’s\neconomic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more\negalitarian relationship at home and at work. The self-\ncare provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my\nview, a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the\njudgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit.\n</pre>", "id": 625722, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/20/Coleman_v._Court_of_Appeals_of_Md..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 11, 2012—Decided March 20, 2012\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) entitles an employ-\n  ee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per year for (A) the\n  care of a newborn son or daughter; (B) the adoption or foster-care\n  placement of a child; (C) the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or par-\n  ent with a serious medical condition; and (D) the employee’s own se-\n  rious health condition when the condition interferes with the employ-\n  ee’s ability to perform at work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The FMLA\n  also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages\n  “against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or\n  State court.” §2617(a)(2). For present purposes, subparagraphs (A),\n  (B), and (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and subpar-\n  agraph (D) as the self-care provision. In Nevada Dept. of Human Re-\n  sources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 730−732, this Court held that Con-\n  gress could subject States to suit for violations of subparagraph (C)\n  based on evidence of family-leave policies that discriminated on the\n  basis of sex.\n     Petitioner filed suit, alleging that his employer, the Maryland\n  Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the State, violated the FMLA\n  by denying him self-care leave. The Federal District Court dismissed\n  the suit on sovereign immunity grounds. The Fourth Circuit af-\n  firmed, holding that unlike the family-care provision in Hibbs, the\n  self-care provision was not directed at an identified pattern of gen-\n  der-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to\n  any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n626 F. 3d 187, affirmed.\n2              COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS,\n    and JUSTICE ALITO, concluded that suits against States under the\n    self-care provision are barred by sovereign immunity. Pp. 3−12.\n       (a) Under the federal system, States, as sovereigns, are immune\n    from damages suits, unless they waive that defense. See, e.g., Kimel\n    v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72−73. Congress may also ab-\n    rogate the States’ immunity pursuant to its powers under §5 of the\n    Fourteenth Amendment, but it must make that intention “unmistak-\n    ably clear in the language of the statute,” Hibbs, supra, at 726. It did\n    so in the FMLA. Congress also “must tailor” legislation enacted un-\n    der §5 “to remedy or prevent” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\n    Amendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid Postsecond-\n    ary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639.\n    “There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury\n    to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.”\n    City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520. Pp. 3−5.\n       (b) The sex-based discrimination that supported allowing subpara-\n    graph (C) suits against States is absent with respect to the self-care\n    provision. Petitioner’s three arguments to the contrary are unper-\n    suasive. Pp. 5–12.\n         (1) Petitioner maintains that the self-care provision addresses\n    sex discrimination and sex stereotyping. But the provision, standing\n    alone, is not a valid abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. At\n    the time the FMLA was enacted, there was no evidence of such dis-\n    crimination or stereotyping in sick-leave policies. Congress was con-\n    cerned about the economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss\n    on employees and their families and about discrimination based on\n    illness, not sex. Although the self-care provision offers some women\n    a benefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-related ill-\n    nesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not congruent and proportional\n    to any identified constitutional violations. When the FMLA was en-\n    acted, Congress had no evidence that States were excluding pregnan-\n    cy-related illnesses from their leave policies. Pp. 6–7.\n         (2) Petitioner also argues that the self-care provision is a neces-\n    sary adjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs. But his\n    claim—that the provisions work in tandem to ensure the equal avail-\n    ability of total FMLA leave time to women and men despite their dif-\n    ferent leave-usage patterns―is unconvincing and does not comply\n    with the requirements of City of Boerne. Also, there are no congres-\n    sional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care provision is nec-\n    essary to the family-care provisions or how it reduces employer dis-\n    crimination against women. Pp. 8–11.\n         (3) Finally, petitioner contends that the self-care provision helps\n    single parents keep their jobs when they get ill. The fact that most\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  single parents happen to be women demonstrates, at most, that the\n  self-care provision was directed at remedying neutral leave re-\n  strictions that have a disparate effect on women.                However,\n  “[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant evidence of . . . discrim-\n  ination . . . such evidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional\n  violation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state ac-\n  tion to strict scrutiny.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,\n  531 U. S. 356, 373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral\n  leave policies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional,\n  the scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its supposed\n  remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 11−12.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA adhered to his view that the Court should abandon\n  the “congruence and proportionality” approach in favor of one that is\n  properly tied to the text of §5, which grants Congress the power “to\n  enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the other provisions of the Four-\n  teenth Amendment. Outside the context of racial discrimination,\n  Congress’s §5 power should be limited to the regulation of conduct\n  that itself violates the Fourteenth Amendment and thus would not\n  reach a State’s failure to grant self-care leave to its employees.\n  Pp. 1−2.\n\n   KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an\nopinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

The statute in\nquestion is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107\nStat. 6, 29 U. S. C. §2601 et seq. The provision at issue\nrequires employers, including state employers, to grant\nunpaid leave for self care for a serious medical condition,\nprovided other statutory requisites are met, particularly\nrequirements that the total amount of annual leave taken\nunder all the Act’s provisions does not exceed a stated\nmaximum. §2612(a)(1)(d). In agreement with every Court\nof Appeals to have addressed this question, this Court now\nholds that suits against States under this provision are\nbarred by the States’ immunity as sovereigns in our feder-\nal system. See 626 F. 3d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below);\nNelson v. University of Tex., 535 F. 3d 318 (CA5 2008);\n2          COLEMAN v.

An employee may take\nleave under the FMLA for: (A) “the birth of a son or\ndaughter . . . in order to care for such son or daughter,” (B)\nthe adoption or foster-care placement of a child with the\nemployee, (C) the care of a “spouse . . . son, daughter, or\nparent” with “a serious health condition,” and (D) the\nemployee’s own serious health condition when the condi-\ntion interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at\nwork. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The Act creates a private\nright of action to seek both equitable relief and money\ndamages “against any employer (including a public agen-\ncy) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdic-\ntion.” §2617(a)(2). As noted, subparagraph (D) is at issue\nhere.\n   This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003).\nSubparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave for rea-\nsons related to family care, and those three provisions are\nreferred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held\nthat Congress could subject the States to suit for viola-\ntions of subparagraph (C), §2612(a)(1)(C). That holding\nrested on evidence that States had family-leave policies\nthat differentiated on the basis of sex and that States\nadministered even neutral family-leave policies in ways\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

See id., at 730–732.\nSubparagraph (D), the self-care provision, was not at issue\nin Hibbs.\n                            B\n   Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the Court\nof Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman\nrequested sick leave, he was informed he would be termi-\nnated if he did not resign. Coleman then sued the state\ncourt in the United States District Court for the District of\nMaryland, alleging, inter alia, that his employer violated\nthe FMLA by failing to provide him with self-care leave.\n   The District Court dismissed the suit on the basis that\nthe Maryland Court of Appeals, as an entity of a sovereign\nState, was immune from the suit for damages. The parties\ndo not dispute the District Court’s ruling that the Mary-\nland Court of Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of\nthe State for purposes of sovereign immunity. The Dis-\ntrict Court concluded the FMLA’s self-care provision did\nnot validly abrogate the State’s immunity from suit. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 15–20. The Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that, unlike the family-\ncare provision at issue in Hibbs, the self-care provision\nwas not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based\ndiscrimination and was not congruent and proportional to\nany pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of\nStates. 626 F. 3d 187. Certiorari was granted. 564 U. S.\n___ (2011).\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  A foundational premise of the federal system is that\nStates, as sovereigns, are immune from suits for damages,\nsave as they elect to waive that defense. See Kimel v.\nFlorida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 72–73 (2000); Alden\nv. Maine, 527 U. S. 706 (1999). As an exception to this\n4          COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nprinciple, Congress may abrogate the States’ immunity\nfrom suit pursuant to its powers under §5 of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU. S. 445 (1976).\n    Congress must “mak[e] its intention to abrogate unmis-\ntakably clear in the language of the statute.” Hibbs, 538\nU. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the clear\npurpose to abrogate the States’ immunity. Ibid. (“The\nclarity of Congress’ intent” to abrogate the States’ immun-\nity from suits for damages under the FMLA “is not fairly\ndebatable”). Congress subjected any “public agency” to\nsuit under the FMLA, 29 U. S. C. §2617(a)(2), and a “pub-\nlic agency” is defined to include both “the government of\na State or political subdivision thereof ” and “any agency of\n. . . a State, or a political subdivision of a State,” §§203(x),\n2611(4)(A)(iii).\n    The question then becomes whether the self-care provi-\nsion and its attempt to abrogate the States’ immunity are\na valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Section 5 grants Congress the\npower “to enforce” the substantive guarantees of §1 of\nthe Amendment by “appropriate legislation.” The power\nto enforce “ ‘includes the authority both to remedy and to\ndeter violation[s] of rights guaranteed’ ” by §1. See Board\nof Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365\n(2001) (quoting Kimel, supra, at 81). To ensure Congress’\nenforcement powers under §5 remain enforcement powers,\nas envisioned by the ratifiers of the Amendment, rather\nthan powers to redefine the substantive scope of §1, Con-\ngress “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “ ‘to rem-\nedy or prevent’ ” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed.

And “[t]here must be a congruence\nand proportionality between the injury to be prevented or\nremedied and the means adopted to that end.” Id., at 520.\n   Under this analysis Hibbs permitted employees to re-\ncover damages from States for violations of subparagraph\n(C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon evidence\nof a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination\nin family-leave policies. States had facially discriminatory\nleave policies that granted longer periods of leave to wom-\nen than to men. 538 U. S., at 730–731. States also admin-\nistered facially neutral family-leave policies in gender-\nbiased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what\nCongress found to be a “pervasive sex-role stereotype that\ncaring for family members is women’s work,” id., at 731,\na stereotype to which even this Court had succumbed in\nearlier times, id., at 729. Faced with “the States’ record of\nunconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-\nbased discrimination in the administration of leave bene-\nfits,” Hibbs concluded that requiring state employers to\ngive all employees the opportunity to take family-care\nleave was “narrowly targeted at the faultline between\nwork and family—precisely where sex-based overgenerali-\nzation has been and remains strongest.” Id., at 735, 738.\n                            B\n  The same cannot be said for requiring the States to give\nall employees the opportunity to take self-care leave.\nPetitioner advances three arguments for allowing employ-\nees to recover damages from States that violate the\n6         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nFMLA’s self-care provision: The self-care provision stand-\ning alone addresses sex discrimination and sex stereotyp-\ning; the provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care\nprovision sustained in Hibbs; and the provision eases the\nburden on single parents. But what the family-care provi-\nsions have to support them, the self-care provision lacks,\nnamely evidence of a pattern of state constitutional viola-\ntions accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to\naddress or prevent those violations.\n                               1\n   Standing alone, the self-care provision is not a valid\nabrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. When the\nFMLA was enacted, “ninety-five percent of full-time state-\nand local-government employees were covered by paid sick\nleave plans and ninety-six percent of such employees\nlikewise enjoyed short-term disability protection.” Brief\nfor States of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (hereinaf-\nter Texas Brief) (citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S.\nDept. of Labor, Employee Benefits in State and Local\nGovernments 17–26 (1994) (hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The\nevidence did not suggest States had facially discriminatory\nself-care leave policies or that they administered neutral\nself-care leave policies in a discriminatory way. And there\nis scant evidence in the legislative history of a purported\nstereotype harbored by employers that women take self-\ncare leave more often than men. Congress considered\nevidence that “men and women are out on medical leave\napproximately equally.” H. R. Rep. No. 101–28, pt. 1, p.\n15 (1989) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record\nshows employers formulated self-care leave policies based\non a contrary view.\n   Without widespread evidence of sex discrimination or\nsex stereotyping in the administration of sick leave, it is\napparent that the congressional purpose in enacting the\nself-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nThe legislative history of the self-care provision reveals a\nconcern for the economic burdens on the employee and the\nemployee’s family resulting from illness-related job loss\nand a concern for discrimination on the basis of illness, not\nsex. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, pp. 11–12 (1993); H. R.\nRep., at 23. In the findings pertinent to the self-care\nprovision, the statute makes no reference to any distinc-\ntion on the basis of sex. See 29 U. S. C. §2601(a)(4)\n(“[T]here is inadequate job security for employees who\nhave serious health conditions that prevent them from\nworking for temporary periods”). By contrast, with regard\nto family care Congress invoked concerns related to gen-\nder. See §2601(a)(5) (“[D]ue to the nature of the roles of\nmen and women in our society, the primary responsibility\nfor family caretaking often falls on women, and such\nresponsibility affects the working lives of women more\nthan it affects the working lives of men”).\n   It is true the self-care provision offers some women a\nbenefit by allowing them to take leave for pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not\ncongruent and proportional to any identified constitutional\nviolations. At the time of the FMLA’s enactment, “ninety-\nfive percent” of state employees had paid sick-leave plans\nat work, and “ninety-six percent” had short-term disability\nprotection. Texas Brief 13–14 (citing BLS Rept. 17–26).\nState employees presumably could take leave for pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses under these policies, and Congress did\nnot document any pattern of States excluding pregnancy-\nrelated illnesses from sick-leave or disability-leave poli-\ncies. “Congress . . . said nothing about the existence or\nadequacy of state remedies.” Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S.,\nat 644. It follows that abrogating the States’ immunity\nfrom suits for damages for failure to give self-care leave is\nnot a congruent and proportional remedy if the existing\nstate leave policies would have sufficed.\n8          COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                               2\n   As an alternative justification for the self-care provision,\nit has been suggested that the provision is a necessary\nadjunct to the family-care provisions. Petitioner argues\nthat employers may assume women are more likely to\ntake family-care leave than men and that the FMLA\ntherefore offers up to 12 weeks of leave for family care and\nself care combined. According to petitioner, when the self-\ncare provision is coupled with the family-care provisions,\nthe self-care provision could reduce the difference in the\nexpected number of weeks of FMLA leave that different\nemployees take for different reasons.\n   The fact that self-care leave could have this effect does\nnot mean that it would. If, for example, women are ex-\npected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and\nmen to take 10, and women and men are each expected to\ntake 5 days of self-care leave per year, the difference in the\nexpected number of days of leave and cost to the employer\nremains the same regardless of the availability of self-care\nleave. Congress made no findings, and received no specific\ntestimony, to suggest the availability of self-care leave\nequalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and\nwomen will take. Even if women take family-care leave\nmore often than men, men do not take self-care leave more\noften than women; and there is little evidence that em-\nployers assume they do. See H. R. Rep., at 15. Petitioner\nsuggests that some women will be expected to take all 12\nweeks of leave under the FMLA for family-care purposes,\nand therefore that any amount of self-care leave taken by\nmen will diminish the difference in the amount of FMLA\nleave taken by men and women. But there is little evi-\ndence to support petitioner’s assumption about the magni-\ntude of women’s expected FMLA leave for family-care\npurposes. And men are only expected to take five days of\nsick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision\ndiminishes the difference in expected leave time by a\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmaximum of five days. And that is only to the extent\nwomen use all their available FMLA leave for family-care\nreasons. Petitioner’s overly complicated argument about\nhow the self-care provision works in tandem with the\nfamily-care provisions is unconvincing and in the end does\nnot comply with the clear requirements of City of Boerne.\n   In addition petitioner’s first defense of the self-care\nprovision contradicts his second defense of the provision.\nIn the first defense, the Court is told employers assume\nwomen take more self-care leave than men. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 10–12. In the second defense, the Court is told\nthe self-care provision provides an incentive to hire women\nthat will counteract the incentives created by the family-\ncare provisions because employers assume women take\nmore family-care leave than men. But if the first defense\nis correct, the second defense is wrong. In other words, if\nemployers assume women take self-care leave more often\nthan men (the first defense), a self-care provision will not\nprovide an incentive to hire women. To the contrary, the\nself-care provision would provide an incentive to discrimi-\nnate against women.\n   There is “little support in the record for the concerns\nthat supposedly animated” the self-care provision. Florida\nPrepaid, supra, at 639. Only supposition and conjecture\nsupport the contention that the self-care provision is\nnecessary to make the family-care provisions effective.\nThe evidence documented in support of the self-care provi-\nsion is, to a large degree, unrelated to sex discrimination,\nor to the administration of the family-care provisions. See\nsupra, at 7. Congress made no findings and did not cite\nspecific or detailed evidence to show how the self-care\nprovision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how\nit reduces an employer’s incentives to discriminate against\nwomen. And “Congress . . . said nothing about the exist-\nence or adequacy of state” sick-leave policies. Florida\nPrepaid, supra, at 644; see Garrett, 531 U. S., at 373.\n10         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nUnder this Court’s precedents, more is required to sub-\nject unconsenting States to suits for damages, particularly\nwhere, as here, it is for violations of a provision (the self-\ncare provision) that is a supposedly preventive step in aid\nof already preventive provisions (the family-care provi-\nsions). See Florida Prepaid, 527 U. S., at 642 (“[T]he\nlegislative record still provides little support for the prop-\nosition that Congress sought to remedy a Fourteenth\nAmendment violation in enacting the Patent Remedy\nAct”); Kimel, 528 U. S., at 88 (“One means by which we\nhave made such a determination . . . is by examining the\nlegislative record containing the reasons for Congress’\naction”).\n   The “few fleeting references” to how self-care leave is\ninseparable from family-care leave fall short of what is\nrequired for a valid abrogation of States’ immunity from\nsuits for damages. Florida Prepaid, supra, at 644. These\n“isolated sentences clipped from floor debates” and testi-\nmony, Kimel, supra, at 89, are stated as conclusions,\nunsupported by evidence or findings about how the self-\ncare provision interrelates to the family-care provisions to\ncounteract employers’ incentives to discriminate against\nwomen. Congress must rely on more than abstract gener-\nalities to subject the States to suits for damages. Other-\nwise, Congress could choose to combat the purported\neffects of the family-care provisions by allowing employees\nto sue States that do not permit employees to take vaca-\ntion time under the FMLA. There is nothing in particular\nabout self-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal\nreason, that connects it to gender discrimination. And\nwhen the issue, as here, is whether subparagraph (D) can\nabrogate a State’s immunity from damages, there is no\nsufficient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated nexus, be-\ntween self-care leave and gender discrimination by state\nemployers. Documented discrimination against women in\nthe general workplace is a persistent, unfortunate reality,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nand, we must assume, a still prevalent wrong. An explicit\npurpose of the Congress in adopting the FMLA was to\nimprove workplace conditions for women. See 29 U. S. C.\n§§2601(b)(4), (5). But States may not be subject to suits\nfor damages based on violations of a comprehensive stat-\nute unless Congress has identified a specific pattern of\nconstitutional violations by state employers. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U. S., at 532.\n                               3\n  The petitioner’s last defense of the self-care provision is\nthat the provision helps single parents retain their jobs\nwhen they become ill. This, however, does not explain\nhow the provision remedies or prevents constitutional\nviolations. The fact that most single parents happen to be\nwomen, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 7, demonstrates, at\nmost, that the self-care provision was directed at remedy-\ning employers’ neutral leave restrictions which have a\ndisparate effect on women. “Although disparate impact\nmay be relevant evidence of . . . discrimination . . . such\nevidence alone is insufficient [to prove a constitutional\nviolation] even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects\nstate action to strict scrutiny.” Garrett, supra, at 372–373;\nsee Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U. S. 53, 82–83 (2001)\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.\n229, 239 (1976). To the extent, then, that the self-care\nprovision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate\nimpact on women, it is not directed at a pattern of consti-\ntutional violations. Because, moreover, it is “unlikely that\nmany of the [neutral leave policies] . . . affected by” the\nself-care provision are unconstitutional, “the scope of the\n[self-care provision is] out of proportion to its supposed\nremedial or preventive objectives.” Kimel, supra, at 82;\nsee City of Boerne, supra, at 519.\n  Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh Amend-\nment immunity from suits for damages. See, e.g., Sossa-\n12         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmon v. Texas, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“A\nState . . . may choose to waive its immunity in federal\ncourt at its pleasure”). Discrimination against women is\ncontrary to the public policy of the State of Maryland, see,\ne.g., Maryland’s Fair Employment Practices Act, Md. State\nGovt. Code Ann. §20–606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has\nconceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral\nArg. 35. If the State agrees with petitioner that damages\nliability for violations of the self-care provision is neces-\nsary to combat discrimination against women, the State\nmay waive its immunity or create a parallel state law\ncause of action.\n                       *    *     *\n  As a consequence of our constitutional design, money\ndamages are the exception when sovereigns are defend-\nants. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U. S. 1, 29 (1981). Subjecting States to\nsuits for damages pursuant to §5 requires more than a\ntheory for why abrogating the States’ immunity aids in, or\nadvances, a stated congressional purpose. To abrogate the\nStates’ immunity from suits for damages under §5, Con-\ngress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations\nand tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the\ndocumented violations. It failed to do so when it allowed\nemployees to sue States for violations of the FMLA’s self-\ncare provision.

This grading of Congress’s homework\nis a task we are ill suited to perform and ill advised to\nundertake.\n   I adhere to my view that we should instead adopt an\napproach that is properly tied to the text of §5, which\ngrants Congress the power “to enforce, by appropriate\nlegislation,” the other provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. (Emphasis added.) As I have explained in\ngreater detail elsewhere, see Lane, supra, at 558–560,\noutside of the context of racial discrimination (which is\ndifferent for stare decisis reasons), I would limit Con-\ngress’s §5 power to the regulation of conduct that itself\n2         COLEMAN v.

See, e.g.,\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 522 (2004). The FMLA’s\nself-care provision, Maryland asserts, trains not on the\nright to be free from gender discrimination, but on an\n“equal protection right to be free from irrational state\nemployment discrimination based on a medical condition.”\nBrief for Respondents 14. The plurality agrees, concluding\nthat the self-care provision reveals “a concern for discrim-\nination on the basis of illness, not sex.” Ante, at 7. In so\ndeclaring, the plurality undervalues the language, pur-\n——————\n    1Iremain of the view that Congress can abrogate state sovereign\nimmunity pursuant to its Article I Commerce Clause power. See\nSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 100 (1996) (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Beyond debate, 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1)(D) is valid Com-\nmerce Clause legislation. See infra, at 21.

As well, the\nplurality underplays the main theme of our decision in\nHibbs: “The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free\nfrom gender-based discrimination in the workplace.” 538\nU. S., at 728.\n  I begin with the text of the statute, which repeatedly\nemphasizes gender discrimination. One of the FMLA’s\nstated purposes is to “entitle employees to take reasonable\nleave,” 29 U. S. C. §2601(b)(2), “in a manner that, con-\nsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, minimizes the potential for employment dis-\ncrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally\nthat leave is available for eligible medical reasons (includ-\ning maternity-related disability) and for compelling family\nreasons, on a gender-neutral basis.” §2601(b)(4). Another\nidentified aim is “to promote the goal of equal employment\nopportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal\nProtection Clause].” §2601(b)(5). “[E]mployment stand-\nards that apply to one gender only,” Congress expressly\nfound, “have serious potential for encouraging employers\nto discriminate against employees and applicants for\nemployment who are of that gender.” §2601(a)(6).\n  The FMLA’s purpose and legislative history reinforce\nthe conclusion that the FMLA, in its entirety, is directed\nat sex discrimination. Indeed, the FMLA was originally\nenvisioned as a way to guarantee—without singling out\nwomen or pregnancy—that pregnant women would not\nlose their jobs when they gave birth. The self-care provi-\nsion achieves that aim.\n  A brief history is in order. In his 1982 congressional\ncampaign, then-candidate Howard Berman pledged to\nintroduce legislation similar to the California law chal-\nlenged in California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra,\n479 U.

California’s law, enacted\nin 1978, made it unlawful for an employer to refuse to\ngrant female employees disabled by pregnancy or child-\nbirth up to four months’ unpaid, job-protected leave. See\n1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, §1, now codified at Cal. Govt.\nCode Ann. §12945(a)(1) (West Supp. 2012).\n  The California law sharply divided women’s rights ad-\nvocates. “Equal-treatment” feminists asserted it violated\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act’s (PDA) commitment\nto treating pregnancy the same as other disabilities.2 It\ndid so by requiring leave only for disability caused by\npregnancy and childbirth, thereby treating pregnancy as\nsui generis. See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union\net al. as Amici Curiae in California Fed., O. T. 1985,\nNo. 85–494, pp. 5–10. “Equal-opportunity” feminists dis-\nagreed, urging that the California law was consistent with\nthe PDA because it remedied the discriminatory burden\nthat inadequate leave policies placed on a woman’s right\nto procreate.

Commission on Family and Medical Leave,\nA Workable Balance: Report to Congress on Family and Medical Leave\nPolicies 210 (Apr. 30, 1996).\n  4 For example, in addition to mandating pregnancy leave, the Califor-\n\nnia statute allowed employers to discriminate against pregnant work-\ners. Employers could refuse to select a pregnant woman for a training\nprogram if she would not finish the program at least three months\nbefore giving birth. See 1978 Cal. Stats. ch. 1321, §1. The law limited\npregnancy disability leave to six weeks, §1, and provided that women\nwere to receive paid disability benefits for only three weeks after\nchildbirth, §2, even if a particular woman remained disabled beyond\nthe three-week period, and even if a man received paid disability\nbenefits throughout his disability.

See Joint Hearing on H. R. 925 before the Sub-\ncommittee on Civil Service and the Subcommittee on\nCompensation and Employee Benefits of the House Com-\nmittee on Post Office and Civil Service, 100th Cong., 1st\nSess., 36 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 House Hearing) (state-\nment of Prof. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Georgetown Uni-\nversity Law Center) (“[If California Fed.] becomes the\nmodel, employers will provide something for women af-\nfected by pregnancy that they are not required to provide\nfor other employees.

In the\n[California Fed.] case, I would have preferred the inter-\npretation urged by the [equal-treatment feminists].”).\n  Congress agreed. See infra, at 14–15. Adhering to\nequal-treatment feminists’ aim, the self-care provision, 29\nU. S. C. §2612(a)(1)(D), prescribes comprehensive leave for\nwomen disabled during pregnancy or while recuperating\nfrom childbirth—without singling out pregnancy or child-\nbirth. See S. Rep. No. 101–77, p. 32 (1989) (A “significant\nbenefit of the temporary medical leave provided by this\nlegislation is the form of protection it offers women work-\ners who bear children. Because the bill treats all employ-\nees who are temporarily unable to work due to serious\nhealth conditions in the same fashion, it does not create\nthe risk of discrimination against pregnant women posed\nby legislation which provides job protection only for\npregnancy-related disability. Legislation solely protecting\n——————\nemployers from refusing to promote a woman because of pregnancy, it\ndid not forbid refusing to hire a woman on that basis. See §1.

In\nview of this history, it is impossible to conclude that “noth-\ning in particular about self-care leave . . . connects it to\ngender discrimination.” Ante, at 10.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   Boerne next asks “whether Congress had evidence of\na pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the\nStates.” Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 729. See also Boerne, 521\nU. S., at 530–532. Beyond question, Congress had evi-\ndence of a well-documented pattern of workplace discrimi-\nnation against pregnant women. Section 2612(a)(1)(D)\ncan therefore “be understood as responsive to, or designed\nto prevent, unconstitutional behavior.” Id., at 532.\n   Although the PDA proscribed blatant discrimination on\nthe basis of pregnancy, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000e(k), 2000e–\n2, supra, at 4, n. 2, the Act is fairly described as a nec-\nessary, but not a sufficient measure. FMLA hearings\nconducted between 1986 and 1993 included illustrative testi-\nmony from women fired after becoming pregnant or giving\nbirth. For example, Beverly Wilkenson was granted seven\nweeks of leave upon the birth of her child. On the eve of\nher return to work, a superior informed her that her job\nhad been eliminated. He stated: “Beverly, the best thing\nfor you to do is stay home and take care of your baby and\ncollect your unemployment.” Hearing on H. R. 770 before\nthe Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations of the\nHouse Committee on Education and Labor, 101st Cong.,\n1st Sess., 12 (1989) (hereinafter 1989 House Hearing)\n(statement of Beverly Wilkenson). See also S. Rep. No.\n102–68, p. 27 (1991) (hereinafter 1991 Senate Report)\n(describing Ms. Wilkenson’s testimony). Similarly, Linda\nPillsbury was notified that she no longer had a job three\n8            COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nweeks after her daughter was born.5 Three secretaries at\nthe same workplace were also forced out of their jobs when\nthey returned to work within weeks of giving birth. See\nHearings on S. 249 before the Subcommittee on Children,\nFamily, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on\nLabor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt.\n2, pp. 16, 23 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 Senate Hearings)\n(statement of Linda Pillsbury).\n   These women’s experiences, Congress learned, were\nhardly isolated incidents. A spokeswoman for the Mayor’s\nCommission on Women’s Affairs in Chicago testified: “The\nlack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the\nworkplace has created an environment where discrimina-\ntion is rampant. Very often we are contacted by women\nworkers who are at risk of losing their jobs or have lost\nthem because they are pregnant, [or have] given birth.”\nId., at 170 (statement of Peggy Montes).

As summarized by the\nAmerican Bar Association:\n    “Historically, denial or curtailment of women’s em-\n    ployment opportunities has been traceable directly to\n    the pervasive presumption that women are mothers\n    first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology\n    about women’s roles has in turn justified discrimina-\n    tion against women when they are mothers or mothers-\n    to-be.” 1989 House Hearing 248 (American Bar\n    Association Background Report). See also Hibbs, 538\n    U. S., at 736 (quoting same language).\n  “Many pregnant women have been fired when their em-\nployer refused to provide an adequate leave of absence,”\nCongress had ample cause to conclude. See H. R. Rep. No.\n99–699, pt. 2, p. 22 (1986). Pregnancy, Congress also\nfound, has a marked impact on women’s earnings. One\nyear after childbirth, mothers’ earnings fell to $1.40 per\nhour less than those of women who had not given birth.\nSee 1991 Senate Report 28. See also 1989 House Hearing\n356–357 (Report of 9to5, National Association of Working\nWomen (citing same study)).\n  Congress heard evidence tying this pattern of discrimi-\nnation to the States. A 50-state survey by the Yale Bush\nCenter Infant Care Leave Project concluded that “[t]he\nproportion and construction of leave policies available to\npublic sector employees differs little from those offered\nprivate sector employees.” Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 730, n. 3\n(quoting 1986 House Hearing 33 (statement of Meryl\nFrank)). Roughly 28% of women employed in the public\nsector did not receive eight weeks of job-protected medical\nleave to recover from childbirth. See 1987 Senate Hear-\nings, pt. 1, pp. 31, 35, 39 (statement of James T. Bond,\n10         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nNational Counsel of Jewish Women). A South Carolina\nstate legislator testified: “[I]n South Carolina, as well as in\nother states . . . no unemployment compensation is paid\nto a woman who is necessarily absent from her place of\nemployment because of pregnancy or maternity.” See id.,\npt. 2, p. 361 (statement of Rep. Irene Rudnick). According\nto an employee of the State of Georgia, if state employees\ntook leave, it was held against them when they were\nconsidered for promotions: “It is common practice for my\nDepartment to compare the balance sheets of workers who\nhave and have not used [leave] benefits in determining\nwho should and should not be promoted.” Hearing on\nH. R. 2 before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management\nRelations of the House Committee on Education and\nLabor, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 36 (1991) (statement of\nRobert E. Dawkins). See also id., at 33 (One type of leave\nfor Georgia state employees “boils down to whether your\nsupervisor wants you to come back or not.”). In short,\nCongress had every reason to believe that a pattern of\nworkplace discrimination against pregnant women existed\nin public-sector employment, just as it did in the private\nsector.\n                              B\n  “[A] state’s refusal to provide pregnancy leave to its\nemployees,” Maryland responds, is “not unconstitutional.”\nBrief for Respondents 23 (citing Geduldig v. Aiello, 417\nU. S. 484, 495 (1974)). Aiello’s footnote 20 proclaimed that\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimi-\nnation on the basis of sex. In my view, this case is a fit\noccasion to revisit that conclusion. Footnote 20 reads:\n         “The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is\n     . . . a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71\n     (1971), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677\n     (1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as\n     such.

While it is true that only women can become\n    pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative\n    classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based\n    classification . . . .\n       “The lack of identity between the excluded disability\n    and gender as such under this insurance program\n    becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The\n    program divides potential recipients into two groups—\n    pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the\n    first group is exclusively female, the second includes\n    members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial bene-\n    fits of the program thus accrue to members of both\n    sexes.” 417 U. S., at 496, n. 20.\n    First, “[a]s an abstract statement,” it is “simply false”\nthat “a classification based on pregnancy is gender-\nneutral.” Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506\nU. S. 263, 327 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Rather,\ndiscriminating on the basis of pregnancy “[b]y definition\n. . . discriminates on account of sex; for it is the capacity\nto become pregnant which primarily differentiates the fe-\nmale from the male.” General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429\nU. S. 125, 161–162 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting). See\nalso Issacharoff & Rosenblum, Women and the Workplace:\nAccommodating the Demands of Pregnancy, 94 Colum.\nL. Rev. 2154, 2180 (1994) (“[I]t is precisely because\npregnancy is a condition unique to women that the exclu-\nsion of pregnancy from disability coverage is a sex-based\nclassification . . . .”).\n    This reality is well illustrated by the facts of Aiello. The\nCalifornia disability-insurance program at issue granted\ndisability benefits for virtually any conceivable work\ndisability, including those arising from cosmetic surgery,\n12        COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nskiing accidents, and alcoholism. See Brief for EEOC as\nAmicus Curiae in Aiello, O. T. 1973, No. 73–640, p. 7. It\nalso compensated men for disabilities caused by ailments\nand procedures that affected men alone: for example,\nvasectomies, circumcision, and prostatectomies. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae\nin id., at 17–18. Only pregnancy was excluded from the\ndefinition of disability. See Cal. Un. Ins. Code Ann. §2626\n(West 1972); Aiello, 417 U. S., at 489. As Justice Brennan\ninsightfully concluded in dissent, “a limitation is imposed\nupon the disabilities for which women workers may re-\ncover, while men receive full compensation for all disabili-\nties suffered . . . . Such dissimilar treatment of men and\nwomen, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably\nlinked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimina-\ntion.” Id., at 501.\n   Second, pregnancy provided a central justification for\nthe historic discrimination against women this Court\nchronicled in Hibbs. See 538 U. S., at 729 (“[A] proper\ndischarge of [a woman’s] maternal functions—having in\nview not merely her own health, but the well-being of the\nrace—justif[ies] legislation to protect her from the greed\nas well as the passion of man.” (quoting Muller v. Oregon,\n208 U. S. 412, 422 (1908); 2d and 3d alterations in Hibbs)).\nSee also Siegel, Employment Equality Under the Preg-\nnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, 94 Yale L. J. 929, 942\n(1985) (Pregnancy “is a biological difference central to the\ndefinition of gender roles, one traditionally believed to\nrender women unfit for employment.”). Relatedly, dis-\ncrimination against pregnant employees was often “based\nnot on the pregnancy itself but on predictions concerning\nthe future behavior of the pregnant woman when her child\nwas born or on views about what her behavior should be.”\nWilliams 355. See also S. Rep. No. 95–331, p. 3 (1977)\n(“[T]he assumption that women will become pregnant and\nleave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyp-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning resulting in unfavorable disparate treatment of women\nin the workplace.”).\n  In sum, childbearing is not only a biological function\nunique to women. It is also inextricably intertwined with\nemployers’ “stereotypical views about women’s commit-\nment to work and their value as employees.” Hibbs, 538\nU. S., at 736. Because pregnancy discrimination is in-\nevitably sex discrimination, and because discrimination\nagainst women is tightly interwoven with society’s beliefs\nabout pregnancy and motherhood, I would hold that Aiello\nwas egregiously wrong to declare that discrimination on\nthe basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of\nsex.\n                              C\n   Boerne’s third step requires “ ‘a congruence and propor-\ntionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied\nand the means adopted to that end.’ ” Ante, at 5 (quoting\n521 U. S., at 520). Section 2612(a)(1)(D), I would conclude,\nis an appropriate response to pervasive discriminatory\ntreatment of pregnant women. In separating self-care\nleave for the physical disability following childbirth,\n§2612(a)(1)(D), which affects only women, from family-\ncare leave for parenting a newborn baby, §2612(a)(1)(A),\nfor which men and women are equally suited, Congress\ncould attack gender discrimination and challenge stereo-\ntypes of women as lone childrearers. Cf. Hibbs, 538 U. S.,\nat 731 (States’ extended “maternity” leaves, far exceeding\na woman’s physical disability following childbirth, were\nattributable “to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that\ncaring for family members is women’s work.”).\n   It would make scant sense to provide job-protected leave\nfor a woman to care for a newborn, but not for her recov-\nery from delivery, a miscarriage, or the birth of a stillborn\nbaby. And allowing States to provide no pregnancy-\ndisability leave at all, given that only women can become\n14         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\npregnant, would obviously “exclude far more women than\nmen from the workplace.” Id., at 738.\n   The plurality’s statement that Congress lacked “wide-\nspread evidence of sex discrimination . . . in the admin-\nistration of sick leave,” ante, at 6, misses the point. So too\ndoes the plurality’s observation that state employees likely\n“could take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses”—\npresumably severe morning sickness, toxemia, etc.—under\npaid sick-leave plans, ante, at 7. Congress heard evidence\nthat existing sick-leave plans were inadequate to ensure\nthat women were not fired when they needed to take time\nout to recover their strength and stamina after childbirth.\nThe self-care provision responds to that evidence by re-\nquiring employers to allow leave for “ongoing pregnancy,\nmiscarriages, . . . the need for prenatal care, childbirth,\nand recovery from childbirth.” S. Rep. No. 103–3, p. 29\n(1993).\n   That §2612(a)(1)(D) entitles all employees to up to 12\nweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for a serious health\ncondition, rather than singling out pregnancy or child-\nbirth, does not mean that the provision lacks the requisite\ncongruence and proportionality to the identified constitu-\ntional violations. As earlier noted, supra, at 6–7, Congress\nmade plain its rationale for the prescription’s broader\ncompass: Congress sought to ward off the unconstitutional\ndiscrimination it believed would attend a pregnancy-only\nleave requirement. Under the caption “Equal protection\nand non-discrimination,” Congress explained:\n       “The FMLA addresses the basic leave needs of all\n     employees. . . . This is an important principle reflected\n     in the bill.\n       “A law providing special protection to women . . . ,\n     in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of caus-\n     ing discriminatory treatment. Employers might be\n     less inclined to hire women . . . . For example, legisla-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n     tion addressing the needs of pregnant women only\n     might encourage discriminatory hiring practices\n     against women of child bearing age. Legislation ad-\n     dressing the needs of all workers equally does not\n     have this effect. By addressing the serious leave\n     needs of all employees, the FMLA avoids providing\n     employers the temptation to discriminate [against\n     women].\n     .             .         .          .           .\n     “The legislation is [thus] based not only on the Com-\n     merce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal pro-\n     tection . . . embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n     H. R. Rep. No. 102–135, pt. 1, pp. 27–28 (1991) (here-\n     inafter 1991 House Report).\n  Congress’ concern was solidly grounded in workplace\nrealities. After this Court upheld California’s pregnancy-\nonly leave policy in California Fed., Don Butler, President\nof the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, one of\nthe plaintiffs in that case, told National Public Radio\nreporter Nina Totenberg that, as a result of the decision,\n“many employers will be prone to discriminate against\nwomen in hiring and hire males instead.” 1987 House\nHearing 36. Totenberg replied, “But that is illegal, too”—\nto which Butler responded, “Well, that is illegal, but try to\nprove it.” Ibid.\n  Finally, as in Hibbs, it is important to note the moderate\ncast of the FMLA, in particular, the considerable limi-\ntations Congress placed on §§2612(a)(1)(A)–(D)’s leave\nrequirement. See 538 U. S., at 738–739. FMLA leave is\nunpaid. It is limited to employees who have worked\nat least one year for the employer and at least 1,250\nhours during the past year. §§2611(2)(A), 2612(c)(1).\nHigh-ranking employees, including state elected officials\nand their staffs, are not within the Act’s compass.\n§§203(e)(2)(C), 2611(3). Employees must provide advance\nnotice of foreseeable leaves. §2612(e). Employers may\n16             COLEMAN v.

See also id., at 729–\n731, and n. 5 (Congress adduced evidence “of a pattern of\nconstitutional violations on the part of the States” in\ngranting parental and family-care leave).\n   Requiring States to provide gender-neutral parental and\nfamily-care leave alone, Congress was warned, would\npromote precisely the type of workplace discrimination\nCongress sought to reduce. The “pervasive sex-role stereo-\ntype that caring for family members is women’s work,” id.,\nat 731, Congress heard, led employers to regard required\nparental and family-care leave as a woman’s benefit.\nCarol Ball, speaking on behalf of the U. S. Chamber of\nCommerce, testified that she did not think “there are\ngoing to be many men that take up . . . parental leave.”\nSee Hearing on S. 345 before the Subcommittee on Chil-\ndren, Family, Drugs, and Alcoholism of the Senate Com-\nmittee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 1st\nSess., 39 (1989) (statement of Carol Ball). She frankly\nadmitted that she herself would choose to hire a man over\nan equally qualified woman if parental leave was required\nby law. Id., at 30.\n   Others similarly testified that mandating gender-\nneutral parental leave would lead to discrimination\nagainst women. A representative of the National Federal\nof Independent Business stated: “Requiring employers to\nprovide parental leave benefits creates clear pressures for\nsubtle discrimination based on . . . sex. When choosing\nbetween two equally qualified candidates, an employer\nmay be more likely to hire the candidate least likely to\ntake the leave. It is the wage levels and jobs of women of\nchildbearing years which are most at risk in such a situa-\ntion.” Hearing on H. R. 1 before the Subcommittee on\nLabor-Management Relations of the House Committee\non Education and Labor, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 95 (1993).\n18           COLEMAN v.

Women of child-bearing age\nwill be viewed as risks, potentially disrupting operations\nthrough an untimely leave.”).\n   Conversely—unlike perceptions surrounding who takes\nparental and family-care leave—Congress was told that\nmen and women take medical leave approximately equal-\nly. According to one study, male workers missed an aver-\nage of 4.9 days of work per year due to illness or injury;\nfemale workers missed 5.1 days. See 1991 House Report,\npt. 1, p. 28. “[T]he incidence of serious medical conditions\nthat would be covered by medical leave under the bill,”\nCongress determined, “is virtually the same for men and\nwomen. Employers will find that women and men will\ntake medical leave with equal frequency.” Ibid. “[P]a-\nrental and medical leave,” Congress was thus alerted,\n“are inseparable”:\n       “In the words of an old song, ‘You can’t have one with-\n       out the other.’\n       .            .           .           .          .\n          “Adoption of parental leave protections without\n       medical leave would . . . encourage discrimination\n       against women of child-bearing age, who constitute\n       approximately 73 percent of all the women in the la-\n       bor force.\n          “Employers would tend to hire men, who are much\n       less likely to claim [the parental leave] benefit. . . .\n          “Parental leave without medical leave would be the\n       modern version of protective labor laws.” 1986 House\n       Hearing 33–34 (Statement of Irene Natividad, Na-\n       tional Women’s Political Caucus).\n     Congress therefore had good reason to conclude that the\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Providing for self-\ncare would thus reduce employers’ corresponding incentive\nto discriminate against women in hiring and promotion.\nIn other words, “[t]he availability of self-care leave to men\nserves to blunt the force of stereotypes of women as prima-\nry caregivers by increasing the odds that men and women\nwill invoke the FMLA’s leave provisions in near-equal\nnumbers.” See Brief for National Partnership for Women\n& Families et al. as Amici Curiae 26. As Judge Lipez\nexplained:\n      “If Congress had drawn a line at leave for caring for\n    other family members, there is greater likelihood that\n    the FMLA would have been perceived as further rea-\n    son to avoid granting employment opportunities to\n    women. Heretofore, women have provided most of the\n    child and elder care, and legislation that focused on\n    these duties could have had a deleterious impact be-\n    cause of the prevalent notion that women take more\n    advantage of such leave policies. The inclusion of per-\n    sonal medical leave in the scheme, unrelated to any\n    need to care for another person, undermines the as-\n    sumption that women are the only ones taking leave\n    because men, presumably, are as likely as women to\n    get sick.” Laro v. New Hampshire, 259 F. 3d 1, 21\n    (CA1 2001) (dissenting opinion).\n  Senator Barbara Boxer advanced a similar point. Re-\nsponding to assertions that the FMLA would lead employ-\ners to discriminate against women, Senator Boxer stated:\n“[T]o say that women will not be hired by business is a\nspecious argument . . . . Men also get sick. They get\ncancer. They get heart disease. They have ailments. And\nthis bill applies to men and women.” 139 Cong. Rec. 1697\n(1993). See also 1987 Senate Hearings, pt. 2, p. 536 (“I\n20         COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\njust think it’s wrong that there will be a perception that\nthis is something that only women will take and they are,\ntherefore, more expensive. Both men and women have\nmedical conditions . . . .” (statement of Prof. Susan Deller\nRoss, Georgetown University Law Center)).\n   The plurality therefore gets it wrong in concluding that\n“[o]nly supposition and conjecture support the contention\nthat the self-care provision is necessary to make the family-\ncare provisions effective.” Ante, at 9. Self-care leave, I\nwould hold, is a key part of Congress’ endeavor to make it\nfeasible for women to work and have families. See 1991\nSenate Report 25–26 (“This legislation is essential if the\nnation is to address the dramatic changes that have oc-\ncurred in the American workforce in recent years. . . . The\nonce-typical American family, where the father worked for\npay and the mother stayed at home with the children, is\nvanishing. . . . Today, more than one-half of all mothers\nwith infants under one year of age work outside the home.\nThat figure has doubled since 1970 . . . . By the year 2000,\nabout three out of every four American children will have\nmothers in the workforce.”). By reducing an employer’s\nperceived incentive to avoid hiring women, §2612(a)(1)(D)\nlessens the risk that the FMLA as a whole would give rise\nto the very sex discrimination it was enacted to thwart.\nThe plurality offers no legitimate ground to dilute the\nforce of the Act.\n                             IV\n   Two additional points. First, this Court reached a dif-\nferent conclusion than the one I reach here in Board of\nTrustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356 (2001),\nand Kimel, 528 U. S. 62. In those cases, as we observed in\nHibbs, we reviewed statutes targeting disability and age\ndiscrimination, respectively. Neither disability nor age is\na suspect classification under this Court’s Equal Protec-\ntion Clause jurisprudence; States may discriminate on the\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            21\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nbasis of disability or age as long as the classification is\nrationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Gar-\nrett, 531 U. S., at 366–367; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 83–84.\nTherefore, for the statutes to be responsive to or designed\nto prevent unconstitutional discrimination, Congress\nneeded to rely on a pattern of irrational state discrimina-\ntion on the basis of disability or age. See Garrett, 531\nU. S., at 368; Kimel, 528 U. S., at 89. Here, however,\nCongress homed in on gender discrimination, which trig-\ngers heightened review. See United States v. Virginia, 518\nU. S. 515, 531 (1996) (“Parties who seek to defend gender-\nbased government action must demonstrate an exceeding-\nly persuasive justification for that action.” (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)). “[I]t was [therefore] easier for\nCongress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.”\nHibbs, 538 U. S., at 736.\n   Finally, the plurality’s opinion does not authorize state\nemployers to violate the FMLA, although it does block\ninjured employees from suing for monetary relief. The\nself-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legis-\nlation, Maryland concedes, and consequently binds the\nstates, as well as the private sector. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25;\nBrief for Respondents 32–33. An employee wrongly denied\nself-care leave, Maryland also acknowledges, may, pursu-\nant to Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), seek injunc-\ntive relief against the responsible state official. See Brief\nfor Respondents 33. Moreover, the U. S. Department of\nLabor may bring an action against a state for violating the\nself-care provision and may recover monetary relief on an\nemployee’s behalf. 29 U. S. C. §§2617(b)(2)–(3), (d).\n                           V\n  The plurality pays scant attention to the overarching\naim of the FMLA: to make it feasible for women to work\nwhile sustaining family life. Over the course of eight\nyears, Congress considered the problem of workplace\n22        COLEMAN v. COURT OF APPEALS OF MD.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndiscrimination against women, and devised the FMLA to\nreduce sex-based inequalities in leave programs. Essen-\ntial to its design, Congress assiduously avoided a legisla-\ntive package that, overall, was or would be seen as geared\nto women only. Congress thereby reduced employers’\nincentives to prefer men over women, advanced women’s\neconomic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more\negalitarian relationship at home and at work. The self-\ncare provision is a key part of that endeavor, and, in my\nview, a valid exercise of congressional power under §5 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the\njudgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/625722/", "sha1": "e5e7f2fe9e7f52377f93ed89a19b84e418cec17d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-20T07:46:07"}
