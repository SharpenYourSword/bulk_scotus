FRYE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MISSOURI, WEST-\n                    ERN DISTRICT\n\n    No. 10\u2013444.      Argued October 31, 2011\u2014Decided March 21, 2012\nRespondent Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license. Be-\n  cause he had been convicted of the same offense three times before,\n  he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maxi-\n  mum 4-year prison term. The prosecutor sent Frye\u2019s counsel a letter,\n  offering two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the\n  charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90-\n  day sentence. Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they ex-\n  pired. Less than a week before Frye\u2019s preliminary hearing, he was\n  again arrested for driving with a revoked license. He subsequently\n  pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced\n  to three years in prison. Seeking postconviction relief in state court,\n  he alleged his counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers\n  denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testified that\n  he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of\n  the offer. The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate\n  court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for\n  showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washing-\n  ton, 466 U. S. 668. Specifically, the court found that defense counsel\n  had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and\n  concluded that Frye had shown that counsel\u2019s deficient performance\n  caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of\n  a misdemeanor.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel ex-\n tends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.\n That right applies to \u201call \u2018critical\u2019 stages of the criminal proceedings.\u201d\n Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786. Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S.\n 52, established that Strickland\u2019s two-part test governs ineffective-\n2                            MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    assistance claims in the plea bargain context. There, the defendant\n    had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about\n    his plea, but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial\n    had he received the proper advice. 474 U. S., at 60. In Padilla v.\n    Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, where a plea offer was set aside because\n    counsel had misinformed the defendant of its immigration conse-\n    quences, this Court made clear that \u201cthe negotiation of a plea bargain\n    is a critical\u201d stage for ineffective-assistance purposes, id., at ___, and\n    rejected the argument made by the State in this case that a knowing\n    and voluntary plea supersedes defense counsel\u2019s errors. The State\n    attempts to distinguish Hill and Padilla from the instant case. It\n    notes that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective\n    assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a\n    formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present,\n    while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has\n    lapsed or been rejected; and it insists that there is no right to receive\n    a plea offer in any event. Thus, the State contends, it is unfair to\n    subject it to the consequences of defense counsel\u2019s inadequacies when\n    the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or for a later guilty plea al-\n    beit on less favorable terms, are preserved. While these contentions\n    are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, they do not\n    suffice to overcome the simple reality that 97 percent of federal con-\n    victions and 94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty\n    pleas. Plea bargains have become so central to today\u2019s criminal jus-\n    tice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the\n    plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel\n    that the Sixth Amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal\n    process. Pp. 3\u20138.\n       2. As a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate\n    formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions\n    that may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to this rule\n    need not be addressed here, for the offer was a formal one with a\n    fixed expiration date. Standards for prompt communication and con-\n    sultation recommended by the American Bar Association and adopt-\n    ed by numerous state and federal courts, though not determinative,\n    serve as important guides. The prosecution and trial courts may\n    adopt measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated\n    claims. First, a formal offer\u2019s terms and processing can be document-\n    ed. Second, States may require that all offers be in writing. Third,\n    formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea\n    proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully\n    advised before the later proceedings commence. Here, as the result of\n    counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland,\n    the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nbreach of duty. Pp. 8\u201311.\n   3. To show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected\nbecause of counsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendants must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted\nthe more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assis-\ntance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without\nthe prosecution\u2019s canceling it or the trial court\u2019s refusing to accept it,\nif they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.\nThis application of Strickland to uncommunicated, lapsed pleas does\nnot alter Hill\u2019s standard, which requires a defendant complaining\nthat ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of go-\ning to trial to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nerrors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\ngoing to trial.\u201d 474 U. S., at 59. Hill correctly applies in the context\nin which it arose, but it does not provide the sole means for demon-\nstrating prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s deficient performance dur-\ning plea negotiations. Because Frye argues that with effective assis-\ntance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to\nentering an open plea, Strickland\u2019s inquiry into whether \u201cthe result\nof the proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 U. S., at 694, re-\nquires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to\ntrial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer.\nHe must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to can-\ncel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse\nto accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution\nnor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accept-\ned or implemented. This further showing is particularly important\nbecause a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford\nv. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561, nor a federal right that the judge accept\nit, Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262. Missouri, among other\nStates, appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a\nplea agreement; and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, some\nstate rules, including Missouri\u2019s, and this Court\u2019s precedents give tri-\nal courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements. Pp. 11\u201313.\n   4. Applying these standards here, the Missouri court correctly con-\ncluded that counsel\u2019s failure to inform Frye of the written plea offer\nbefore it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard, but\nit failed to require Frye to show that the plea offer would have been\nadhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court. These\nmatters should be addressed by the Missouri appellate court in the\nfirst instance. Given that Frye\u2019s new offense for driving without a li-\ncense occurred a week before his preliminary hearing, there is reason\nto doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement\nor that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were re-\n4                          MISSOURI v.

GALIN E. FRYE\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n              MISSOURI, WESTERN DISTRICT\n\n                                [March 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the\nterms of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the ac-\ncused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal\nprosecutions. The right to counsel is the right to effective\nassistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU. S. 668, 686 (1984). This case arises in the context of\nclaimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a\nprosecution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered\nterms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea en-\ntered later. The initial question is whether the consti-\ntutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and\nconsideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. If\nthere is a right to effective assistance with respect to those\noffers, a further question is what a defendant must dem-\nonstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance. Other questions relating\nto ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers, includ-\ning the question of proper remedies, are considered in a\nsecond case decided today. See Lafler v. Cooper, post, at\n3\u201316.\n2                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n  In August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged\nwith driving with a revoked license. Frye had been con-\nvicted for that offense on three other occasions, so the\nState of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which\ncarries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.\nSee Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7302.321.2, 558.011.1(4) (2011).\n  On November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye\u2019s\ncounsel offering a choice of two plea bargains. App. 50.\nThe prosecutor first offered to recommend a 3-year sen-\ntence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, with-\nout a recommendation regarding probation but with a\nrecommendation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as so-\ncalled \u201cshock\u201d time. The second offer was to reduce the\ncharge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it,\nto recommend a 90-day sentence. The misdemeanor\ncharge of driving with a revoked license carries a maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of one year. 311 S. W. 3d 350,\n360 (Mo. App. 2010). The letter stated both offers would\nexpire on December 28. Frye\u2019s attorney did not advise\nFrye that the offers had been made. The offers expired.\nId., at 356.\n  Frye\u2019s preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4,\n2008. On December 30, 2007, less than a week before\nthe hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a re-\nvoked license. App. 47\u201348, 311 S. W. 3d, at 352\u2013353. At\nthe January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a prelimi-\nnary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007\narrest. He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraign-\nment but then changed his plea to guilty. There was no\nunderlying plea agreement. App. 5, 13, 16. The state trial\ncourt accepted Frye\u2019s guilty plea. Id., at 21. The prosecu-\ntor recommended a 3-year sentence, made no recommen-\ndation regarding probation, and requested 10 days shock\ntime in jail. Id., at 22. The trial judge sentenced Frye to\nthree years in prison. Id., at 21, 23.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Frye filed for postconviction relief in state court. Id., at\n8, 25\u201329. He alleged his counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of\nthe prosecution\u2019s plea offer denied him the effective assis-\ntance of counsel. At an evidentiary hearing, Frye testified\nhe would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor\nhad he known about the offer. Id., at 34.\n   A state court denied the postconviction motion, id., at\n52\u201357, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed, 311\nS. W. 3d 350. It determined that Frye met both of the\nrequirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation\nunder Strickland. First, the court determined Frye\u2019s\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient because the \u201crecord is\nvoid of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to com-\nmunicate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.\u201d 311\nS. W. 3d, at 355, 356 (emphasis deleted). The court next\nconcluded Frye had shown his counsel\u2019s deficient perfor-\nmance caused him prejudice because \u201cFrye pled guilty to\na felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a\nmaximum sentence of four years instead of one year.\u201d Id.,\nat 360.\n   To implement a remedy for the violation, the court\ndeemed Frye\u2019s guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to\nallow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty\nto any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to\ncharge. This Court granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  It is well settled that the right to the effective assistance\nof counsel applies to certain steps before trial. The \u201cSixth\nAmendment guarantees a defendant the right to have\ncounsel present at all \u2018critical\u2019 stages of the criminal pro-\nceedings.\u201d Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786 (2009)\n(quoting United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 227\u2013228\n(1967)). Critical stages include arraignments, postindict-\n4                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the\nentry of a guilty plea. See Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S.\n52 (1961) (arraignment); Massiah v. United States, 377\nU. S. 201 (1964) (postindictment interrogation); Wade,\nsupra (postindictment lineup); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407\nU. S. 25 (1972) (guilty plea).\n  With respect to the right to effective counsel in plea\nnegotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two\ncases from this Court considering the role of counsel in\nadvising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty\nplea: Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985); and Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. ___(2010).\n  Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the\ntwo-part test set forth in Strickland. See Hill, supra, at\n57. As noted above, in Frye\u2019s case, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, deter-\nmined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and\nsecond that there was resulting prejudice.\n  In Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the\nStrickland test. There, a defendant who had entered a\nguilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of\nthe amount of time he would have to serve before he be-\ncame eligible for parole. But the defendant had not al-\nleged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had\nbeen given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and\nproceed to trial. Thus, the Court found that no prejudice\nfrom the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.\nHill, supra, at 60.\n  In Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of\ncounsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer\nthat leads to a guilty plea. Padilla held that a guilty plea,\nbased on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel\nmisinformed the defendant of the immigration conse-\nquences of the conviction. The Court made clear that \u201cthe\nnegotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litiga-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effec-\ntive assistance of counsel.\u201d 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). It also rejected the argument made by petitioner in\nthis case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes\nerrors by defense counsel. Cf. Brief for Respondent in\nPadilla v. Kentucky, O. T. 2009, No. 08\u2013651, p. 27 (arguing\nSixth Amendment\u2019s assurance of effective assistance \u201cdoes\nnot extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution\u201d because\n\u201cknowledge of the consequences that are collateral to the\nguilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing\nand intelligent plea\u201d).\n   In the case now before the Court the State, as petitioner,\npoints out that the legal question presented is different\nfrom that in Hill and Padilla. In those cases the claim\nwas that the prisoner\u2019s plea of guilty was invalid because\ncounsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the\nplea. In the instant case, by contrast, the guilty plea that\nwas accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in\ncourt, were all based on accurate advice and information\nfrom counsel. The challenge is not to the advice pertain-\ning to the plea that was accepted but rather to the course\nof legal representation that preceded it with respect to\nother potential pleas and plea offers.\n   To give further support to its contention that the instant\ncase is in a category different from what the Court consid-\nered in Hill and Padilla, the State urges that there is no\nright to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event. See\nWeatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). It claims\nFrye therefore was not deprived of any legal benefit to\nwhich he was entitled. Under this view, any wrongful or\nmistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea\noffers is beside the point.\n   The State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla\nconcerned whether there was ineffective assistance lead-\ning to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a\nformal court appearance with the defendant and all coun-\n6                     MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsel present. Before a guilty plea is entered the defendant\u2019s\nunderstanding of the plea and its consequences can be\nestablished on the record. This affords the State substan-\ntial protection against later claims that the plea was the\nresult of inadequate advice. At the plea entry proceedings\nthe trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to\nestablish on the record that the defendant understands\nthe process that led to any offer, the advantages and\ndisadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing conse-\nquences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is\nentered based upon the plea. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 11; Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02 (2004). Hill and Padilla\nboth illustrate that, nevertheless, there may be instances\nwhen claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the\nconviction is entered. Still, the State, and the trial court\nitself, have had a substantial opportunity to guard against\nthis contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceed-\ning that the defendant has been given proper advice or, if\nthe advice received appears to have been inadequate, to\nremedy that deficiency before the plea is accepted and the\nconviction entered.\n   When a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected, however,\nno formal court proceedings are involved. This under-\nscores that the plea-bargaining process is often in flux,\nwith no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial\nsupervision of the discussions between prosecution and\ndefense. Indeed, discussions between client and defense\ncounsel are privileged. So the prosecution has little or no\nnotice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity\nto intervene in any event. And, as noted, the State insists\nthere is no right to receive a plea offer. For all these\nreasons, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the\nconsequences of defense counsel\u2019s inadequacies, especially\nwhen the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or, as here,\nfor a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are\npreserved.\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State\u2019s contentions are neither illogical nor without\nsome persuasive force, yet they do not suffice to overcome\na simple reality. Ninety-seven percent of federal con-\nvictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are\nthe result of guilty pleas. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Sta-\ntistics Online, Table 5.22.2009, http://www.albany.edu/\nsourcebook/pdf/t5222009.pdf (all Internet materials as\nvisited Mar. 1, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile); Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S.\nRosenmerkel, M.

The reality is that plea bargains have become so\ncentral to the administration of the criminal justice sys-\ntem that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea\nbargain process, responsibilities that must be met to\nrender the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth\nAmendment requires in the criminal process at critical\nstages. Because ours \u201cis for the most part a system of\npleas, not a system of trials,\u201d Lafler, post, at 11, it is insuf-\nficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a\nbackstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.\n\u201cTo a large extent . . . horse trading [between prosecutor\nand defense counsel] determines who goes to jail and for\nhow long. That is what plea bargaining is. It is not some\nadjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal\njustice system.\u201d Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Con-\ntract, 101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992). See also Barkow,\nSeparation of Powers and the Criminal Law, 58 Stan. L.\nRev. 989, 1034 (2006) (\u201c[Defendants] who do take their\ncase to trial and lose receive longer sentences than even\nCongress or the prosecutor might think appropriate, be-\ncause the longer sentences exist on the books largely for\n8                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbargaining purposes. This often results in individuals\nwho accept a plea bargain receiving shorter sentences\nthan other individuals who are less morally culpable but\ntake a chance and go to trial\u201d (footnote omitted)). In to-\nday\u2019s criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of\na plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is\nalmost always the critical point for a defendant.\n  To note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criti-\ncize it. The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial\nresources and for defendants to admit their crimes and\nreceive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a\nplea agreement can benefit both parties. In order that\nthese benefits can be realized, however, criminal defend-\nants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.\n\u201cAnything less . . . might deny a defendant \u2018effective repre-\nsentation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and\nadvice would help him.\u2019 \u201d Massiah, 377 U. S., at 204 (quot-\ning Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959) (Doug-\nlas, J., concurring)).\n                              B\n   The inquiry then becomes how to define the duty and\nresponsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain\nprocess. This is a difficult question. \u201cThe art of negotia-\ntion is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and\nit presents questions farther removed from immediate\njudicial supervision.\u201d Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139). Bargaining is, by its nature,\ndefined to a substantial degree by personal style. The\nalternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so indi-\nvidual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to\ntry to elaborate or define detailed standards for the proper\ndischarge of defense counsel\u2019s participation in the process.\nCf. ibid.\n   This case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion\nto define the duties of defense counsel in those respects,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever. Here the question is whether defense counsel\nhas the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to\naccept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a\nlesser sentence, a conviction on lesser charges, or both.\n  This Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense\ncounsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from\nthe prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions\nthat may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to\nthat rule need not be explored here, for the offer was a\nformal one with a fixed expiration date. When defense\ncounsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the\ndefendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel\ndid not render the effective assistance the Constitution\nrequires.\n  Though the standard for counsel\u2019s performance is not\ndetermined solely by reference to codified standards of\nprofessional practice, these standards can be important\nguides. The American Bar Association recommends de-\nfense counsel \u201cpromptly communicate and explain to the\ndefendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attor-\nney,\u201d ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty\n14\u20133.2(a) (3d ed. 1999), and this standard has been adopt-\ned by numerous state and federal courts over the last 30\nyears. See, e.g., Davie v. State, 381 S. C. 601, 608\u2013609,\n675 S. E. 2d 416, 420 (2009); Cottle v. State, 733 So. 2d\n963, 965\u2013966 (Fla. 1999); Becton v. Hun, 205 W. Va. 139,\n144, 516 S. E. 2d 762, 767 (1999); Harris v. State, 875\nS. W. 2d 662, 665 (Tenn. 1994); Lloyd v. State, 258 Ga.\n645, 648, 373 S. E. 2d 1, 3 (1988); United States v. Rodri-\nguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d 747, 752 (CA1 1991) (per curi-\nam); Pham v. United States, 317 F. 3d 178, 182 (CA2\n2003); United States ex rel. Caruso v.

The standard for prompt communi-\ncation and consultation is also set out in state bar profes-\nsional standards for attorneys. See, e.g., Fla. Rule Regu-\nlating Bar 4\u20131.4 (2008); Ill. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011);\nKan. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2010); Ky. Sup. Ct. Rule\n3.130, Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4 (2011); Mass. Rule Prof.\nConduct 1.4 (2011\u20132012); Mich. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.4\n(2011).\n   The prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some\nmeasures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabri-\ncated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer has\nbeen accepted or after a trial leading to conviction with\nresulting harsh consequences. First, the fact of a formal\noffer means that its terms and its processing can be docu-\nmented so that what took place in the negotiation process\nbecomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the\nconduct of earlier pretrial negotiations. Second, States\nmay elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing,\nagain to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabri-\ncated charges. See N. J. Ct. Rule 3:9\u20131(b) (2012) (\u201cAny\nplea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing\nand forwarded to the defendant\u2019s attorney\u201d). Third, formal\noffers can be made part of the record at any subsequent\nplea proceeding or before a trial on the merits, all to en-\nsure that a defendant has been fully advised before those\nfurther proceedings commence. At least one State often\nfollows a similar procedure before trial. See Brief for\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al.\nas Amici Curiae 20 (discussing hearings in Arizona con-\nducted pursuant to State v.

As a result of that deficient per-\nformance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland, the ques-\ntion then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from\nthe breach of duty.\n                              C\n  To show prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel\nwhere a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendants must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability they would have accepted\nthe earlier plea offer had they been afforded effective\nassistance of counsel. Defendants must also demonstrate\na reasonable probability the plea would have been entered\nwithout the prosecution canceling it or the trial court\nrefusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise\nthat discretion under state law. To establish prejudice in\nthis instance, it is necessary to show a reasonable proba-\nbility that the end result of the criminal process would\nhave been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser\ncharge or a sentence of less prison time. Cf. Glover v.\nUnited States, 531 U. S. 198, 203 (2001) (\u201c[A]ny amount of\n[additional] jail time has Sixth Amendment significance\u201d).\n  This application of Strickland to the instances of an\nuncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the\nstandard laid out in Hill. In cases where a defendant\ncomplains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a\nplea offer as opposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant\nwill have to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for\n12                   MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and\nwould have insisted on going to trial.\u201d Hill, 474 U. S., at\n59. Hill was correctly decided and applies in the context\nin which it arose. Hill does not, however, provide the sole\nmeans for demonstrating prejudice arising from the defi-\ncient performance of counsel during plea negotiations.\nUnlike the defendant in Hill, Frye argues that with effec-\ntive assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea\noffer (limiting his sentence to one year in prison) as op-\nposed to entering an open plea (exposing him to a maxi-\nmum sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment). In a case,\nsuch as this, where a defendant pleads guilty to less fa-\nvorable terms and claims that ineffective assistance of\ncounsel caused him to miss out on a more favorable earlier\nplea offer, Strickland\u2019s inquiry into whether \u201cthe result of\nthe proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 U. S., at\n694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would\nhave proceeded to trial absent ineffective assistance but\nwhether he would have accepted the offer to plead pursu-\nant to the terms earlier proposed.\n   In order to complete a showing of Strickland prejudice,\ndefendants who have shown a reasonable probability they\nwould have accepted the earlier plea offer must also show\nthat, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel it or\nif the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it,\nthere is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution\nnor the trial court would have prevented the offer from\nbeing accepted or implemented. This further showing is of\nparticular importance because a defendant has no right to\nbe offered a plea, see Weatherford, 429 U. S., at 561, nor a\nfederal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New\nYork, 404 U. S. 257, 262 (1971). In at least some States,\nincluding Missouri, it appears the prosecution has some\ndiscretion to cancel a plea agreement to which the defend-\nant has agreed, see, e.g., 311 S. W. 3d, at 359 (case below);\nAriz. Rule Crim. Proc. 17.4(b) (Supp. 2011). The Federal\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this\nCourt\u2019s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept\nor reject plea agreements, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n11(c)(3); see Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4); Boykin v. Ala-\nbama, 395 U. S. 238, 243\u2013244 (1969). It can be assumed\nthat in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are\nfamiliar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains\nand sentences. So in most instances it should not be\ndifficult to make an objective assessment as to whether or\nnot a particular fact or intervening circumstance would\nsuffice, in the normal course, to cause prosecutorial with-\ndrawal or judicial nonapproval of a plea bargain. The\ndetermination that there is or is not a reasonable probabil-\nity that the outcome of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent absent counsel\u2019s errors can be conducted within\nthat framework.\n                             III\n   These standards must be applied to the instant case. As\nregards the deficient performance prong of Strickland, the\nCourt of Appeals found the \u201crecord is void of any evidence\nof any effort by trial counsel to communicate the [formal]\nOffer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evi-\ndence that Frye\u2019s conduct interfered with trial counsel\u2019s\nability to do so.\u201d 311 S. W. 3d, at 356. On this record, it\nis evident that Frye\u2019s attorney did not make a meaningful\nattempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer\nbefore the offer expired. See supra, at 2. The Missouri\nCourt of Appeals was correct that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representa-\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d\nStrickland, supra, at 688.\n   The Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the\nprecise standard for prejudice in this context. As noted, a\ndefendant in Frye\u2019s position must show not only a reason-\nable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed\nplea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution\n14                   MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould have adhered to the agreement and that it would\nhave been accepted by the trial court. Frye can show he\nwould have accepted the offer, but there is strong reason\nto doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have\npermitted the plea bargain to become final.\n  There appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would\nhave accepted the prosecutor\u2019s original offer of a plea\nbargain if the offer had been communicated to him, be-\ncause he pleaded guilty to a more serious charge, with no\npromise of a sentencing recommendation from the prose-\ncutor. It may be that in some cases defendants must show\nmore than just a guilty plea to a charge or sentence harsh-\ner than the original offer. For example, revelations be-\ntween plea offers about the strength of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase may make a late decision to plead guilty insufficient\nto demonstrate, without further evidence, that the defend-\nant would have pleaded guilty to an earlier, more gener-\nous plea offer if his counsel had reported it to him. Here,\nhowever, that is not the case. The Court of Appeals did\nnot err in finding Frye\u2019s acceptance of the less favorable\nplea offer indicated that he would have accepted the earli-\ner (and more favorable) offer had he been apprised of it;\nand there is no need to address here the showings that\nmight be required in other cases.\n  The Court of Appeals failed, however, to require Frye to\nshow that the first plea offer, if accepted by Frye, would\nhave been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by\nthe trial court. Whether the prosecution and trial court\nare required to do so is a matter of state law, and it is not\nthe place of this Court to settle those matters. The Court\nhas established the minimum requirements of the Sixth\nAmendment as interpreted in Strickland, and States have\nthe discretion to add procedural protections under state\nlaw if they choose. A State may choose to preclude the\nprosecution from withdrawing a plea offer once it has been\naccepted or perhaps to preclude a trial court from rejecting\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na plea bargain. In Missouri, it appears \u201ca plea offer once\naccepted by the defendant can be withdrawn without re-\ncourse\u201d by the prosecution. 311 S. W. 3d, at 359. The ex-\ntent of the trial court\u2019s discretion in Missouri to reject a\nplea agreement appears to be in some doubt. Compare id.,\nat 360, with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4).\n   We remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consid-\ner these state-law questions, because they bear on the\nfederal question of Strickland prejudice. If, as the Mis-\nsouri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled\nthe plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable\nprobability the prosecutor would have adhered to the\nagreement, there is no Strickland prejudice. Likewise, if\nthe trial court could have refused to accept the plea\nagreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probabil-\nity the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no\nStrickland prejudice. In this case, given Frye\u2019s new of-\nfense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007,\nthere is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have\nadhered to the agreement or that the trial court would\nhave accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless\nthey were required by state law to do so.\n   It is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals\nto address this question in the first instance. The judg-\nment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Cooper, post, p. ___.\nThe principal difference between the cases is that the\nfairness of the defendant\u2019s conviction in Lafler was estab-\nlished by a full trial and jury verdict, whereas Frye\u2019s\nconviction here was established by his own admission of\nguilt, received by the court after the usual colloquy that\nassured it was voluntary and truthful. In Lafler all that\ncould be said (and as I discuss there it was quite enough)\nis that the fairness of the conviction was clear, though a\nunanimous jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt can\nsometimes be wrong. Here it can be said not only that the\nprocess was fair, but that the defendant acknowledged the\ncorrectness of his conviction. Thus, as far as the reasons\nfor my dissent are concerned, this is an a fortiori case. I\nwill not repeat here the constitutional points that I discuss\nat length in Lafler, but I will briefly apply those points to\nthe facts here and comment upon a few statements in the\nCourt\u2019s analysis.\n                       *     *     *\n  Galin Frye\u2019s attorney failed to inform him about a plea\noffer, and Frye ultimately pleaded guilty without the\nbenefit of a deal.

So little entitlement that, had\nhe known of and accepted the bargain, the prosecution\nwould have been able to withdraw it right up to the point\nthat his guilty plea pursuant to the bargain was accepted.\nSee 311 S. W. 3d 350, 359, and n. 4 (Mo. App. 2010).\n   The Court acknowledges, moreover, that Frye\u2019s convic-\ntion was untainted by attorney error: \u201c[T]he guilty plea\nthat was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it\nin court, were all based on accurate advice and infor-\nmation from counsel.\u201d Ante, at 5. Given the \u201cultimate\nfocus\u201d of our ineffective-assistance cases on \u201cthe funda-\nmental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being\nchallenged,\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 696\n(1984), that should be the end of the matter. Instead,\nhere, as in Lafler, the Court mechanically applies an\noutcome-based test for prejudice, and mistakes the possi-\nbility of a different result for constitutional injustice. As\nI explain in Lafler, post, p. ___ (dissenting opinion), that\napproach is contrary to our precedents on the right to\neffective counsel, and for good reason.\n   The Court announces its holding that \u201cas a general rule,\ndefense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers\nfrom the prosecution\u201d as though that resolves a disputed\npoint; in reality, however, neither the State nor the Solici-\ntor General argued that counsel\u2019s performance here was\nadequate. Ante, at 9. The only issue was whether the in-\nadequacy deprived Frye of his constitutional right to a\nfair trial. In other cases, however, it will not be so clear\nthat counsel\u2019s plea-bargaining skills, which must now\nmeet a constitutional minimum, are adequate. \u201c[H]ow to\ndefine the duty and responsibilities of defense counsel in\nthe plea bargain process,\u201d the Court acknowledges, \u201cis a\ndifficult question,\u201d since \u201c[b]argaining is, by its nature,\ndefined to a substantial degree by personal style.\u201d Ante, at\n8. Indeed. What if an attorney\u2019s \u201cpersonal style\u201d is to\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

It seems\ninconceivable that a lawyer could compromise his client\u2019s\nconstitutional rights so that he can secure better deals for\nother clients in the future; does a hard-bargaining \u201cper-\nsonal style\u201d now violate the Sixth Amendment? The Court\nignores such difficulties, however, since \u201c[t]his case pre-\nsents neither the necessity nor the occasion to define the\nduties of defense counsel in those respects.\u201d Ante, at 8.\nPerhaps not. But it does present the necessity of confront-\ning the serious difficulties that will be created by constitu-\ntionalization of the plea-bargaining process. It will not do\nsimply to announce that they will be solved in the sweet\nby-and-by.\n   While the inadequacy of counsel\u2019s performance in this\ncase is clear enough, whether it was prejudicial (in the\nsense that the Court\u2019s new version of Strickland requires)\nis not. The Court\u2019s description of how that question is\nto be answered on remand is alone enough to show how\nunwise it is to constitutionalize the plea-bargaining pro-\ncess. Prejudice is to be determined, the Court tells us, by\na process of retrospective crystal-ball gazing posing as\nlegal analysis. First of all, of course, we must estimate\nwhether the defendant would have accepted the earlier\nplea bargain. Here that seems an easy question, but as\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 14, it will not always be.\nNext, since Missouri, like other States, permits accepted\nplea offers to be withdrawn by the prosecution (a reality\nwhich alone should suffice, one would think, to demon-\nstrate that Frye had no entitlement to the plea bargain),\nwe must estimate whether the prosecution would have\nwithdrawn the plea offer. And finally, we must estimate\nwhether the trial court would have approved the plea\nagreement. These last two estimations may seem easy in\nthe present case, since Frye committed a new infraction\n4                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbefore the hearing at which the agreement would have\nbeen presented; but they assuredly will not be easy in the\nmine run of cases.\n  The Court says \u201c[i]t can be assumed that in most juris-\ndictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the\nboundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. Assuredly it can, just as it can be assumed\nthat the sun rises in the west; but I know of no basis for\nthe assumption. Virtually no cases deal with the stand-\nards for a prosecutor\u2019s withdrawal from a plea agreement\nbeyond stating the general rule that a prosecutor may\nwithdraw any time prior to, but not after, the entry of a\nguilty plea or other action constituting detrimental reli-\nance on the defendant\u2019s part. See, e.g., United States v.\nKuchinski, 469 F. 3d 853, 857\u2013858 (CA9 2006). And cases\naddressing trial courts\u2019 authority to accept or reject plea\nagreements almost universally observe that a trial court\nenjoys broad discretion in this regard. See, e.g., Missouri\nv. Banks, 135 S. W. 3d 497, 500 (Mo. App. 2004) (trial\ncourt abuses its discretion in rejecting a plea only if the\ndecision \u201cis so arbitrary and unreasonable that it shocks\nthe sense of justice and indicates a lack of careful con-\nsideration\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Of course\nafter today\u2019s opinions there will be cases galore, so the\nCourt\u2019s assumption would better be cast as an optimistic\nprediction of the certainty that will emerge, many years\nhence, from our newly created constitutional field of plea-\nbargaining law. Whatever the \u201cboundaries\u201d ultimately\ndevised (if that were possible), a vast amount of discretion\nwill still remain, and it is extraordinary to make a defend-\nant\u2019s constitutional rights depend upon a series of ret-\nrospective mind-readings as to how that discretion, in\nprosecutors and trial judges, would have been exercised.\n  The plea-bargaining process is a subject worthy of regu-\nlation, since it is the means by which most criminal con-\nvictions are obtained.

FRYE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MISSOURI, WEST-\n                    ERN DISTRICT\n\n    No. 10\u2013444.      Argued October 31, 2011\u2014Decided March 21, 2012\nRespondent Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license. Be-\n  cause he had been convicted of the same offense three times before,\n  he was charged, under Missouri law, with a felony carrying a maxi-\n  mum 4-year prison term. The prosecutor sent Frye\u2019s counsel a letter,\n  offering two possible plea bargains, including an offer to reduce the\n  charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend, with a guilty plea, a 90-\n  day sentence. Counsel did not convey the offers to Frye, and they ex-\n  pired. Less than a week before Frye\u2019s preliminary hearing, he was\n  again arrested for driving with a revoked license. He subsequently\n  pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced\n  to three years in prison. Seeking postconviction relief in state court,\n  he alleged his counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers\n  denied him the effective assistance of counsel, and he testified that\n  he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of\n  the offer. The court denied his motion, but the Missouri appellate\n  court reversed, holding that Frye met both of the requirements for\n  showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland v. Washing-\n  ton, 466 U. S. 668. Specifically, the court found that defense counsel\n  had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to Frye and\n  concluded that Frye had shown that counsel\u2019s deficient performance\n  caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of\n  a misdemeanor.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel ex-\n tends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.\n That right applies to \u201call \u2018critical\u2019 stages of the criminal proceedings.\u201d\n Montejo v.

There, the defendant\n    had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about\n    his plea, but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial\n    had he received the proper advice. 474 U. S., at 60. In Padilla v.\n    Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, where a plea offer was set aside because\n    counsel had misinformed the defendant of its immigration conse-\n    quences, this Court made clear that \u201cthe negotiation of a plea bargain\n    is a critical\u201d stage for ineffective-assistance purposes, id., at ___, and\n    rejected the argument made by the State in this case that a knowing\n    and voluntary plea supersedes defense counsel\u2019s errors. The State\n    attempts to distinguish Hill and Padilla from the instant case. It\n    notes that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective\n    assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a\n    formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present,\n    while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has\n    lapsed or been rejected; and it insists that there is no right to receive\n    a plea offer in any event. Thus, the State contends, it is unfair to\n    subject it to the consequences of defense counsel\u2019s inadequacies when\n    the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or for a later guilty plea al-\n    beit on less favorable terms, are preserved. While these contentions\n    are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, they do not\n    suffice to overcome the simple reality that 97 percent of federal con-\n    victions and 94 percent of state convictions are the result of guilty\n    pleas. Plea bargains have become so central to today\u2019s criminal jus-\n    tice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the\n    plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel\n    that the Sixth Amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal\n    process. Pp. 3\u20138.\n       2. As a general rule, defense counsel has the duty to communicate\n    formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions\n    that may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to this rule\n    need not be addressed here, for the offer was a formal one with a\n    fixed expiration date. Standards for prompt communication and con-\n    sultation recommended by the American Bar Association and adopt-\n    ed by numerous state and federal courts, though not determinative,\n    serve as important guides. The prosecution and trial courts may\n    adopt measures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabricated\n    claims. First, a formal offer\u2019s terms and processing can be document-\n    ed. Second, States may require that all offers be in writing. Third,\n    formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea\n    proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully\n    advised before the later proceedings commence. Here, as the result of\n    counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland,\n    the question then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from the\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nbreach of duty. Pp. 8\u201311.\n   3. To show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected\nbecause of counsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendants must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted\nthe more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assis-\ntance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without\nthe prosecution\u2019s canceling it or the trial court\u2019s refusing to accept it,\nif they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.\nThis application of Strickland to uncommunicated, lapsed pleas does\nnot alter Hill\u2019s standard, which requires a defendant complaining\nthat ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of go-\ning to trial to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\nerrors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on\ngoing to trial.\u201d 474 U. S., at 59. Hill correctly applies in the context\nin which it arose, but it does not provide the sole means for demon-\nstrating prejudice arising from counsel\u2019s deficient performance dur-\ning plea negotiations. Because Frye argues that with effective assis-\ntance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to\nentering an open plea, Strickland\u2019s inquiry into whether \u201cthe result\nof the proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 U. S., at 694, re-\nquires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to\ntrial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer.\nHe must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to can-\ncel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse\nto accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution\nnor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accept-\ned or implemented. This further showing is particularly important\nbecause a defendant has no right to be offered a plea, see Weatherford\nv. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561, nor a federal right that the judge accept\nit, Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262. Missouri, among other\nStates, appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a\nplea agreement; and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, some\nstate rules, including Missouri\u2019s, and this Court\u2019s precedents give tri-\nal courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements. Pp. 11\u201313.\n   4. Applying these standards here, the Missouri court correctly con-\ncluded that counsel\u2019s failure to inform Frye of the written plea offer\nbefore it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard, but\nit failed to require Frye to show that the plea offer would have been\nadhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court. These\nmatters should be addressed by the Missouri appellate court in the\nfirst instance. Given that Frye\u2019s new offense for driving without a li-\ncense occurred a week before his preliminary hearing, there is reason\nto doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement\nor that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were re-\n4                          MISSOURI v.

GALIN E. FRYE\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n              MISSOURI, WESTERN DISTRICT\n\n                                [March 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the\nterms of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the ac-\ncused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal\nprosecutions. The right to counsel is the right to effective\nassistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU. S. 668, 686 (1984). This case arises in the context of\nclaimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a\nprosecution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered\nterms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea en-\ntered later. The initial question is whether the consti-\ntutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and\nconsideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. If\nthere is a right to effective assistance with respect to those\noffers, a further question is what a defendant must dem-\nonstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance. Other questions relating\nto ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers, includ-\ning the question of proper remedies, are considered in a\nsecond case decided today. See Lafler v. Cooper, post, at\n3\u201316.\n2                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n  In August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged\nwith driving with a revoked license. Frye had been con-\nvicted for that offense on three other occasions, so the\nState of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which\ncarries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.\nSee Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7302.321.2, 558.011.1(4) (2011).\n  On November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye\u2019s\ncounsel offering a choice of two plea bargains. App. 50.\nThe prosecutor first offered to recommend a 3-year sen-\ntence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, with-\nout a recommendation regarding probation but with a\nrecommendation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as so-\ncalled \u201cshock\u201d time. The second offer was to reduce the\ncharge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it,\nto recommend a 90-day sentence. The misdemeanor\ncharge of driving with a revoked license carries a maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of one year. 311 S. W. 3d 350,\n360 (Mo. App. 2010). The letter stated both offers would\nexpire on December 28. Frye\u2019s attorney did not advise\nFrye that the offers had been made. The offers expired.\nId., at 356.\n  Frye\u2019s preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4,\n2008. On December 30, 2007, less than a week before\nthe hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a re-\nvoked license. App. 47\u201348, 311 S. W. 3d, at 352\u2013353. At\nthe January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a prelimi-\nnary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007\narrest. He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraign-\nment but then changed his plea to guilty. There was no\nunderlying plea agreement. App. 5, 13, 16. The state trial\ncourt accepted Frye\u2019s guilty plea. Id., at 21. The prosecu-\ntor recommended a 3-year sentence, made no recommen-\ndation regarding probation, and requested 10 days shock\ntime in jail. Id., at 22. The trial judge sentenced Frye to\nthree years in prison. Id., at 21, 23.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Frye filed for postconviction relief in state court. Id., at\n8, 25\u201329. He alleged his counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of\nthe prosecution\u2019s plea offer denied him the effective assis-\ntance of counsel. At an evidentiary hearing, Frye testified\nhe would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor\nhad he known about the offer. Id., at 34.\n   A state court denied the postconviction motion, id., at\n52\u201357, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed, 311\nS. W. 3d 350. It determined that Frye met both of the\nrequirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation\nunder Strickland. First, the court determined Frye\u2019s\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient because the \u201crecord is\nvoid of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to com-\nmunicate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.\u201d 311\nS. W. 3d, at 355, 356 (emphasis deleted). The court next\nconcluded Frye had shown his counsel\u2019s deficient perfor-\nmance caused him prejudice because \u201cFrye pled guilty to\na felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a\nmaximum sentence of four years instead of one year.\u201d Id.,\nat 360.\n   To implement a remedy for the violation, the court\ndeemed Frye\u2019s guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to\nallow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty\nto any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to\ncharge. This Court granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  It is well settled that the right to the effective assistance\nof counsel applies to certain steps before trial. The \u201cSixth\nAmendment guarantees a defendant the right to have\ncounsel present at all \u2018critical\u2019 stages of the criminal pro-\nceedings.\u201d Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 786 (2009)\n(quoting United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 227\u2013228\n(1967)). Critical stages include arraignments, postindict-\n4                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the\nentry of a guilty plea. See Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S.\n52 (1961) (arraignment); Massiah v. United States, 377\nU. S. 201 (1964) (postindictment interrogation); Wade,\nsupra (postindictment lineup); Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407\nU. S. 25 (1972) (guilty plea).\n  With respect to the right to effective counsel in plea\nnegotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two\ncases from this Court considering the role of counsel in\nadvising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty\nplea: Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985); and Padilla v.\nKentucky, 559 U. S. ___(2010).\n  Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the\ntwo-part test set forth in Strickland. See Hill, supra, at\n57. As noted above, in Frye\u2019s case, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, deter-\nmined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and\nsecond that there was resulting prejudice.\n  In Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the\nStrickland test. There, a defendant who had entered a\nguilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of\nthe amount of time he would have to serve before he be-\ncame eligible for parole. But the defendant had not al-\nleged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had\nbeen given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and\nproceed to trial. Thus, the Court found that no prejudice\nfrom the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.\nHill, supra, at 60.\n  In Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of\ncounsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer\nthat leads to a guilty plea. Padilla held that a guilty plea,\nbased on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel\nmisinformed the defendant of the immigration conse-\nquences of the conviction. The Court made clear that \u201cthe\nnegotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litiga-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at\n16). It also rejected the argument made by petitioner in\nthis case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes\nerrors by defense counsel. Cf. Brief for Respondent in\nPadilla v. Kentucky, O. T. 2009, No. 08\u2013651, p. 27 (arguing\nSixth Amendment\u2019s assurance of effective assistance \u201cdoes\nnot extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution\u201d because\n\u201cknowledge of the consequences that are collateral to the\nguilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing\nand intelligent plea\u201d).\n   In the case now before the Court the State, as petitioner,\npoints out that the legal question presented is different\nfrom that in Hill and Padilla. In those cases the claim\nwas that the prisoner\u2019s plea of guilty was invalid because\ncounsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the\nplea. In the instant case, by contrast, the guilty plea that\nwas accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in\ncourt, were all based on accurate advice and information\nfrom counsel. The challenge is not to the advice pertain-\ning to the plea that was accepted but rather to the course\nof legal representation that preceded it with respect to\nother potential pleas and plea offers.\n   To give further support to its contention that the instant\ncase is in a category different from what the Court consid-\nered in Hill and Padilla, the State urges that there is no\nright to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event. See\nWeatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). It claims\nFrye therefore was not deprived of any legal benefit to\nwhich he was entitled. Under this view, any wrongful or\nmistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea\noffers is beside the point.\n   The State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla\nconcerned whether there was ineffective assistance lead-\ning to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a\nformal court appearance with the defendant and all coun-\n6                     MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsel present. Before a guilty plea is entered the defendant\u2019s\nunderstanding of the plea and its consequences can be\nestablished on the record. This affords the State substan-\ntial protection against later claims that the plea was the\nresult of inadequate advice. At the plea entry proceedings\nthe trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to\nestablish on the record that the defendant understands\nthe process that led to any offer, the advantages and\ndisadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing conse-\nquences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is\nentered based upon the plea. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim.\nProc. 11; Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02 (2004). Hill and Padilla\nboth illustrate that, nevertheless, there may be instances\nwhen claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the\nconviction is entered. Still, the State, and the trial court\nitself, have had a substantial opportunity to guard against\nthis contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceed-\ning that the defendant has been given proper advice or, if\nthe advice received appears to have been inadequate, to\nremedy that deficiency before the plea is accepted and the\nconviction entered.\n   When a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected, however,\nno formal court proceedings are involved. This under-\nscores that the plea-bargaining process is often in flux,\nwith no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial\nsupervision of the discussions between prosecution and\ndefense. Indeed, discussions between client and defense\ncounsel are privileged. So the prosecution has little or no\nnotice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity\nto intervene in any event. And, as noted, the State insists\nthere is no right to receive a plea offer. For all these\nreasons, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the\nconsequences of defense counsel\u2019s inadequacies, especially\nwhen the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or, as here,\nfor a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are\npreserved.\n                   Cite as: 566 U.

The reality is that plea bargains have become so\ncentral to the administration of the criminal justice sys-\ntem that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea\nbargain process, responsibilities that must be met to\nrender the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth\nAmendment requires in the criminal process at critical\nstages. Because ours \u201cis for the most part a system of\npleas, not a system of trials,\u201d Lafler, post, at 11, it is insuf-\nficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a\nbackstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.\n\u201cTo a large extent . . . horse trading [between prosecutor\nand defense counsel] determines who goes to jail and for\nhow long. That is what plea bargaining is. It is not some\nadjunct to the criminal justice system; it is the criminal\njustice system.\u201d Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Con-\ntract, 101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992). See also Barkow,\nSeparation of Powers and the Criminal Law, 58 Stan. L.\nRev. 989, 1034 (2006) (\u201c[Defendants] who do take their\ncase to trial and lose receive longer sentences than even\nCongress or the prosecutor might think appropriate, be-\ncause the longer sentences exist on the books largely for\n8                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbargaining purposes. This often results in individuals\nwho accept a plea bargain receiving shorter sentences\nthan other individuals who are less morally culpable but\ntake a chance and go to trial\u201d (footnote omitted)). In to-\nday\u2019s criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of\na plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is\nalmost always the critical point for a defendant.\n  To note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criti-\ncize it. The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial\nresources and for defendants to admit their crimes and\nreceive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a\nplea agreement can benefit both parties. In order that\nthese benefits can be realized, however, criminal defend-\nants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.\n\u201cAnything less . . . might deny a defendant \u2018effective repre-\nsentation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and\nadvice would help him.\u2019 \u201d Massiah, 377 U. S., at 204 (quot-\ning Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959) (Doug-\nlas, J., concurring)).\n                              B\n   The inquiry then becomes how to define the duty and\nresponsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain\nprocess. This is a difficult question. \u201cThe art of negotia-\ntion is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and\nit presents questions farther removed from immediate\njudicial supervision.\u201d Premo v. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 8\u20139). Bargaining is, by its nature,\ndefined to a substantial degree by personal style. The\nalternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so indi-\nvidual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to\ntry to elaborate or define detailed standards for the proper\ndischarge of defense counsel\u2019s participation in the process.\nCf. ibid.\n   This case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion\nto define the duties of defense counsel in those respects,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever. Here the question is whether defense counsel\nhas the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to\naccept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a\nlesser sentence, a conviction on lesser charges, or both.\n  This Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense\ncounsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from\nthe prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions\nthat may be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to\nthat rule need not be explored here, for the offer was a\nformal one with a fixed expiration date. When defense\ncounsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the\ndefendant or allowing him to consider it, defense counsel\ndid not render the effective assistance the Constitution\nrequires.\n  Though the standard for counsel\u2019s performance is not\ndetermined solely by reference to codified standards of\nprofessional practice, these standards can be important\nguides. The American Bar Association recommends de-\nfense counsel \u201cpromptly communicate and explain to the\ndefendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attor-\nney,\u201d ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty\n14\u20133.2(a) (3d ed. 1999), and this standard has been adopt-\ned by numerous state and federal courts over the last 30\nyears.

First, the fact of a formal\noffer means that its terms and its processing can be docu-\nmented so that what took place in the negotiation process\nbecomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the\nconduct of earlier pretrial negotiations. Second, States\nmay elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing,\nagain to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabri-\ncated charges. See N. J. Ct. Rule 3:9\u20131(b) (2012) (\u201cAny\nplea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing\nand forwarded to the defendant\u2019s attorney\u201d). Third, formal\noffers can be made part of the record at any subsequent\nplea proceeding or before a trial on the merits, all to en-\nsure that a defendant has been fully advised before those\nfurther proceedings commence. At least one State often\nfollows a similar procedure before trial.

As a result of that deficient per-\nformance, the offers lapsed. Under Strickland, the ques-\ntion then becomes what, if any, prejudice resulted from\nthe breach of duty.\n                              C\n  To show prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel\nwhere a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendants must demon-\nstrate a reasonable probability they would have accepted\nthe earlier plea offer had they been afforded effective\nassistance of counsel. Defendants must also demonstrate\na reasonable probability the plea would have been entered\nwithout the prosecution canceling it or the trial court\nrefusing to accept it, if they had the authority to exercise\nthat discretion under state law. To establish prejudice in\nthis instance, it is necessary to show a reasonable proba-\nbility that the end result of the criminal process would\nhave been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser\ncharge or a sentence of less prison time. Cf. Glover v.\nUnited States, 531 U. S. 198, 203 (2001) (\u201c[A]ny amount of\n[additional] jail time has Sixth Amendment significance\u201d).\n  This application of Strickland to the instances of an\nuncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the\nstandard laid out in Hill. In cases where a defendant\ncomplains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a\nplea offer as opposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant\nwill have to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for\n12                   MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and\nwould have insisted on going to trial.\u201d Hill, 474 U. S., at\n59. Hill was correctly decided and applies in the context\nin which it arose. Hill does not, however, provide the sole\nmeans for demonstrating prejudice arising from the defi-\ncient performance of counsel during plea negotiations.\nUnlike the defendant in Hill, Frye argues that with effec-\ntive assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea\noffer (limiting his sentence to one year in prison) as op-\nposed to entering an open plea (exposing him to a maxi-\nmum sentence of four years\u2019 imprisonment). In a case,\nsuch as this, where a defendant pleads guilty to less fa-\nvorable terms and claims that ineffective assistance of\ncounsel caused him to miss out on a more favorable earlier\nplea offer, Strickland\u2019s inquiry into whether \u201cthe result of\nthe proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 U. S., at\n694, requires looking not at whether the defendant would\nhave proceeded to trial absent ineffective assistance but\nwhether he would have accepted the offer to plead pursu-\nant to the terms earlier proposed.\n   In order to complete a showing of Strickland prejudice,\ndefendants who have shown a reasonable probability they\nwould have accepted the earlier plea offer must also show\nthat, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel it or\nif the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it,\nthere is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution\nnor the trial court would have prevented the offer from\nbeing accepted or implemented. This further showing is of\nparticular importance because a defendant has no right to\nbe offered a plea, see Weatherford, 429 U. S., at 561, nor a\nfederal right that the judge accept it, Santobello v. New\nYork, 404 U. S. 257, 262 (1971). In at least some States,\nincluding Missouri, it appears the prosecution has some\ndiscretion to cancel a plea agreement to which the defend-\nant has agreed, see, e.g., 311 S. W. 3d, at 359 (case below);\nAriz. Rule Crim. Proc. 17.4(b) (Supp. 2011). The Federal\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this\nCourt\u2019s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept\nor reject plea agreements, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n11(c)(3); see Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4); Boykin v. Ala-\nbama, 395 U. S. 238, 243\u2013244 (1969). It can be assumed\nthat in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are\nfamiliar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains\nand sentences. So in most instances it should not be\ndifficult to make an objective assessment as to whether or\nnot a particular fact or intervening circumstance would\nsuffice, in the normal course, to cause prosecutorial with-\ndrawal or judicial nonapproval of a plea bargain. The\ndetermination that there is or is not a reasonable probabil-\nity that the outcome of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent absent counsel\u2019s errors can be conducted within\nthat framework.\n                             III\n   These standards must be applied to the instant case. As\nregards the deficient performance prong of Strickland, the\nCourt of Appeals found the \u201crecord is void of any evidence\nof any effort by trial counsel to communicate the [formal]\nOffer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evi-\ndence that Frye\u2019s conduct interfered with trial counsel\u2019s\nability to do so.\u201d 311 S. W. 3d, at 356. On this record, it\nis evident that Frye\u2019s attorney did not make a meaningful\nattempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer\nbefore the offer expired. See supra, at 2. The Missouri\nCourt of Appeals was correct that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representa-\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d\nStrickland, supra, at 688.\n   The Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the\nprecise standard for prejudice in this context. As noted, a\ndefendant in Frye\u2019s position must show not only a reason-\nable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed\nplea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution\n14                   MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould have adhered to the agreement and that it would\nhave been accepted by the trial court. Frye can show he\nwould have accepted the offer, but there is strong reason\nto doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have\npermitted the plea bargain to become final.\n  There appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would\nhave accepted the prosecutor\u2019s original offer of a plea\nbargain if the offer had been communicated to him, be-\ncause he pleaded guilty to a more serious charge, with no\npromise of a sentencing recommendation from the prose-\ncutor. It may be that in some cases defendants must show\nmore than just a guilty plea to a charge or sentence harsh-\ner than the original offer. For example, revelations be-\ntween plea offers about the strength of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase may make a late decision to plead guilty insufficient\nto demonstrate, without further evidence, that the defend-\nant would have pleaded guilty to an earlier, more gener-\nous plea offer if his counsel had reported it to him. Here,\nhowever, that is not the case. The Court of Appeals did\nnot err in finding Frye\u2019s acceptance of the less favorable\nplea offer indicated that he would have accepted the earli-\ner (and more favorable) offer had he been apprised of it;\nand there is no need to address here the showings that\nmight be required in other cases.\n  The Court of Appeals failed, however, to require Frye to\nshow that the first plea offer, if accepted by Frye, would\nhave been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by\nthe trial court. Whether the prosecution and trial court\nare required to do so is a matter of state law, and it is not\nthe place of this Court to settle those matters. The Court\nhas established the minimum requirements of the Sixth\nAmendment as interpreted in Strickland, and States have\nthe discretion to add procedural protections under state\nlaw if they choose. A State may choose to preclude the\nprosecution from withdrawing a plea offer once it has been\naccepted or perhaps to preclude a trial court from rejecting\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na plea bargain. In Missouri, it appears \u201ca plea offer once\naccepted by the defendant can be withdrawn without re-\ncourse\u201d by the prosecution. 311 S. W. 3d, at 359. The ex-\ntent of the trial court\u2019s discretion in Missouri to reject a\nplea agreement appears to be in some doubt. Compare id.,\nat 360, with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4).\n   We remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consid-\ner these state-law questions, because they bear on the\nfederal question of Strickland prejudice. If, as the Mis-\nsouri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled\nthe plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable\nprobability the prosecutor would have adhered to the\nagreement, there is no Strickland prejudice. Likewise, if\nthe trial court could have refused to accept the plea\nagreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probabil-\nity the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no\nStrickland prejudice. In this case, given Frye\u2019s new of-\nfense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007,\nthere is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have\nadhered to the agreement or that the trial court would\nhave accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless\nthey were required by state law to do so.\n   It is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals\nto address this question in the first instance. The judg-\nment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Cooper, post, p. ___.\nThe principal difference between the cases is that the\nfairness of the defendant\u2019s conviction in Lafler was estab-\nlished by a full trial and jury verdict, whereas Frye\u2019s\nconviction here was established by his own admission of\nguilt, received by the court after the usual colloquy that\nassured it was voluntary and truthful. In Lafler all that\ncould be said (and as I discuss there it was quite enough)\nis that the fairness of the conviction was clear, though a\nunanimous jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt can\nsometimes be wrong. Here it can be said not only that the\nprocess was fair, but that the defendant acknowledged the\ncorrectness of his conviction. Thus, as far as the reasons\nfor my dissent are concerned, this is an a fortiori case. I\nwill not repeat here the constitutional points that I discuss\nat length in Lafler, but I will briefly apply those points to\nthe facts here and comment upon a few statements in the\nCourt\u2019s analysis.\n                       *     *     *\n  Galin Frye\u2019s attorney failed to inform him about a plea\noffer, and Frye ultimately pleaded guilty without the\nbenefit of a deal. Counsel\u2019s mistake did not deprive Frye\nof any substantive or procedural right; only of the oppor-\n2                    MISSOURI v.

So little entitlement that, had\nhe known of and accepted the bargain, the prosecution\nwould have been able to withdraw it right up to the point\nthat his guilty plea pursuant to the bargain was accepted.\nSee 311 S. W. 3d 350, 359, and n. 4 (Mo. App. 2010).\n   The Court acknowledges, moreover, that Frye\u2019s convic-\ntion was untainted by attorney error: \u201c[T]he guilty plea\nthat was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it\nin court, were all based on accurate advice and infor-\nmation from counsel.\u201d Ante, at 5. Given the \u201cultimate\nfocus\u201d of our ineffective-assistance cases on \u201cthe funda-\nmental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being\nchallenged,\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 696\n(1984), that should be the end of the matter. Instead,\nhere, as in Lafler, the Court mechanically applies an\noutcome-based test for prejudice, and mistakes the possi-\nbility of a different result for constitutional injustice. As\nI explain in Lafler, post, p. ___ (dissenting opinion), that\napproach is contrary to our precedents on the right to\neffective counsel, and for good reason.\n   The Court announces its holding that \u201cas a general rule,\ndefense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers\nfrom the prosecution\u201d as though that resolves a disputed\npoint; in reality, however, neither the State nor the Solici-\ntor General argued that counsel\u2019s performance here was\nadequate. Ante, at 9. The only issue was whether the in-\nadequacy deprived Frye of his constitutional right to a\nfair trial. In other cases, however, it will not be so clear\nthat counsel\u2019s plea-bargaining skills, which must now\nmeet a constitutional minimum, are adequate. \u201c[H]ow to\ndefine the duty and responsibilities of defense counsel in\nthe plea bargain process,\u201d the Court acknowledges, \u201cis a\ndifficult question,\u201d since \u201c[b]argaining is, by its nature,\ndefined to a substantial degree by personal style.\u201d Ante, at\n8.

It seems\ninconceivable that a lawyer could compromise his client\u2019s\nconstitutional rights so that he can secure better deals for\nother clients in the future; does a hard-bargaining \u201cper-\nsonal style\u201d now violate the Sixth Amendment? The Court\nignores such difficulties, however, since \u201c[t]his case pre-\nsents neither the necessity nor the occasion to define the\nduties of defense counsel in those respects.\u201d Ante, at 8.\nPerhaps not. But it does present the necessity of confront-\ning the serious difficulties that will be created by constitu-\ntionalization of the plea-bargaining process. It will not do\nsimply to announce that they will be solved in the sweet\nby-and-by.\n   While the inadequacy of counsel\u2019s performance in this\ncase is clear enough, whether it was prejudicial (in the\nsense that the Court\u2019s new version of Strickland requires)\nis not. The Court\u2019s description of how that question is\nto be answered on remand is alone enough to show how\nunwise it is to constitutionalize the plea-bargaining pro-\ncess. Prejudice is to be determined, the Court tells us, by\na process of retrospective crystal-ball gazing posing as\nlegal analysis. First of all, of course, we must estimate\nwhether the defendant would have accepted the earlier\nplea bargain. Here that seems an easy question, but as\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 14, it will not always be.\nNext, since Missouri, like other States, permits accepted\nplea offers to be withdrawn by the prosecution (a reality\nwhich alone should suffice, one would think, to demon-\nstrate that Frye had no entitlement to the plea bargain),\nwe must estimate whether the prosecution would have\nwithdrawn the plea offer. And finally, we must estimate\nwhether the trial court would have approved the plea\nagreement. These last two estimations may seem easy in\nthe present case, since Frye committed a new infraction\n4                    MISSOURI v. FRYE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbefore the hearing at which the agreement would have\nbeen presented; but they assuredly will not be easy in the\nmine run of cases.\n  The Court says \u201c[i]t can be assumed that in most juris-\ndictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the\nboundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. Assuredly it can, just as it can be assumed\nthat the sun rises in the west; but I know of no basis for\nthe assumption. Virtually no cases deal with the stand-\nards for a prosecutor\u2019s withdrawal from a plea agreement\nbeyond stating the general rule that a prosecutor may\nwithdraw any time prior to, but not after, the entry of a\nguilty plea or other action constituting detrimental reli-\nance on the defendant\u2019s part. See, e.g., United States v.\nKuchinski, 469 F. 3d 853, 857\u2013858 (CA9 2006). And cases\naddressing trial courts\u2019 authority to accept or reject plea\nagreements almost universally observe that a trial court\nenjoys broad discretion in this regard. See, e.g., Missouri\nv. Banks, 135 S. W. 3d 497, 500 (Mo. App. 2004) (trial\ncourt abuses its discretion in rejecting a plea only if the\ndecision \u201cis so arbitrary and unreasonable that it shocks\nthe sense of justice and indicates a lack of careful con-\nsideration\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Of course\nafter today\u2019s opinions there will be cases galore, so the\nCourt\u2019s assumption would better be cast as an optimistic\nprediction of the certainty that will emerge, many years\nhence, from our newly created constitutional field of plea-\nbargaining law. Whatever the \u201cboundaries\u201d ultimately\ndevised (if that were possible), a vast amount of discretion\nwill still remain, and it is extraordinary to make a defend-\nant\u2019s constitutional rights depend upon a series of ret-\nrospective mind-readings as to how that discretion, in\nprosecutors and trial judges, would have been exercised.\n  The plea-bargaining process is a subject worthy of regu-\nlation, since it is the means by which most criminal con-\nvictions are obtained. It happens not to be, however, a\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsubject covered by the Sixth Amendment, which is con-\ncerned not with the fairness of bargaining but with the\nfairness of conviction. \u201cThe Constitution . . . is not an all-\npurpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world;\nand when we ignore its text in order to make it that, we\noften find ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack ham-\nmer is needed.\u201d Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). In this case\nand its companion, the Court\u2019s sledge may require the\nreversal of perfectly valid, eminently just, convictions. A\nlegislature could solve the problems presented by these\ncases in a much more precise and efficient manner. It\nmight begin, for example, by penalizing the attorneys\nwho made such grievous errors. That type of sub-\nconstitutional remedy is not available to the Court, which\nis limited to penalizing (almost) everyone else by reversing\nvalid convictions or sentences. Because that result is\ninconsistent with the Sixth Amendment and decades of\nour precedent, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
