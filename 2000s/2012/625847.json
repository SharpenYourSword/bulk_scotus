Argued January 9, 2012\u2014Decided March 21, 2012\nThe Clean Water Act prohibits \u201cthe discharge of any pollutant by any\n  person,\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71311, without a permit, into \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d\n  \u00a71344. Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) may either issue a compliance\n  order or initiate a civil enforcement action. \u00a71319(a)(3). The result-\n  ing civil penalty may not \u201cexceed [$37,500] per day for each viola-\n  tion.\u201d \u00a71319(d). The Government contends that the amount doubles\n  to $75,000 when the EPA prevails against a person who has been is-\n  sued a compliance order but has failed to comply.\n     The Sacketts, petitioners here, received a compliance order from\n  the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable\n  waters and that their construction project violated the Act. The\n  Sacketts sought declarative and injunctive relief in the Federal Dis-\n  trict Court, contending that the compliance order was \u201carbitrary\n  [and] capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5\n  U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of due process in viola-\n  tion of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the\n  claims for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit af-\n  firmed, concluding that the Clean Water Act precluded pre-\n  enforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such pre-\n  clusion did not violate due process.\nHeld: The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge\n the issuance of the EPA\u2019s order. Pp. 4\u201310.\n    (a) The APA provides for judicial review of \u201cfinal agency action for\n which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d 5 U. S.

S. 154, 178, requiring the Sacketts to restore their\n    property according to an agency-approved plan and to give the EPA\n    access. Also, \u201clegal consequences . . . flow\u201d from the order, ibid.,\n    which, according to the Government\u2019s litigating position, exposes the\n    Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings. The\n    order also severely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their fill\n    from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. \u00a71344; 33 CFR\n    \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv). Further, the order\u2019s issuance marks the \u201cconsumma-\n    tion\u201d of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178,\n    for the EPA\u2019s findings in the compliance order were not subject to\n    further agency review. The Sacketts also had \u201cno other adequate\n    remedy in a court,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7704. A civil action brought by the EPA\n    under 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such\n    cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process. And each day\n    they wait, they accrue additional potential liability. Applying to the\n    Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if\n    that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for\n    the EPA\u2019s action. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) The Clean Water Act is not a statute that \u201cpreclude[s] judicial\n    review\u201d under the APA, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701(a)(1).

While\n    this presumption \u201cmay be overcome by inferences of intent drawn\n    from the statutory scheme as a whole,\u201d ibid., the Government\u2019s ar-\n    guments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Act\u2019s stat-\n    utory scheme precludes APA review.

ENVI-\n   RONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [March 21, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   We consider whether Michael and Chantell Sackett may\nbring a civil action under the Administrative Procedure\nAct, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7500 et seq., to challenge the issuance by\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of an admin\u00ad\nistrative compliance order under \u00a7309 of the Clean Water\nAct, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319. The order asserts that the Sack\u00ad\netts\u2019 property is subject to the Act, and that they have\nviolated its provisions by placing fill material on the prop\u00ad\nerty; and on this basis it directs them immediately to\nrestore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan.\n                              I\n   The Clean Water Act prohibits, among other things, \u201cthe\ndischarge of any pollutant by any person,\u201d \u00a71311, without\na permit, into the \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d \u00a71344\u2014which the\nAct defines as \u201cthe waters of the United States,\u201d \u00a71362(7).\nIf the EPA determines that any person is in violation of\nthis restriction, the Act directs the agency either to issue\na compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action.\n\u00a71319(a)(3). When the EPA prevails in a civil action, the\nAct provides for \u201ca civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per\n2                         SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nday for each violation.\u201d1 \u00a71319(d). And according to the\nGovernment, when the EPA prevails against any person\nwho has been issued a compliance order but has failed\nto comply, that amount is increased to $75,000\u2014up to\n$37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional\n$37,500 for violating the compliance order.\n  The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about\nthe scope of \u201cthe navigable waters\u201d subject to this en\u00ad\nforcement regime. Today we consider only whether the\ndispute may be brought to court by challenging the com\u00ad\npliance order\u2014we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.\nThe reader will be curious, however, to know what all\nthe fuss is about. In United States v. Riverside Bayview\nHomes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we upheld a regulation\nthat construed \u201cthe navigable waters\u201d to include \u201cfreshwa\u00ad\nter wetlands,\u201d id., at 124, themselves not actually naviga\u00ad\nble, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters. Later,\nin Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 (2001), we held that an\nabandoned sand and gravel pit, which \u201cseasonally ponded\u201d\nbut which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was\nnot part of the navigable waters. Then most recently, in\nRapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), we consid\u00ad\nered whether a wetland not adjacent to navigable-in-fact\nwaters fell within the scope of the Act. Our answer was\nno, but no one rationale commanded a majority of the\nCourt. In his separate opinion, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ex\u00ad\npressed the concern that interested parties would lack\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per\nday. The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 104\nStat. 890, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a72461, as amended by the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996, \u00a73720E, 110 Stat. 1321\u2013373, note\nfollowing 28 U. S. C. \u00a72461, p. 1315 (Amendment), authorizes the EPA\nto adjust that maximum penalty for inflation. On the basis of that\nauthority, the agency has raised the cap to $37,500. See 74 Fed. Reg.\n626, 627 (2009).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is\nseparated from the lake by several lots containing perma\u00ad\nnent structures. In preparation for constructing a house,\nthe Sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.\nSome months later, they received from the EPA a compli\u00ad\nance order. The order contained a number of \u201cFindings\nand Conclusions,\u201d including the following:\n    \u201c1.4 [The Sacketts\u2019 property] contains wetlands with\u00ad\n    in the meaning of 33 C. F. R. \u00a7328.4(8)(b); the wet\u00ad\n    lands meet the criteria for jurisdictional wetlands in\n    the 1987 \u2018Federal Manual for Identifying and Deline\u00ad\n    ating Jurisdictional Wetlands.\u2019\n    \u201c1.5 The Site\u2019s wetlands are adjacent to Priest Lake\n    within the meaning of 33 C. F. R. \u00a7328.4(8)(c). Priest\n    Lake is a \u2018navigable water\u2019 within the meaning of sec\u00ad\n    tion 502(7) of the Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(7), and \u2018wa\u00ad\n    ters of the United States\u2019 within the meaning of 40\n    C. F. R. \u00a7232.2.\n    \u201c1.6 In April and May, 2007, at times more fully\n    known to [the Sacketts, they] and/or persons acting on\n    their behalf discharged fill material into wetlands at\n    the Site. [They] filled approximately one half acre.\n        .            .          .          .           .\n    \u201c1.9 By causing such fill material to enter waters of\n    the United States, [the Sacketts] have engaged, and\n    are continuing to engage, in the \u2018discharge of pollu\u00ad\n    tants\u2019 from a point source within the meaning of sec\u00ad\n    tions 301 and 502(12) of the Act, 33 U.

EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201c1.11 [The Sacketts\u2019] discharge of pollutants into wa\u00ad\n    ters of the United States at the Site without [a] per\u00ad\n    mit constitutes a violation of section 301 of the Act, 33\n    U. S. C. \u00a71311.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\nOn the basis of these findings and conclusions, the order\ndirects the Sacketts, among other things, \u201cimmediately\n[to] undertake activities to restore the Site in accordance\nwith [an EPA-created] Restoration Work Plan\u201d and to \u201cpro-\nvide and/or obtain access to the Site . . . [and] access to\nall records and documentation related to the conditions at\nthe Site . . . to EPA employees and/or their designated\nrepresentatives.\u201d Id., at 21\u201322, \u00b6\u00b62.1, 2.7.\n   The Sacketts, who do not believe that their property is\nsubject to the Act, asked the EPA for a hearing, but that\nrequest was denied. They then brought this action in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho,\nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint\ncontended that the EPA\u2019s issuance of the compliance order\nwas \u201carbitrary [and] capricious\u201d under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A), and that it\ndeprived them of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law,\u201d in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The\nDistrict Court dismissed the claims for want of subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction, and the United States Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 622 F. 3d 1139\n(2010).    It concluded that the Act \u201cpreclude[s] pre\u00ad\nenforcement judicial review of compliance orders,\u201d id., at\n1144, and that such preclusion does not violate the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s due process guarantee, id., at 1147. We\ngranted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n  The Sacketts brought suit under Chapter 7 of the APA,\nwhich provides for judicial review of \u201cfinal agency action\nfor which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7704. We consider first whether the compliance\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\norder is final agency action. There is no doubt it is agency\naction, which the APA defines as including even a \u201cfailure\nto act.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7551(13), 701(b)(2). But is it final? It has all of\nthe hallmarks of APA finality that our opinions establish.\nThrough the order, the EPA \u201c \u2018determined\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018rights or ob\u00ad\nligations.\u2019 \u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997)\n(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Re-\nderiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970)).\nBy reason of the order, the Sacketts have the legal obliga\u00ad\ntion to \u201crestore\u201d their property according to an agency\u00ad\napproved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA\naccess to their property and to \u201crecords and documentation\nrelated to the conditions at the Site.\u201d App. 22, \u00b62.7. Also,\n\u201c \u2018legal consequences . . . flow\u2019 \u201d from issuance of the order.\nBennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Marine Terminal, supra,\nat 71). For one, according to the Government\u2019s current\nlitigating position, the order exposes the Sacketts to dou\u00ad\nble penalties in a future enforcement proceeding.2 It also\nseverely limits the Sacketts\u2019 ability to obtain a permit for\ntheir fill from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71344. The Corps\u2019 regulations provide that, once the EPA\nhas issued a compliance order with respect to certain\nproperty, the Corps will not process a permit application\nfor that property unless doing so \u201cis clearly appropriate.\u201d\n33 CFR \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).3\n    The issuance of the compliance order also marks the\n\u201c \u2018consummation\u2019 \u201d of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We do not decide today that the Government\u2019s position is correct,\n\nbut assume the consequences of the order to be what the Government\nasserts.\n  3 The regulation provides this consequence for \u201cenforcement litigation\n\nthat has been initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.\u201d 33\nCFR \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The Government acknowledges, however,\nthat EPA\u2019s issuance of a compliance order is considered by the Corps to\nfall within the provision. Brief for Respondents 31. Here again, we\ntake the Government at its word without affirming that it represents a\nproper interpretation of the regulation.\n6                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago & Southern Air\nLines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113\n(1948)). As the Sacketts learned when they unsuccessfully\nsought a hearing, the \u201cFindings and Conclusions\u201d that the\ncompliance order contained were not subject to further\nagency review. The Government resists this conclusion,\npointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts\nto \u201cengage in informal discussion of the terms and re\u00ad\nquirements\u201d of the order with the EPA and to inform the\nagency of \u201cany allegations [t]herein which [they] believe[d]\nto be inaccurate.\u201d App. 22\u201323, \u00b62.11. But that confers no\nentitlement to further agency review. The mere possibil\u00ad\nity that an agency might reconsider in light of \u201cinformal\ndiscussion\u201d and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not\nsuffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.\n   The APA\u2019s judicial review provision also requires that\nthe person seeking APA review of final agency action have\n\u201cno other adequate remedy in a court,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7704. In\nClean Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordi\u00ad\nnarily comes by way of a civil action brought by the EPA\nunder 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319. But the Sacketts cannot initiate\nthat process, and each day they wait for the agency to drop\nthe hammer, they accrue, by the Government\u2019s telling, an\nadditional $75,000 in potential liability. The other possi\u00ad\nble route to judicial review\u2014applying to the Corps of\nEngineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA\nif a permit is denied\u2014will not serve either. The remedy\nfor denial of action that might be sought from one agency\ndoes not ordinarily provide an \u201cadequate remedy\u201d for ac-\ntion already taken by another agency. The Government,\nto its credit, does not seriously contend that other availa\u00ad\nble remedies alone foreclose review under \u00a7704. Instead,\nthe Government relies on \u00a7701(a)(1) of the APA, which\nexcludes APA review \u201cto the extent that [other] statutes\npreclude judicial review.\u201d The Clean Water Act, it says, is\nsuch a statute.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   Nothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes\njudicial review under the APA or otherwise. But in de\u00ad\ntermining \u201c[w]hether and to what extent a particular\nstatute precludes judicial review,\u201d we do not look \u201conly [to]\nits express language.\u201d Block v. Community Nutrition\nInstitute, 467 U. S. 340, 345 (1984). The APA, we have\nsaid, creates a \u201cpresumption favoring judicial review of\nadministrative action,\u201d but as with most presumptions,\nthis one \u201cmay be overcome by inferences of intent drawn\nfrom the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d Id., at 349. The\nGovernment offers several reasons why the statutory\nscheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review.\n   The Government first points to 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319(a)(3),\nwhich provides that, when the EPA \u201cfinds that any person\nis in violation\u201d of certain portions of the Act, the agency\n\u201cshall issue an order requiring such person to comply\nwith [the Act], or . . . shall bring a civil action [to enforce\nthe Act].\u201d The Government argues that, because Congress\ngave the EPA the choice between a judicial proceeding and\nan administrative action, it would undermine the Act to\nallow judicial review of the latter. But that argument\nrests on the question-begging premise that the relevant\ndifference between a compliance order and an enforcement\nproceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial\nreview. There are eminently sound reasons other than\ninsulation from judicial review why compliance orders\nare useful. The Government itself suggests that they\n\u201cprovid[e] a means of notifying recipients of potential vio\u00ad\nlations and quickly resolving the issues through volun-\ntary compliance.\u201d Brief for Respondents 39. It is entirely\nconsistent with this function to allow judicial review when\nthe recipient does not choose \u201cvoluntary compliance.\u201d The\nAct does not guarantee the EPA that issuing a compliance\norder will always be the most effective choice.\n   The Government also notes that compliance orders are\n8                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot self-executing, but must be enforced by the agency in\na plenary judicial action. It suggests that Congress there\u00ad\nfore viewed a compliance order \u201cas a step in the delibera\u00ad\ntive process[,] . . . rather than as a coercive sanction that\nitself must be subject to judicial review.\u201d Id., at 38. But\nthe APA provides for judicial review of all final agency\nactions, not just those that impose a self-executing sanc\u00ad\ntion. And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim\nthat the issuance of the compliance order was just \u201ca step\nin the deliberative process\u201d when the agency rejected the\nSacketts\u2019 attempt to obtain a hearing and when the next\nstep will either be taken by the Sacketts (if they comply\nwith the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative,\ndeliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action). As\nthe text (and indeed the very name) of the compliance\norder makes clear, the EPA\u2019s \u201cdeliberation\u201d over whether\nthe Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the\nagency may still have to deliberate over whether it is\nconfident enough about this conclusion to initiate litiga\u00ad\ntion, but that is a separate subject.\n   The Government further urges us to consider that Con\u00ad\ngress expressly provided for prompt judicial review, on the\nadministrative record, when the EPA assesses administra\u00ad\ntive penalties after a hearing, see \u00a71319(g)(8), but did not\nexpressly provide for review of compliance orders. But if\nthe express provision of judicial review in one section of\na long and complicated statute were alone enough to over-\ncome the APA\u2019s presumption of reviewability for all final\nagency action, it would not be much of a presumption at\nall.\n   The cases on which the Government relies simply are\nnot analogous. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,\nsupra, we held that the Agricultural Marketing Agree\u00ad\nment Act of 1937, which expressly allowed milk handlers\nto obtain judicial review of milk market orders, precluded\nreview of milk market orders in suits brought by milk\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconsumers. 467 U. S., at 345\u2013348. Where a statute pro\u00ad\nvides that particular agency action is reviewable at the\ninstance of one party, who must first exhaust administra\u00ad\ntive remedies, the inference that it is not reviewable at the\ninstance of other parties, who are not subject to the admin\u00ad\nistrative process, is strong. In United States v. Erika, Inc.,\n456 U. S. 201 (1982), we held that the Medicare statute,\nwhich expressly provided for judicial review of awards\nunder Part A, precluded review of awards under Part B.\nId., at 206\u2013208. The strong parallel between the award\nprovisions in Part A and Part B of the Medicare statute\ndoes not exist between the issuance of a compliance order\nand the assessment of administrative penalties under the\nClean Water Act. And in United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439 (1988), we held that the Civil Service Reform\nAct, which expressly excluded certain \u201cnonpreference\u201d\nemployees from the statute\u2019s review scheme, precluded\nreview at the instance of those employees in a separate\nClaims Court action. Id., at 448\u2013449. Here, there is no\nsuggestion that Congress has sought to exclude compli\u00ad\nance-order recipients from the Act\u2019s review scheme; quite\nto the contrary, the Government\u2019s case is premised on the\nnotion that the Act\u2019s primary review mechanisms are open\nto the Sacketts.\n   Finally, the Government notes that Congress passed the\nClean Water Act in large part to respond to the inefficien\u00ad\ncy of then-existing remedies for water pollution. Compli\u00ad\nance orders, as noted above, can obtain quick remediation\nthrough voluntary compliance. The Government warns\nthat the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are\nsubject to judicial review. That may be true\u2014but it will be\ntrue for all agency actions subjected to judicial review.\nThe APA\u2019s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation\nof the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all.\nAnd there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act\nwas uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of\n10                    SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulated parties into \u201cvoluntary compliance\u201d without the\nopportunity for judicial review\u2014even judicial review of the\nquestion whether the regulated party is within the EPA\u2019s\njurisdiction. Compliance orders will remain an effective\nmeans of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those\nmany cases where there is no substantial basis to question\ntheir validity.\n                        *    *    *\n   We conclude that the compliance order in this case is\nfinal agency action for which there is no adequate remedy\nother than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does\nnot preclude that review. We therefore reverse the judg\u00ad\nment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

The EPA\nmay issue a compliance order demanding that the own-\ners cease construction, engage in expensive remedial\nmeasures, and abandon any use of the property. If the\nowners do not do the EPA\u2019s bidding, they may be fined up\nto $75,000 per day ($37,500 for violating the Act and\nanother $37,500 for violating the compliance order). And\nif the owners want their day in court to show that their lot\ndoes not include covered wetlands, well, as a practical\nmatter, that is just too bad. Until the EPA sues them,\nthey are blocked from access to the courts, and the EPA\nmay wait as long as it wants before deciding to sue. By\nthat time, the potential fines may easily have reached the\n2                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nmillions. In a nation that values due process, not to men-\ntion private property, such treatment is unthinkable.\n   The Court\u2019s decision provides a modest measure of re-\nlief. At least, property owners like petitioners will have\nthe right to challenge the EPA\u2019s jurisdictional determina-\ntion under the Administrative Procedure Act. But the\ncombination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act\nand the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of viola-\ntions alleged in this case still leaves most property owners\nwith little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA\u2019s\ntune.\n   Real relief requires Congress to do what it should have\ndone in the first place: provide a reasonably clear rule re-\ngarding the reach of the Clean Water Act. When Con-\ngress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it provided\nthat the Act covers \u201cthe waters of the United States.\u201d 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71362(7). But Congress did not define what it\nmeant by \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d; the phrase\nwas not a term of art with a known meaning; and the\nwords themselves are hopelessly indeterminate. Unsur-\nprisingly, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers in-\nterpreted the phrase as an essentially limitless grant of\nauthority. We rejected that boundless view, see Rapanos\nv. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 732\u2013739 (2006) (plurality\nopinion); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167\u2013174 (2001),\nbut the precise reach of the Act remains unclear. For 40\nyears, Congress has done nothing to resolve this critical\nambiguity, and the EPA has not seen fit to promulgate a\nrule providing a clear and sufficiently limited definition of\nthe phrase. Instead, the agency has relied on informal\nguidance. But far from providing clarity and predictabil-\nity, the agency\u2019s latest informal guidance advises property\nowners that many jurisdictional determinations concern-\ning wetlands can only be made on a case-by-case basis by\nEPA field staff.

Argued January 9, 2012\u2014Decided March 21, 2012\nThe Clean Water Act prohibits \u201cthe discharge of any pollutant by any\n  person,\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71311, without a permit, into \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d\n  \u00a71344. Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) may either issue a compliance\n  order or initiate a civil enforcement action. \u00a71319(a)(3). The result-\n  ing civil penalty may not \u201cexceed [$37,500] per day for each viola-\n  tion.\u201d \u00a71319(d). The Government contends that the amount doubles\n  to $75,000 when the EPA prevails against a person who has been is-\n  sued a compliance order but has failed to comply.\n     The Sacketts, petitioners here, received a compliance order from\n  the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable\n  waters and that their construction project violated the Act. The\n  Sacketts sought declarative and injunctive relief in the Federal Dis-\n  trict Court, contending that the compliance order was \u201carbitrary\n  [and] capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5\n  U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A), and that it deprived them of due process in viola-\n  tion of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the\n  claims for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit af-\n  firmed, concluding that the Clean Water Act precluded pre-\n  enforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such pre-\n  clusion did not violate due process.\nHeld: The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge\n the issuance of the EPA\u2019s order.

Also, \u201clegal consequences . . . flow\u201d from the order, ibid.,\n    which, according to the Government\u2019s litigating position, exposes the\n    Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings. The\n    order also severely limits their ability to obtain a permit for their fill\n    from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C. \u00a71344; 33 CFR\n    \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv). Further, the order\u2019s issuance marks the \u201cconsumma-\n    tion\u201d of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process, Bennett, supra, at 178,\n    for the EPA\u2019s findings in the compliance order were not subject to\n    further agency review. The Sacketts also had \u201cno other adequate\n    remedy in a court,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7704. A civil action brought by the EPA\n    under 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319 ordinarily provides judicial review in such\n    cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that process. And each day\n    they wait, they accrue additional potential liability. Applying to the\n    Corps of Engineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if\n    that permit is denied also does not provide an adequate remedy for\n    the EPA\u2019s action.

S. C. \u00a7500 et seq., to challenge the issuance by\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of an admin\u00ad\nistrative compliance order under \u00a7309 of the Clean Water\nAct, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319. The order asserts that the Sack\u00ad\netts\u2019 property is subject to the Act, and that they have\nviolated its provisions by placing fill material on the prop\u00ad\nerty; and on this basis it directs them immediately to\nrestore the property pursuant to an EPA work plan.\n                              I\n   The Clean Water Act prohibits, among other things, \u201cthe\ndischarge of any pollutant by any person,\u201d \u00a71311, without\na permit, into the \u201cnavigable waters,\u201d \u00a71344\u2014which the\nAct defines as \u201cthe waters of the United States,\u201d \u00a71362(7).\nIf the EPA determines that any person is in violation of\nthis restriction, the Act directs the agency either to issue\na compliance order or to initiate a civil enforcement action.\n\u00a71319(a)(3). When the EPA prevails in a civil action, the\nAct provides for \u201ca civil penalty not to exceed [$37,500] per\n2                         SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nday for each violation.\u201d1 \u00a71319(d). And according to the\nGovernment, when the EPA prevails against any person\nwho has been issued a compliance order but has failed\nto comply, that amount is increased to $75,000\u2014up to\n$37,500 for the statutory violation and up to an additional\n$37,500 for violating the compliance order.\n  The particulars of this case flow from a dispute about\nthe scope of \u201cthe navigable waters\u201d subject to this en\u00ad\nforcement regime. Today we consider only whether the\ndispute may be brought to court by challenging the com\u00ad\npliance order\u2014we do not resolve the dispute on the merits.\nThe reader will be curious, however, to know what all\nthe fuss is about. In United States v. Riverside Bayview\nHomes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 (1985), we upheld a regulation\nthat construed \u201cthe navigable waters\u201d to include \u201cfreshwa\u00ad\nter wetlands,\u201d id., at 124, themselves not actually naviga\u00ad\nble, that were adjacent to navigable-in-fact waters. Later,\nin Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 (2001), we held that an\nabandoned sand and gravel pit, which \u201cseasonally ponded\u201d\nbut which was not adjacent to open water, id., at 164, was\nnot part of the navigable waters. Then most recently, in\nRapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715 (2006), we consid\u00ad\nered whether a wetland not adjacent to navigable-in-fact\nwaters fell within the scope of the Act. Our answer was\nno, but no one rationale commanded a majority of the\nCourt. In his separate opinion, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ex\u00ad\npressed the concern that interested parties would lack\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        original statute set a penalty cap of $25,000 per violation per\nday.

Their property lies just north of Priest Lake, but is\nseparated from the lake by several lots containing perma\u00ad\nnent structures. In preparation for constructing a house,\nthe Sacketts filled in part of their lot with dirt and rock.\nSome months later, they received from the EPA a compli\u00ad\nance order. The order contained a number of \u201cFindings\nand Conclusions,\u201d including the following:\n    \u201c1.4 [The Sacketts\u2019 property] contains wetlands with\u00ad\n    in the meaning of 33 C.

They then brought this action in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho,\nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Their complaint\ncontended that the EPA\u2019s issuance of the compliance order\nwas \u201carbitrary [and] capricious\u201d under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A), and that it\ndeprived them of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law,\u201d in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The\nDistrict Court dismissed the claims for want of subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction, and the United States Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 622 F. 3d 1139\n(2010).    It concluded that the Act \u201cpreclude[s] pre\u00ad\nenforcement judicial review of compliance orders,\u201d id., at\n1144, and that such preclusion does not violate the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s due process guarantee, id., at 1147. We\ngranted certiorari. 564 U.

S. C. \u00a7704. We consider first whether the compliance\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\norder is final agency action. There is no doubt it is agency\naction, which the APA defines as including even a \u201cfailure\nto act.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7551(13), 701(b)(2). But is it final? It has all of\nthe hallmarks of APA finality that our opinions establish.\nThrough the order, the EPA \u201c \u2018determined\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018rights or ob\u00ad\nligations.\u2019 \u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997)\n(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Re-\nderiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970)).\nBy reason of the order, the Sacketts have the legal obliga\u00ad\ntion to \u201crestore\u201d their property according to an agency\u00ad\napproved Restoration Work Plan, and must give the EPA\naccess to their property and to \u201crecords and documentation\nrelated to the conditions at the Site.\u201d App. 22, \u00b62.7. Also,\n\u201c \u2018legal consequences . . . flow\u2019 \u201d from issuance of the order.\nBennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Marine Terminal, supra,\nat 71). For one, according to the Government\u2019s current\nlitigating position, the order exposes the Sacketts to dou\u00ad\nble penalties in a future enforcement proceeding.2 It also\nseverely limits the Sacketts\u2019 ability to obtain a permit for\ntheir fill from the Army Corps of Engineers, see 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71344. The Corps\u2019 regulations provide that, once the EPA\nhas issued a compliance order with respect to certain\nproperty, the Corps will not process a permit application\nfor that property unless doing so \u201cis clearly appropriate.\u201d\n33 CFR \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011).3\n    The issuance of the compliance order also marks the\n\u201c \u2018consummation\u2019 \u201d of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We do not decide today that the Government\u2019s position is correct,\n\nbut assume the consequences of the order to be what the Government\nasserts.\n  3 The regulation provides this consequence for \u201cenforcement litigation\n\nthat has been initiated by other Federal . . . regulatory agencies.\u201d 33\nCFR \u00a7326.3(e)(1)(iv) (2011). The Government acknowledges, however,\nthat EPA\u2019s issuance of a compliance order is considered by the Corps to\nfall within the provision. Brief for Respondents 31. Here again, we\ntake the Government at its word without affirming that it represents a\nproper interpretation of the regulation.\n6                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBennett, supra, at 178 (quoting Chicago & Southern Air\nLines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113\n(1948)). As the Sacketts learned when they unsuccessfully\nsought a hearing, the \u201cFindings and Conclusions\u201d that the\ncompliance order contained were not subject to further\nagency review. The Government resists this conclusion,\npointing to a portion of the order that invited the Sacketts\nto \u201cengage in informal discussion of the terms and re\u00ad\nquirements\u201d of the order with the EPA and to inform the\nagency of \u201cany allegations [t]herein which [they] believe[d]\nto be inaccurate.\u201d App. 22\u201323, \u00b62.11. But that confers no\nentitlement to further agency review. The mere possibil\u00ad\nity that an agency might reconsider in light of \u201cinformal\ndiscussion\u201d and invited contentions of inaccuracy does not\nsuffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.\n   The APA\u2019s judicial review provision also requires that\nthe person seeking APA review of final agency action have\n\u201cno other adequate remedy in a court,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7704. In\nClean Water Act enforcement cases, judicial review ordi\u00ad\nnarily comes by way of a civil action brought by the EPA\nunder 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319. But the Sacketts cannot initiate\nthat process, and each day they wait for the agency to drop\nthe hammer, they accrue, by the Government\u2019s telling, an\nadditional $75,000 in potential liability. The other possi\u00ad\nble route to judicial review\u2014applying to the Corps of\nEngineers for a permit and then filing suit under the APA\nif a permit is denied\u2014will not serve either. The remedy\nfor denial of action that might be sought from one agency\ndoes not ordinarily provide an \u201cadequate remedy\u201d for ac-\ntion already taken by another agency. The Government,\nto its credit, does not seriously contend that other availa\u00ad\nble remedies alone foreclose review under \u00a7704. Instead,\nthe Government relies on \u00a7701(a)(1) of the APA, which\nexcludes APA review \u201cto the extent that [other] statutes\npreclude judicial review.\u201d The Clean Water Act, it says, is\nsuch a statute.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   Nothing in the Clean Water Act expressly precludes\njudicial review under the APA or otherwise. But in de\u00ad\ntermining \u201c[w]hether and to what extent a particular\nstatute precludes judicial review,\u201d we do not look \u201conly [to]\nits express language.\u201d Block v. Community Nutrition\nInstitute, 467 U. S. 340, 345 (1984). The APA, we have\nsaid, creates a \u201cpresumption favoring judicial review of\nadministrative action,\u201d but as with most presumptions,\nthis one \u201cmay be overcome by inferences of intent drawn\nfrom the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d Id., at 349. The\nGovernment offers several reasons why the statutory\nscheme of the Clean Water Act precludes review.\n   The Government first points to 33 U. S. C. \u00a71319(a)(3),\nwhich provides that, when the EPA \u201cfinds that any person\nis in violation\u201d of certain portions of the Act, the agency\n\u201cshall issue an order requiring such person to comply\nwith [the Act], or . . . shall bring a civil action [to enforce\nthe Act].\u201d The Government argues that, because Congress\ngave the EPA the choice between a judicial proceeding and\nan administrative action, it would undermine the Act to\nallow judicial review of the latter. But that argument\nrests on the question-begging premise that the relevant\ndifference between a compliance order and an enforcement\nproceeding is that only the latter is subject to judicial\nreview. There are eminently sound reasons other than\ninsulation from judicial review why compliance orders\nare useful. The Government itself suggests that they\n\u201cprovid[e] a means of notifying recipients of potential vio\u00ad\nlations and quickly resolving the issues through volun-\ntary compliance.\u201d Brief for Respondents 39. It is entirely\nconsistent with this function to allow judicial review when\nthe recipient does not choose \u201cvoluntary compliance.\u201d The\nAct does not guarantee the EPA that issuing a compliance\norder will always be the most effective choice.\n   The Government also notes that compliance orders are\n8                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot self-executing, but must be enforced by the agency in\na plenary judicial action. It suggests that Congress there\u00ad\nfore viewed a compliance order \u201cas a step in the delibera\u00ad\ntive process[,] . . . rather than as a coercive sanction that\nitself must be subject to judicial review.\u201d Id., at 38. But\nthe APA provides for judicial review of all final agency\nactions, not just those that impose a self-executing sanc\u00ad\ntion. And it is hard for the Government to defend its claim\nthat the issuance of the compliance order was just \u201ca step\nin the deliberative process\u201d when the agency rejected the\nSacketts\u2019 attempt to obtain a hearing and when the next\nstep will either be taken by the Sacketts (if they comply\nwith the order) or will involve judicial, not administrative,\ndeliberation (if the EPA brings an enforcement action). As\nthe text (and indeed the very name) of the compliance\norder makes clear, the EPA\u2019s \u201cdeliberation\u201d over whether\nthe Sacketts are in violation of the Act is at an end; the\nagency may still have to deliberate over whether it is\nconfident enough about this conclusion to initiate litiga\u00ad\ntion, but that is a separate subject.\n   The Government further urges us to consider that Con\u00ad\ngress expressly provided for prompt judicial review, on the\nadministrative record, when the EPA assesses administra\u00ad\ntive penalties after a hearing, see \u00a71319(g)(8), but did not\nexpressly provide for review of compliance orders. But if\nthe express provision of judicial review in one section of\na long and complicated statute were alone enough to over-\ncome the APA\u2019s presumption of reviewability for all final\nagency action, it would not be much of a presumption at\nall.\n   The cases on which the Government relies simply are\nnot analogous. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,\nsupra, we held that the Agricultural Marketing Agree\u00ad\nment Act of 1937, which expressly allowed milk handlers\nto obtain judicial review of milk market orders, precluded\nreview of milk market orders in suits brought by milk\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconsumers. 467 U. S., at 345\u2013348. Where a statute pro\u00ad\nvides that particular agency action is reviewable at the\ninstance of one party, who must first exhaust administra\u00ad\ntive remedies, the inference that it is not reviewable at the\ninstance of other parties, who are not subject to the admin\u00ad\nistrative process, is strong. In United States v. Erika, Inc.,\n456 U. S. 201 (1982), we held that the Medicare statute,\nwhich expressly provided for judicial review of awards\nunder Part A, precluded review of awards under Part B.\nId., at 206\u2013208. The strong parallel between the award\nprovisions in Part A and Part B of the Medicare statute\ndoes not exist between the issuance of a compliance order\nand the assessment of administrative penalties under the\nClean Water Act. And in United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439 (1988), we held that the Civil Service Reform\nAct, which expressly excluded certain \u201cnonpreference\u201d\nemployees from the statute\u2019s review scheme, precluded\nreview at the instance of those employees in a separate\nClaims Court action. Id., at 448\u2013449. Here, there is no\nsuggestion that Congress has sought to exclude compli\u00ad\nance-order recipients from the Act\u2019s review scheme; quite\nto the contrary, the Government\u2019s case is premised on the\nnotion that the Act\u2019s primary review mechanisms are open\nto the Sacketts.\n   Finally, the Government notes that Congress passed the\nClean Water Act in large part to respond to the inefficien\u00ad\ncy of then-existing remedies for water pollution. Compli\u00ad\nance orders, as noted above, can obtain quick remediation\nthrough voluntary compliance. The Government warns\nthat the EPA is less likely to use the orders if they are\nsubject to judicial review. That may be true\u2014but it will be\ntrue for all agency actions subjected to judicial review.\nThe APA\u2019s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation\nof the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all.\nAnd there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act\nwas uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of\n10                    SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregulated parties into \u201cvoluntary compliance\u201d without the\nopportunity for judicial review\u2014even judicial review of the\nquestion whether the regulated party is within the EPA\u2019s\njurisdiction. Compliance orders will remain an effective\nmeans of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those\nmany cases where there is no substantial basis to question\ntheir validity.\n                        *    *    *\n   We conclude that the compliance order in this case is\nfinal agency action for which there is no adequate remedy\nother than APA review, and that the Clean Water Act does\nnot preclude that review. We therefore reverse the judg\u00ad\nment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

The EPA\nmay issue a compliance order demanding that the own-\ners cease construction, engage in expensive remedial\nmeasures, and abandon any use of the property. If the\nowners do not do the EPA\u2019s bidding, they may be fined up\nto $75,000 per day ($37,500 for violating the Act and\nanother $37,500 for violating the compliance order). And\nif the owners want their day in court to show that their lot\ndoes not include covered wetlands, well, as a practical\nmatter, that is just too bad. Until the EPA sues them,\nthey are blocked from access to the courts, and the EPA\nmay wait as long as it wants before deciding to sue. By\nthat time, the potential fines may easily have reached the\n2                     SACKETT v. EPA\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nmillions. In a nation that values due process, not to men-\ntion private property, such treatment is unthinkable.\n   The Court\u2019s decision provides a modest measure of re-\nlief. At least, property owners like petitioners will have\nthe right to challenge the EPA\u2019s jurisdictional determina-\ntion under the Administrative Procedure Act. But the\ncombination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act\nand the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of viola-\ntions alleged in this case still leaves most property owners\nwith little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA\u2019s\ntune.\n   Real relief requires Congress to do what it should have\ndone in the first place: provide a reasonably clear rule re-\ngarding the reach of the Clean Water Act. When Con-\ngress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it provided\nthat the Act covers \u201cthe waters of the United States.\u201d 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71362(7). But Congress did not define what it\nmeant by \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d; the phrase\nwas not a term of art with a known meaning; and the\nwords themselves are hopelessly indeterminate. Unsur-\nprisingly, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers in-\nterpreted the phrase as an essentially limitless grant of\nauthority. We rejected that boundless view, see Rapanos\nv. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 732\u2013739 (2006) (plurality\nopinion); Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167\u2013174 (2001),\nbut the precise reach of the Act remains unclear. For 40\nyears, Congress has done nothing to resolve this critical\nambiguity, and the EPA has not seen fit to promulgate a\nrule providing a clear and sufficiently limited definition of\nthe phrase. Instead, the agency has relied on informal\nguidance. But far from providing clarity and predictabil-\nity, the agency\u2019s latest informal guidance advises property\nowners that many jurisdictional determinations concern-\ning wetlands can only be made on a case-by-case basis by\nEPA field staff.
