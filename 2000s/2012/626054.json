Argued November 29, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012\nUnder \u00a716(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or\n security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who\n realize profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of\n the corporation\u2019s securities within any 6-month period. The Act pro-\n vides that such suits must be brought within \u201ctwo years after the\n date such profit was realized.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778p(b).\n    In 2007, respondent Simmonds filed numerous \u00a716(b) actions,\n claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the\n late 1990\u2019s and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks\u2019 af-\n termarket prices, allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sales.\n She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with \u00a716(a)\u2019s\n requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership in-\n terests. That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled \u00a716(b)\u2019s 2-year\n time period. The District Court dismissed the complaints as untime-\n ly. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing its decision in Whittaker v.\n Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516, it held that the limitations period is\n tolled until an insider files the \u00a716(a) disclosure statement \u201cregard-\n less of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the con-\n duct at issue.\u201d\nHeld: Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a ques-\n tion on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in\n determining that it is tolled until a \u00a716(a) statement is filed. The\n text of \u00a716(b)\u2014which starts the clock from \u201cthe date such profit was\n realized,\u201d \u00a778p(b)\u2014simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The\n rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling\n for fraudulent concealment. Under long-settled equitable-tolling\n principles, a litigant must establish \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing\n2       CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances\n    stood in his way.\u201d Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Tolling\n    therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should\n    have been, discovered by the plaintiff. Allowing tolling to continue\n    beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the\n    general purpose of statutes of limitations: \u201cto protect defendants\n    against stale or unduly delayed claims.\u201d John R. Sand & Gravel Co.\n    v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133. The Whittaker rule\u2019s inequity is\n    especially apparent here, where the theory of \u00a716(b) liability is so\n    novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware\n    they had to file a \u00a716(a) statement. Under the Whittaker rule, al-\n    leged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled ei-\n    ther to file or to face the prospect of \u00a716(b) litigation in perpetuity.\n    Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it\n    would have said so. Simmonds\u2019 arguments to the contrary are un-\n    persuasive. The lower courts should consider in the first instance\n    how usual equitable tolling rules apply in this case.

S. C. \u00a778p(b), begins to run\nonly upon the insider\u2019s filing of the disclosure statement\nrequired by \u00a716(a) of the Act, \u00a778p(a).\n                               I\n   Under \u00a716(b) of the Exchange Act, 48 Stat. 896, as\namended, a corporation or security holder of that corpora-\ntion may bring suit against the officers, directors, and\ncertain beneficial owners1 of the corporation who realize\nany profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and pur-\nchase, of the corporation\u2019s securities within any 6-month\nperiod. \u201cThe statute imposes a form of strict liability\u201d and\nrequires insiders to disgorge these \u201cshort-swing\u201d profits\n\u201ceven if they did not trade on inside information or in-\ntend to profit on the basis of such information.\u201d Gollust v.\nMendell, 501 U.

C. \u00a778p(b).\n   In 2007, respondent Vanessa Simmonds filed 55 nearly\nidentical actions under \u00a716(b) against financial institu-\ntions that had underwritten various initial public offerings\n(IPOs) in the late 1990\u2019s and 2000, including these peti-\ntioners.3 In a representative complaint, she alleged that\nthe underwriters and the issuers\u2019 insiders employed vari-\nous mechanisms to inflate the aftermarket price of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Section\n            16(b) provides in full:\n  \u201cFor the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which\nmay have been obtained by such beneficial owner, director, or officer by\nreason of his relationship to the issuer, any profit realized by him from\nany purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security\nof such issuer (other than an exempted security) or a security-based\nswap agreement (as defined in section 206B of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct) involving any such equity security within any period of less than\nsix months, unless such security or security-based swap agreement was\nacquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted,\nshall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any in-\ntention on the part of such beneficial owner, director, or officer in en-\ntering into such transaction of holding the security or security-based\nswap agreement purchased or of not repurchasing the security or\nsecurity-based swap agreement sold for a period exceeding six months.\nSuit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any\nsecurity of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the\nissuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after\nrequest or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no\nsuch suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such\nprofit was realized. This subsection shall not be construed to cover any\ntransaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time\nof the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security or\nsecurity-based swap agreement (as defined in section 206B of the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act) involved, or any transaction or transactions\nwhich the [Securities and Exchange] Commission by rules and regu-\nlations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this\nsubsection.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778p(b).\n  3 Simmonds also named the issuing companies as nominal defend-\n\nants. In re: Section 16(b) Litigation, 602 F.

She further\nalleged that, as a group, the underwriters and the insiders\nowned in excess of 10% of the outstanding stock during\nthe relevant time period, which subjected them to both\ndisgorgement of profits under \u00a716(b) and the reporting\nrequirements of \u00a716(a). Id., at 61. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778m(d)(3); 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7240.13d\u20135(b)(1) and 240.16a\u20131(a)(1)\n(2011). The latter requires insiders to disclose any changes\nto their ownership interests on a document known as a\nForm 4, specified in the Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion regulations.     15 U. S. C. \u00a778p(a)(2)(C); 17 CFR\n\u00a7240.16a\u20133(a). Simmonds alleged that the underwriters\nfailed to comply with that requirement, thereby tolling\n\u00a716(b)\u2019s 2-year time period.4 App. 62.\n  Simmonds\u2019 lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial pur-\nposes, and the United States District Court for the West-\nern District of Washington dismissed all of her com-\nplaints.5 In re: Section 16(b) Litigation, 602 F. Supp. 2d\n1202 (2009). As relevant here, the court granted petition-\ners\u2019 motion to dismiss 24 complaints on the ground that\n\u00a716(b)\u2019s 2-year time period had expired long before Sim-\nmonds filed the suits. The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part. 638 F. 3d\n1072 (2011). Citing its decision in Whittaker v. Whittaker\nCorp., 639 F. 2d 516 (1981), the court held that \u00a716(b)\u2019s\nlimitations period is \u201ctolled until the insider discloses\nhis transactions in a Section 16(a) filing, regardless of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Petitioners have consistently disputed \u00a716\u2019s application to them,\narguing that they, as underwriters, are generally exempt from the\nstatute\u2019s coverage. See 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7240.16a\u20137(a) and 240.16a\u201310.\nSimmonds contends that this exemption does not apply where the\nunderwriters do not act in good faith. Brief for Respondent 49. See\n\u00a7240.16a\u20137(a). We express no view on this issue.\n  5 Simmonds voluntarily dismissed one of the complaints.         602\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1206, n. 4.\n4    CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the con-\nduct at issue.\u201d 638 F. 3d, at 1095. Judge Milan Smith, Jr.,\nthe author of the panel opinion, also specially concurred,\nexpressing his disagreement with the Whittaker rule, but\nnoting that the court was compelled to follow Circuit\nprecedent. Id., at 1099\u20131101. We granted certiorari, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011).\n                                II\n   Petitioners maintain that these suits were properly\ndismissed because they were filed more than two years af-\nter the alleged profits were realized. Pointing to dictum\nin Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson,\n501 U. S. 350 (1991), petitioners argue that \u00a716(b)\u2019s limi-\ntations period is a period of repose, which is not to be\n\u201cextended to account for a plaintiff \u2019s discovery of the facts\nunderlying a claim.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17. See Lampf,\nsupra, at 360, n. 5 (\u201cSection 16(b) . . . sets a 2-year . . .\nperiod of repose\u201d). We do not reach that contention, be-\ncause we conclude that, even assuming that the 2-year\nperiod can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in de-\ntermining that it is tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a)\nstatement.\n   In adopting its rule in Whittaker, the Ninth Circuit ex-\npressed its concern that \u201c[i]t would be a simple matter\nfor the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section\n16(b) . . . simply by failing to file . . . reports in violation of\nsubdivision (a) and thereby concealing from prospective\nplaintiffs the information they would need\u201d to bring a\n\u00a716(b) action. 639 F. 2d, at 528 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Assuming that is correct, it does not follow that\nthe limitations period is tolled until the \u00a716(a) statement\nis filed. Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the\nperiod in that manner. The 2-year clock starts from \u201cthe\ndate such profit was realized.\u201d \u00a778p(b). Congress could\nhave very easily provided that \u201cno such suit shall be\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought more than two years after the filing of a statement\nunder subsection (a)(2)(C).\u201d But it did not. The text of \u00a716\nsimply does not support the Whittaker rule.\n   The Whittaker court suggested that the background rule\nof equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment6 operates\nto toll the limitations period until the \u00a716(a) statement is\nfiled. See 639 F. 2d, at 527, and n. 9. Even accepting that\nequitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered\nby the failure to file a \u00a716(a) statement, the Whittaker rule\nis completely divorced from long-settled equitable-tolling\nprinciples. \u201cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling\nbears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he\nhas been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some\nextraordinary circumstances stood in his way.\u201d Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005) (emphasis added).\nIt is well established, moreover, that when a limitations\nperiod is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts,\nthe tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have\nbeen, discovered by the plaintiff. 2 C. Corman, Limitation\nof Actions \u00a79.7.1, pp. 55\u201357 (1991). Thus, we have ex-\nplained that the statute does not begin to run until discov-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Relying on our decision in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah,\n\n414 U. S. 538 (1974), Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule is\nbest understood as applying legal\u2014rather than equitable\u2014tolling. In\nAmerican Pipe, we held that \u201ccommencement of a class action suspends\nthe applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the\nclass who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to\ncontinue as a class action.\u201d 414 U. S., at 554. We based our conclusion\non \u201cthe efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose\nof [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23 class actions].\u201d Id., at 553. Although we did\nnot employ the term \u201clegal tolling,\u201d some federal courts have used that\nterm to describe our holding on the ground that the rule \u201cis derived\nfrom a statutory source,\u201d whereas equitable tolling is \u201cjudicially creat-\ned.\u201d Arivella v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 2d 164, 176\n(Mass. 2009). The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter.\nAs we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles\nnor the \u201cstatutory source\u201d of \u00a716 supports the conclusion that the\nlimitations period is tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a) statement.\n6    CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nery of the fraud \u201c \u2018where the party injured by the fraud\nremains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of\ndiligence or care on his part.\u2019 \u201d Lampf, supra, at 363 (quot-\ning Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875); emphasis\nadded). Allowing tolling to continue beyond the point at\nwhich a \u00a716(b) plaintiff is aware, or should have been\naware, of the facts underlying the claim would quite cer-\ntainly be inequitable and inconsistent with the general\npurpose of statutes of limitations: \u201cto protect defendants\nagainst stale or unduly delayed claims.\u201d John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133 (2008).\n   The inequity of the Whittaker rule is especially apparent\nin a case such as this, where the theory of \u00a716(b) liability\nof underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly\nclaim that they were not aware they were required to file a\n\u00a716(a) statement. And where they disclaim the necessity\nof filing, the Whittaker rule compels them either to file or\nto face the prospect of \u00a716(b) litigation in perpetuity.\nSimmonds has acknowledged that \u201cunder her theory she\ncould buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago\nand bring claims for short-swing transactions if the un-\nderwriters had undervalued a stock.\u201d 602 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1218. The potential for such endless tolling in cases in\nwhich a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the\nfacts underlying the action is out of step with the purpose\nof limitations periods in general. And it is especially at\nodds with a provision that imposes strict liability on puta-\ntive insiders, see Gollust, 501 U. S., at 122. Had Congress\nintended this result, it most certainly would have said so.\n   Simmonds maintains that failing to apply the Whittaker\nrule would obstruct Congress\u2019s objective of curbing short-\nswing speculation by corporate insiders. This objective,\naccording to Simmonds, is served by \u00a716(a) statements,\nwhich \u201cprovide the information necessary to trigger \u00a716(b)\nenforcement.\u201d Brief for Respondent 24. Simmonds\u2014like\nthe Ninth Circuit in Whittaker\u2014disregards the most\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nglaring indication that Congress did not intend that the\nlimitations period be categorically tolled until the state-\nment is filed: The limitations provision does not say so.\nThis fact alone is reason enough to reject a departure from\nsettled equitable-tolling principles. Moreover, \u00a716\u2019s pur-\npose is fully served by the rules outlined above, under\nwhich the limitations period would not expire until two\nyears after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nlearned the facts underlying a \u00a716(b) action. The usual\nequitable-tolling inquiry will thus take account of the\nunavailability of sources of information other than the\n\u00a716(a) filing. Cf., e.g., Ruth v. Unifund CCR Partners, 604\nF. 3d 908, 911\u2013913 (CA6 2010); Santos ex rel. Beato v.\nUnited States, 559 F. 3d 189, 202\u2013203 (CA3 2009). The\noddity of Simmonds\u2019 position is well demonstrated by\nthe circumstances of this case. Under the Whittaker rule,\nbecause petitioners have yet to file \u00a716(a) statements (as\nnoted earlier they do not think themselves subject to that\nrequirement), Simmonds still has two years to bring suit,\neven though she is so well aware of her alleged cause of\naction that she has already sued. If \u00a716(a) statements\nwere, as Simmonds suggests, indispensable to a party\u2019s\nability to sue, Simmonds would not be here.\n   Simmonds also asserts that application of established\nequitable-tolling doctrine in this context would be in-\nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intention to establish in \u00a716\na clear rule that is capable of \u201cmechanical application.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 57 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Equitable tolling, after all, involves fact-intensive\ndisputes \u201cabout what the notice was, where it was dissem-\ninated, who received it, when it was received, and whether\nit provides sufficient notice of relevant Section 16(a) facts.\u201d\nId, at 56\u201357. Of course this argument counsels just as\nmuch in favor of the \u201cstatute of repose\u201d rule that petition-\ners urge (that is, no tolling whatever) as it does in favor of\nthe Whittaker rule.

And assuming some form of\ntolling does apply, it is preferable to apply that form which\nCongress was certainly aware of, as opposed to the rule\nthe Ninth Circuit has fashioned.7 See Meyer v. Holley, 537\nU. S. 280, 286 (2003) (\u201cCongress\u2019 silence, while permitting\nan inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary\nbackground tort principles, cannot show that it intended\nto apply an unusual modification of those rules\u201d).\n                          *     *    *\n  Having determined that \u00a716(b)\u2019s limitations period is\nnot tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a) statement, we remand\nfor the lower courts to consider how the usual rules of\nequitable tolling apply to the facts of this case.8 We are\ndivided 4 to 4 concerning, and thus affirm without prece-\ndential effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of petitioners\u2019\ncontention that \u00a716(b) establishes a period of repose that\nis not subject to tolling. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 It is for this reason that we also reject the Second Circuit\u2019s rule that\n\nthe 2-year period is tolled until the plaintiff \u201cgets actual notice that a\nperson subject to Section 16(a) has realized specific short-swing profits\nthat are worth pursuing,\u201d Litzler v.

Argued November 29, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012\nUnder \u00a716(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a corporation or\n security holder of that corporation may sue corporate insiders who\n realize profits from the purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of\n the corporation\u2019s securities within any 6-month period. The Act pro-\n vides that such suits must be brought within \u201ctwo years after the\n date such profit was realized.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778p(b).\n    In 2007, respondent Simmonds filed numerous \u00a716(b) actions,\n claiming that, in underwriting various initial public offerings in the\n late 1990\u2019s and 2000, petitioners and others inflated the stocks\u2019 af-\n termarket prices, allowing them to profit from the aftermarket sales.\n She also claimed that petitioners had failed to comply with \u00a716(a)\u2019s\n requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership in-\n terests. That failure, according to Simmonds, tolled \u00a716(b)\u2019s 2-year\n time period. The District Court dismissed the complaints as untime-\n ly. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing its decision in Whittaker v.\n Whittaker Corp., 639 F. 2d 516, it held that the limitations period is\n tolled until an insider files the \u00a716(a) disclosure statement \u201cregard-\n less of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the con-\n duct at issue.\u201d\nHeld: Even assuming that the 2-year period can be extended (a ques-\n tion on which the Court is equally divided), the Ninth Circuit erred in\n determining that it is tolled until a \u00a716(a) statement is filed. The\n text of \u00a716(b)\u2014which starts the clock from \u201cthe date such profit was\n realized,\u201d \u00a778p(b)\u2014simply does not support the Whittaker rule. The\n rule is also not supported by the background rule of equitable tolling\n for fraudulent concealment. Under long-settled equitable-tolling\n principles, a litigant must establish \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing\n2       CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstances\n    stood in his way.\u201d Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Tolling\n    therefore ceases when fraudulently concealed facts are, or should\n    have been, discovered by the plaintiff. Allowing tolling to continue\n    beyond that point would be inequitable and inconsistent with the\n    general purpose of statutes of limitations: \u201cto protect defendants\n    against stale or unduly delayed claims.\u201d John R. Sand & Gravel Co.\n    v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133. The Whittaker rule\u2019s inequity is\n    especially apparent here, where the theory of \u00a716(b) liability is so\n    novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware\n    they had to file a \u00a716(a) statement. Under the Whittaker rule, al-\n    leged insiders who disclaim the necessity of filing are compelled ei-\n    ther to file or to face the prospect of \u00a716(b) litigation in perpetuity.\n    Had Congress intended the possibility of such endless tolling, it\n    would have said so.

Pointing to dictum\nin Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson,\n501 U. S. 350 (1991), petitioners argue that \u00a716(b)\u2019s limi-\ntations period is a period of repose, which is not to be\n\u201cextended to account for a plaintiff \u2019s discovery of the facts\nunderlying a claim.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 17. See Lampf,\nsupra, at 360, n. 5 (\u201cSection 16(b) . . . sets a 2-year . . .\nperiod of repose\u201d). We do not reach that contention, be-\ncause we conclude that, even assuming that the 2-year\nperiod can be extended, the Ninth Circuit erred in de-\ntermining that it is tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a)\nstatement.\n   In adopting its rule in Whittaker, the Ninth Circuit ex-\npressed its concern that \u201c[i]t would be a simple matter\nfor the unscrupulous to avoid the salutary effect of Section\n16(b) . . . simply by failing to file . . . reports in violation of\nsubdivision (a) and thereby concealing from prospective\nplaintiffs the information they would need\u201d to bring a\n\u00a716(b) action. 639 F. 2d, at 528 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Assuming that is correct, it does not follow that\nthe limitations period is tolled until the \u00a716(a) statement\nis filed. Section 16 itself quite clearly does not extend the\nperiod in that manner. The 2-year clock starts from \u201cthe\ndate such profit was realized.\u201d \u00a778p(b). Congress could\nhave very easily provided that \u201cno such suit shall be\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The text of \u00a716\nsimply does not support the Whittaker rule.\n   The Whittaker court suggested that the background rule\nof equitable tolling for fraudulent concealment6 operates\nto toll the limitations period until the \u00a716(a) statement is\nfiled. See 639 F. 2d, at 527, and n. 9. Even accepting that\nequitable tolling for fraudulent concealment is triggered\nby the failure to file a \u00a716(a) statement, the Whittaker rule\nis completely divorced from long-settled equitable-tolling\nprinciples. \u201cGenerally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling\nbears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he\nhas been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some\nextraordinary circumstances stood in his way.\u201d Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005) (emphasis added).\nIt is well established, moreover, that when a limitations\nperiod is tolled because of fraudulent concealment of facts,\nthe tolling ceases when those facts are, or should have\nbeen, discovered by the plaintiff. 2 C. Corman, Limitation\nof Actions \u00a79.7.1, pp. 55\u201357 (1991).

S. 538 (1974), Simmonds argues that the Whittaker rule is\nbest understood as applying legal\u2014rather than equitable\u2014tolling. In\nAmerican Pipe, we held that \u201ccommencement of a class action suspends\nthe applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the\nclass who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to\ncontinue as a class action.\u201d 414 U.

Although we did\nnot employ the term \u201clegal tolling,\u201d some federal courts have used that\nterm to describe our holding on the ground that the rule \u201cis derived\nfrom a statutory source,\u201d whereas equitable tolling is \u201cjudicially creat-\ned.\u201d Arivella v.

The label attached to the Whittaker rule does not matter.\nAs we proceed to explain, neither general equitable-tolling principles\nnor the \u201cstatutory source\u201d of \u00a716 supports the conclusion that the\nlimitations period is tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a) statement.\n6    CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v.

Allowing tolling to continue beyond the point at\nwhich a \u00a716(b) plaintiff is aware, or should have been\naware, of the facts underlying the claim would quite cer-\ntainly be inequitable and inconsistent with the general\npurpose of statutes of limitations: \u201cto protect defendants\nagainst stale or unduly delayed claims.\u201d John R.

S. 130, 133 (2008).\n   The inequity of the Whittaker rule is especially apparent\nin a case such as this, where the theory of \u00a716(b) liability\nof underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly\nclaim that they were not aware they were required to file a\n\u00a716(a) statement. And where they disclaim the necessity\nof filing, the Whittaker rule compels them either to file or\nto face the prospect of \u00a716(b) litigation in perpetuity.\nSimmonds has acknowledged that \u201cunder her theory she\ncould buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago\nand bring claims for short-swing transactions if the un-\nderwriters had undervalued a stock.\u201d 602 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1218. The potential for such endless tolling in cases in\nwhich a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the\nfacts underlying the action is out of step with the purpose\nof limitations periods in general. And it is especially at\nodds with a provision that imposes strict liability on puta-\ntive insiders, see Gollust, 501 U. S., at 122. Had Congress\nintended this result, it most certainly would have said so.\n   Simmonds maintains that failing to apply the Whittaker\nrule would obstruct Congress\u2019s objective of curbing short-\nswing speculation by corporate insiders.

S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nglaring indication that Congress did not intend that the\nlimitations period be categorically tolled until the state-\nment is filed: The limitations provision does not say so.\nThis fact alone is reason enough to reject a departure from\nsettled equitable-tolling principles. Moreover, \u00a716\u2019s pur-\npose is fully served by the rules outlined above, under\nwhich the limitations period would not expire until two\nyears after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nlearned the facts underlying a \u00a716(b) action. The usual\nequitable-tolling inquiry will thus take account of the\nunavailability of sources of information other than the\n\u00a716(a) filing. Cf., e.g., Ruth v. Unifund CCR Partners, 604\nF. 3d 908, 911\u2013913 (CA6 2010); Santos ex rel. Beato v.\nUnited States, 559 F. 3d 189, 202\u2013203 (CA3 2009). The\noddity of Simmonds\u2019 position is well demonstrated by\nthe circumstances of this case. Under the Whittaker rule,\nbecause petitioners have yet to file \u00a716(a) statements (as\nnoted earlier they do not think themselves subject to that\nrequirement), Simmonds still has two years to bring suit,\neven though she is so well aware of her alleged cause of\naction that she has already sued. If \u00a716(a) statements\nwere, as Simmonds suggests, indispensable to a party\u2019s\nability to sue, Simmonds would not be here.\n   Simmonds also asserts that application of established\nequitable-tolling doctrine in this context would be in-\nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intention to establish in \u00a716\na clear rule that is capable of \u201cmechanical application.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 57 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). Equitable tolling, after all, involves fact-intensive\ndisputes \u201cabout what the notice was, where it was dissem-\ninated, who received it, when it was received, and whether\nit provides sufficient notice of relevant Section 16(a) facts.\u201d\nId, at 56\u201357. Of course this argument counsels just as\nmuch in favor of the \u201cstatute of repose\u201d rule that petition-\ners urge (that is, no tolling whatever) as it does in favor of\nthe Whittaker rule. No tolling is certainly an easily ad-\n8     CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC v. SIMMONDS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nministrable bright-line rule. And assuming some form of\ntolling does apply, it is preferable to apply that form which\nCongress was certainly aware of, as opposed to the rule\nthe Ninth Circuit has fashioned.7 See Meyer v. Holley, 537\nU. S. 280, 286 (2003) (\u201cCongress\u2019 silence, while permitting\nan inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary\nbackground tort principles, cannot show that it intended\nto apply an unusual modification of those rules\u201d).\n                          *     *    *\n  Having determined that \u00a716(b)\u2019s limitations period is\nnot tolled until the filing of a \u00a716(a) statement, we remand\nfor the lower courts to consider how the usual rules of\nequitable tolling apply to the facts of this case.8 We are\ndivided 4 to 4 concerning, and thus affirm without prece-\ndential effect, the Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of petitioners\u2019\ncontention that \u00a716(b) establishes a period of repose that\nis not subject to tolling. The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 It is for this reason that we also reject the Second Circuit\u2019s rule that\n\nthe 2-year period is tolled until the plaintiff \u201cgets actual notice that a\nperson subject to Section 16(a) has realized specific short-swing profits\nthat are worth pursuing,\u201d Litzler v. CC Investments, L. D. C., 362 F. 3d\n203, 208 (2004). As that court itself recognized, this actual-notice rule\ndeparts from usual equitable-tolling principles. See id., at 207.\n  8 The District Court said that \u201cthere is no dispute that all of the facts\n\ngiving rise to Ms. Simmonds\u2019 complaints against [petitioners] were\nknown to the shareholders of the Issuer Defendants for at least five\nyears before these cases were filed,\u201d 602 F. Supp. 2d, at 1217. The\nCourt of Appeals did not consider the accuracy of that statement, which\nSimmonds disputes, Brief for Respondent 12, since it concluded the\nperiod is tolled until a \u00a716(a) statement is filed.\n</pre>",
