UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 10–7387. Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012\nWhen petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges,\n the State also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then\n serving for another drug offense. At about the same time, Setser\n pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. The Federal District Court\n imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sen-\n tence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any\n state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. While Setser’s fed-\n eral appeal was pending, the state court sentenced him to 5 years for\n the probation violation and 10 years for the drug charge, but ordered\n the sentences to be served concurrently. The Fifth Circuit affirmed\n the federal sentence, holding that the District Court had authority to\n order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and\n that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if the state court’s deci-\n sion made it unclear exactly how to administer it.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had discretion to order that Setser’s federal\n sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the\n probation violation. Pp. 2–12.\n       (a) Judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting\n whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecu-\n tively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have\n been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings, see\n Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169. The statutory text and struc-\n ture do not foreclose a district court’s exercise of this discretion with\n respect to anticipated state sentences. The Sentencing Reform Act of\n 1984 addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the\n situation here, since the District Court did not impose “multiple\n terms of imprisonment . . . at the same time,” and Setser was not “al-\n2                      SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ready subject to” the state sentences at issue, 18 U. S. C. §3584(a).\n    This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the\n    District Court lacked authority to act as it did and that the Bureau of\n    Prisons is to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision after the\n    federal sentence has been imposed. Section 3621(b), from which the\n    Bureau claims to derive this authority, says nothing about concur-\n    rent or consecutive sentences. And it is more natural to read\n    §3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in sit-\n    uations not covered than it is to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau\n    what amounts to sentencing authority. Setser’s arguments to the\n    contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 2–8.\n          (b) None of the other objections raised by Setser and the Gov-\n    ernment requires a different result. Pp. 8–12.\n       2. The state court’s subsequent decision to make the state sentenc-\n    es run concurrently does not establish that the Federal District Court\n    imposed an unreasonable sentence. The difficulty here arises not\n    from the federal-court sentence—which is to run concurrently with\n    one state sentence and consecutively with another—but from the\n    state court’s decision. Deciding which of the District Court’s disposi-\n    tions should prevail under these circumstances is a problem, but it\n    does not show the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The rea-\n    sonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether\n    the district court abused its discretion, see Gall v. United States, 552\n    U. S. 38, 46, but Setser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s deci-\n    sionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing\n    that the court failed to consider. Where late-onset facts make it diffi-\n    cult, or even impossible, to implement the sentence, the Bureau of\n    Prisons may determine, in the first instance, how long the District\n    Court’s sentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement, sub-\n    ject to the potential for judicial review.

UNITED\n\n                  STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 28, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We consider whether a district court, in sentencing a de-\nfendant for a federal offense, has authority to order that\nthe federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state\nsentence that has not yet been imposed.\n                               I\n   When officers of the Lubbock Police Department ar-\nrested petitioner Monroe Setser for possessing metham-\nphetamine, he was already serving a 5-year term of proba-\ntion imposed by a Texas court for another drug offense.\nSetser was indicted in state court for possession with intent\nto deliver a controlled substance, and the State also moved\nto revoke his term of probation. As often happens in drug\ncases, the federal authorities also got involved. A federal\ngrand jury indicted Setser for possessing with intent to\ndistribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 21\nU. S. C. §841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii), and he pleaded guilty.\n   Before the federal sentencing hearing, a probation of-\nficer calculated the applicable Guidelines range to be 121\nto 151 months’ imprisonment. Citing precedent from\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,\n2                 SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 920 F. 2d 1212 (1991) (per curiam),\nhe indicated that the District Court had discretion to make\nSetser’s sentence either concurrent with or consecutive to\nany sentence anticipated in the separate state-court pro-\nceedings. Setser objected, arguing that the District Court\nlacked such authority. The court nevertheless made the\nsentence of 151 months that it imposed consecutive to any\nstate sentence imposed for probation violation, but concur-\nrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug\ncharge. Setser appealed.\n  While Setser’s appeal was pending, the state court\nsentenced him to a prison term of 5 years for probation\nviolation and 10 years on the new drug charge. It ordered\nthat these sentences be served concurrently. Setser then\nmade before the Court of Appeals, in addition to the ar-\ngument that the District Court had no authority to order a\nconsecutive sentence, the argument that his federal sen-\ntence was unreasonable because it was impossible to\nimplement in light of the concurrent state sentences.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 607\nF. 3d 128 (2010). Following its earlier Brown decision, the\ncourt held that the District Court did have authority to\norder a consecutive sentence. 607 F. 3d, at 131–132. It\nalso held that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if it\nwas “ ‘partially foiled’ ” by the state court’s decision. Id., at\n132–133. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and\nappointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in\nsupport of the judgment below, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   Before proceeding further, it is important to be clear\nabout what is at issue. Setser does not contend that his\nfederal sentence must run concurrently with both state\nsentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing.\nHe acknowledges that someone must answer “the consecu-\ntive versus concurrent question,” Brief for Petitioner 27,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand decide how the state and federal sentences will fit\ntogether. The issue here is who will make that decision,\nwhich in turn determines when that decision is made.\nOne possible answer, and the one the Fifth Circuit gave, is\nthat the decision belongs to the Federal District Court at\nthe federal sentencing hearing.\n   The concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision has been ad-\ndressed by §212(a) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n18 U. S. C. §3584, reproduced in full as Appendix A, infra.\nThe first subsection of that provision, which says when\nconcurrent and consecutive sentences may be imposed,\nand specifies which of those dispositions will be assumed\nin absence of indication by the sentencing judge, does not\ncover the situation here. It addresses only “multiple terms\nof imprisonment . . . imposed . . . at the same time” and “a\nterm of imprisonment . . . imposed on a defendant who is\nalready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”\n§3584(a). Here the state sentence is not imposed at the\nsame time as the federal sentence, and the defendant was\nnot already subject to that state sentence.\n   Setser, supported by the Government, argues that, be-\ncause §3584(a) does not cover this situation, the District\nCourt lacked authority to act as it did; and that the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision is therefore to be made\nby the Bureau of Prisons at any time after the federal sen-\ntence has been imposed. The Bureau of Prisons is said to\nderive this authority from 18 U. S. C. §3621(b) (2006 ed.\nand Supp. IV), reproduced in full as Appendix B, infra.\n   On its face, this provision says nothing about concurrent\nor consecutive sentences, but the Government explains its\nposition as follows: Section 3621(b) gives the Bureau the\nauthority to order that a prisoner serve his federal sen-\ntence in any suitable prison facility “whether maintained\nby the Federal Government or otherwise.” The Bureau\nmay therefore order that a prisoner serve his federal\nsentence in a state prison. Thus, when a person subject to\n4                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na federal sentence is serving a state sentence, the Bureau\nmay designate the state prison as the place of impris-\nonment for the federal sentence—effectively making the\ntwo sentences concurrent—or decline to do so—effec-\ntively making them consecutive.1 Based on §§3584(a)\nand 3621(b), Setser and the Government argue that the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, under the circum-\nstances presented here, is committed exclusively to the\nBureau of Prisons.\n   It is fundamental that we construe statutes governing\nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of “the\ncommon-law background against which the statutes . . .\nwere enacted,” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council\nof City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), and the\nsame approach is appropriate here, where the issue con-\ncerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the\nJudiciary. Judges have long been understood to have\ndiscretion to select whether the sentences they impose will\nrun concurrently or consecutively with respect to other\nsentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in\nother proceedings, including state proceedings. See Ore-\ngon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169 (2009). And a large\nmajority of the federal appellate courts addressing the\nquestion have recognized a similar authority in the con-\ntext here, where a federal judge anticipates a state sen-\ntence that has not yet been imposed. See Salley v. United\nStates, 786 F. 2d 546, 547 (CA2 1986); Anderson v. United\nStates, 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam); United\nStates ex rel. Lester v. Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41–42 (CA3\n1968) (per curiam); United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178,\n179–180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam); but see United States v.\n\n\n——————\n  1 The Bureau of Prisons sometimes makes this designation while the\n\nprisoner is in state custody and sometimes makes a nunc pro tunc\ndesignation once the prisoner enters federal custody.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nEastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985)2. We find\nnothing in the Sentencing Reform Act, or in any other\nprovision of law, to show that Congress foreclosed the\nexercise of district courts’ sentencing discretion in these\ncircumstances.\n   Setser’s main contention is that §3584(a) has this effect.\nBut that provision cannot sustain the weight that Setser\nasks it to bear. In essence, he reads the first sentence in\n§3584(a) to say that “terms [of imprisonment] may run\nconcurrently or consecutively” only “[i]f multiple terms of\nimprisonment are imposed . . . at the same time, or if a\nterm of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is\n——————\n  2 The  dissent is incorrect to say, post, at 7–8 (opinion of BREYER, J.),\nthat only the Second Circuit, in Salley held to that effect. So did the\nSeventh Circuit in Kanton and the Tenth Circuit in Anderson. The\ndissent says that Anderson addressed only the question “whether a\nfederal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of\nentry into federal custody,” post, at 7–8. That is true enough (and it is\ntrue of Kanton as well); but answering that question in a manner that\nupheld the consecutive federal sentence (i.e., it runs from the date of\nentry into federal custody) necessarily upheld the sentencing court’s\nauthority to impose the consecutive federal sentence. In fact, Ander-\nson confronted and specifically rejected the defendant’s argument that\n“ ‘[n]o court has the authority to impose a sentence consecutive to\nsomething that does not exist,’ ” 405 F. 2d, at 493. And, finally, so did\nthe Third Circuit in Lester. The dissent says that Lester addressed only\nthe question “whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for pur-\nposes of due process,” post, at 8. But that was the defendant’s princi-\npal reason (as it appears also to be the dissent’s principal reason) for\nasserting that the sentencing court had no authority to impose a\nconsecutive sentence. And the Third Circuit rejected not only that\nreason but “[o]ther arguments advanced by [the defendant] ” attacking\nthe consecutive sentence, 404 F. 2d, at 42.\n    The only contrary federal appellate decision rendered before the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act took effect relied upon 18 U. S. C. §4082 (1982 ed.)\n(the predecessor of §3621) and §3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed by 98 Stat.\n1987), which provided that a federal sentence “shall commence to run\nfrom the date on which such person is received” into federal custody.\nSee United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985).\n6                    SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nalready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”\nSince the District Court was not imposing the state sen-\ntence and since it was not already imposed, the sentence\ncould not be ordered to run consecutively. But if the text\nis exclusive—if the addition of only is correct—the provi-\nsion forbids not only the imposition of consecutive sen-\ntences, but the imposition of concurrent ones as well. And\nyet, as Setser acknowledges, it must be one or the other;\nsomeone must decide the issue.\n   Setser’s response is that, read in context, the sentence\nspeaks only to district courts. Under the circumstances at\nissue here, he says, the federal and state sentences still\nmight run either concurrently or consecutively, but just\nnot at the discretion of the District Court. That is an odd\nparsing of the text, which makes no distinction between\nthe district court and the Bureau of Prisons. The place-\nment of §3584 does indeed suggest that it is directed at\ndistrict courts—but that is likely because Congress con-\ntemplated that only district courts would have the author-\nity to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, not\nbecause Congress meant to leave the Bureau unfettered.\nIndeed, the Bureau already follows the other directives in\n§3584(a). See Brief for United States 35. For example, if\nthe district court imposes multiple terms of imprisonment\nat the same time, but fails to address the concurrent-vs.-\nconsecutive issue, the terms “run concurrently,” §3584(a),\nand the Bureau is not free to use its “place of imprison-\nment” authority to achieve a different result.3\n   The Latin maxim on which Setser relies—expressio\n——————\n  3 The Government contends that the Bureau applies the default rules\n\nin §3584(a) “[a]s a matter of discretion” but is not “ ‘bound’ ” by that\nsubsection. Reply Brief for United States 15, n. 5. We think it implau-\nsible that the effectiveness of those rules—of §3584(a)’s prescription, for\nexample, that “[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different\ntimes run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to\nrun concurrently”—depends upon the “discretion” of the Bureau.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunius est exclusio alterius—might have application here if\nthe provision in question were a conferral of authority on\ndistrict courts. Giving sentencing authority in only speci-\nfied circumstances could be said to imply that it is with-\nheld in other circumstances. Section 3584, however, is\nframed not as a conferral of authority but as a limitation\nof authority that already exists (and a specification of\nwhat will be assumed when the exercise of that authority\nis ambiguous). It reads not “District courts shall have\nauthority to impose multiple terms of imprisonment on a\ndefendant at the same time, etc.” but rather “If multiple\nterms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at\nthe same time, [etc.]”—quite clearly assuming that such au-\nthority already exists. The mere acknowledgment of the\nexistence of certain pre-existing authority (and regulation\nof that authority) in no way implies a repeal of other pre-\nexisting authority. And that is especially true when there\nis an obvious reason for selecting the instances of pre-\nexisting authority that are addressed—to wit, that they\nare the examples of sentencing discretion most frequently\nencountered.\n   Moreover, expressio unius est exclusio alterius is a\ndouble-edged sword. Setser thinks it suggests that, because\n§3584(a) recognizes judicial discretion in scenario A and\nscenario B, there is no such discretion in scenario C. But\nthe same maxim shows much more convincingly why\n§3621(b) cannot be read to give the Bureau of Prisons\nexclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed\nto the district court in §3584(a). When §3584(a) specific-\nally addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive\nsentences, and makes no mention of the Bureau’s role in\nthe process, the implication is that no such role exists.\nAnd that conclusion is reinforced by application of the\nsame maxim (properly, in this instance) to §3621(b)—\nwhich is a conferral of authority on the Bureau of Prisons,\nbut does not confer authority to choose between concur-\n8                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrent and consecutive sentences. Put to the choice, we\nbelieve it is much more natural to read §3584(a) as not\ncontaining an implied “only,” leaving room for the exercise\nof judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it\nis to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what\namounts to sentencing authority.\n                             III\n   None of the other objections to this approach raised by\nSetser and the Government require a different result.\n   Our decision today follows the interpretive rule they\ninvoke, that we must “give effect . . . to every clause and\nword” of the Act. United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S.\n528, 538–539 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe first sentence in §3584(a) addresses the most common\nsituations in which the decision between concurrent and\nconsecutive sentences must be made: where two sentences\nare imposed at the same time, and where a sentence is\nimposed subsequent to a prior sentence that has not yet\nbeen fully served. It says that the district court has dis-\ncretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or\nconsecutive, except that it may not make consecutive a\nsentence for “an attempt” and a sentence for an “offense\nthat was the sole objective of the attempt.” And the last\ntwo sentences of §3584(a) say what will be assumed in\nthose two common situations if the court does not specify\nthat the sentence is concurrent or consecutive. Giving\nthose dispositions full effect does not demand that we\nregard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other\nsituations.\n   Setser and the Government both suggest that, because\n§3584(b) directs courts to consider the sentencing factors\nin §3553(a) in making these decisions, and because some\nof those factors will be difficult to apply with respect to\nanticipated sentences, the Act cannot be read to allow\njudicial discretion in these circumstances. One cannot be\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsure that the sentence imposed is “sufficient, but not\ngreater than necessary,” §3553(a), the argument goes, if\none does not know how long it will actually be. But the\ndistrict judge faces the same uncertainty if the concurrent-\nvs.-consecutive decision is left for later resolution by the\nBureau of Prisons; he does not know, for example, whether\nthe 5-year sentence he imposes will be an actual five years\nor will be simply swallowed within another sentence. To\nbe sure, the Bureau of Prisons, if it waits to decide the\nmatter until after the state court has imposed its sentence,\nwill know for sure what sentences it is dealing with. But\nthe Bureau is not charged with applying §3553(a). The\nfactors that guide the agency’s “place of imprisonment”\ndecision do include “the nature and circumstances of the\noffense” and “the history and characteristics of the pris-\noner,” §3621(b)(2), (b)(3) (2006 ed.)—factors that are, to be\nsure, relevant to sentencing but also relevant to selection\nof the place of confinement; but they also include factors\nthat make little, if any, sense in the sentencing context,\nsuch as “the resources of the facility contemplated” and\nwhether the state facility “meets minimum standards of\nhealth and habitability,” §3621(b), (b)(1). (These factors\nconfirm our view that §3621 is not a sentencing provision\nbut a place-of-confinement provision.) It is much more\nnatural for a judge to apply the §3553(a) factors in making\nall concurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, than it is for some\nsuch decisions to be made by a judge applying §3553(a)\nfactors and others by the Bureau of Prisons applying\n§3621(b) factors.\n  The final objection is that principles of federalism and\ngood policy do not allow a district court to make the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision when it does not have\nbefore it all of the information about the anticipated state\nsentence. As for principles of federalism, it seems to us\nthey cut in precisely the opposite direction. In our Ameri-\ncan system of dual sovereignty, each sovereign—whether\n10                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Federal Government or a State—is responsible for “the\nadministration of [its own] criminal justice syste[m].” Ice,\n555 U. S., at 170. If a prisoner like Setser starts in state\ncustody, serves his state sentence, and then moves to\nfederal custody, it will always be the Federal Govern-\nment—whether the district court or the Bureau of Pris-\nons—that decides whether he will receive credit for the\ntime served in state custody. And if he serves his federal\nsentence first, the State will decide whether to give him\ncredit against his state sentences without being bound by\nwhat the district court or the Bureau said on the matter.\nGiven this framework, it is always more respectful of the\nState’s sovereignty for the district court to make its deci-\nsion up front rather than for the Bureau of Prisons to\nmake the decision after the state court has acted. That\nway, the state court has all of the information before it\nwhen it acts.4 The Government’s position does not pro-\nmote the States’ interest—just the interests of the Bureau\nof Prisons.\n   As for good policy: The basic claim of Setser, the Gov-\nernment, and the dissent is that when it comes to sentenc-\ning, later is always better because the decisionmaker has\nmore information. See, e.g., post, at 7 (“[A] sentencing\njudge typically needs detailed information when construct-\ning a multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline\nsentence”). That is undoubtedly true, but when that\ndesideratum is applied to the statutory structure before us\n——————\n  4 Setser notes that the text of §3584(a) does not distinguish between\n\nstate and federal sentences. If a district court can enter a consecutive\nsentencing order in advance of an anticipated state sentence, he asks,\nwhat is to stop it from issuing such an order in advance of an antici-\npated federal sentence? It could be argued that §3584(a) impliedly\nprohibits such an order because it gives that decision to the federal\ncourt that sentences the defendant when the other sentence is “already”\nimposed—and does not speak (of course) to what a state court must do\nwhen a sentence has already been imposed. It suffices to say, however,\nthat this question is not before us.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

Section\n3582(c)(1)(A) provides that a district court,\n     “upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,\n     may reduce the term of imprisonment . . . after con-\n——————\n   5 To support its view that Congress authorized the Bureau to make\n\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, the dissent relies on the fact that\nthe Executive long had what is effectively sentencing authority in its\nability to grant or deny parole. That is a particularly curious power for\nthe dissent to rely upon, inasmuch as most of the dissent discusses (in\ngreat detail) the Sentencing Reform Act, whose principal objective was\nto eliminate the Executive’s parole power. Curiouser still is the dissent’s\ninvocation of the Guidelines system, which “tell[s] the sentencing judge\nhow, through the use of partially concurrent and partially consecutive\nsentences, to build a total sentence that meets the Guidelines’ require-\nments.” Post, at 4. These “instructions,” ibid., do not cover yet-to-be-\nimposed sentences, the dissent says, because “the sentencing judge\nnormally does not yet know enough about the behavior that underlies\n(or will underlie)” such a sentence. Post, at 5. That explains, perhaps,\nwhy the Guidelines’ “instructions” to judges do not cover them. But\nwhy do not the Guidelines “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons how to\nconduct its concurrent/consecutive sentencing? If the reason is (as we\nsuspect) that the Sentencing Commission does not have, or does not\nbelieve it has, authority to “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons, the dis-\nsent’s entire argument based upon what it calls “the purposes and the\nmechanics of the SRA’s sentencing system,” post, at 6, falls apart. Yet-\nto-be-imposed sentences are not within the system at all, and we are\nsimply left with the question whether judges or the Bureau of Prisons\nis responsible for them. For the reasons we have given, we think it is\njudges.\n   6 Of course, a district court should exercise the power to impose antic-\n\nipatory consecutive (or concurrent) sentences intelligently. In some\nsituations, a district court may have inadequate information and may\nforbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.\n12                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     sidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the\n     extent that they are applicable, if it finds that . . . ex-\n     traordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a\n     reduction [or that the defendant meets other criteria\n     for relief].”\n                               IV\n   Setser argues that, even if the District Court’s consecu-\ntive order was consistent with §3584(a), it made his sen-\ntence impossible to implement and therefore unreasonable\nunder the Act, see United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220,\n261–262 (2005),7 in light of the State’s decision to make\nhis sentences concurrent. We think not. There is nothing\nunreasonable—let alone inherently impossible—about the\nsentence itself. Setser is ordered to serve a 151-month\nterm in federal custody, and that sentence should run\nconcurrently with one state sentence and consecutively\nwith another.\n   The difficulty arises not from the sentence, but from the\nstate court’s decision to make both state sentences concur-\nrent. Which of the District Court’s dispositions should\nprevail: that his federal sentence run consecutively to the\nstate sentence on the parole revocation charge, or that his\nfederal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence\non the new drug charge? If the federal sentence is added\nto the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new\ndrug charge, and if it is merged in the state sentence it\nwill not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge.\n\n——————\n  7 We have never had occasion to decide whether reasonableness re-\nview under Booker applies to a court’s decision that a federal sentence\nshould run concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. The\nCourts of Appeals, however, generally seem to agree that such review\napplies. See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 618 F. 3d 643, 647 (CA7\n2010) (per curiam); United States v. Matera, 489 F. 3d 115, 123–124\n(CA2 2007). For purpose of the present case we assume, without\ndeciding, that it does.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThis is indeed a problem, but not, we think, one that\nshows the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The\nreasonableness standard we apply in reviewing federal\nsentences asks whether the district court abused its dis-\ncretion. See Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 46 (2007).\nSetser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s deci-\nsionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of\nsentencing that the District Court failed to consider. That\na sentence is thwarted does not mean that it was unrea-\nsonable. If a district court ordered, as a term of super-\nvised release, that a defendant maintain a steady job, but\na subsequent disability rendered gainful employment\ninfeasible, we doubt that one would call the original sen-\ntence an abuse of discretion. There will often be late-onset\nfacts that materially alter a prisoner’s position and that\nmake it difficult, or even impossible, to implement his\nsentence.\n  This is where the Bureau of Prisons comes in—which\nultimately has to determine how long the District Court’s\nsentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement.\nSetser is free to urge the Bureau to credit his time served\nin state court based on the District Court’s judgment that\nthe federal sentence run concurrently with the state sen-\ntence for the new drug charges. If the Bureau initially\ndeclines to do so, he may raise his claim through the Bu-\nreau’s Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR\n§542.10 et seq. (2011). And if that does not work, he may\nseek a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U. S. C. §2241.

The provision of the Act\nhere at issue concerns “multiple sentences.” See 18\nU. S. C. §3584. It brings into focus a difficult Guidelines-\nrelated problem: How should a federal judge sentence an\noffender where the offender has been convicted of having\nviolated several different statutes? The convictions may\nhave taken place all at the same time. Or, some convic-\ntions might have taken place at an earlier time, the of-\nfender may already have been sentenced to prison, and\nindeed the offender may still be serving that sentence.\nThe federal judge must decide the extent to which a sen-\ntence attached to one conviction should be served concur-\nrently or consecutively with sentences attached to other\nconvictions.\n   An understanding of the nature of this general problem\nand the Sentencing Commission’s statutorily foreseen\nsolutions will help the reader understand why, in my view,\nthe better legal answer to the question before us is that a\nfederal sentencing judge does not have the power to order\nthat a “federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated\n2                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstate sentence that has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1.\n                               I\n   The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) has two overall objec-\ntives. See Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip\nop., at 7); see also United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual §1A3, p. 1.2 (Nov. 1987) (USSG) (ad-\ndressing statutory objectives). First, it seeks greater\nhonesty in sentencing. Instead of a parole commission and\na judge trying to second-guess each other about the time\nan offender will actually serve in prison, the SRA tries to\ncreate a sentencing system that will require the offender\nactually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes.\nSee Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989)\n(“[The SRA] makes all sentences basically determinate”).\nSecond, the Act seeks greater fairness in sentencing\nthrough the creation of Guidelines that will increase the\nlikelihood that two offenders who engage in roughly simi-\nlar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar sen-\ntences. See Barber, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (noting\nthat Congress sought to achieve, in part, “increased sen-\ntencing uniformity”).\n   To implement these reforms, the SRA instructs the\nCommission to write Guidelines that inevitably move in\nthe direction of increased “real offense” sentencing. See\nUSSG §1A2, p. 1.1. (describing how statute, e.g., by insist-\ning upon categories of offense behavior and offender char-\nacteristics, leads to this result). In principle, real offense\nsentencing would impose the same sentence upon different\noffenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective\nof the statutes under which they are charged. Real offense\nsentencing, for example, would mean that two individuals,\nboth of whom rob a bank and injure a teller, would receive\nthe same sentence even if the Government charges one of\nthem under a bank robbery statute and the other under an\nassault statute. See, e.g., USSG App. A (listing federal\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatutory offenses, while keying them to specific individual\nGuidelines that determine sentence based upon likely\nactual behavior). In the event, the Guidelines move the\nsentencing system in this direction while simultaneously\nrecognizing that other factors require considerable modifi-\ncation of the real offense principle. See USSG §1A4(a)\n(“real offense vs. charge offense sentencing”).\n   Nonetheless the “real offense” goal influenced the Act’s,\nand the Commission’s, objectives in respect to the sentenc-\ning of an offender with multiple convictions. Insofar as\nseveral convictions arise out of the same course of behav-\nior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes underly-\ning the convictions as if they were all part of a single crime\nand sentence accordingly. But, insofar as the crimes un-\nderlying the convictions arise out of different courses of\nbehavior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes\nunderlying the convictions as if they were not part of a\nsingle crime and should see that the ultimate sentence\nreflects that fact.\n   To achieve these objectives is easier said than done. For\none thing, it requires a definition of what counts as the\nsame course of behavior. The Guidelines set forth that\ndefinition in §1B1.3, p. 1.17 (“Relevant Conduct”). For\nanother thing, statutes and Guidelines that set forth\nrelated instructions must take into account the fact that\nsentencing-related circumstances can prove highly com-\nplex. To take a fairly simple example, suppose that a\ndefendant is convicted of both robbery and impersonating\na federal official, that he has engaged in a single course of\nbehavior, but that neither the robbery nor the impersona-\ntion Guidelines take account of the other. Instructions\nabout concurrent/consecutive sentences must give the\njudge an idea about what to do in such a case. They must\nalso take account of the fact that a maximum penalty\ncontained in a statute will trump a greater penalty con-\ntained in a Guideline. And they must tell the judge (faced\n4                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith multiple convictions) what to do where that is so.\n   Reflecting these, and other, complexities, the Guidelines\ncontain complex instructions about how to sentence where\nthe offender is convicted of “Multiple Counts,” see USSG\n§3D, or has previously been convicted of a crime for which\nhe is “subject to an Un-discharged Term of Imprisonment,”\nsee §5G1.3. The Guidelines also tell the sentencing judge\nhow, through the use of partially concurrent and partially\nconsecutive sentences, to build a total sentence that meets\nthe Guidelines’ requirements. See §§5G1.2(d), 5G1.3.\n   With this background it becomes easier to understand\nthe statutory provisions before us. They reflect the fact\nthat Congress expected sentencing judges, when faced\nwith a defendant convicted of multiple crimes, to construct\na sentence that would, at least to a degree, reflect the\ndefendant’s real underlying behavior. Where two convic-\ntions reflect in whole or in part the same behavior, the\noverall sentences should reflect that fact, say by running\nconcurrently.\n   Accordingly, the statute says that “[m]ultiple terms of\nimprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently\nunless the court orders or the statute mandates that the\nterms are to run consecutively.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). And\nthat statement reflects the fact that often (but not always)\nmultiple convictions after a single trial will reflect a sin-\ngle course of behavior (different aspects of which violate\ndifferent criminal statutes). The statute also says that\n“[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different\ntimes run consecutively unless the court orders that the\nterms are to run concurrently.” Ibid. This statement\nreflects the fact that several convictions imposed after\ndifferent trials are more likely to reflect unrelated behav-\niors. In the first instance that the statute addresses,\nconcurrent sentences are more likely to be appropriate;\nin the second, consecutive sentences are more likely to be\nappropriate. But that is not always so. Thus the statu-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntory provisions assure sentencing judges that they retain\nthe power to reach a different conclusion.\n   At this point, I would ask the question that this case\nposes. Why does the statute say nothing about a sentenc-\ning judge imposing a sentence that might run consecu-\ntively with a sentence that a (typically different) judge has\nnot yet imposed? The answer is this: Because the sentenc-\ning judge normally does not yet know enough about the\nbehavior that underlies (or will underlie) a sentence that\nhas not yet been imposed. Normally the sentencing judge\ndoes not know, for example, (a) what that sentence will be,\n(b) whether the behavior underlying that later sentence\nconstitutes part of the same course of behavior that under-\nlies the present sentence or, instead, is totally separate\nfrom the behavior underlying the present sentence, or (c)\nis partly the same and partly different. Even if the judge\nhas an idea about what will happen, he does not know\nprecisely what will happen; and precision in this matter is\nimportant.\n   In a word, the sentencing judge normally does not yet\nknow enough about what will happen in the sentencing-\nproceeding-yet-to-come to be able to construct a sentence\nthat meets the Guidelines’ instructions and which, in\ndoing so, helps to assure that different individuals who\nengage in the same criminal behavior will typically receive\nroughly comparable sentences.\n   Of course, the Court is correct when it says that eventu-\nally the sentences will run (either wholly in or in part)\nconcurrently or consecutively. And someone must decide\nhow they will run. Ante, at 2–3. But the Court is not\ncorrect when it says that this someone should be the first\nfederal sentencing judge. Rather, the Executive and\nJudicial Branches have devised a system that can draw\nupon the intentions of that first federal judge, while apply-\ning them in light of actual knowledge about what later\nhappened. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in effect makes\n6                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe consecutive/concurrent decision after considering,\namong other things, “any statement by the court that\nimposed the sentence,” including statements “concerning\nthe purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was\ndetermined to be warranted.” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b)(4)(A).\nAnd its program statement provides that it will review\nthe “intent of the federal sentencing court” when deciding\nwhether in effect to make an earlier federal, and later\nstate, sentence concurrent or consecutive. Dept. of Jus-\ntice, BOP, Program Statement 5160.05: Designation of\nState Institution for Service of Federal Sentence 4 (Jan.\n16, 2003). The Bureau exercises this authority by desig-\nnating (or refusing to designate) the state prison where an\noffender is or will be incarcerated pursuant to his state\nsentence as the place where he will serve his federal sen-\ntence. 18 U. S. C. §3621(b).\n   This exercise of authority by the Executive Branch is\nnot constitutionally surprising. After all, “federal sentenc-\ning” has “never . . . been thought to be assigned by the\nConstitution to the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the\nthree Branches of Government.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at\n364. And, until fairly recently the federal BOP decided\n(via parole) the far more global question of just how long\n(within broad limits) each imprisoned offender would\nserve. See id., at 367. Thus, the present Bureau involve-\nment represents a further practical accommodation to a\nfact about the world, namely that the initial sentencing\njudge typically lacks important sentencing-related infor-\nmation about a second sentence that has not yet been\nimposed.\n                            II\n  Given the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA’s\nsentencing system, just described, the better reading of\nthe “multiple sentences” provision is a reading that denies\na sentencing judge the authority to “order that the federal\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence\nthat has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1. For one thing,\nnothing in the statute explicitly grants the judge that\nauthority. The text refers to other circumstances, those\nthat involve earlier or contemporaneous (multiple-count)\nconvictions, while it does not refer to later imposed\nsentences.\n   For another, exercise of any such authority would more\nlikely hinder than advance the basic objectives of the SRA.\nAs I have explained, supra, at 2–5, a sentencing judge\ntypically needs detailed information when constructing a\nmultiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline sentence.\nThe fact that the future sentence has not yet been imposed\nmeans that information will often be lacking, and that in\nturn means that the exercise of such authority would risk\nconfusion and error. A sentencing judge who believes, for\nexample, that the future conviction will be based upon\ndifferent relevant conduct (and consequently orders a\nconsecutive sentence) could discover that the second con-\nviction rests upon the same relevant conduct (warranting\na concurrent sentence). Mistakes of this kind increase the\nrisk of sentencing disparity and, insofar as the first judge\nguesses wrong, they can mean a less honest sentencing\nprocess as well.\n   Further, I can find no significant tradition (pre-\nGuideline or post-Guideline) of federal judges imposing a\nsentence that runs consecutively with a sentence not yet\nimposed. The Court refers to four Courts of Appeals cases\nfor the proposition that “traditionally” a judge possessed\nthis authority. Ante, at 4. The opinions in three of the\ncases are each about a page long and do not discuss the\nmatter here at issue. (They assume, without significant\ndiscussion, the existence of the relevant sentencing au-\nthority.) See Anderson v. United States, 405 F. 2d 492,\n493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam) (addressing the question\nwhether a federal sentence runs from the date of its impo-\n8                SETSER v.

The fourth case, Salley v.\nUnited States, 786 F. 2d 546, 548 (CA2 1986), discusses the\nissue directly and takes the Court’s position. But, like the\nother three cases, it was decided before the Guidelines took\neffect (i.e., when the reasons for denying the authority\nwere less strong). And, one judge on the panel disagreed\nin a separate opinion, and in my view has the better of the\nargument. See id., at 548–550 (Newman, J., concurring in\nresult); see also United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315,\n1317 (CA9 1985) (holding that a judge lacks the here-\nrelevant sentencing power). In any event, these instances\nare too few to constitute a “tradition.”\n   In fact the Senate Committee Report accompanying the\nSRA provides strong evidence that there was no such\ntradition. S. Rep. No. 98–225 (1983). That Report thor-\noughly surveyed prior law. It says that the SRA is a\n“comprehensive statement of the Federal law of sentenc-\ning,” that it “describes in detail the kinds of sentences that\nmay be imposed,” and that §3584 “provides the rules for\ndetermining the length of a term of imprisonment for a\nperson convicted of more than one offense.” Id., at 50,\n125–126. It further states that “[e]xisting law permits the\nimposition of either concurrent or consecutive sentences,”\nwhich practice it then describes as limited to two scenarios:\n“[t]erms of imprisonment imposed at the same time,” and\nthose “imposed on a person already serving a prison term.”\nId., at 126. It says the same when describing how §3584 is\nsupposed to work. In neither place does it refer to a prac-\ntice of, or any authority for, imposing a prison term that\nruns consecutively with a future term not yet imposed.\n   In addition, a grant of such authority risks at least\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noccasional incoherence. For example, the statute, after\nsetting forth the court’s authority to impose a sentence\nof imprisonment that runs either concurrently or consecu-\ntively with other terms imposed in the same or in earlier\nproceedings, creates an exception that says: “except that\nthe terms may not run consecutively for an attempt and\nfor another offense that was the sole objective of the at-\ntempt.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). Now suppose the Court\nwere right, and a sentencing judge had the authority to\nrun a present term consecutively with a not-yet-imposed\nfuture term. Would it not be important to apply this same\n“attempt” exception in such instances as well? Indeed,\nthe exception is phrased in categorical terms, and the legis-\nlative history in no way indicates that the exception ap-\nplies only occasionally. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 126\n(“[C]onsecutive terms of imprisonment may not, contrary\nto current law, be imposed for [attempt] and for an offense\nthat was the sole objective of the attempt” (emphasis\nadded)). Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to read the\nstatute’s language as broadening the exception beyond the\nstatutorily listed scenarios.\n   Or, consider, for example, an offender tried for arguably\nrelated crimes in two different federal courts at two differ-\nent times. The Court’s reading would not only allow the\nsecond judge to order concurrent service with the first\nsentence if warranted, as the statute explicitly permits,\nbut it would also allow the first judge to make an analo-\ngous but anticipatory order based upon the sentence he\nexpected the second judge would impose. But where com-\nplex forms of criminal behavior are at issue, these differ-\nent judges may reach different conclusions. The result\nmay well be conflict and confusion.\n   Finally, as I said above, supra, at 5–6, a more practical\nsolution to potential problems presented by a future sen-\ntencing proceeding lies closer at hand. The BOP has the\nstatutory authority to effect concurrent service of federal\n10               SETSER v.

The\nrelevant statute provides that “[t]he Bureau may desig-\nnate any available penal or correctional facility . . . ,\nwhether maintained by the Federal Government or other-\nwise . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b). And in reliance on this\nauthority, the Bureau has concluded that it has the power\nto “designat[e] . . . a state institution for concurrent ser-\nvice of a federal sentence.” Program Statement 5160.05,\nat 1. The Program Statement further provides that exer-\ncise of this power will be guided by, in part, “the intent of\nthe federal sentencing court” in addition to “any other\npertinent information regarding the inmate.” Id., at 4.\n   The Court’s only criticism of this system is that it is\nless “natural” to read the statute “as giving the Bureau\nof Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority.” Ante,\nat 8. But what is unnatural about giving the Bureau that\nauthority? The sentencing process has long involved\ncooperation among the three branches of Government.\nMistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And until the Guidelines\nthe BOP itself decided, within broad limits, precisely how\nmuch prison time every typical offender would serve.\nEven today, it still decides that question within certain\nlimits. 18 U. S. C. §3624 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (delegat-\ning to the BOP authority to calculate “good time credit,”\nwhich in effect reduces a prisoner’s term of incarceration);\nsee also Barber, 560 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 1). Although\nCongress limited the Bureau’s authority in this respect,\nthere is nothing unnatural about leaving the Bureau with\na small portion of that authority—particularly where\ndoing so helps significantly to alleviate a small, but im-\nportant, technical problem in the application of the SRA’s\nsentencing system.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 10–7387. Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012\nWhen petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges,\n the State also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then\n serving for another drug offense. At about the same time, Setser\n pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. The Federal District Court\n imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sen-\n tence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any\n state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. While Setser’s fed-\n eral appeal was pending, the state court sentenced him to 5 years for\n the probation violation and 10 years for the drug charge, but ordered\n the sentences to be served concurrently. The Fifth Circuit affirmed\n the federal sentence, holding that the District Court had authority to\n order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and\n that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if the state court’s deci-\n sion made it unclear exactly how to administer it.\nHeld:\n    1. The District Court had discretion to order that Setser’s federal\n sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the\n probation violation. Pp. 2–12.\n       (a) Judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting\n whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecu-\n tively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have\n been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings, see\n Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169. The statutory text and struc-\n ture do not foreclose a district court’s exercise of this discretion with\n respect to anticipated state sentences. The Sentencing Reform Act of\n 1984 addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the\n situation here, since the District Court did not impose “multiple\n terms of imprisonment . . . at the same time,” and Setser was not “al-\n2                      SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ready subject to” the state sentences at issue, 18 U. S. C. §3584(a).\n    This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the\n    District Court lacked authority to act as it did and that the Bureau of\n    Prisons is to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision after the\n    federal sentence has been imposed. Section 3621(b), from which the\n    Bureau claims to derive this authority, says nothing about concur-\n    rent or consecutive sentences. And it is more natural to read\n    §3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in sit-\n    uations not covered than it is to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau\n    what amounts to sentencing authority. Setser’s arguments to the\n    contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 2–8.\n          (b) None of the other objections raised by Setser and the Gov-\n    ernment requires a different result. Pp. 8–12.\n       2. The state court’s subsequent decision to make the state sentenc-\n    es run concurrently does not establish that the Federal District Court\n    imposed an unreasonable sentence. The difficulty here arises not\n    from the federal-court sentence—which is to run concurrently with\n    one state sentence and consecutively with another—but from the\n    state court’s decision. Deciding which of the District Court’s disposi-\n    tions should prevail under these circumstances is a problem, but it\n    does not show the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The rea-\n    sonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether\n    the district court abused its discretion, see Gall v. United States, 552\n    U. S. 38, 46, but Setser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s deci-\n    sionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of sentencing\n    that the court failed to consider. Where late-onset facts make it diffi-\n    cult, or even impossible, to implement the sentence, the Bureau of\n    Prisons may determine, in the first instance, how long the District\n    Court’s sentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement, sub-\n    ject to the potential for judicial review.

As often happens in drug\ncases, the federal authorities also got involved. A federal\ngrand jury indicted Setser for possessing with intent to\ndistribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 21\nU. S. C. §841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii), and he pleaded guilty.\n   Before the federal sentencing hearing, a probation of-\nficer calculated the applicable Guidelines range to be 121\nto 151 months’ imprisonment. Citing precedent from\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,\n2                 SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 920 F. 2d 1212 (1991) (per curiam),\nhe indicated that the District Court had discretion to make\nSetser’s sentence either concurrent with or consecutive to\nany sentence anticipated in the separate state-court pro-\nceedings. Setser objected, arguing that the District Court\nlacked such authority. The court nevertheless made the\nsentence of 151 months that it imposed consecutive to any\nstate sentence imposed for probation violation, but concur-\nrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug\ncharge. Setser appealed.\n  While Setser’s appeal was pending, the state court\nsentenced him to a prison term of 5 years for probation\nviolation and 10 years on the new drug charge. It ordered\nthat these sentences be served concurrently. Setser then\nmade before the Court of Appeals, in addition to the ar-\ngument that the District Court had no authority to order a\nconsecutive sentence, the argument that his federal sen-\ntence was unreasonable because it was impossible to\nimplement in light of the concurrent state sentences.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 607\nF. 3d 128 (2010). Following its earlier Brown decision, the\ncourt held that the District Court did have authority to\norder a consecutive sentence. 607 F. 3d, at 131–132. It\nalso held that Setser’s sentence was reasonable, even if it\nwas “ ‘partially foiled’ ” by the state court’s decision. Id., at\n132–133. We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and\nappointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in\nsupport of the judgment below, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   Before proceeding further, it is important to be clear\nabout what is at issue. Setser does not contend that his\nfederal sentence must run concurrently with both state\nsentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing.\nHe acknowledges that someone must answer “the consecu-\ntive versus concurrent question,” Brief for Petitioner 27,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand decide how the state and federal sentences will fit\ntogether. The issue here is who will make that decision,\nwhich in turn determines when that decision is made.\nOne possible answer, and the one the Fifth Circuit gave, is\nthat the decision belongs to the Federal District Court at\nthe federal sentencing hearing.\n   The concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision has been ad-\ndressed by §212(a) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n18 U. S. C. §3584, reproduced in full as Appendix A, infra.\nThe first subsection of that provision, which says when\nconcurrent and consecutive sentences may be imposed,\nand specifies which of those dispositions will be assumed\nin absence of indication by the sentencing judge, does not\ncover the situation here. It addresses only “multiple terms\nof imprisonment . . . imposed . . . at the same time” and “a\nterm of imprisonment . . . imposed on a defendant who is\nalready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”\n§3584(a). Here the state sentence is not imposed at the\nsame time as the federal sentence, and the defendant was\nnot already subject to that state sentence.\n   Setser, supported by the Government, argues that, be-\ncause §3584(a) does not cover this situation, the District\nCourt lacked authority to act as it did; and that the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision is therefore to be made\nby the Bureau of Prisons at any time after the federal sen-\ntence has been imposed. The Bureau of Prisons is said to\nderive this authority from 18 U. S. C. §3621(b) (2006 ed.\nand Supp. IV), reproduced in full as Appendix B, infra.\n   On its face, this provision says nothing about concurrent\nor consecutive sentences, but the Government explains its\nposition as follows: Section 3621(b) gives the Bureau the\nauthority to order that a prisoner serve his federal sen-\ntence in any suitable prison facility “whether maintained\nby the Federal Government or otherwise.” The Bureau\nmay therefore order that a prisoner serve his federal\nsentence in a state prison. Thus, when a person subject to\n4                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na federal sentence is serving a state sentence, the Bureau\nmay designate the state prison as the place of impris-\nonment for the federal sentence—effectively making the\ntwo sentences concurrent—or decline to do so—effec-\ntively making them consecutive.1 Based on §§3584(a)\nand 3621(b), Setser and the Government argue that the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, under the circum-\nstances presented here, is committed exclusively to the\nBureau of Prisons.\n   It is fundamental that we construe statutes governing\nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of “the\ncommon-law background against which the statutes . . .\nwere enacted,” New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council\nof City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), and the\nsame approach is appropriate here, where the issue con-\ncerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the\nJudiciary. Judges have long been understood to have\ndiscretion to select whether the sentences they impose will\nrun concurrently or consecutively with respect to other\nsentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in\nother proceedings, including state proceedings. See Ore-\ngon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 168–169 (2009). And a large\nmajority of the federal appellate courts addressing the\nquestion have recognized a similar authority in the con-\ntext here, where a federal judge anticipates a state sen-\ntence that has not yet been imposed. See Salley v. United\nStates, 786 F. 2d 546, 547 (CA2 1986); Anderson v. United\nStates, 405 F. 2d 492, 493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam); United\nStates ex rel. Lester v. Parker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41–42 (CA3\n1968) (per curiam); United States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178,\n179–180 (CA7 1966) (per curiam); but see United States v.\n\n\n——————\n  1 The Bureau of Prisons sometimes makes this designation while the\n\nprisoner is in state custody and sometimes makes a nunc pro tunc\ndesignation once the prisoner enters federal custody.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

We find\nnothing in the Sentencing Reform Act, or in any other\nprovision of law, to show that Congress foreclosed the\nexercise of district courts’ sentencing discretion in these\ncircumstances.\n   Setser’s main contention is that §3584(a) has this effect.\nBut that provision cannot sustain the weight that Setser\nasks it to bear. In essence, he reads the first sentence in\n§3584(a) to say that “terms [of imprisonment] may run\nconcurrently or consecutively” only “[i]f multiple terms of\nimprisonment are imposed . . . at the same time, or if a\nterm of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is\n——————\n  2 The  dissent is incorrect to say, post, at 7–8 (opinion of BREYER, J.),\nthat only the Second Circuit, in Salley held to that effect. So did the\nSeventh Circuit in Kanton and the Tenth Circuit in Anderson. The\ndissent says that Anderson addressed only the question “whether a\nfederal sentence runs from the date of its imposition or from the date of\nentry into federal custody,” post, at 7–8. That is true enough (and it is\ntrue of Kanton as well); but answering that question in a manner that\nupheld the consecutive federal sentence (i.e., it runs from the date of\nentry into federal custody) necessarily upheld the sentencing court’s\nauthority to impose the consecutive federal sentence. In fact, Ander-\nson confronted and specifically rejected the defendant’s argument that\n“ ‘[n]o court has the authority to impose a sentence consecutive to\nsomething that does not exist,’ ” 405 F. 2d, at 493. And, finally, so did\nthe Third Circuit in Lester. The dissent says that Lester addressed only\nthe question “whether a sentence was insufficiently certain for pur-\nposes of due process,” post, at 8. But that was the defendant’s princi-\npal reason (as it appears also to be the dissent’s principal reason) for\nasserting that the sentencing court had no authority to impose a\nconsecutive sentence. And the Third Circuit rejected not only that\nreason but “[o]ther arguments advanced by [the defendant] ” attacking\nthe consecutive sentence, 404 F. 2d, at 42.\n    The only contrary federal appellate decision rendered before the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act took effect relied upon 18 U. S. C. §4082 (1982 ed.)\n(the predecessor of §3621) and §3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed by 98 Stat.\n1987), which provided that a federal sentence “shall commence to run\nfrom the date on which such person is received” into federal custody.\nSee United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315, 1317 (CA9 1985).\n6                    SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nalready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.”\nSince the District Court was not imposing the state sen-\ntence and since it was not already imposed, the sentence\ncould not be ordered to run consecutively. But if the text\nis exclusive—if the addition of only is correct—the provi-\nsion forbids not only the imposition of consecutive sen-\ntences, but the imposition of concurrent ones as well. And\nyet, as Setser acknowledges, it must be one or the other;\nsomeone must decide the issue.\n   Setser’s response is that, read in context, the sentence\nspeaks only to district courts. Under the circumstances at\nissue here, he says, the federal and state sentences still\nmight run either concurrently or consecutively, but just\nnot at the discretion of the District Court. That is an odd\nparsing of the text, which makes no distinction between\nthe district court and the Bureau of Prisons. The place-\nment of §3584 does indeed suggest that it is directed at\ndistrict courts—but that is likely because Congress con-\ntemplated that only district courts would have the author-\nity to make the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, not\nbecause Congress meant to leave the Bureau unfettered.\nIndeed, the Bureau already follows the other directives in\n§3584(a). See Brief for United States 35. For example, if\nthe district court imposes multiple terms of imprisonment\nat the same time, but fails to address the concurrent-vs.-\nconsecutive issue, the terms “run concurrently,” §3584(a),\nand the Bureau is not free to use its “place of imprison-\nment” authority to achieve a different result.3\n   The Latin maxim on which Setser relies—expressio\n——————\n  3 The Government contends that the Bureau applies the default rules\n\nin §3584(a) “[a]s a matter of discretion” but is not “ ‘bound’ ” by that\nsubsection. Reply Brief for United States 15, n. 5. We think it implau-\nsible that the effectiveness of those rules—of §3584(a)’s prescription, for\nexample, that “[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different\ntimes run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to\nrun concurrently”—depends upon the “discretion” of the Bureau.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunius est exclusio alterius—might have application here if\nthe provision in question were a conferral of authority on\ndistrict courts. Giving sentencing authority in only speci-\nfied circumstances could be said to imply that it is with-\nheld in other circumstances. Section 3584, however, is\nframed not as a conferral of authority but as a limitation\nof authority that already exists (and a specification of\nwhat will be assumed when the exercise of that authority\nis ambiguous). It reads not “District courts shall have\nauthority to impose multiple terms of imprisonment on a\ndefendant at the same time, etc.” but rather “If multiple\nterms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at\nthe same time, [etc.]”—quite clearly assuming that such au-\nthority already exists. The mere acknowledgment of the\nexistence of certain pre-existing authority (and regulation\nof that authority) in no way implies a repeal of other pre-\nexisting authority. And that is especially true when there\nis an obvious reason for selecting the instances of pre-\nexisting authority that are addressed—to wit, that they\nare the examples of sentencing discretion most frequently\nencountered.\n   Moreover, expressio unius est exclusio alterius is a\ndouble-edged sword. Setser thinks it suggests that, because\n§3584(a) recognizes judicial discretion in scenario A and\nscenario B, there is no such discretion in scenario C. But\nthe same maxim shows much more convincingly why\n§3621(b) cannot be read to give the Bureau of Prisons\nexclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed\nto the district court in §3584(a). When §3584(a) specific-\nally addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive\nsentences, and makes no mention of the Bureau’s role in\nthe process, the implication is that no such role exists.\nAnd that conclusion is reinforced by application of the\nsame maxim (properly, in this instance) to §3621(b)—\nwhich is a conferral of authority on the Bureau of Prisons,\nbut does not confer authority to choose between concur-\n8                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrent and consecutive sentences. Put to the choice, we\nbelieve it is much more natural to read §3584(a) as not\ncontaining an implied “only,” leaving room for the exercise\nof judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it\nis to read §3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what\namounts to sentencing authority.\n                             III\n   None of the other objections to this approach raised by\nSetser and the Government require a different result.\n   Our decision today follows the interpretive rule they\ninvoke, that we must “give effect . . . to every clause and\nword” of the Act. United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S.\n528, 538–539 (1955) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe first sentence in §3584(a) addresses the most common\nsituations in which the decision between concurrent and\nconsecutive sentences must be made: where two sentences\nare imposed at the same time, and where a sentence is\nimposed subsequent to a prior sentence that has not yet\nbeen fully served. It says that the district court has dis-\ncretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or\nconsecutive, except that it may not make consecutive a\nsentence for “an attempt” and a sentence for an “offense\nthat was the sole objective of the attempt.” And the last\ntwo sentences of §3584(a) say what will be assumed in\nthose two common situations if the court does not specify\nthat the sentence is concurrent or consecutive. Giving\nthose dispositions full effect does not demand that we\nregard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other\nsituations.\n   Setser and the Government both suggest that, because\n§3584(b) directs courts to consider the sentencing factors\nin §3553(a) in making these decisions, and because some\nof those factors will be difficult to apply with respect to\nanticipated sentences, the Act cannot be read to allow\njudicial discretion in these circumstances. One cannot be\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsure that the sentence imposed is “sufficient, but not\ngreater than necessary,” §3553(a), the argument goes, if\none does not know how long it will actually be. But the\ndistrict judge faces the same uncertainty if the concurrent-\nvs.-consecutive decision is left for later resolution by the\nBureau of Prisons; he does not know, for example, whether\nthe 5-year sentence he imposes will be an actual five years\nor will be simply swallowed within another sentence. To\nbe sure, the Bureau of Prisons, if it waits to decide the\nmatter until after the state court has imposed its sentence,\nwill know for sure what sentences it is dealing with. But\nthe Bureau is not charged with applying §3553(a). The\nfactors that guide the agency’s “place of imprisonment”\ndecision do include “the nature and circumstances of the\noffense” and “the history and characteristics of the pris-\noner,” §3621(b)(2), (b)(3) (2006 ed.)—factors that are, to be\nsure, relevant to sentencing but also relevant to selection\nof the place of confinement; but they also include factors\nthat make little, if any, sense in the sentencing context,\nsuch as “the resources of the facility contemplated” and\nwhether the state facility “meets minimum standards of\nhealth and habitability,” §3621(b), (b)(1). (These factors\nconfirm our view that §3621 is not a sentencing provision\nbut a place-of-confinement provision.) It is much more\nnatural for a judge to apply the §3553(a) factors in making\nall concurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, than it is for some\nsuch decisions to be made by a judge applying §3553(a)\nfactors and others by the Bureau of Prisons applying\n§3621(b) factors.\n  The final objection is that principles of federalism and\ngood policy do not allow a district court to make the\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision when it does not have\nbefore it all of the information about the anticipated state\nsentence. As for principles of federalism, it seems to us\nthey cut in precisely the opposite direction. In our Ameri-\ncan system of dual sovereignty, each sovereign—whether\n10                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Federal Government or a State—is responsible for “the\nadministration of [its own] criminal justice syste[m].” Ice,\n555 U. S., at 170. If a prisoner like Setser starts in state\ncustody, serves his state sentence, and then moves to\nfederal custody, it will always be the Federal Govern-\nment—whether the district court or the Bureau of Pris-\nons—that decides whether he will receive credit for the\ntime served in state custody. And if he serves his federal\nsentence first, the State will decide whether to give him\ncredit against his state sentences without being bound by\nwhat the district court or the Bureau said on the matter.\nGiven this framework, it is always more respectful of the\nState’s sovereignty for the district court to make its deci-\nsion up front rather than for the Bureau of Prisons to\nmake the decision after the state court has acted. That\nway, the state court has all of the information before it\nwhen it acts.4 The Government’s position does not pro-\nmote the States’ interest—just the interests of the Bureau\nof Prisons.\n   As for good policy: The basic claim of Setser, the Gov-\nernment, and the dissent is that when it comes to sentenc-\ning, later is always better because the decisionmaker has\nmore information. See, e.g., post, at 7 (“[A] sentencing\njudge typically needs detailed information when construct-\ning a multiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline\nsentence”). That is undoubtedly true, but when that\ndesideratum is applied to the statutory structure before us\n——————\n  4 Setser notes that the text of §3584(a) does not distinguish between\n\nstate and federal sentences. If a district court can enter a consecutive\nsentencing order in advance of an anticipated state sentence, he asks,\nwhat is to stop it from issuing such an order in advance of an antici-\npated federal sentence? It could be argued that §3584(a) impliedly\nprohibits such an order because it gives that decision to the federal\ncourt that sentences the defendant when the other sentence is “already”\nimposed—and does not speak (of course) to what a state court must do\nwhen a sentence has already been imposed. It suffices to say, however,\nthat this question is not before us.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

Section\n3582(c)(1)(A) provides that a district court,\n     “upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,\n     may reduce the term of imprisonment . . . after con-\n——————\n   5 To support its view that Congress authorized the Bureau to make\n\nconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decisions, the dissent relies on the fact that\nthe Executive long had what is effectively sentencing authority in its\nability to grant or deny parole. That is a particularly curious power for\nthe dissent to rely upon, inasmuch as most of the dissent discusses (in\ngreat detail) the Sentencing Reform Act, whose principal objective was\nto eliminate the Executive’s parole power. Curiouser still is the dissent’s\ninvocation of the Guidelines system, which “tell[s] the sentencing judge\nhow, through the use of partially concurrent and partially consecutive\nsentences, to build a total sentence that meets the Guidelines’ require-\nments.” Post, at 4. These “instructions,” ibid., do not cover yet-to-be-\nimposed sentences, the dissent says, because “the sentencing judge\nnormally does not yet know enough about the behavior that underlies\n(or will underlie)” such a sentence. Post, at 5. That explains, perhaps,\nwhy the Guidelines’ “instructions” to judges do not cover them. But\nwhy do not the Guidelines “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons how to\nconduct its concurrent/consecutive sentencing? If the reason is (as we\nsuspect) that the Sentencing Commission does not have, or does not\nbelieve it has, authority to “instruct” the Bureau of Prisons, the dis-\nsent’s entire argument based upon what it calls “the purposes and the\nmechanics of the SRA’s sentencing system,” post, at 6, falls apart. Yet-\nto-be-imposed sentences are not within the system at all, and we are\nsimply left with the question whether judges or the Bureau of Prisons\nis responsible for them. For the reasons we have given, we think it is\njudges.\n   6 Of course, a district court should exercise the power to impose antic-\n\nipatory consecutive (or concurrent) sentences intelligently. In some\nsituations, a district court may have inadequate information and may\nforbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.\n12                  SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     sidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the\n     extent that they are applicable, if it finds that . . . ex-\n     traordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a\n     reduction [or that the defendant meets other criteria\n     for relief].”\n                               IV\n   Setser argues that, even if the District Court’s consecu-\ntive order was consistent with §3584(a), it made his sen-\ntence impossible to implement and therefore unreasonable\nunder the Act, see United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220,\n261–262 (2005),7 in light of the State’s decision to make\nhis sentences concurrent. We think not. There is nothing\nunreasonable—let alone inherently impossible—about the\nsentence itself. Setser is ordered to serve a 151-month\nterm in federal custody, and that sentence should run\nconcurrently with one state sentence and consecutively\nwith another.\n   The difficulty arises not from the sentence, but from the\nstate court’s decision to make both state sentences concur-\nrent. Which of the District Court’s dispositions should\nprevail: that his federal sentence run consecutively to the\nstate sentence on the parole revocation charge, or that his\nfederal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence\non the new drug charge? If the federal sentence is added\nto the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new\ndrug charge, and if it is merged in the state sentence it\nwill not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge.\n\n——————\n  7 We have never had occasion to decide whether reasonableness re-\nview under Booker applies to a court’s decision that a federal sentence\nshould run concurrently with or consecutively to another sentence. The\nCourts of Appeals, however, generally seem to agree that such review\napplies. See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 618 F. 3d 643, 647 (CA7\n2010) (per curiam); United States v. Matera, 489 F. 3d 115, 123–124\n(CA2 2007). For purpose of the present case we assume, without\ndeciding, that it does.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThis is indeed a problem, but not, we think, one that\nshows the District Court’s sentence to be unlawful. The\nreasonableness standard we apply in reviewing federal\nsentences asks whether the district court abused its dis-\ncretion. See Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 46 (2007).\nSetser identifies no flaw in the District Court’s deci-\nsionmaking process, nor anything available at the time of\nsentencing that the District Court failed to consider. That\na sentence is thwarted does not mean that it was unrea-\nsonable. If a district court ordered, as a term of super-\nvised release, that a defendant maintain a steady job, but\na subsequent disability rendered gainful employment\ninfeasible, we doubt that one would call the original sen-\ntence an abuse of discretion. There will often be late-onset\nfacts that materially alter a prisoner’s position and that\nmake it difficult, or even impossible, to implement his\nsentence.\n  This is where the Bureau of Prisons comes in—which\nultimately has to determine how long the District Court’s\nsentence authorizes it to continue Setser’s confinement.\nSetser is free to urge the Bureau to credit his time served\nin state court based on the District Court’s judgment that\nthe federal sentence run concurrently with the state sen-\ntence for the new drug charges. If the Bureau initially\ndeclines to do so, he may raise his claim through the Bu-\nreau’s Administrative Remedy Program. See 28 CFR\n§542.10 et seq. (2011). And if that does not work, he may\nseek a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U. S. C. §2241.

The provision of the Act\nhere at issue concerns “multiple sentences.” See 18\nU. S. C. §3584. It brings into focus a difficult Guidelines-\nrelated problem: How should a federal judge sentence an\noffender where the offender has been convicted of having\nviolated several different statutes? The convictions may\nhave taken place all at the same time. Or, some convic-\ntions might have taken place at an earlier time, the of-\nfender may already have been sentenced to prison, and\nindeed the offender may still be serving that sentence.\nThe federal judge must decide the extent to which a sen-\ntence attached to one conviction should be served concur-\nrently or consecutively with sentences attached to other\nconvictions.\n   An understanding of the nature of this general problem\nand the Sentencing Commission’s statutorily foreseen\nsolutions will help the reader understand why, in my view,\nthe better legal answer to the question before us is that a\nfederal sentencing judge does not have the power to order\nthat a “federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated\n2                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstate sentence that has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1.\n                               I\n   The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) has two overall objec-\ntives. See Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip\nop., at 7); see also United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual §1A3, p. 1.2 (Nov. 1987) (USSG) (ad-\ndressing statutory objectives). First, it seeks greater\nhonesty in sentencing. Instead of a parole commission and\na judge trying to second-guess each other about the time\nan offender will actually serve in prison, the SRA tries to\ncreate a sentencing system that will require the offender\nactually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes.\nSee Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989)\n(“[The SRA] makes all sentences basically determinate”).\nSecond, the Act seeks greater fairness in sentencing\nthrough the creation of Guidelines that will increase the\nlikelihood that two offenders who engage in roughly simi-\nlar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar sen-\ntences. See Barber, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (noting\nthat Congress sought to achieve, in part, “increased sen-\ntencing uniformity”).\n   To implement these reforms, the SRA instructs the\nCommission to write Guidelines that inevitably move in\nthe direction of increased “real offense” sentencing. See\nUSSG §1A2, p. 1.1. (describing how statute, e.g., by insist-\ning upon categories of offense behavior and offender char-\nacteristics, leads to this result). In principle, real offense\nsentencing would impose the same sentence upon different\noffenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective\nof the statutes under which they are charged. Real offense\nsentencing, for example, would mean that two individuals,\nboth of whom rob a bank and injure a teller, would receive\nthe same sentence even if the Government charges one of\nthem under a bank robbery statute and the other under an\nassault statute. See, e.g., USSG App. A (listing federal\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatutory offenses, while keying them to specific individual\nGuidelines that determine sentence based upon likely\nactual behavior). In the event, the Guidelines move the\nsentencing system in this direction while simultaneously\nrecognizing that other factors require considerable modifi-\ncation of the real offense principle. See USSG §1A4(a)\n(“real offense vs. charge offense sentencing”).\n   Nonetheless the “real offense” goal influenced the Act’s,\nand the Commission’s, objectives in respect to the sentenc-\ning of an offender with multiple convictions. Insofar as\nseveral convictions arise out of the same course of behav-\nior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes underly-\ning the convictions as if they were all part of a single crime\nand sentence accordingly. But, insofar as the crimes un-\nderlying the convictions arise out of different courses of\nbehavior, the sentencing judge should treat the crimes\nunderlying the convictions as if they were not part of a\nsingle crime and should see that the ultimate sentence\nreflects that fact.\n   To achieve these objectives is easier said than done. For\none thing, it requires a definition of what counts as the\nsame course of behavior. The Guidelines set forth that\ndefinition in §1B1.3, p. 1.17 (“Relevant Conduct”). For\nanother thing, statutes and Guidelines that set forth\nrelated instructions must take into account the fact that\nsentencing-related circumstances can prove highly com-\nplex. To take a fairly simple example, suppose that a\ndefendant is convicted of both robbery and impersonating\na federal official, that he has engaged in a single course of\nbehavior, but that neither the robbery nor the impersona-\ntion Guidelines take account of the other. Instructions\nabout concurrent/consecutive sentences must give the\njudge an idea about what to do in such a case. They must\nalso take account of the fact that a maximum penalty\ncontained in a statute will trump a greater penalty con-\ntained in a Guideline. And they must tell the judge (faced\n4                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith multiple convictions) what to do where that is so.\n   Reflecting these, and other, complexities, the Guidelines\ncontain complex instructions about how to sentence where\nthe offender is convicted of “Multiple Counts,” see USSG\n§3D, or has previously been convicted of a crime for which\nhe is “subject to an Un-discharged Term of Imprisonment,”\nsee §5G1.3. The Guidelines also tell the sentencing judge\nhow, through the use of partially concurrent and partially\nconsecutive sentences, to build a total sentence that meets\nthe Guidelines’ requirements. See §§5G1.2(d), 5G1.3.\n   With this background it becomes easier to understand\nthe statutory provisions before us. They reflect the fact\nthat Congress expected sentencing judges, when faced\nwith a defendant convicted of multiple crimes, to construct\na sentence that would, at least to a degree, reflect the\ndefendant’s real underlying behavior. Where two convic-\ntions reflect in whole or in part the same behavior, the\noverall sentences should reflect that fact, say by running\nconcurrently.\n   Accordingly, the statute says that “[m]ultiple terms of\nimprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently\nunless the court orders or the statute mandates that the\nterms are to run consecutively.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). And\nthat statement reflects the fact that often (but not always)\nmultiple convictions after a single trial will reflect a sin-\ngle course of behavior (different aspects of which violate\ndifferent criminal statutes). The statute also says that\n“[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different\ntimes run consecutively unless the court orders that the\nterms are to run concurrently.” Ibid. This statement\nreflects the fact that several convictions imposed after\ndifferent trials are more likely to reflect unrelated behav-\niors. In the first instance that the statute addresses,\nconcurrent sentences are more likely to be appropriate;\nin the second, consecutive sentences are more likely to be\nappropriate. But that is not always so. Thus the statu-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntory provisions assure sentencing judges that they retain\nthe power to reach a different conclusion.\n   At this point, I would ask the question that this case\nposes. Why does the statute say nothing about a sentenc-\ning judge imposing a sentence that might run consecu-\ntively with a sentence that a (typically different) judge has\nnot yet imposed? The answer is this: Because the sentenc-\ning judge normally does not yet know enough about the\nbehavior that underlies (or will underlie) a sentence that\nhas not yet been imposed. Normally the sentencing judge\ndoes not know, for example, (a) what that sentence will be,\n(b) whether the behavior underlying that later sentence\nconstitutes part of the same course of behavior that under-\nlies the present sentence or, instead, is totally separate\nfrom the behavior underlying the present sentence, or (c)\nis partly the same and partly different. Even if the judge\nhas an idea about what will happen, he does not know\nprecisely what will happen; and precision in this matter is\nimportant.\n   In a word, the sentencing judge normally does not yet\nknow enough about what will happen in the sentencing-\nproceeding-yet-to-come to be able to construct a sentence\nthat meets the Guidelines’ instructions and which, in\ndoing so, helps to assure that different individuals who\nengage in the same criminal behavior will typically receive\nroughly comparable sentences.\n   Of course, the Court is correct when it says that eventu-\nally the sentences will run (either wholly in or in part)\nconcurrently or consecutively. And someone must decide\nhow they will run. Ante, at 2–3. But the Court is not\ncorrect when it says that this someone should be the first\nfederal sentencing judge. Rather, the Executive and\nJudicial Branches have devised a system that can draw\nupon the intentions of that first federal judge, while apply-\ning them in light of actual knowledge about what later\nhappened. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in effect makes\n6                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe consecutive/concurrent decision after considering,\namong other things, “any statement by the court that\nimposed the sentence,” including statements “concerning\nthe purposes for which the sentence to imprisonment was\ndetermined to be warranted.” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b)(4)(A).\nAnd its program statement provides that it will review\nthe “intent of the federal sentencing court” when deciding\nwhether in effect to make an earlier federal, and later\nstate, sentence concurrent or consecutive. Dept. of Jus-\ntice, BOP, Program Statement 5160.05: Designation of\nState Institution for Service of Federal Sentence 4 (Jan.\n16, 2003). The Bureau exercises this authority by desig-\nnating (or refusing to designate) the state prison where an\noffender is or will be incarcerated pursuant to his state\nsentence as the place where he will serve his federal sen-\ntence. 18 U. S. C. §3621(b).\n   This exercise of authority by the Executive Branch is\nnot constitutionally surprising. After all, “federal sentenc-\ning” has “never . . . been thought to be assigned by the\nConstitution to the exclusive jurisdiction of any one of the\nthree Branches of Government.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at\n364. And, until fairly recently the federal BOP decided\n(via parole) the far more global question of just how long\n(within broad limits) each imprisoned offender would\nserve. See id., at 367. Thus, the present Bureau involve-\nment represents a further practical accommodation to a\nfact about the world, namely that the initial sentencing\njudge typically lacks important sentencing-related infor-\nmation about a second sentence that has not yet been\nimposed.\n                            II\n  Given the purposes and the mechanics of the SRA’s\nsentencing system, just described, the better reading of\nthe “multiple sentences” provision is a reading that denies\na sentencing judge the authority to “order that the federal\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence\nthat has not yet been imposed.” Ante, at 1. For one thing,\nnothing in the statute explicitly grants the judge that\nauthority. The text refers to other circumstances, those\nthat involve earlier or contemporaneous (multiple-count)\nconvictions, while it does not refer to later imposed\nsentences.\n   For another, exercise of any such authority would more\nlikely hinder than advance the basic objectives of the SRA.\nAs I have explained, supra, at 2–5, a sentencing judge\ntypically needs detailed information when constructing a\nmultiple-count or multiple-conviction Guideline sentence.\nThe fact that the future sentence has not yet been imposed\nmeans that information will often be lacking, and that in\nturn means that the exercise of such authority would risk\nconfusion and error. A sentencing judge who believes, for\nexample, that the future conviction will be based upon\ndifferent relevant conduct (and consequently orders a\nconsecutive sentence) could discover that the second con-\nviction rests upon the same relevant conduct (warranting\na concurrent sentence). Mistakes of this kind increase the\nrisk of sentencing disparity and, insofar as the first judge\nguesses wrong, they can mean a less honest sentencing\nprocess as well.\n   Further, I can find no significant tradition (pre-\nGuideline or post-Guideline) of federal judges imposing a\nsentence that runs consecutively with a sentence not yet\nimposed. The Court refers to four Courts of Appeals cases\nfor the proposition that “traditionally” a judge possessed\nthis authority. Ante, at 4. The opinions in three of the\ncases are each about a page long and do not discuss the\nmatter here at issue. (They assume, without significant\ndiscussion, the existence of the relevant sentencing au-\nthority.) See Anderson v. United States, 405 F. 2d 492,\n493 (CA10 1969) (per curiam) (addressing the question\nwhether a federal sentence runs from the date of its impo-\n8                SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsition or from the date of entry into federal custody);\nUnited States v. Kanton, 362 F. 2d 178, 179–180 (CA7\n1966) (per curiam) (same); United States ex rel. Lester v.\nParker, 404 F. 2d 40, 41 (CA3 1968) (per curiam) (address-\ning the question whether a sentence was insufficiently cer-\ntain for purposes of due process). The fourth case, Salley v.\nUnited States, 786 F. 2d 546, 548 (CA2 1986), discusses the\nissue directly and takes the Court’s position. But, like the\nother three cases, it was decided before the Guidelines took\neffect (i.e., when the reasons for denying the authority\nwere less strong). And, one judge on the panel disagreed\nin a separate opinion, and in my view has the better of the\nargument. See id., at 548–550 (Newman, J., concurring in\nresult); see also United States v. Eastman, 758 F. 2d 1315,\n1317 (CA9 1985) (holding that a judge lacks the here-\nrelevant sentencing power). In any event, these instances\nare too few to constitute a “tradition.”\n   In fact the Senate Committee Report accompanying the\nSRA provides strong evidence that there was no such\ntradition. S. Rep. No. 98–225 (1983). That Report thor-\noughly surveyed prior law. It says that the SRA is a\n“comprehensive statement of the Federal law of sentenc-\ning,” that it “describes in detail the kinds of sentences that\nmay be imposed,” and that §3584 “provides the rules for\ndetermining the length of a term of imprisonment for a\nperson convicted of more than one offense.” Id., at 50,\n125–126. It further states that “[e]xisting law permits the\nimposition of either concurrent or consecutive sentences,”\nwhich practice it then describes as limited to two scenarios:\n“[t]erms of imprisonment imposed at the same time,” and\nthose “imposed on a person already serving a prison term.”\nId., at 126. It says the same when describing how §3584 is\nsupposed to work. In neither place does it refer to a prac-\ntice of, or any authority for, imposing a prison term that\nruns consecutively with a future term not yet imposed.\n   In addition, a grant of such authority risks at least\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noccasional incoherence. For example, the statute, after\nsetting forth the court’s authority to impose a sentence\nof imprisonment that runs either concurrently or consecu-\ntively with other terms imposed in the same or in earlier\nproceedings, creates an exception that says: “except that\nthe terms may not run consecutively for an attempt and\nfor another offense that was the sole objective of the at-\ntempt.” 18 U. S. C. §3584(a). Now suppose the Court\nwere right, and a sentencing judge had the authority to\nrun a present term consecutively with a not-yet-imposed\nfuture term. Would it not be important to apply this same\n“attempt” exception in such instances as well? Indeed,\nthe exception is phrased in categorical terms, and the legis-\nlative history in no way indicates that the exception ap-\nplies only occasionally. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 126\n(“[C]onsecutive terms of imprisonment may not, contrary\nto current law, be imposed for [attempt] and for an offense\nthat was the sole objective of the attempt” (emphasis\nadded)). Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to read the\nstatute’s language as broadening the exception beyond the\nstatutorily listed scenarios.\n   Or, consider, for example, an offender tried for arguably\nrelated crimes in two different federal courts at two differ-\nent times. The Court’s reading would not only allow the\nsecond judge to order concurrent service with the first\nsentence if warranted, as the statute explicitly permits,\nbut it would also allow the first judge to make an analo-\ngous but anticipatory order based upon the sentence he\nexpected the second judge would impose. But where com-\nplex forms of criminal behavior are at issue, these differ-\nent judges may reach different conclusions. The result\nmay well be conflict and confusion.\n   Finally, as I said above, supra, at 5–6, a more practical\nsolution to potential problems presented by a future sen-\ntencing proceeding lies closer at hand. The BOP has the\nstatutory authority to effect concurrent service of federal\n10               SETSER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand state sentences and is well situated to take into ac-\ncount both the intent of the first sentencing judge and\nthe specific facts developed in the second sentencing. The\nrelevant statute provides that “[t]he Bureau may desig-\nnate any available penal or correctional facility . . . ,\nwhether maintained by the Federal Government or other-\nwise . . . .” 18 U. S. C. §3621(b). And in reliance on this\nauthority, the Bureau has concluded that it has the power\nto “designat[e] . . . a state institution for concurrent ser-\nvice of a federal sentence.” Program Statement 5160.05,\nat 1. The Program Statement further provides that exer-\ncise of this power will be guided by, in part, “the intent of\nthe federal sentencing court” in addition to “any other\npertinent information regarding the inmate.” Id., at 4.\n   The Court’s only criticism of this system is that it is\nless “natural” to read the statute “as giving the Bureau\nof Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority.” Ante,\nat 8. But what is unnatural about giving the Bureau that\nauthority? The sentencing process has long involved\ncooperation among the three branches of Government.\nMistretta, 488 U. S., at 364. And until the Guidelines\nthe BOP itself decided, within broad limits, precisely how\nmuch prison time every typical offender would serve.\nEven today, it still decides that question within certain\nlimits. 18 U. S. C. §3624 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV) (delegat-\ning to the BOP authority to calculate “good time credit,”\nwhich in effect reduces a prisoner’s term of incarceration);\nsee also Barber, 560 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 1). Although\nCongress limited the Bureau’s authority in this respect,\nthere is nothing unnatural about leaving the Bureau with\na small portion of that authority—particularly where\ndoing so helps significantly to alleviate a small, but im-\nportant, technical problem in the application of the SRA’s\nsentencing system.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.
