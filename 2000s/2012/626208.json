Argued November 30, 2011\u2014Decided March 28, 2012\r\nRespondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human im-\r\n  munodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Admin-\r\n  istration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical cer-\r\n  tificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with\r\n  HIV. Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Ad-\r\n  ministration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the\r\n  basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with\r\n  the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding in-\r\n  formation about his condition. The Department of Transportation\r\n  (DOT), the FAA\u2019s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga-\r\n  tion with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had ob-\r\n  tained FAA certifications. The DOT provided the SSA with the\r\n  names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT\r\n  with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had\r\n  also received disability benefits. Respondent\u2019s name appeared on the\r\n  spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had\r\n  intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the\r\n  FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for mak-\r\n  ing false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and\r\n  was fined and sentenced to probation. He then filed suit, alleging\r\n  that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which\r\n  contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of rec-\r\n  ords held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an aggrieved\r\n  individual to sue for \u201cactual damages,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(g)(4)(A), if\r\n  the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act\u2019s require-\r\n  ments in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specifical-\r\n  ly, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his\r\n2                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    confidential medical information had caused him mental and emo-\r\n    tional distress. The District Court concluded that the Government\r\n    had violated the Act. But, finding the term \u201cactual damages\u201d ambig-\r\n    uous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which pro-\r\n    vides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in\r\n    the Government\u2019s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the\r\n    recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the\r\n    Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act is not am-\r\n    biguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.\r\nHeld: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for\r\n mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Gov-\r\n ernment\u2019s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 4\u2013\r\n 19.\r\n    (a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally ex-\r\n pressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192,\r\n and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United\r\n States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a\r\n plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money\r\n damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village,\r\n Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 5\u20136.\r\n    (b) The term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act is a legal term of\r\n art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, \u201c \u2018presumably\r\n knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each bor-\r\n rowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,\u2019 \u201d Molzof\r\n v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise\r\n meaning of \u201cactual damages\u201d is far from clear. Although the term is\r\n sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been\r\n used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary\r\n harm. Because of the term\u2019s chameleon-like quality, it must be con-\r\n sidered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 6\u20139.\r\n    (c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by\r\n defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which\r\n plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove\r\n at least some \u201cactual damages,\u201d \u201cparallels\u201d the common-law torts of\r\n libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover \u201cgen-\r\n eral damages\u201d if they first prove \u201cspecial damages.\u201d Doe v. Chao, 540\r\n U. S. 614, 625. \u201cSpecial damages\u201d are limited to actual pecuniary\r\n loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. \u201cGeneral damag-\r\n es\u201d cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This\r\n parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term \u201cac-\r\n tual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial damages,\u201d thus barring Privacy Act\r\n victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pe-\r\n cuniary harm. That Congress would choose \u201cactual damages\u201d instead\r\n of \u201cspecial damages\u201d is not without precedent, as the terms have oc-\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  casionally been used interchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about\r\n  the plausibility of construing \u201cactual damages\u201d as special damages in\r\n  the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress\u2019 deliberate refusal to allow\r\n  recovery for \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d In common-law defamation and pri-\r\n  vacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory\r\n  damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to\r\n  authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress in-\r\n  tended the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act to mean special damag-\r\n  es for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 9\u201314.\r\n     (d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by\r\n  the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it\r\n  is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic\r\n  loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court\r\n  adopts an interpretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d limited to proven pecu-\r\n  niary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress\u2019\r\n  sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly\r\n  requires. P. 14.\r\n     (e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) common-law\r\n  cases often define \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean all compensatory dam-\r\n  ages; (2) the elimination of \u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the Privacy Act\r\n  means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but\r\n  plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress;\r\n  (3) because some courts have construed \u201cactual damages\u201d in similar\r\n  statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must\r\n  have intended \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act to include mental and\r\n  emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages\r\n  would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act\u2019s remedial\r\n  purpose. None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immuni-\r\n  ty canon.

S. C.\r\n\u00a7552a, contains a comprehensive and detailed set of re\u00ad\r\nquirements for the management of confidential records\r\nheld by Executive Branch agencies. If an agency fails to\r\ncomply with those requirements \u201cin such a way as to have\r\nan adverse effect on an individual,\u201d the Act authorizes the\r\nindividual to bring a civil action against the agency.\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(1)(D). For violations found to be \u201cintentional or\r\nwillful,\u201d the United States is liable for \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(4)(A). In this case, we must decide whether the\r\nterm \u201cactual damages,\u201d as used in the Privacy Act, in\u00ad\r\ncludes damages for mental or emotional distress. We hold\r\nthat it does not.\r\n                                I\r\n   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires\r\npilots to obtain a pilot certificate and medical certificate as\r\na precondition for operating an aircraft. 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a761.3(a),\r\n(c) (2011). Pilots must periodically renew their medical\r\ncertificates to ensure compliance with FAA medical stand\u00ad\r\n2                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nards. See \u00a761.23(d). When applying for renewal, pilots\r\nmust disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they\r\nhave had, and they must identify any medications they are\r\ntaking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.\r\n   Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot\r\nsince 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human im-\r\nmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking\r\nantiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not\r\nissue medical certificates to persons with respondent\u2019s\r\ncondition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal\r\nof his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded\r\nhimself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he ap-\r\nplied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so\r\nwithout disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He\r\nrenewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004,\r\neach time intentionally withholding information about his\r\ncondition.\r\n   When respondent\u2019s health deteriorated in 1995, he\r\napplied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of\r\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7401 et seq. To sub\u00ad\r\nstantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the\r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA), which awarded him\r\nbenefits for the year from August 1995 to August 1996.\r\n   In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the\r\nFAA\u2019s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga\u00ad\r\ntion with the SSA, known as \u201cOperation Safe Pilot,\u201d to\r\nidentify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA\r\ncertifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names\r\nand other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots\r\nin northern California. The SSA then compared the list\r\nwith its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a\r\nspreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.\r\n   The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current\r\nmedical certificate but had also received disability bene\u00ad\r\nfits. After reviewing respondent\u2019s FAA medical file and\r\nhis SSA disability file, FAA flight surgeons determined in\r\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\n2005 that the FAA would not have issued a medical cer-\r\ntificate to respondent had it known his true medical\r\ncondition.\r\n   When investigators confronted respondent with what\r\nhad been discovered, he admitted that he had intention-\r\nally withheld from the FAA information about his HIV\r\nstatus and other relevant medical information. Because of\r\nthese fraudulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent\u2019s\r\npilot certificate, and he was indicted on three counts of\r\nmaking false statements to a Government agency, in\r\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001. Respondent ultimately\r\npleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a\r\nfalse official writing, in violation of \u00a71018. He was sen\u00ad\r\ntenced to two years of probation and fined $1,000.1\r\n   Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter\r\nGovernment) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his\r\nrecords with one another, respondent filed suit in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\r\nCalifornia. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the\r\nDOT of his confidential medical information, including his\r\nHIV status, had caused him \u201chumiliation, embarrassment,\r\nmental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe\r\nemotional distress.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a. Notably,\r\nhe did not allege any pecuniary or economic loss.\r\n   The District Court granted summary judgment against\r\nrespondent. 816 F. Supp. 2d 778, 781 (2008). The court\r\nconcluded that the Government had violated the Privacy\r\nAct and that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether\r\nthe violation was intentional or willful.2 But the court\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Respondent eventually applied for recertification as a pilot. After\r\n\r\nreviewing respondent\u2019s medical records, including information about\r\nhis HIV diagnosis and treatment, the FAA reissued his pilot certificate\r\nand medical certificate. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1.\r\n  2 With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for an agency to disclose a\r\n\r\nrecord to another agency without the written consent of the person to\r\nwhom the record pertains. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(b). One exception to this\r\n4                         FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nheld that respondent could not recover damages because\r\nhe alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic\r\nloss. Finding that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d is \u201cfacially\r\nambiguous,\u201d id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign\r\nimmunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign\r\nimmunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Gov\u00ad\r\nernment, the court concluded that the Act does not author\u00ad\r\nize the recovery of damages from the Government for\r\nnonpecuniary mental or emotional harm.\r\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\u00ad\r\ncuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010).\r\nThe court acknowledged that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d\r\nis a \u201c \u2018chameleon\u2019 \u201d in that \u201cits meaning changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.\u201d Id., at 1029. But the\r\ncourt nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,\r\nthe term includes damages for mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Looking to what it described as \u201c[i]ntrinsic\u201d and\r\n\u201c[e]xtrinsic\u201d sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded\r\nthat the meaning of \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy\r\nAct is not ambiguous and that \u201ca construction that limits\r\nrecovery to pecuniary loss\u201d is not \u201cplausible,\u201d id., at 1034.\r\n   The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing\r\nen banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at\r\n1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and\r\nwe granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                          II\r\n  Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen\u00ad\r\nsation from the Government for mental and emotional\r\nharm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nnondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a\r\nwritten request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that\r\nmaintains the record. See \u00a7552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could\r\neasily have shared respondent\u2019s medical records pursuant to the\r\nprocedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con\u00ad\r\ncluded that they failed to do so.\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nsion of the Privacy Act waives the Government\u2019s sovereign\r\nimmunity with respect to such a recovery.\r\n                             A\r\n   We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity must be \u201cunequivocally expressed\u201d in\r\nstatutory text. See, e.g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192\r\n(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,\r\n33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\r\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a\r\nwaiver that is not clearly evident from the language of\r\nthe statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the\r\nstatutory language are to be construed in favor of immu-\r\nnity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),\r\nso that the Government\u2019s consent to be sued is never en-\r\nlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,\r\nRuckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685\u2013686 (1983)\r\n(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,\r\n686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter\u00ad\r\npretation of the statute that would not authorize money\r\ndamages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,\r\nat 34, 37.\r\n   The question that confronts us here is not whether\r\nCongress has consented to be sued for damages under the\r\nPrivacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which\r\nexpressly authorizes recovery from the Government for\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d Rather, the question at issue concerns\r\nthe scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we\r\nrefuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously\r\nexpressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities\r\nin the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,\r\nsupra, at 192.\r\n   Although this canon of interpretation requires an un\u00ad\r\nmistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to\r\nwaive the Government\u2019s immunity, Congress need not\r\nstate its intent in any particular way. We have never\r\n6                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,\r\nwe have observed that the sovereign immunity canon \u201cis\r\na tool for interpreting the law\u201d and that it does not \u201cdis\u00ad\r\nplac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc\u00ad\r\ntion.\u201d Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.\r\n571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of\r\nCongress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory\r\ntext in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,\r\nthen we take the interpretation most favorable to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n                               B\r\n   The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides\r\nthat, for any \u201cintentional or willful\u201d refusal or failure to\r\ncomply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for\r\n\u201cactual damages sustained by the individual as a result of\r\nthe refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled\r\nto recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define \u201cactual\r\ndamages,\u201d respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word \u201cactual\u201d as it is defined in standard\r\ngeneral-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals\r\nexplained, \u201cactual damages\u201d is a legal term of art, 622\r\nF. 3d, at 1028, and it is a \u201ccardinal rule of statutory con\u00ad\r\nstruction\u201d that, when Congress employs a term of art, \u201c \u2018it\r\npresumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that\r\nwere attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn\u00ad\r\ning from which it was taken,\u2019 \u201d Molzof v. United States, 502\r\nU. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,\r\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).\r\n   Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d is far from clear. The latest edition of Black\u2019s\r\nLaw Dictionary available when Congress enacted the\r\nPrivacy Act defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[r]eal, substan\u00ad\r\ntial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com\u00ad\r\nplainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or\r\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

But this\r\ngeneral (and notably circular) definition is of little value\r\nhere because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,\r\nthe precise meaning of the term \u201cchanges with the specific\r\nstatute in which it is found.\u201d 622 F. 3d, at 1029.\r\n   The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu\u00ad\r\nniary harm. Take, for instance, some courts\u2019 interpreta\u00ad\r\ntions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c),\r\nand the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed \u201cac\u00ad\r\ntual\u201d damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes\r\nto include compensation for mental and emotional dis\u00ad\r\ntress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,\r\n636\u2013638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages\r\nunder the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a73612, the predecessor to\r\n\u00a73613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d\r\n380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the\r\nFHA \u201care not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may\r\ninclude an award for emotional distress and humiliation\u201d);\r\nThompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682\r\nF. 2d 509, 513\u2013514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining\r\nthat, \u201c[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,\r\nhumiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable\r\nelements of damage\u201d under the FCRA); Millstone v.\r\nO\u2019Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834\u2013835 (CA8 1976)\r\n(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for \u201closs\r\nof sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish\u201d).\r\n   In other contexts, however, the term has been used or\r\nconstrued more narrowly to authorize damages for only\r\npecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the\r\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress\r\nauthorized \u201cactual or compensatory damages, measured\r\nby the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\u201d 28\r\nU. S. C. \u00a72674, \u00b62. At least one court has defined \u201cactual\r\n8                           FAA v.

And some\r\ncourts have construed \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Securities\r\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(a), to mean \u201csome\r\nform of economic loss.\u201d Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc.,\r\n556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v.

Wallace, 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5\r\n1970) (noting that the \u201cgist\u201d of an action for damages\r\nunder the Act is \u201ceconomic injury\u201d).3\r\n   Because the term \u201cactual damages\u201d has this chameleon\u00ad\r\nlike quality, we cannot rely on any all-purpose definition\r\nbut must consider the particular context in which the term\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci\u00ad\r\n\r\nsions as well. See, e.g., Reist v. Manwiller, 231 Pa. Super. 444, 449,\r\nn. 4, 332 A. 2d 518, 520, n. 4 (1974) (explaining that recovery for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed \u201cdespite the total\r\nabsence of physical injury and actual damages\u201d); Nalder v.

It\r\nis also reflected in post-Privacy Act statutes and judicial decisions. See,\r\ne.g., 17 U. S.

The dissent says that the defini\u00ad\r\ntion\u2014\u201c \u2018[a]ctual damages\u2019 compensate for actual injury\u201d\u2014is \u201cplain\r\nenough.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But defining \u201cactual\u201d\r\ndamages by reference to \u201cactual\u201d injury is hardly helpful when our task\r\nis to determine what Congress meant by \u201cactual.\u201d The dissent\u2019s refer\u00ad\r\nence to the current version of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which provides\r\nthat \u201cactual damages\u201d can mean \u201ctangible damages,\u201d only highlights\r\nthe term\u2019s ambiguity. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIf \u201cactual damages\u201d can mean \u201ctangible damages,\u201d then it can be\r\nconstrued not to include intangible harm, like mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Similarly unhelpful is the dissent\u2019s citation to a general\u00ad\r\npurpose dictionary that defines \u201cactual\u201d as \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d\r\nand \u201cdamages\u201d as \u201ccompensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a\r\nwrong or injury.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 22,\r\n571 (2002) (emphasis added). Combining these two lay definitions says\r\nnothing about whether compensation for mental and emotional distress\r\nis in fact imposed by law. The definitions merely beg the question we\r\nare trying to answer. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d has taken on different meanings in different statutes, as our\r\nexamples amply illustrate.\r\n10                         FAA v.

The basic idea is that\r\nPrivacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slan\u00ad\r\nder, are barred from any recovery unless they can first\r\nshow actual\u2014that is, pecuniary or material\u2014harm. Upon\r\nshowing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they\r\ncan recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably\r\nfor any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to\r\nuse the term \u201cactual damages\u201d instead of \u201cspecial damages\u201d\r\nwas not without precedent. The terms had occasionally\r\nbeen used interchangeably. See, e.g., Wetzel v.

Id., at 622.\r\n  By authorizing recovery for \u201cactual\u201d but not for \u201cgen\u00ad\r\neral\u201d damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those\r\nterms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation\r\nand related dignitary torts, two categories of compensa-\r\ntory damages are recoverable: general damages and special\r\ndamages. Cooley \u00a7164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement\r\n\u00a7867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for inter\u00ad\r\nference with privacy \u201ccan be awarded in the same way in\r\nwhich general damages are given for defamation\u201d).9 Be\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  8 The   dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless\r\nimprecision. Post, at 8, n. 6. But just as we assume that Congress did\r\nnot act carelessly, we should not be so quick to assume that the courts\r\ndid. The better explanation for these precedents is not that the courts\r\nwere careless, but that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d has a varied mean\u00ad\r\ning that, depending on the context, can be limited to compensation for\r\nonly pecuniary harm.\r\n    9 See also Moriarty v.

But because the Privacy Act\r\nwaives the Federal Government\u2019s sovereign immunity, the\r\nquestion we must answer is whether it is plausible to read\r\nthe statute, as the Government does, to authorize only\r\ndamages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\r\n34, 37. When waiving the Government\u2019s sovereign im\u00ad\r\nmunity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518\r\nU. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a\r\nconsequence, we adopt an interpretation of \u201cactual dam\u00ad\r\nages\u201d limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To\r\ndo otherwise would expand the scope of Congress\u2019 sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text\r\nclearly requires.\r\n                          III\r\n  None of respondent\u2019s contrary arguments suffices to\r\novercome the sovereign immunity canon.\r\n                             A\r\n   Respondent notes that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d has\r\noften been defined broadly in common-law cases, and in\r\nour own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 18\u201325. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo\u00ad\r\nlidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we\r\nobserved that \u201c[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam\u00ad\r\nages mean the same thing.\u201d Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert\r\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual\r\ninjury in the defamation context \u201cis not limited to out-of\u00ad\r\npocket loss\u201d and that it customarily includes \u201cimpairment\r\nof reputation and standing in the community, personal\r\nhumiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\u201d Id., at\r\n350.\r\n   These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)               15\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nunremarkable point that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d can\r\ninclude nonpecuniary loss. But this generic meaning does\r\nnot establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy\r\nAct, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for\r\nmental and emotional distress. As we already explained,\r\nthe term \u201cactual damages\u201d takes on different meanings in\r\ndifferent contexts.\r\n                               B\r\n   Respondent\u2019s stronger argument is that the exclusion of\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the statute simply means that\r\nthere can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy\r\nAct victims can still recover for mental and emotional\r\ndistress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 54\u201356.10\r\n   This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven\r\nmental and emotional distress does not count as general\r\ndamages. The term \u201cgeneral damages\u201d is not limited to\r\ncompensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensa\u00ad\r\ntion for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement \u00a7621,\r\nComment a (noting that general damages compensate for\r\n\u201charm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,\r\nis assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff\u2019s] reputation\u201d).\r\nTo be sure, specific proof of emotional harm is not required\r\nto recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs\r\n\u00a77.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages\r\ncannot be recovered for emotional harm that is actually\r\nproved.\r\n   Aside from the fact that general damages need not be\r\nproved, what distinguishes those damages, whether\r\nproved or not, from the only other category of compensa-\r\ntory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is\r\nthe type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, \u201cthe\r\naffront to the plaintiff\u2019s dignity and the emotional harm\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n 10 The   dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 9\u201311.\r\n16                    FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndone\u201d are \u201ccalled general damages, to distinguish them\r\nfrom proof of actual economic harm,\u201d which is called \u201cspe\u00ad\r\ncial damages.\u201d Id., \u00a73.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12\u2013\r\n13, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general\r\ndamages is special damages, not all proven damages, as\r\nrespondent would have it. Because Congress removed\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the Act\u2019s remedial provision, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for\r\nnonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and\r\ninstead waived the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity only\r\nwith respect to harm compensable as special damages.\r\n                              C\r\n  Looking beyond the Privacy Act\u2019s text, respondent\r\npoints to the use of the term \u201cactual\u201d damages in the\r\nremedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c), and\r\nthe FCRA, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o. As previously\r\nmentioned, courts have held that \u201cactual\u201d damages within\r\nthe meaning of these statutes include compensation for\r\nmental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the\r\nrule of construction that Congress intends the same lan\u00ad\r\nguage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see\r\nNorthcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412\r\nU. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that\r\nthe Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing\r\ndamages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for\r\nRespondent 25\u201332.\r\n  Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower\r\ncourt decisions are correct, they provide only weak support\r\nfor respondent\u2019s argument here. Since the term \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d can mean different things in different contexts,\r\nstatutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited\r\ninterpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither\r\nthe FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir\u00ad\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrors the Privacy Act.11 In neither of those statutes did\r\nCongress specifically decline to authorize recovery for\r\ngeneral damages as it did in the Privacy Act. Supra, at\r\n12\u201313. And most importantly, none of the lower court\r\ncases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has\r\ncited, see Brief for Respondent 29\u201331, involves the sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity canon.\r\n   Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA\u2019s\r\ngeneral liability provision does not even use the term\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d It instead provides that the \u201cUnited\r\nStates shall be liable\u201d for certain tort claims \u201cin the same\r\nmanner and to the same extent as a private individual\u201d\r\nunder relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72674, \u00b61. For that\r\nreason alone, the FTCA\u2019s general liability provision is not\r\na reliable source for interpreting the term \u201cactual damages\u201d\r\nin the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA\u2019s wrongful\u00ad\r\ndeath provision\u2014which authorizes \u201cactual or compensa-\r\ntory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting\r\nfrom such death,\u201d \u00a72674, \u00b62\u2014prove that Congress under\u00ad\r\nstood the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act to\r\ninclude nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm. To the\r\ncontrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood\r\nto entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.\r\nBecause the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not\r\nshare the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not\r\na fitting analog for construing the Act.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  11 Compare   42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c)(1) (stating that \u201cthe court may award\r\nto the plaintiff actual and punitive damages\u201d); 15 U. S. C. \u00a71681n(a)(1)\r\n(authorizing \u201c(A) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a\r\nresult of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than\r\n$1,000; or (B) . . . actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result\r\nof the failure or $1,000, whichever is greater\u201d); \u00a71681o(a)(1) (authoriz\u00ad\r\ning \u201cany actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the\r\nfailure\u201d) with 5 U.

COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\n                               D\r\n  Finally, respondent argues that excluding damages for\r\nmental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results.\r\nPersons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would\r\nbe entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only\r\nsevere and debilitating mental or emotional distress would\r\nget nothing. See Brief for Respondent 33\u201335.\r\n  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, however, there is\r\nnothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Govern\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substanti\u00ad\r\nated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent in\u00ad\r\nsists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act\u2019s\r\nremedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by delib\u00ad\r\nerately refusing to authorize general damages, Congress\r\nintended to cabin relief, not to maximize it.12\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps\r\n\r\nin our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.\r\nSee post, at 2\u20133. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our under\u00ad\r\nstanding of the canon\u2019s meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges\r\nthat statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining\r\nits meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context,\r\nsee ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes\u2014as it must in light of our\r\nreasoning in Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004)\u2014that the common law\r\nof defamation has relevance in construing the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in\r\nthe Privacy Act. See post, at 7\u20139.\r\n   The dissent\u2019s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose\r\nof the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the\r\nterm \u201cactual damages,\u201d as used in the Act, means compensatory dam\u00ad\r\nages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.\r\nThe dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary\r\nand nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the\r\nrecovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both\r\ntypes of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoid\u00ad\r\nable. The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other\r\nways\u2014for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by\r\nimposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(i);\r\nand possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To that end, the Act provides a civil\r\nremedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain\r\nagency misconduct to recover \u201cactual damages\u201d sustained\r\nas a result of the unlawful action.\r\n   Today the Court holds that \u201cactual damages\u201d is limited\r\nto pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer\r\nrecover what our precedents and common sense under-\r\nstand to be the primary, and often only, damages sus-\r\ntained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely mental\r\nor emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text,\r\nstructure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples\r\nthe Act\u2019s core purpose of redressing and deterring viola-\r\ntions of privacy interests. I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n  The majority concludes that \u201cactual damages\u201d in the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery\r\nfor pecuniary loss alone.

Yet be-\r\ncause it considers its reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d to be\r\n\u201cplausible,\u201d the majority contends that the canon of sover-\r\neign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most\r\nfavorable to the Government. Ibid.\r\n   The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority\r\nascribes it. \u201cThe sovereign immunity canon is just that\u2014a\r\ncanon of construction.

Here, traditional tools of statutory construc-\r\ntion\u2014the statute\u2019s text, structure, drafting history, and\r\npurpose\u2014provide a clear answer: The term \u201cactual dam-\r\nages\u201d permits recovery for all injuries established by\r\ncompetent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or\r\nnonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental\r\nand emotional distress. There is no need to seek refuge in\r\na canon of construction, see id., at 589\u2013590 (declining to\r\nrely on canon as there is \u201cno ambiguity left for us to con-\r\nstrue\u201d after application of \u201ctraditional tools of statutory\r\ninterpretation and considerations of stare decisis\u201d), much\r\nless one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court\u2019s\r\nhistory, see United States v.

COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nloss caused by the wrong or injury\u201d).1 There is nothing\r\ncircular about that definition.2 It is the definition this\r\nCourt adopted more than a century ago when we recog-\r\nnized that \u201c[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages\r\nmean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be\r\nthe result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the\r\namount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with\r\nthe injury suffered.\u201d Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64\r\n(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal\r\ndictionaries. See Black\u2019s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[a]n amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages\r\nthat repay actual losses.\u2014Also termed compensatory\r\ndamages; tangible damages; real damages\u201d (italics omit-\r\nted)). And it is the definition that accords with the plain\r\nand ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster\u2019s Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining\r\n\u201cactual\u201d as \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d as\r\n\u201ccompensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong\r\nor injury caused by a violation of a legal right\u201d). Thus,\r\nboth as a term of art and in its plain meaning, \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d connotes compensation for proven injuries or\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary also defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as synony-\r\n\r\nmous with \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d Black\u2019s 467. While \u201cgeneral damages\u201d\r\nhas a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander\r\ncases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that \u201cdid in\r\nfact result from the wrong, directly and proximately.\u201d Black\u2019s 468.\r\n  2 The majority declares the definition circular because \u201cdefining \u2018ac-\r\n\r\ntual\u2019 damages by reference to \u2018actual\u2019 injury is hardly helpful when our\r\ntask is to determine what Congress meant by \u2018actual.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9, n. 4.\r\n\u201cActual injury,\u201d however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This\r\nCourt already has recognized in the defamation context that \u201cactual\r\ninjury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.\u201d Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,\r\n418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the\r\nterms. See Black\u2019s 53, 924 (defining \u201cactual\u201d as \u201c[r]eal; substantial;\r\nexisting presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed\r\nto that which is merely theoretical or possible,\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201c[a]ny\r\nwrong or damage done to another\u201d).\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven\r\ninjuries need be pecuniary in nature.\r\n  The majority discards all this on the asserted ground\r\nthat \u201cthe precise meaning of the term \u2018changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 7 (quoting\r\n622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is\r\nrelevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues\r\nthat Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its\r\nordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule\r\ncannot, however, render irrelevant\u2014as the majority would\r\nhave it\u2014the ordinary meaning of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n  Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim\r\nthat \u201cactual damages\u201d has no fixed meaning undermines\u2014\r\nrather than supports\u2014its holding. Each cited authority\r\ninvolves either a statute in which Congress expressly\r\ndirected that compensation be measured in strictly eco-\r\nnomic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of\r\n1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable\r\nconsequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3\r\nNeither factor is present here. Notably absent from the\r\nPrivacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that \u201cac-\r\ntual damages\u201d should be limited to economic loss. And\r\nwhile \u201c \u2018 \u201churt feelings\u201d over the nature of the [copyright]\r\ninfringement\u2019 \u201d may \u201chave no place in the actual damages\r\ncalculus\u201d under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quot-\r\ning in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917\r\n(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding\r\nthat \u201churt feelings\u201d are equally invalid in an Act con-\r\ncerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while\r\ncontext is no doubt relevant, the majority\u2019s cited authority\r\ndoes little to help its cause in the stated context of this\r\nstatute.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 See 28 U.

The Act re-\r\nquires agencies to \u201cestablish appropriate administrative,\r\ntechnical, and physical safeguards\u201d to ensure against\r\nsecurity breaches that could result in \u201csubstantial harm,\r\nembarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any indi-\r\nvidual.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies\r\nto \u201cmaintain all records\u201d used in making a determination\r\nabout an individual in a manner that is \u201creasonably neces-\r\nsary to assure fairness to the individual in the determina-\r\ntion.\u201d \u00a7552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of\r\nthe Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting\r\nagainst \u201cembarrassment\u201d; there is no additional require-\r\nment that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency\u2019s\r\nintentional or willful violation of those duties triggers\r\nliability for \u201cactual damages\u201d under \u00a7552a(g)(4) in the\r\nevent of an adverse impact. \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C)\u2013(D), (g)(4).\r\n   Adopting a reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d that permits\r\nrecovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect\r\nbetween the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial provisions. It\r\nallows a swath of Government violations to go unreme-\r\ndied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo\r\nestablishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment\r\nand no successful private action could be taken against it\r\nfor the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation\r\nof \u201cactual damages\u201d that permits recovery for nonpecuni-\r\nary harms harmonizes the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial\r\nprovisions. Robinson v.

It (correctly) in-\r\nfers from them that the Act \u201cserves interests similar to\r\nthose protected by defamation and privacy torts.\u201d Ante,\r\nat 9. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540\r\nU. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act\u2019s civil-remedies provi-\r\nsion \u201cparallels\u201d the remedial scheme for the common-law\r\ntorts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery\r\nof \u201cgeneral damages\u201d (i.e., presumed damages) only if a\r\nplaintiff first establishes \u201cspecial damages\u201d (i.e., monetary\r\nloss).5 Ante, at 10. That \u201cparallel,\u201d the majority con-\r\ncludes, \u201csuggests the possibility that Congress intended\r\nthe term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Act to mean special dam-\r\nages.\u201d Ante, at 11.\r\n  The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive\r\n\r\nrelief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C) and\r\n(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a\r\nlimited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to\r\na record. See \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like peti-\r\ntioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an inten-\r\ntional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under\r\nthe majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n   5 As the majority notes, \u201cgeneral damages\u201d at common law refers to\r\n\r\ndamages \u201cpresumed\u201d to accrue from the violation of the legally pro-\r\ntected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,\r\nLaw of Remedies \u00a77.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,\r\nat 621. \u201cSpecial damages,\u201d in contrast, \u201cmeant monetary loss.\u201d Dobbs \u00a77.2,\r\nat 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling\r\nwithin the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to\r\nrecover \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at\r\n621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,\r\nwhich permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d See Dobbs, \u00a77.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in\r\ndefamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary\r\ninjuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 521;\r\nDoe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase was the question whether the Act\u2019s civil-suit provi-\r\nsion authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award\r\nof $1,000 absent proof of some \u201cactual damages.\u201d The\r\nCourt answered in the negative, and in the course of doing\r\nso replied to petitioner\u2019s argument that there was \u201csome-\r\nthing peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . .\r\nonly to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual dam-\r\nages.\u201d 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the\r\nAct\u2019s parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting\r\nthat nothing was \u201cpeculiar\u201d about the Act\u2019s remedial\r\nscheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d means economic loss alone. Indeed, it\r\nexpressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12.\r\n  The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the\r\nAct\u2019s parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest\r\nCongress intended \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress\r\n\u201cwould probably have known about\u201d defamation per quod\r\nactions, id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that\r\nCongress did not write \u201cspecial damages\u201d in the civil-\r\nremedies provision. This Court is typically not in the\r\nbusiness of substituting words we think Congress in-\r\ntended to use for words Congress in fact used. Yet that is\r\nprecisely what the majority does when it rewrites \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial damages.\u201d6 In sum, the statu-\r\ntory context, and in particular the Act\u2019s substantive provi-\r\nsions, confirms the ordinary meaning of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\nAlthough the Act shares parallels with common-law defa-\r\nmation torts, such analogies do not warrant a reading of\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used\r\n\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d in place of \u201cspecial damages\u201d to note that Congress\r\nwould not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the\r\nlatter. Ante, at 11\u201312. But that a handful of lower courts on occasion\r\nhave been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis to assume\r\nthe Legislature has been equally careless in the text of a statute.\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S.,\r\nat 622.\r\n   As the Court explained in Doe, \u201c[t]he deletion of \u2018general\r\ndamages\u2019 from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate\r\nelimination of any possibility of imputing harm and\r\nawarding presumed damages.\u201d Id., at 623; see also id., at\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   7 There is yet another flaw in the majority\u2019s reasoning. At common\r\n\r\nlaw a plaintiff who successfully established \u201cspecial damages\u201d in an\r\naction for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for\r\nemotional and mental distress. See ante, at 10; n. 5, supra. If \u201cCon-\r\ngress intended the term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Act to mean special\r\ndamages,\u201d ante, at 11, then an individual who successfully establishes\r\nsome pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act\u2014presumably as trivial\r\nas the cost of a bottle of Tylenol\u2014should be permitted to recover for\r\nemotional and mental distress. The majority, of course, does not accept\r\nthat result, and its piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines\r\nits assertion that Congress intended \u201cspecial damages\u201d in place of\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n   8 See S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7303(c)(1) (1974); H.

The elimination of presumed damages from the\r\nbill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left\r\nbehind\u2014\u201cactual damages\u201d\u2014comprised damages that are\r\nnot presumed, i.e., damages proven by competent evidence\r\nin the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.\r\n323, 349\u2013350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context\r\nbetween presumed damages and damages for actual inju-\r\nries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which\r\ninclude \u201cimpairment of reputation and standing in the\r\ncommunity, personal humiliation, and mental anguish\r\nand suffering\u201d); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262\u2013264\r\n(1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and\r\nproven damages for mental and emotional distress).\r\n   Rather than view the deletion of general damages (pre-\r\nsumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven dam-\r\nages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a\r\nsubset of proven damages\u2014those of an economic nature,\r\ni.e., \u201cspecial damages.\u201d Once again, however, the major-\r\nity\u2019s insistence that \u201cCongress intended \u2018actual damages\u2019 in\r\nthe Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecu-\r\nniary loss,\u201d ante, at 13, finds no basis in the statutory text,\r\nsee supra, at 8. And its response to the conclusion that\r\nCongress retained recovery for proven damages when it\r\neliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying.\r\nThe majority declares such a conclusion \u201cflawed\u201d because\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d \u201cincludes compensation for proven\r\ninjuries as well,\u201d so that \u201cwhat distinguishes [general]\r\ndamages, whether proved or not, from the only other\r\ncategory of compensatory damages available in the rele-\r\nvant common-law suits is the type of harm\u201d the term\r\nencompasses\u2014which the majority takes to be emotional\r\nharm alone. Ante, at 15\u201316. That assertion is defective on\r\ntwo scores. First, a plaintiff \u2019s ability to present proof of\r\ninjury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S., at 621; see also id., at\r\n623; n. 5, supra. Second, \u201cgeneral damages\u201d is not limited\r\nto a \u201ctype\u201d of harm. The majority\u2019s contrary assertion that\r\nthe term permits recovery only for emotional \u201ctypes\u201d of\r\nharm overlooks the fact that \u201cgeneral damages are partly\r\nbased on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable\r\npecuniary losses.\u201d Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It\r\nthus was established at common law that in a defamation\r\nper se action, \u201cthe plaintiff is usually free to prove what-\r\never actual pecuniary loss he can,\u201d and \u201cthe jury may be\r\npermitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the\r\ntip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-\r\nproven, and award damage accordingly.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following\r\nsyllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in\r\ndefamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery\r\nfor \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d it must have meant to retain recov-\r\nery only for \u201cspecial damages.\u201d That syllogism, of course,\r\nignores that there is another category of damages. It is\r\nthe very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy\r\nAct: \u201cActual damages.\u201d However much Congress may\r\nhave drawn \u201cparallels,\u201d ante, at 10, between the Act and\r\nthe common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that\r\nCongress expressly choose not to use the words \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d9\r\n                            D\r\n  I turn finally to the statute\u2019s purpose, for \u201c[a]s in all\r\ncases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study\r\n\r\nCommission in support of its interpretation of \u201cactual damages.\u201d The\r\nmajority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratex-\r\ntual material is due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated\r\nconclusions persuasive.\r\n12                     FAA v.

The purposes of the Priv-\r\nacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent\r\nwith interpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d according to its ordi-\r\nnary meaning.\r\n   \u201cThe historical context of the Act is important to an\r\nunderstanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Con-\r\ngress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance\r\nand investigation of individuals by federal agencies that\r\nhad been exposed during the Watergate scandal.\u201d Dept.\r\nof Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of\r\nthe Privacy Act 4 (2010). In particular, Congress recog-\r\nnized that \u201cthe increasing use of computers and sophisti-\r\ncated information technology . . . has greatly magnified\r\nthe harm to individual privacy that can occur from any\r\ncollection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal\r\ninformation.\u201d \u00a72(a), 88 Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to\r\nprivacy as \u201ca personal and fundamental right,\u201d Congress\r\nfound it \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d to enact the Privacy Act\r\n\u201cin order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in\r\ninformation systems maintained by Federal agencies.\u201d\r\nIbid.\r\n   Congress explained that the \u201cpurpose of this Act is to\r\nprovide certain safeguards for an individual against an\r\ninvasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agen-\r\ncies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,\u201d inter alia,\r\n\u201cbe subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a\r\nresult of willful or intentional action which violates any\r\nindividual\u2019s rights under this Act.\u201d \u00a72(b)(6), ibid.

It signals unmistakably congressional recognition\r\nthat the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing\r\nthe Act\u2019s purposes.\r\n  Reading \u201cactual damages\u201d to permit recovery for any\r\ninjury established by competent evidence in the record\u2014\r\npecuniary or not\u2014best effectuates the statute\u2019s basic\r\npurpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result\r\nin economic loss, we have recognized time and again that\r\nthe primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes\r\nmental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc.\r\nv. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (\u201cIn the \u2018right of\r\nprivacy\u2019 cases the primary damage is the mental dis-\r\ntress\u201d); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (\u201c[A]ctual injury\u201d\r\nin defamatory falsehood cases \u201cis not limited to out-of-\r\npocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual\r\nharm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impair-\r\nment of reputation and standing in the community, per-\r\nsonal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\u201d).\r\nAccord, 2 Dobbs \u00a77.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a\r\ndignitary interest, and \u201cin a great many of the cases\u201d in\r\nwhich the interest is invaded \u201cthe only harm is the affront\r\nto the plaintiff \u2019s dignity as a human being, the damage to\r\nhis self-image, and the resulting mental distress\u201d). That\r\naccords with common sense.\r\n  In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not\r\nforget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri-\r\nvacy. The majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d renders\r\nthe remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly\r\nunlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely\r\nnonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Con-\r\ngress\u2019 stated purpose. The majority, however, does not\r\ngrapple with the ramifications of its opinion. It acknowl-\r\nedges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd\r\nresults as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor\r\n14                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\npecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering\r\nsevere mental anguish to recover nothing. But it con-\r\ncludes that \u201cthere is nothing absurd about a scheme that\r\nlimits the Government\u2019s Privacy Act liability to harm that\r\ncan be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress\u2019\r\nprerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,\r\nnamely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of\r\nprivacy without remedying the primary harm that results\r\nfrom invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is\r\nthat one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the\r\nstatute before us that Congress intended such a result.\r\nNowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint\r\nthat it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of\r\nremedy than debilitating mental distress, and the major-\r\nity\u2019s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emo-\r\ntional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integ-\r\nrity that privacy protects.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial\r\nthe resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by\r\na federal agency\u2019s intentional or willful violation of the\r\nPrivacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she\r\nis able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result\r\nCongress intended when it enacted an Act with the ex-\r\npress purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against\r\nGovernment invasion. And it is not a result remotely\r\nsuggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of\r\nthe Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n",

Argued November 30, 2011\u2014Decided March 28, 2012\r\nRespondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human im-\r\n  munodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Admin-\r\n  istration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical cer-\r\n  tificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with\r\n  HIV. Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Ad-\r\n  ministration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the\r\n  basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with\r\n  the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding in-\r\n  formation about his condition. The Department of Transportation\r\n  (DOT), the FAA\u2019s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga-\r\n  tion with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had ob-\r\n  tained FAA certifications. The DOT provided the SSA with the\r\n  names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT\r\n  with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had\r\n  also received disability benefits. Respondent\u2019s name appeared on the\r\n  spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had\r\n  intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the\r\n  FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for mak-\r\n  ing false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and\r\n  was fined and sentenced to probation. He then filed suit, alleging\r\n  that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which\r\n  contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of rec-\r\n  ords held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an aggrieved\r\n  individual to sue for \u201cactual damages,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(g)(4)(A), if\r\n  the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act\u2019s require-\r\n  ments in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specifical-\r\n  ly, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his\r\n2                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    confidential medical information had caused him mental and emo-\r\n    tional distress. The District Court concluded that the Government\r\n    had violated the Act. But, finding the term \u201cactual damages\u201d ambig-\r\n    uous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which pro-\r\n    vides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in\r\n    the Government\u2019s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the\r\n    recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the\r\n    Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act is not am-\r\n    biguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.\r\nHeld: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for\r\n mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Gov-\r\n ernment\u2019s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 4\u2013\r\n 19.\r\n    (a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally ex-\r\n pressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192,\r\n and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United\r\n States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a\r\n plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money\r\n damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village,\r\n Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 5\u20136.\r\n    (b) The term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act is a legal term of\r\n art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, \u201c \u2018presumably\r\n knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each bor-\r\n rowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,\u2019 \u201d Molzof\r\n v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise\r\n meaning of \u201cactual damages\u201d is far from clear. Although the term is\r\n sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been\r\n used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary\r\n harm. Because of the term\u2019s chameleon-like quality, it must be con-\r\n sidered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 6\u20139.\r\n    (c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by\r\n defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which\r\n plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove\r\n at least some \u201cactual damages,\u201d \u201cparallels\u201d the common-law torts of\r\n libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover \u201cgen-\r\n eral damages\u201d if they first prove \u201cspecial damages.\u201d Doe v. Chao, 540\r\n U. S. 614, 625. \u201cSpecial damages\u201d are limited to actual pecuniary\r\n loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. \u201cGeneral damag-\r\n es\u201d cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This\r\n parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term \u201cac-\r\n tual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial damages,\u201d thus barring Privacy Act\r\n victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pe-\r\n cuniary harm. That Congress would choose \u201cactual damages\u201d instead\r\n of \u201cspecial damages\u201d is not without precedent, as the terms have oc-\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  casionally been used interchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about\r\n  the plausibility of construing \u201cactual damages\u201d as special damages in\r\n  the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress\u2019 deliberate refusal to allow\r\n  recovery for \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d In common-law defamation and pri-\r\n  vacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory\r\n  damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to\r\n  authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress in-\r\n  tended the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act to mean special damag-\r\n  es for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 9\u201314.\r\n     (d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by\r\n  the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it\r\n  is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic\r\n  loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court\r\n  adopts an interpretation of \u201cactual damages\u201d limited to proven pecu-\r\n  niary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress\u2019\r\n  sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly\r\n  requires. P. 14.\r\n     (e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) common-law\r\n  cases often define \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean all compensatory dam-\r\n  ages; (2) the elimination of \u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the Privacy Act\r\n  means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but\r\n  plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress;\r\n  (3) because some courts have construed \u201cactual damages\u201d in similar\r\n  statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must\r\n  have intended \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Act to include mental and\r\n  emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages\r\n  would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act\u2019s remedial\r\n  purpose. None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immuni-\r\n  ty canon.

S. C.\r\n\u00a7552a, contains a comprehensive and detailed set of re\u00ad\r\nquirements for the management of confidential records\r\nheld by Executive Branch agencies. If an agency fails to\r\ncomply with those requirements \u201cin such a way as to have\r\nan adverse effect on an individual,\u201d the Act authorizes the\r\nindividual to bring a civil action against the agency.\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(1)(D). For violations found to be \u201cintentional or\r\nwillful,\u201d the United States is liable for \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(4)(A). In this case, we must decide whether the\r\nterm \u201cactual damages,\u201d as used in the Privacy Act, in\u00ad\r\ncludes damages for mental or emotional distress. We hold\r\nthat it does not.\r\n                                I\r\n   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires\r\npilots to obtain a pilot certificate and medical certificate as\r\na precondition for operating an aircraft. 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a761.3(a),\r\n(c) (2011).

When applying for renewal, pilots\r\nmust disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they\r\nhave had, and they must identify any medications they are\r\ntaking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.\r\n   Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot\r\nsince 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human im-\r\nmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking\r\nantiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not\r\nissue medical certificates to persons with respondent\u2019s\r\ncondition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal\r\nof his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded\r\nhimself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he ap-\r\nplied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so\r\nwithout disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He\r\nrenewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004,\r\neach time intentionally withholding information about his\r\ncondition.\r\n   When respondent\u2019s health deteriorated in 1995, he\r\napplied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of\r\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7401 et seq. To sub\u00ad\r\nstantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the\r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA), which awarded him\r\nbenefits for the year from August 1995 to August 1996.\r\n   In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the\r\nFAA\u2019s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga\u00ad\r\ntion with the SSA, known as \u201cOperation Safe Pilot,\u201d to\r\nidentify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA\r\ncertifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names\r\nand other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots\r\nin northern California. The SSA then compared the list\r\nwith its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a\r\nspreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.\r\n   The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current\r\nmedical certificate but had also received disability bene\u00ad\r\nfits. After reviewing respondent\u2019s FAA medical file and\r\nhis SSA disability file, FAA flight surgeons determined in\r\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

Because of\r\nthese fraudulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent\u2019s\r\npilot certificate, and he was indicted on three counts of\r\nmaking false statements to a Government agency, in\r\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001. Respondent ultimately\r\npleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a\r\nfalse official writing, in violation of \u00a71018. He was sen\u00ad\r\ntenced to two years of probation and fined $1,000.1\r\n   Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter\r\nGovernment) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his\r\nrecords with one another, respondent filed suit in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\r\nCalifornia. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the\r\nDOT of his confidential medical information, including his\r\nHIV status, had caused him \u201chumiliation, embarrassment,\r\nmental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe\r\nemotional distress.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a.

But the\r\ncourt nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,\r\nthe term includes damages for mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Looking to what it described as \u201c[i]ntrinsic\u201d and\r\n\u201c[e]xtrinsic\u201d sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded\r\nthat the meaning of \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy\r\nAct is not ambiguous and that \u201ca construction that limits\r\nrecovery to pecuniary loss\u201d is not \u201cplausible,\u201d id., at 1034.\r\n   The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing\r\nen banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at\r\n1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and\r\nwe granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                          II\r\n  Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen\u00ad\r\nsation from the Government for mental and emotional\r\nharm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi\u00ad\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nnondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a\r\nwritten request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that\r\nmaintains the record. See \u00a7552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could\r\neasily have shared respondent\u2019s medical records pursuant to the\r\nprocedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con\u00ad\r\ncluded that they failed to do so.\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nsion of the Privacy Act waives the Government\u2019s sovereign\r\nimmunity with respect to such a recovery.\r\n                             A\r\n   We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity must be \u201cunequivocally expressed\u201d in\r\nstatutory text. See, e.g., Lane v. Pe\u00f1a, 518 U. S. 187, 192\r\n(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,\r\n33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\r\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a\r\nwaiver that is not clearly evident from the language of\r\nthe statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the\r\nstatutory language are to be construed in favor of immu-\r\nnity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),\r\nso that the Government\u2019s consent to be sued is never en-\r\nlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,\r\nRuckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685\u2013686 (1983)\r\n(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,\r\n686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter\u00ad\r\npretation of the statute that would not authorize money\r\ndamages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,\r\nat 34, 37.\r\n   The question that confronts us here is not whether\r\nCongress has consented to be sued for damages under the\r\nPrivacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which\r\nexpressly authorizes recovery from the Government for\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d Rather, the question at issue concerns\r\nthe scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we\r\nrefuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously\r\nexpressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities\r\nin the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,\r\nsupra, at 192.\r\n   Although this canon of interpretation requires an un\u00ad\r\nmistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to\r\nwaive the Government\u2019s immunity, Congress need not\r\nstate its intent in any particular way. We have never\r\n6                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,\r\nwe have observed that the sovereign immunity canon \u201cis\r\na tool for interpreting the law\u201d and that it does not \u201cdis\u00ad\r\nplac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc\u00ad\r\ntion.\u201d Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.\r\n571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of\r\nCongress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory\r\ntext in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,\r\nthen we take the interpretation most favorable to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n                               B\r\n   The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides\r\nthat, for any \u201cintentional or willful\u201d refusal or failure to\r\ncomply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for\r\n\u201cactual damages sustained by the individual as a result of\r\nthe refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled\r\nto recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define \u201cactual\r\ndamages,\u201d respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word \u201cactual\u201d as it is defined in standard\r\ngeneral-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals\r\nexplained, \u201cactual damages\u201d is a legal term of art, 622\r\nF. 3d, at 1028, and it is a \u201ccardinal rule of statutory con\u00ad\r\nstruction\u201d that, when Congress employs a term of art, \u201c \u2018it\r\npresumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that\r\nwere attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn\u00ad\r\ning from which it was taken,\u2019 \u201d Molzof v. United States, 502\r\nU. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,\r\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).\r\n   Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d is far from clear. The latest edition of Black\u2019s\r\nLaw Dictionary available when Congress enacted the\r\nPrivacy Act defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[r]eal, substan\u00ad\r\ntial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com\u00ad\r\nplainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or\r\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

But this\r\ngeneral (and notably circular) definition is of little value\r\nhere because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,\r\nthe precise meaning of the term \u201cchanges with the specific\r\nstatute in which it is found.\u201d 622 F. 3d, at 1029.\r\n   The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu\u00ad\r\nniary harm. Take, for instance, some courts\u2019 interpreta\u00ad\r\ntions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c),\r\nand the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\r\n\u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed \u201cac\u00ad\r\ntual\u201d damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes\r\nto include compensation for mental and emotional dis\u00ad\r\ntress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,\r\n636\u2013638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages\r\nunder the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a73612, the predecessor to\r\n\u00a73613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d\r\n380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the\r\nFHA \u201care not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may\r\ninclude an award for emotional distress and humiliation\u201d);\r\nThompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682\r\nF. 2d 509, 513\u2013514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining\r\nthat, \u201c[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,\r\nhumiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable\r\nelements of damage\u201d under the FCRA); Millstone v.\r\nO\u2019Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834\u2013835 (CA8 1976)\r\n(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for \u201closs\r\nof sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish\u201d).\r\n   In other contexts, however, the term has been used or\r\nconstrued more narrowly to authorize damages for only\r\npecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the\r\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress\r\nauthorized \u201cactual or compensatory damages, measured\r\nby the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.\u201d 28\r\nU. S. C. \u00a72674, \u00b62. At least one court has defined \u201cactual\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndamages\u201d in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7101(b)\r\n(1970 ed.), as \u201cthe extent to which the market value of\r\na copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an\r\ninfringement.\u201d Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-\r\nMayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d 505, 512 (CA9 1985); see also\r\nMackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding\r\nthat \u201c \u2018hurt feelings\u2019 over the nature of the infringement\u201d\r\nhave no place in the actual damages calculus). And some\r\ncourts have construed \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Securities\r\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(a), to mean \u201csome\r\nform of economic loss.\u201d Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc.,\r\n556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v.

The dissent says that the defini\u00ad\r\ntion\u2014\u201c \u2018[a]ctual damages\u2019 compensate for actual injury\u201d\u2014is \u201cplain\r\nenough.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But defining \u201cactual\u201d\r\ndamages by reference to \u201cactual\u201d injury is hardly helpful when our task\r\nis to determine what Congress meant by \u201cactual.\u201d The dissent\u2019s refer\u00ad\r\nence to the current version of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which provides\r\nthat \u201cactual damages\u201d can mean \u201ctangible damages,\u201d only highlights\r\nthe term\u2019s ambiguity. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIf \u201cactual damages\u201d can mean \u201ctangible damages,\u201d then it can be\r\nconstrued not to include intangible harm, like mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Similarly unhelpful is the dissent\u2019s citation to a general\u00ad\r\npurpose dictionary that defines \u201cactual\u201d as \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d\r\nand \u201cdamages\u201d as \u201ccompensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a\r\nwrong or injury.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 22,\r\n571 (2002) (emphasis added). Combining these two lay definitions says\r\nnothing about whether compensation for mental and emotional distress\r\nis in fact imposed by law. The definitions merely beg the question we\r\nare trying to answer. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d has taken on different meanings in different statutes, as our\r\nexamples amply illustrate.\r\n10                         FAA v.

The basic idea is that\r\nPrivacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slan\u00ad\r\nder, are barred from any recovery unless they can first\r\nshow actual\u2014that is, pecuniary or material\u2014harm. Upon\r\nshowing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they\r\ncan recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably\r\nfor any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to\r\nuse the term \u201cactual damages\u201d instead of \u201cspecial damages\u201d\r\nwas not without precedent. The terms had occasionally\r\nbeen used interchangeably.

But because the Privacy Act\r\nwaives the Federal Government\u2019s sovereign immunity, the\r\nquestion we must answer is whether it is plausible to read\r\nthe statute, as the Government does, to authorize only\r\ndamages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\r\n34, 37. When waiving the Government\u2019s sovereign im\u00ad\r\nmunity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518\r\nU. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a\r\nconsequence, we adopt an interpretation of \u201cactual dam\u00ad\r\nages\u201d limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To\r\ndo otherwise would expand the scope of Congress\u2019 sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text\r\nclearly requires.\r\n                          III\r\n  None of respondent\u2019s contrary arguments suffices to\r\novercome the sovereign immunity canon.\r\n                             A\r\n   Respondent notes that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d has\r\noften been defined broadly in common-law cases, and in\r\nour own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 18\u201325. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo\u00ad\r\nlidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we\r\nobserved that \u201c[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam\u00ad\r\nages mean the same thing.\u201d Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert\r\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual\r\ninjury in the defamation context \u201cis not limited to out-of\u00ad\r\npocket loss\u201d and that it customarily includes \u201cimpairment\r\nof reputation and standing in the community, personal\r\nhumiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\u201d Id., at\r\n350.\r\n   These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)               15\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nunremarkable point that the term \u201cactual damages\u201d can\r\ninclude nonpecuniary loss. But this generic meaning does\r\nnot establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy\r\nAct, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for\r\nmental and emotional distress. As we already explained,\r\nthe term \u201cactual damages\u201d takes on different meanings in\r\ndifferent contexts.\r\n                               B\r\n   Respondent\u2019s stronger argument is that the exclusion of\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the statute simply means that\r\nthere can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy\r\nAct victims can still recover for mental and emotional\r\ndistress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 54\u201356.10\r\n   This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven\r\nmental and emotional distress does not count as general\r\ndamages. The term \u201cgeneral damages\u201d is not limited to\r\ncompensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensa\u00ad\r\ntion for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement \u00a7621,\r\nComment a (noting that general damages compensate for\r\n\u201charm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,\r\nis assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff\u2019s] reputation\u201d).\r\nTo be sure, specific proof of emotional harm is not required\r\nto recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs\r\n\u00a77.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages\r\ncannot be recovered for emotional harm that is actually\r\nproved.\r\n   Aside from the fact that general damages need not be\r\nproved, what distinguishes those damages, whether\r\nproved or not, from the only other category of compensa-\r\ntory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is\r\nthe type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, \u201cthe\r\naffront to the plaintiff\u2019s dignity and the emotional harm\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n 10 The   dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 9\u201311.\r\n16                    FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndone\u201d are \u201ccalled general damages, to distinguish them\r\nfrom proof of actual economic harm,\u201d which is called \u201cspe\u00ad\r\ncial damages.\u201d Id., \u00a73.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12\u2013\r\n13, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general\r\ndamages is special damages, not all proven damages, as\r\nrespondent would have it. Because Congress removed\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d from the Act\u2019s remedial provision, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for\r\nnonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and\r\ninstead waived the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity only\r\nwith respect to harm compensable as special damages.\r\n                              C\r\n  Looking beyond the Privacy Act\u2019s text, respondent\r\npoints to the use of the term \u201cactual\u201d damages in the\r\nremedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c), and\r\nthe FCRA, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71681n, 1681o. As previously\r\nmentioned, courts have held that \u201cactual\u201d damages within\r\nthe meaning of these statutes include compensation for\r\nmental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the\r\nrule of construction that Congress intends the same lan\u00ad\r\nguage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see\r\nNorthcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412\r\nU. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that\r\nthe Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing\r\ndamages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for\r\nRespondent 25\u201332.\r\n  Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower\r\ncourt decisions are correct, they provide only weak support\r\nfor respondent\u2019s argument here. Since the term \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d can mean different things in different contexts,\r\nstatutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited\r\ninterpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither\r\nthe FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir\u00ad\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrors the Privacy Act.11 In neither of those statutes did\r\nCongress specifically decline to authorize recovery for\r\ngeneral damages as it did in the Privacy Act. Supra, at\r\n12\u201313. And most importantly, none of the lower court\r\ncases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has\r\ncited, see Brief for Respondent 29\u201331, involves the sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity canon.\r\n   Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA\u2019s\r\ngeneral liability provision does not even use the term\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d It instead provides that the \u201cUnited\r\nStates shall be liable\u201d for certain tort claims \u201cin the same\r\nmanner and to the same extent as a private individual\u201d\r\nunder relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72674, \u00b61. For that\r\nreason alone, the FTCA\u2019s general liability provision is not\r\na reliable source for interpreting the term \u201cactual damages\u201d\r\nin the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA\u2019s wrongful\u00ad\r\ndeath provision\u2014which authorizes \u201cactual or compensa-\r\ntory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting\r\nfrom such death,\u201d \u00a72674, \u00b62\u2014prove that Congress under\u00ad\r\nstood the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in the Privacy Act to\r\ninclude nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm. To the\r\ncontrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood\r\nto entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.\r\nBecause the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not\r\nshare the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not\r\na fitting analog for construing the Act.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  11 Compare   42 U. S. C. \u00a73613(c)(1) (stating that \u201cthe court may award\r\nto the plaintiff actual and punitive damages\u201d); 15 U. S.

COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\n                               D\r\n  Finally, respondent argues that excluding damages for\r\nmental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results.\r\nPersons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would\r\nbe entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only\r\nsevere and debilitating mental or emotional distress would\r\nget nothing. See Brief for Respondent 33\u201335.\r\n  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, however, there is\r\nnothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Govern\u00ad\r\nment\u2019s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substanti\u00ad\r\nated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent in\u00ad\r\nsists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act\u2019s\r\nremedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by delib\u00ad\r\nerately refusing to authorize general damages, Congress\r\nintended to cabin relief, not to maximize it.12\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps\r\n\r\nin our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sover\u00ad\r\neign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.\r\nSee post, at 2\u20133. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our under\u00ad\r\nstanding of the canon\u2019s meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges\r\nthat statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining\r\nits meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context,\r\nsee ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes\u2014as it must in light of our\r\nreasoning in Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004)\u2014that the common law\r\nof defamation has relevance in construing the term \u201cactual damages\u201d in\r\nthe Privacy Act. See post, at 7\u20139.\r\n   The dissent\u2019s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose\r\nof the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the\r\nterm \u201cactual damages,\u201d as used in the Act, means compensatory dam\u00ad\r\nages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.\r\nThe dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary\r\nand nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the\r\nrecovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both\r\ntypes of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoid\u00ad\r\nable. The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other\r\nways\u2014for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by\r\nimposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(i);\r\nand possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To that end, the Act provides a civil\r\nremedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain\r\nagency misconduct to recover \u201cactual damages\u201d sustained\r\nas a result of the unlawful action.\r\n   Today the Court holds that \u201cactual damages\u201d is limited\r\nto pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer\r\nrecover what our precedents and common sense under-\r\nstand to be the primary, and often only, damages sus-\r\ntained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely mental\r\nor emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text,\r\nstructure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples\r\nthe Act\u2019s core purpose of redressing and deterring viola-\r\ntions of privacy interests. I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n  The majority concludes that \u201cactual damages\u201d in the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery\r\nfor pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpre-\r\ntation is not compelled by the plain text of the statute or\r\notherwise required by any other traditional tool of statu-\r\n2                      FAA v.

Yet be-\r\ncause it considers its reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d to be\r\n\u201cplausible,\u201d the majority contends that the canon of sover-\r\neign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most\r\nfavorable to the Government. Ibid.\r\n   The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority\r\nascribes it. \u201cThe sovereign immunity canon is just that\u2014a\r\ncanon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law,\r\nand we have never held that it displaces the other tra-\r\nditional tools of statutory construction.\u201d Richlin Security\r\nService Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008) (opinion\r\nof ALITO, J.). Here, traditional tools of statutory construc-\r\ntion\u2014the statute\u2019s text, structure, drafting history, and\r\npurpose\u2014provide a clear answer: The term \u201cactual dam-\r\nages\u201d permits recovery for all injuries established by\r\ncompetent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or\r\nnonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental\r\nand emotional distress. There is no need to seek refuge in\r\na canon of construction, see id., at 589\u2013590 (declining to\r\nrely on canon as there is \u201cno ambiguity left for us to con-\r\nstrue\u201d after application of \u201ctraditional tools of statutory\r\ninterpretation and considerations of stare decisis\u201d), much\r\nless one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court\u2019s\r\nhistory, see United States v.

Nicklos Drill-\r\ning Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992). The language of the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act is clear.\r\n   At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black\u2019s Law Dic-\r\ntionary defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[r]eal, substantial\r\nand just damages, or the amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant in compensation for his actual and real loss or in-\r\njury\u201d and as \u201c[s]ynonymous with \u2018compensatory damages.\u2019 \u201d\r\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter\r\nBlack\u2019s). The majority claims this is a \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cno-\r\ntably circular\u201d definition, ante, at 7, but it is unclear why.\r\nThe definition is plain enough: \u201cActual damages\u201d compen-\r\nsate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous\r\nwith compensatory damages. See Black\u2019s 467 (defining\r\n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d as damages that \u201cwill compen-\r\nsate the injured party for the injury sustained, and noth-\r\ning more; such as will simply make good or replace the\r\n4                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nloss caused by the wrong or injury\u201d).1 There is nothing\r\ncircular about that definition.2 It is the definition this\r\nCourt adopted more than a century ago when we recog-\r\nnized that \u201c[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages\r\nmean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be\r\nthe result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the\r\namount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with\r\nthe injury suffered.\u201d Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64\r\n(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal\r\ndictionaries. See Black\u2019s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d as \u201c[a]n amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages\r\nthat repay actual losses.\u2014Also termed compensatory\r\ndamages; tangible damages; real damages\u201d (italics omit-\r\nted)). And it is the definition that accords with the plain\r\nand ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster\u2019s Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining\r\n\u201cactual\u201d as \u201cexisting in fact or reality\u201d and \u201cdamages\u201d as\r\n\u201ccompensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong\r\nor injury caused by a violation of a legal right\u201d). Thus,\r\nboth as a term of art and in its plain meaning, \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d connotes compensation for proven injuries or\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  1 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary also defined \u201cactual damages\u201d as synony-\r\n\r\nmous with \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d Black\u2019s 467. While \u201cgeneral damages\u201d\r\nhas a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander\r\ncases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that \u201cdid in\r\nfact result from the wrong, directly and proximately.\u201d Black\u2019s 468.\r\n  2 The majority declares the definition circular because \u201cdefining \u2018ac-\r\n\r\ntual\u2019 damages by reference to \u2018actual\u2019 injury is hardly helpful when our\r\ntask is to determine what Congress meant by \u2018actual.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9, n. 4.\r\n\u201cActual injury,\u201d however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This\r\nCourt already has recognized in the defamation context that \u201cactual\r\ninjury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.\u201d Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,\r\n418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the\r\nterms. See Black\u2019s 53, 924 (defining \u201cactual\u201d as \u201c[r]eal; substantial;\r\nexisting presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed\r\nto that which is merely theoretical or possible,\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d as \u201c[a]ny\r\nwrong or damage done to another\u201d).\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven\r\ninjuries need be pecuniary in nature.\r\n  The majority discards all this on the asserted ground\r\nthat \u201cthe precise meaning of the term \u2018changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 7 (quoting\r\n622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is\r\nrelevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues\r\nthat Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its\r\nordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule\r\ncannot, however, render irrelevant\u2014as the majority would\r\nhave it\u2014the ordinary meaning of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n  Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim\r\nthat \u201cactual damages\u201d has no fixed meaning undermines\u2014\r\nrather than supports\u2014its holding. Each cited authority\r\ninvolves either a statute in which Congress expressly\r\ndirected that compensation be measured in strictly eco-\r\nnomic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of\r\n1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable\r\nconsequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3\r\nNeither factor is present here. Notably absent from the\r\nPrivacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that \u201cac-\r\ntual damages\u201d should be limited to economic loss. And\r\nwhile \u201c \u2018 \u201churt feelings\u201d over the nature of the [copyright]\r\ninfringement\u2019 \u201d may \u201chave no place in the actual damages\r\ncalculus\u201d under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quot-\r\ning in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917\r\n(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding\r\nthat \u201churt feelings\u201d are equally invalid in an Act con-\r\ncerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while\r\ncontext is no doubt relevant, the majority\u2019s cited authority\r\ndoes little to help its cause in the stated context of this\r\nstatute.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  3 See 28 U.

The Act re-\r\nquires agencies to \u201cestablish appropriate administrative,\r\ntechnical, and physical safeguards\u201d to ensure against\r\nsecurity breaches that could result in \u201csubstantial harm,\r\nembarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any indi-\r\nvidual.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies\r\nto \u201cmaintain all records\u201d used in making a determination\r\nabout an individual in a manner that is \u201creasonably neces-\r\nsary to assure fairness to the individual in the determina-\r\ntion.\u201d \u00a7552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of\r\nthe Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting\r\nagainst \u201cembarrassment\u201d; there is no additional require-\r\nment that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency\u2019s\r\nintentional or willful violation of those duties triggers\r\nliability for \u201cactual damages\u201d under \u00a7552a(g)(4) in the\r\nevent of an adverse impact. \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C)\u2013(D), (g)(4).\r\n   Adopting a reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d that permits\r\nrecovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect\r\nbetween the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial provisions. It\r\nallows a swath of Government violations to go unreme-\r\ndied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo\r\nestablishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment\r\nand no successful private action could be taken against it\r\nfor the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation\r\nof \u201cactual damages\u201d that permits recovery for nonpecuni-\r\nary harms harmonizes the Act\u2019s substantive and remedial\r\nprovisions. Robinson v.

It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540\r\nU. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act\u2019s civil-remedies provi-\r\nsion \u201cparallels\u201d the remedial scheme for the common-law\r\ntorts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery\r\nof \u201cgeneral damages\u201d (i.e., presumed damages) only if a\r\nplaintiff first establishes \u201cspecial damages\u201d (i.e., monetary\r\nloss).5 Ante, at 10. That \u201cparallel,\u201d the majority con-\r\ncludes, \u201csuggests the possibility that Congress intended\r\nthe term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Act to mean special dam-\r\nages.\u201d Ante, at 11.\r\n  The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive\r\n\r\nrelief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(1)(C) and\r\n(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a\r\nlimited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to\r\na record. See \u00a7\u00a7552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like peti-\r\ntioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an inten-\r\ntional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under\r\nthe majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n   5 As the majority notes, \u201cgeneral damages\u201d at common law refers to\r\n\r\ndamages \u201cpresumed\u201d to accrue from the violation of the legally pro-\r\ntected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,\r\nLaw of Remedies \u00a77.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,\r\nat 621. \u201cSpecial damages,\u201d in contrast, \u201cmeant monetary loss.\u201d Dobbs \u00a77.2,\r\nat 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling\r\nwithin the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to\r\nrecover \u201cgeneral damages.\u201d See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at\r\n621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,\r\nwhich permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d See Dobbs, \u00a77.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in\r\ndefamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary\r\ninjuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 521;\r\nDoe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase was the question whether the Act\u2019s civil-suit provi-\r\nsion authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award\r\nof $1,000 absent proof of some \u201cactual damages.\u201d The\r\nCourt answered in the negative, and in the course of doing\r\nso replied to petitioner\u2019s argument that there was \u201csome-\r\nthing peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . .\r\nonly to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual dam-\r\nages.\u201d 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the\r\nAct\u2019s parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting\r\nthat nothing was \u201cpeculiar\u201d about the Act\u2019s remedial\r\nscheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d means economic loss alone. Indeed, it\r\nexpressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12.\r\n  The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the\r\nAct\u2019s parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest\r\nCongress intended \u201cactual damages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress\r\n\u201cwould probably have known about\u201d defamation per quod\r\nactions, id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that\r\nCongress did not write \u201cspecial damages\u201d in the civil-\r\nremedies provision. This Court is typically not in the\r\nbusiness of substituting words we think Congress in-\r\ntended to use for words Congress in fact used. Yet that is\r\nprecisely what the majority does when it rewrites \u201cactual\r\ndamages\u201d to mean \u201cspecial damages.\u201d6 In sum, the statu-\r\ntory context, and in particular the Act\u2019s substantive provi-\r\nsions, confirms the ordinary meaning of \u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\nAlthough the Act shares parallels with common-law defa-\r\nmation torts, such analogies do not warrant a reading of\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used\r\n\r\n\u201cactual damages\u201d in place of \u201cspecial damages\u201d to note that Congress\r\nwould not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the\r\nlatter.

S.,\r\nat 622.\r\n   As the Court explained in Doe, \u201c[t]he deletion of \u2018general\r\ndamages\u2019 from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate\r\nelimination of any possibility of imputing harm and\r\nawarding presumed damages.\u201d Id., at 623; see also id., at\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n   7 There is yet another flaw in the majority\u2019s reasoning. At common\r\n\r\nlaw a plaintiff who successfully established \u201cspecial damages\u201d in an\r\naction for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for\r\nemotional and mental distress. See ante, at 10; n. 5, supra. If \u201cCon-\r\ngress intended the term \u2018actual damages\u2019 in the Act to mean special\r\ndamages,\u201d ante, at 11, then an individual who successfully establishes\r\nsome pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act\u2014presumably as trivial\r\nas the cost of a bottle of Tylenol\u2014should be permitted to recover for\r\nemotional and mental distress. The majority, of course, does not accept\r\nthat result, and its piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines\r\nits assertion that Congress intended \u201cspecial damages\u201d in place of\r\n\u201cactual damages.\u201d\r\n   8 See S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7303(c)(1) (1974); H. R. 16373, 93d\r\n\r\nCong., 2d Sess., \u00a73 (1974).\r\n10                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n622, n. 5 (\u201cCongress explicitly rejected the proposal to\r\nmake presumed damages available for Privacy Act viola-\r\ntions\u201d). The elimination of presumed damages from the\r\nbill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left\r\nbehind\u2014\u201cactual damages\u201d\u2014comprised damages that are\r\nnot presumed, i.e., damages proven by competent evidence\r\nin the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.\r\n323, 349\u2013350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context\r\nbetween presumed damages and damages for actual inju-\r\nries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which\r\ninclude \u201cimpairment of reputation and standing in the\r\ncommunity, personal humiliation, and mental anguish\r\nand suffering\u201d); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262\u2013264\r\n(1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and\r\nproven damages for mental and emotional distress).\r\n   Rather than view the deletion of general damages (pre-\r\nsumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven dam-\r\nages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a\r\nsubset of proven damages\u2014those of an economic nature,\r\ni.e., \u201cspecial damages.\u201d Once again, however, the major-\r\nity\u2019s insistence that \u201cCongress intended \u2018actual damages\u2019 in\r\nthe Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecu-\r\nniary loss,\u201d ante, at 13, finds no basis in the statutory text,\r\nsee supra, at 8. And its response to the conclusion that\r\nCongress retained recovery for proven damages when it\r\neliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying.\r\nThe majority declares such a conclusion \u201cflawed\u201d because\r\n\u201cgeneral damages\u201d \u201cincludes compensation for proven\r\ninjuries as well,\u201d so that \u201cwhat distinguishes [general]\r\ndamages, whether proved or not, from the only other\r\ncategory of compensatory damages available in the rele-\r\nvant common-law suits is the type of harm\u201d the term\r\nencompasses\u2014which the majority takes to be emotional\r\nharm alone. Ante, at 15\u201316. That assertion is defective on\r\ntwo scores. First, a plaintiff \u2019s ability to present proof of\r\ninjury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsuch proven injury) does not alter the definition of \u201cgen-\r\neral damages,\u201d which we already explained in Doe means\r\n\u201cpresumed damages.\u201d 540 U. S., at 621; see also id., at\r\n623; n. 5, supra. Second, \u201cgeneral damages\u201d is not limited\r\nto a \u201ctype\u201d of harm. The majority\u2019s contrary assertion that\r\nthe term permits recovery only for emotional \u201ctypes\u201d of\r\nharm overlooks the fact that \u201cgeneral damages are partly\r\nbased on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable\r\npecuniary losses.\u201d Dobbs \u00a77.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It\r\nthus was established at common law that in a defamation\r\nper se action, \u201cthe plaintiff is usually free to prove what-\r\never actual pecuniary loss he can,\u201d and \u201cthe jury may be\r\npermitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the\r\ntip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-\r\nproven, and award damage accordingly.\u201d Ibid.\r\n   At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following\r\nsyllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in\r\ndefamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery\r\nfor \u201cgeneral damages,\u201d it must have meant to retain recov-\r\nery only for \u201cspecial damages.\u201d That syllogism, of course,\r\nignores that there is another category of damages. It is\r\nthe very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy\r\nAct: \u201cActual damages.\u201d However much Congress may\r\nhave drawn \u201cparallels,\u201d ante, at 10, between the Act and\r\nthe common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that\r\nCongress expressly choose not to use the words \u201cspecial\r\ndamages.\u201d9\r\n                            D\r\n  I turn finally to the statute\u2019s purpose, for \u201c[a]s in all\r\ncases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n  9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study\r\n\r\nCommission in support of its interpretation of \u201cactual damages.\u201d The\r\nmajority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratex-\r\ntual material is due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated\r\nconclusions persuasive.\r\n12                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe words of th[e] statut[e] in light of the purposes Con-\r\ngress sought to serve.\u201d Chapman v. Houston Welfare\r\nRights Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 608 (1979); see also\r\nDolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInter-\r\npretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the\r\nwhole statutory text, considering the purpose and context\r\nof the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori-\r\nties that inform the analysis\u201d). The purposes of the Priv-\r\nacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent\r\nwith interpreting \u201cactual damages\u201d according to its ordi-\r\nnary meaning.\r\n   \u201cThe historical context of the Act is important to an\r\nunderstanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Con-\r\ngress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance\r\nand investigation of individuals by federal agencies that\r\nhad been exposed during the Watergate scandal.\u201d Dept.\r\nof Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of\r\nthe Privacy Act 4 (2010). In particular, Congress recog-\r\nnized that \u201cthe increasing use of computers and sophisti-\r\ncated information technology . . . has greatly magnified\r\nthe harm to individual privacy that can occur from any\r\ncollection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal\r\ninformation.\u201d \u00a72(a), 88 Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to\r\nprivacy as \u201ca personal and fundamental right,\u201d Congress\r\nfound it \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d to enact the Privacy Act\r\n\u201cin order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in\r\ninformation systems maintained by Federal agencies.\u201d\r\nIbid.\r\n   Congress explained that the \u201cpurpose of this Act is to\r\nprovide certain safeguards for an individual against an\r\ninvasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agen-\r\ncies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,\u201d inter alia,\r\n\u201cbe subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a\r\nresult of willful or intentional action which violates any\r\nindividual\u2019s rights under this Act.\u201d \u00a72(b)(6), ibid. (empha-\r\nsis added). That statement is an explicit reference to suits\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nbrought under \u00a7552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a\r\ncivil suit based on \u201cwillful or intentional\u201d agency miscon-\r\nduct. It signals unmistakably congressional recognition\r\nthat the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing\r\nthe Act\u2019s purposes.\r\n  Reading \u201cactual damages\u201d to permit recovery for any\r\ninjury established by competent evidence in the record\u2014\r\npecuniary or not\u2014best effectuates the statute\u2019s basic\r\npurpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result\r\nin economic loss, we have recognized time and again that\r\nthe primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes\r\nmental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc.\r\nv. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (\u201cIn the \u2018right of\r\nprivacy\u2019 cases the primary damage is the mental dis-\r\ntress\u201d); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (\u201c[A]ctual injury\u201d\r\nin defamatory falsehood cases \u201cis not limited to out-of-\r\npocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual\r\nharm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impair-\r\nment of reputation and standing in the community, per-\r\nsonal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering\u201d).\r\nAccord, 2 Dobbs \u00a77.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a\r\ndignitary interest, and \u201cin a great many of the cases\u201d in\r\nwhich the interest is invaded \u201cthe only harm is the affront\r\nto the plaintiff \u2019s dignity as a human being, the damage to\r\nhis self-image, and the resulting mental distress\u201d). That\r\naccords with common sense.\r\n  In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not\r\nforget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri-\r\nvacy. The majority\u2019s reading of \u201cactual damages\u201d renders\r\nthe remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly\r\nunlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely\r\nnonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Con-\r\ngress\u2019 stated purpose. The majority, however, does not\r\ngrapple with the ramifications of its opinion. It acknowl-\r\nedges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd\r\nresults as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor\r\n14                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\npecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering\r\nsevere mental anguish to recover nothing. But it con-\r\ncludes that \u201cthere is nothing absurd about a scheme that\r\nlimits the Government\u2019s Privacy Act liability to harm that\r\ncan be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.\u201d\r\nAnte, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress\u2019\r\nprerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,\r\nnamely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of\r\nprivacy without remedying the primary harm that results\r\nfrom invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is\r\nthat one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the\r\nstatute before us that Congress intended such a result.\r\nNowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint\r\nthat it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of\r\nremedy than debilitating mental distress, and the major-\r\nity\u2019s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emo-\r\ntional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integ-\r\nrity that privacy protects.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial\r\nthe resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by\r\na federal agency\u2019s intentional or willful violation of the\r\nPrivacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she\r\nis able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result\r\nCongress intended when it enacted an Act with the ex-\r\npress purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against\r\nGovernment invasion. And it is not a result remotely\r\nsuggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of\r\nthe Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n</pre>",
