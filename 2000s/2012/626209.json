Argued November 7, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012\nPetitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem. His\n  mother requested that Zivotofsky\u2019s place of birth be listed as \u201cIsrael\u201d\n  on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to\n  \u00a7214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.\n  That provision states: \u201cFor purposes of the registration of birth, certi-\n  fication of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States cit-\n  izen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\n  quest of the citizen or the citizen\u2019s legal guardian, record the place of\n  birth as Israel.\u201d U. S. officials refused the request, citing a State De-\n  partment policy that prohibits recording \u201cIsrael\u201d as the place of birth\n  for those born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky\u2019s parents filed a suit on his\n  behalf against the Secretary of State. The District Court dismissed\n  the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question\n  regarding Jerusalem\u2019s political status. The D. C. Circuit affirmed,\n  reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive\n  power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that\n  power cannot be reviewed by the courts.\nHeld: The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zi-\n votofsky\u2019s claim. Pp. 5\u221212.\n    (a) This Court has said that a controversy \u201cinvolves a political\n question . . . where there is \u2018a textually demonstrable constitutional\n commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a\n lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolv-\n ing it.\u2019 \u201d Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228. The lower courts\n ruled that this case presents such a political question because they\n2                        ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky\u2019s claim\n    would require the Judiciary to define U. S. policy regarding the sta-\n    tus of Jerusalem. In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only\n    whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under \u00a7214(d) to\n    choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.\n    Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreo-\n    ver, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of \u00a7214(d),\n    the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is consti-\n    tutional. There is no \u201ctextually demonstrable constitutional com-\n    mitment\u201d of that question to another branch: At least since Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is \u201cem-\n    phatically the province and duty\u201d of the Judiciary to determine the\n    constitutionality of a statute. Nor is there \u201ca lack of judicially discov-\n    erable and manageable standards for resolving\u201d the question: Both\n    parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textu-\n    al, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that\n    \u00a7214(d) is constitutional. Pp. 5\u201312.\n      (b) Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case\n    presents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivo-\n    tofsky\u2019s claim. This Court is \u201ca court of final review and not first\n    view,\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.

The State Department\ndeclined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of\nnot taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem.\nWhen sued by an American who invoked the statute, the\nSecretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority\nto decide the case because it presented a political question.\nThe Court of Appeals so held.\n  We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determin-\ning whether this statute may be given effect, or instead\nmust be struck down in light of authority conferred on the\nExecutive by the Constitution.\n                          I\n                          A\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Au-\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. Section\n214 of the Act is entitled \u201cUnited States Policy with Re-\nspect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.\u201d Id., at 1365.\nThe first two subsections express Congress\u2019s \u201ccommit-\nment\u201d to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to\nJerusalem. Id., at 1365\u20131366. The third bars funding for\nthe publication of official Government documents that do\nnot list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Id., at 1366.\nThe fourth and final provision, \u00a7214(d), is the only one at\nstake in this case. Entitled \u201cRecord of Place of Birth as\nIsrael for Passport Purposes,\u201d it provides that \u201c[f]or pur-\nposes of the registration of birth, certification of national-\nity, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born\nin the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\nquest of the citizen or the citizen\u2019s legal guardian, record\nthe place of birth as Israel.\u201d Ibid.\n   The State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual states\nthat \u201c[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located\nin territory disputed by another country, the city or area\nof birth may be written in the passport.\u201d 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual \u00a71383.5\u20132, App. 108. The manual specifically\ndirects that passport officials should enter \u201cJERUSALEM\u201d\nand should \u201cnot write Israel or Jordan\u201d when recording\nthe birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a pass-\nport. Id., \u00a71383, Exh. 1383.1, App. 127; see also id.,\n\u00a7\u00a71383.1, 1383.5\u20134, .5\u20135, .5\u20136, App. 106, 108\u2013110.\n   Section 214(d) sought to override this instruction by\nallowing citizens born in Jerusalem to have \u201cIsrael\u201d rec-\norded on their passports if they wish. In signing the For-\neign Relations Authorization Act into law, President\nGeorge W. Bush stated his belief that \u00a7214 \u201cimpermissibly\ninterferes with the President\u2019s constitutional authority to\nconduct the Nation\u2019s foreign affairs and to supervise the\nunitary executive branch.\u201d Statement on Signing the\nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003,\nPublic Papers of the Presidents, George W. Bush, Vol. 2,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSept. 30, 2002, p. 1698 (2005). He added that if the sec-\ntion is \u201cconstrued as mandatory,\u201d then it would \u201cinterfere\nwith the President\u2019s constitutional authority to formulate\nthe position of the United States, speak for the Nation in\ninternational affairs, and determine the terms on which\nrecognition is given to foreign states.\u201d Ibid. He concluded\nby emphasizing that \u201cU. S. policy regarding Jerusalem has\nnot changed.\u201d Ibid. The President made no specific refer-\nence to the passport mandate in \u00a7214(d).\n                              B\n   Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in\nJerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after \u00a7214(d) was\nenacted. Zivotofsky\u2019s parents were American citizens and\nhe accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional\nenactment. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401\nU. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American\ncitizens acquire citizenship at birth through \u201ccongres-\nsional generosity\u201d). Zivotofsky\u2019s mother filed an application\nfor a consular report of birth abroad and a United States\npassport. She requested that his place of birth be listed as\n\u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d on both documents. U. S. officials\ninformed Zivotofsky\u2019s mother that State Department\npolicy prohibits recording \u201cIsrael\u201d as Zivotofsky\u2019s place of\nbirth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a\npassport and consular report of birth abroad listing only\n\u201cJerusalem.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\n   Zivotofsky\u2019s parents filed a complaint on his behalf\nagainst the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a de-\nclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering\nthe Secretary to identify his place of birth as \u201cJerusalem,\nIsrael\u201d in the official documents. Id., at 17\u201318. The Dis-\ntrict Court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing\nand that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political\nquestion.\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that Zivotofsky did have standing. It then\nobserved that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that\n\u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d be recorded on his passport, \u201c[b]oth\nsides agree that the question now is whether \u00a7214(d)\nentitles [him] to have just \u2018Israel\u2019 listed as his place of\nbirth.\u201d 444 F. 3d 614, 619 (2006). The D. C. Circuit de-\ntermined that additional factual development might be\nhelpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable,\nas the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implica-\ntions of listing \u201cIsrael\u201d alone as a birthplace on the pass-\nport. Id., at 619\u2013620. It therefore remanded the case to\nthe District Court.\n   The District Court again found that the case was not\njusticiable. It explained that \u201c[r]esolving [Zivotofsky\u2019s]\nclaim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to\ndecide the political status of Jerusalem.\u201d 511 F. Supp. 2d\n97, 103 (2007). Concluding that the claim therefore pre-\nsented a political question, the District Court dismissed\nthe case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   The D. C. Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the Consti-\ntution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize\nforeign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power\ncannot be reviewed by the courts. Therefore, \u201cdeciding\nwhether the Secretary of State must mark a passport . . .\nas Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court]\ninto an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to\nthe Executive alone.\u201d 571 F. 3d 1227, 1232\u20131233 (2009).\nThe D. C. Circuit held that the political question doctrine\nprohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any\nsuggestion that Congress\u2019s decision to take \u201ca position on\nthe status of Jerusalem\u201d could change the analysis. Id., at\n1233.\n   Judge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote\nseparately to express his view that the political question\ndoctrine has no application to this case. He explained that\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe issue before the court was whether \u00a7214(d) \u201cimpermis-\nsibly intrude[s] on the President\u2019s exclusive power to\nrecognize foreign sovereigns.\u201d Id., at 1234. That question,\nhe observed, involves \u201ccommonplace issues of statutory\nand constitutional interpretation\u201d plainly within the con-\nstitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at\n1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined\nthat designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is\na policy \u201cin furtherance of the recognition power.\u201d Id., at\n1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that\npower exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found\n\u00a7214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded\nthat Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and con-\ncurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.\n  Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted\nreview. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim\npresents a political question and therefore cannot be ad-\njudicated. We disagree.\n  In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide\ncases properly before it, even those it \u201cwould gladly avoid.\u201d\nCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Our prece-\ndents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,\nknown as the \u201cpolitical question\u201d doctrine. See, e.g., Ja-\npan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S.\n221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy\n\u201cinvolves a political question . . . where there is \u2018a textu-\nally demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue\nto a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\u2019 \u201d\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case,\nwe have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the\ndispute before it.\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political\nquestion because deciding Zivotofsky\u2019s claim would force\nthe Judicial Branch to interfere with the President\u2019s exer-\ncise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The\nDistrict Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to\n\u201cdecide the political status of Jerusalem.\u201d 511 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 103. This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivo-\ntofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jeru-\nsalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to deter-\nmine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under\n\u00a7214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport\nas his place of birth.\n    For its part, the D. C. Circuit treated the two questions\nas one and the same. That court concluded that \u201c[o]nly\nthe Executive\u2014not Congress and not the courts\u2014has the\npower to define U. S. policy regarding Israel\u2019s sovereignty\nover Jerusalem,\u201d and also to \u201cdecide how best to imple-\nment that policy.\u201d 571 F. 3d, at 1232. Because the De-\npartment\u2019s passport rule was adopted to implement the\nPresident\u2019s \u201cexclusive and unreviewable constitutional\npower to keep the United States out of the debate over the\nstatus of Jerusalem,\u201d the validity of that rule was itself a\n\u201cnonjusticiable political question\u201d that \u201cthe Constitution\nleaves to the Executive alone.\u201d Id., at 1231\u20131233. Indeed,\nthe D. C. Circuit\u2019s opinion does not even mention \u00a7214(d)\nuntil the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis, and then\nonly to dismiss it as irrelevant: \u201cThat Congress took a\nposition on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a\nstatutory cause of action . . . is of no moment to whether\nthe judiciary has [the] authority to resolve this dispute\n. . . .\u201d Id., at 1233.\n    The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly\nrelevant to the Judiciary\u2019s power to decide Zivotofsky\u2019s\nclaim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant\na foreign policy decision of the political branches with the\ncourts\u2019 own unmoored determination of what United\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivo-\ntofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory\nright. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if\nZivotofsky\u2019s interpretation of the statute is correct, and\nwhether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar\njudicial exercise.\n   Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the inter-\npretation of \u00a7214(d), the only real question for the courts is\nwhether the statute is constitutional. At least since Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized\nthat when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the\nConstitution, \u201c[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d Id., at\n177. That duty will sometimes involve the \u201c[r]esolution of\nlitigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of\nthe three branches,\u201d but courts cannot avoid their respon-\nsibility merely \u201cbecause the issues have political implica-\ntions.\u201d INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 943 (1983).\n   In this case, determining the constitutionality of \u00a7214(d)\ninvolves deciding whether the statute impermissibly\nintrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution.\nIf so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky\u2019s case\nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the\nother hand, the statute does not trench on the President\u2019s\npowers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivo-\ntofsky a passport that complies with \u00a7214(d). Either way,\nthe political question doctrine is not implicated. \u201cNo\npolicy underlying the political question doctrine suggests\nthat Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitu-\ntionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.\u201d Id.,\nat 941\u2013942.\n   The Secretary contends that \u201cthere is \u2018a textually de-\nmonstrable constitutional commitment\u2019 \u201d to the President\nof the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as\na corollary, to determine whether an American born in\nJerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v.

But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment\nto the Executive of the power to determine the constitu-\ntionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately\nexercises that authority, including in a case such as this,\nwhere the question is whether Congress or the Executive\nis \u201caggrandizing its power at the expense of another\nbranch.\u201d Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878\n(1991); see, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176\n(1926) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it en-\ncroached upon the President\u2019s removal power); Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (finding a statute un-\nconstitutional because it \u201cintruded into the executive\nfunction\u201d); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988)\n(upholding a statute\u2019s constitutionality against a charge\nthat it \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with the President\u2019s\nexercise of his constitutionally appointed functions\u201d).\n   Our precedents have also found the political question\ndoctrine implicated when there is \u201c \u2018a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving\u2019 \u201d the\nquestion before the court. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting\nBaker, supra, at 217). Framing the issue as the lower\ncourts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide\nthe political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those\nconcerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is\nrecognized to be the more focused one of the constitution-\nality of \u00a7214(d). Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal\narguments regarding whether \u00a7214(d) is constitutional in\nlight of powers committed to the Executive, and whether\nCongress\u2019s own powers with respect to passports must be\nweighed in analyzing this question.\n   For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her\nargument on the political question issue, claiming that the\nConstitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to\nformulate recognition policy. She roots her claim in the\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

S. Const.,\nArt. II, \u00a73. According to the Secretary, \u201c[c]enturies-long\nExecutive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence,\nand decisions by this Court\u201d confirm that the \u201creceive\nAmbassadors\u201d clause confers upon the Executive the\nexclusive power of recognition. Brief for Respondent 18.\n    The Secretary observes that \u201cPresident Washington and\nhis cabinet unanimously decided that the President could\nreceive the ambassador from the new government of\nFrance without first consulting Congress.\u201d Id., at 19\n(citing Letter from George Washington to the Cabinet\n(Apr. 18, 1793), reprinted in 25 Papers of Thomas Jeffer-\nson 568\u2013569 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1992); Thomas Jefferson,\nNotes on Washington\u2019s Questions on Neutrality and the\nAlliance with France (May 6, 1793), reprinted in id., at\n665\u2013666). She notes, too, that early attempts by the Leg-\nislature to affect recognition policy were regularly \u201cre-\njected in Congress as inappropriate incursions into the\nExecutive Branch\u2019s constitutional authority.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 21. And she cites precedents from this Court\nstating that \u201c[p]olitical recognition is exclusively a func-\ntion of the Executive.\u201d Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sab-\nbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 410 (1964); see Brief for Respondent\n24\u201327 (citing, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203\n(1942)).\n    The Secretary further contends that \u00a7214(d) constitutes\nan impermissible exercise of the recognition power be-\ncause \u201cthe decision as to how to describe the place of birth\n. . . operates as an official statement of whether the United\nStates recognizes a state\u2019s sovereignty over a territorial\narea.\u201d Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not\n\u201clist[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over\nthe relevant territory the United States does not recog-\nnize.\u201d Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, \u201clisting \u2018Israel\u2019 as\nthe place of birth would constitute an official decision by\n10                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city\nlocated within Israel. \u201d Id., at 38\u201339 (some internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an\nexercise of the recognition power, \u00a7214(d) is instead a\n\u201clegitimate and permissible\u201d exercise of Congress\u2019s \u201cau-\nthority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor\nLouis Henkin\u2019s observation that \u201c \u2018in the competition for\npower in foreign relations,\u2019 Congress has \u2018an impressive\narray of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitu-\ntion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and\nthe United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivo-\ntofsky suggests that Congress\u2019s authority to enact \u00a7214(d)\nderives specifically from its powers over naturalization,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., \u00a78,\ncl. 3. According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these\npowers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of\npassports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing\nAct of Aug. 18, 1856, \u00a723, 11 Stat. 60).\n   Zivotofsky contends that \u00a7214(d) fits squarely within\nthis tradition. He notes that the State Department\u2019s\ndesignated representative stated in her deposition for this\nlitigation that the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry is included only\nas \u201can element of identification.\u201d App. 76 (Deposition of\nCatherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for\nOverseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.\nMoreover, Zivotofsky argues, the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry\ncannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sover-\neigns, because the State Department authorizes recording\nunrecognized territories\u2014such as the Gaza Strip and the\nWest Bank\u2014as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43\n(citing 7 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a71383.5\u20135, App. 109\u2013\n110).\n   Further, Zivotofsky claims that even if \u00a7214(d) does\nimplicate the recognition power, that is not a power the\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution commits exclusively to the Executive. Zivo-\ntofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority\ngranted to the President in the \u201creceive Ambassadors\u201d\nclause. He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexander\nHamilton described the power conferred by this clause as\n\u201cmore a matter of dignity than of authority,\u201d and called it \u201ca\ncircumstance, which will be without consequence in the\nadministration of the government.\u201d The Federalist No. 69,\np. 468 (J. Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37. Zivo-\ntofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such\nas Congress\u2019s power to declare war, that suggest some con-\ngressional role in recognition. Reply Brief for Petitioner 23\n(citing U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 11). He cites, for example,\nan 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, ac-\nknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to\nrecognize because it is a power \u201cno where expressly dele-\ngated\u201d in the Constitution, and one that is \u201cnecessarily\ninvolved in some of the great powers given to Congress.\u201d\nMessage from the President of the United States Upon the\nSubject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of\nTexas, H. R. Doc. No. 35, 24th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; see Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 11\u201312.\n   Zivotofsky argues that language from this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively\nto the President is inapplicable to his claim, because that\nlanguage appeared in cases where the Court was asked to\nalter recognition policy developed by the Executive in the\nabsence of congressional opposition. See Brief for Petitioner\n44\u201346; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18\u201319. Finally, Zivotofsky\ncontends that even if the \u201creceive Ambassadors\u201d clause\nconfers some exclusive recognition power on the President,\nsimply allowing a choice as to the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry on a\npassport does not significantly intrude on that power.\n   Recitation of these arguments\u2014which sound in familiar\nprinciples of constitutional interpretation\u2014is enough to\nestablish that this case does not \u201cturn on standards that defy\n12                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial application.\u201d Baker, 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of\nZivotofksy\u2019s claim demands careful examination of the tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the\nparties regarding the nature of the statute and of the pass-\nport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The\npolitical question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of\nthis case.\n                              III\n  To say that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim presents issues the Judi-\nciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a\ndecision in this case is simple. Because the District Court\nand the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by\nthe political question doctrine, we are without the benefit\nof thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of\nthe merits. Ours is \u201ca court of final review and not first\nview.\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Ordinarily, \u201cwe do not decide in the first in-\nstance issues not decided below.\u201d National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In\nparticular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we\ntypically remand for resolution of any claims the lower\ncourts\u2019 error prevented them from addressing. See, e.g.,\nBond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 1\u20132) (reversing the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination on\nstanding and remanding because the \u201cmerits of petition-\ner\u2019s challenge to the statute\u2019s validity are to be considered,\nin the first instance, by the Court of Appeals\u201d). We see no\nreason to depart from this approach in this case. Having\ndetermined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the\nlower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that this\ncase does not present a political question. I write sepa-\nrately, however, because I understand the inquiry re-\nquired by the political question doctrine to be more de-\nmanding than that suggested by the Court.\n                              I\n   The political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of\ncircumstances in which courts properly examine whether\na particular suit is justiciable\u2014that is, whether the dis-\npute is appropriate for resolution by courts. The doctrine\nis \u201cessentially a function of the separation of powers,\u201d\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), which recognizes\nthe limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords\nappropriate respect to the other branches\u2019 exercise of their\nown constitutional powers.\n   In Baker, this Court identified six circumstances in\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwhich an issue might present a political question: (1) \u201ca\ntextually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the\nissue to a coordinate political department\u201d; (2) \u201ca lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for\nresolving it\u201d; (3) \u201cthe impossibility of deciding without an\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudi-\ncial discretion\u201d; (4) \u201cthe impossibility of a court\u2019s undertak-\ning independent resolution without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government\u201d; (5) \u201can\nunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made\u201d; or (6) \u201cthe potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.\u201d Id., at 217. Baker estab-\nlished that \u201c[u]nless one of these formulations is inextri-\ncable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for\nnonjusticiability.\u201d Ibid. But Baker left unanswered when\nthe presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal,\nas well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the\nrelative importance of each in determining whether a case\nis suitable for adjudication.\n   In my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct\njustifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a\ndispute. When a case would require a court to decide an\nissue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordi-\nnate political department, as envisioned by Baker\u2019s first\nfactor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks\nauthority to resolve that issue. See, e.g., Nixon v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 224, 229 (1993) (holding nonjusticiable\nthe Senate\u2019s impeachment procedures in light of Article I\u2019s\ncommitment to the Senate of the \u201c \u2018sole Power to try all\nImpeachments\u2019 \u201d); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 165\u2013166 (1803) (\u201cBy the constitution of the United\nStates, the president is invested with certain important\npolitical powers, in the exercise of which he is to use\nhis own discretion, and is accountable only to his country\nin his political character, and to his own conscience\u201d).

S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsuch cases, the Constitution itself requires that another\nbranch resolve the question presented.\n  The second and third Baker factors reflect circum-\nstances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond\ncourts\u2019 competence. \u201c \u2018The judicial Power\u2019 created by Arti-\ncle III, \u00a71, of the Constitution is not whatever judges\nchoose to do,\u201d but rather the power \u201cto act in the manner\ntraditional for English and American courts.\u201d Vieth v.\nJubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 278 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nThat traditional role involves the application of some\nmanageable and cognizable standard within the compe-\ntence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts\nof a concrete case. When a court is given no standard by\nwhich to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute\nin the absence of a yet-unmade policy determination\ncharged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is be-\nyond the judicial role envisioned by Article III. See, e.g.,\nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973) (\u201c[I]t is difficult\nto conceive of an area of governmental activity in which\nthe courts have less competence\u201d than \u201c[t]he complex,\nsubtle, and professional decisions as to the composition,\ntraining, equipping, and control of a military force\u201d); Vieth,\n541 U. S., at 278 (\u201cOne of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard . . . \u201d). This is not to say, of course,\nthat courts are incapable of interpreting or applying\nsomewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of\nstatutory or constitutional interpretation. But where an\nissue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be \u201cno\ndoubt of [the] validity\u201d of a court\u2019s decision to abstain from\njudgment. Ibid.\n  The final three Baker factors address circumstances in\nwhich prudence may counsel against a court\u2019s resolution of\nan issue presented. Courts should be particularly cautious\nbefore forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that\njudicial intervention risks \u201cembarrassment from multifar-\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nious pronouncements by various departments on one\nquestion,\u201d would express a \u201clack of the respect due coordi-\nnate branches of government,\u201d or because there exists an\n\u201cunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made.\u201d 369 U. S., at 217. We have re-\npeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met\nwhenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitu-\ntionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Gov-\nernment. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495\nU. S. 385, 390\u2013391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.\n486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate\na dispute merely because a decision \u201cmay have significant\npolitical overtones\u201d or affect \u201cthe conduct of this Nation\u2019s\nforeign relations,\u201d Japan Whaling Assn. v. American\nCetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts\ndecline to resolve a controversy within their traditional\ncompetence and proper jurisdiction simply because the\nquestion is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the\npotential real for conflict with the policy preferences of\nthe political branches. The exercise of such authority is\namong the \u201cgravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this\nCourt is called on to perform,\u201d Blodgett v. Holden, 275\nU. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is\nthe role assigned to courts by the Constitution. \u201cQuestions\nmay occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot\navoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judg-\nment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.\u201d Cohens v.\nVirginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).\n   Rare occasions implicating Baker\u2019s final factors, how-\never, may present an \u201c \u2018unusual case\u2019 \u201d unfit for judicial\ndisposition. 369 U. S., at 218 (quoting the argument of\nDaniel Webster in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 29 (1849)).\nBecause of the respect due to a coequal and independent\ndepartment, for instance, courts properly resist calls to\nquestion the good faith with which another branch attests\nto the authenticity of its internal acts. See, e.g., Field v.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nClark, 143 U.

Likewise, we have\nlong acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited\nto intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual\nneed for \u201cattributing finality to the action of the political\ndepartments,\u201d Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454\n(1939), or creating acute \u201crisk [of] embarrassment of our\ngovernment abroad, or grave disturbance at home,\u201d Baker,\n369 U. S., at 226. See, e.g., Luther, 7 How., at 43 (\u201cAfter\nthe President has acted and called out the militia, is a\nCircuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire\nwhether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power\nextends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitu-\ntion of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and\nnot of order\u201d).1 Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to\nstay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions\nconcerning the distribution of political authority between\ncoordinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable,\nand incapable of resolution by the political process.

In two respects, however, my understanding of the\npolitical question doctrine might require a court to engage\nin further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court.\n  First, the Court appropriately recognizes that petition-\ner\u2019s claim to a statutory right is \u201crelevant\u201d to the justicia-\nbility inquiry required in this case. Ante, at 6. In order to\nevaluate whether a case presents a political question, a\ncourt must first identify with precision the issue it is being\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Often when such factors are implicated in a case presenting a politi-\n\ncal question, other factors identified in Baker will likewise be apparent.\nSee, e.g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 236 (1993) (\u201c[i]n addi-\ntion to the textual commitment argument,\u201d finding persuasive that\n\u201copening the door of judicial review\u201d of impeachment procedures would\n\u201c \u2018expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of\nchaos\u2019 \u201d); Baker, 369 U. S., at 222 (explaining that the Court in Luther\nv. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), found present features associated with each\nof the three rationales underlying Baker\u2019s factors).\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nasked to decide. Here, petitioner\u2019s suit claims that a\nfederal statute provides him with a right to have \u201cIsrael\u201d\nlisted as his place of birth on his passport and other re-\nlated documents. App. 15\u201318. To decide that question, a\ncourt must determine whether the statute is constitu-\ntional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to\nissue petitioner\u2019s desired passport, or unconstitutional, in\nwhich case his suit is at an end. Resolution of that issue is\nnot one \u201ctextually committed\u201d to another branch; to the\ncontrary, it is committed to this one. In no fashion does the\nquestion require a court to review the wisdom of the Pres-\nident\u2019s policy toward Jerusalem or any other decision\ncommitted to the discretion of a coordinate department.\nFor that reason, I agree that the decision below should be\nreversed.\n   That is not to say, however, that no statute could give\nrise to a political question. It is not impossible to imagine\na case involving the application or even the constitutional-\nity of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable\nissue. Indeed, this Court refused to determine whether an\nOhio state constitutional provision offended the Repub-\nlican Guarantee Clause, Art. IV, \u00a74, holding that \u201cthe\nquestion of whether that guarantee of the Constitution\nhas been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.\u201d\nOhio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569 (1916).\nA similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute,\nfor instance, purporting to award financial relief to those\nimproperly \u201ctried\u201d of impeachment offenses. To adjudicate\nclaims under such a statute would require a court to re-\nsolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in\nNixon. Such examples are atypical, but they suffice to show\nthat the foreclosure altogether of political question analy-\nsis in statutory cases is unwarranted.\n   Second, the Court suggests that this case does not im-\nplicate the political question doctrine\u2019s concern with issues\nexhibiting \u201c \u2018a lack of judicially discoverable and managea-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nble standards,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 8, because the parties\u2019 arguments\nrely on textual, structural, and historical evidence of the\nkind that courts routinely consider. But that was equally\ntrue in Nixon, a case in which we found that \u201cthe use of\nthe word \u2018try\u2019 in the first sentence of the Impeachment\nTrial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judi-\ncially manageable standard of review of the Senate\u2019s\nactions.\u201d 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion\neven though the parties\u2019 briefs focused upon the text of the\nImpeachment Trial Clause, \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s drafting\nhistory,\u201d \u201ccontemporaneous commentary,\u201d \u201cthe unbroken\npractice of the Senate for 150 years,\u201d contemporary dic-\ntionary meanings, \u201cHamilton\u2019s Federalist essays,\u201d and the\npractice in the House of Lords prior to ratification. Such\nevidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than\nthat on which the parties rely here.\n   In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which\nlitigants rely is common to judicial consideration that\ndetermines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable\nand manageable standards. Rather, it is whether that\nevidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate\nmeaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The\nanswer will almost always be yes, but if the parties\u2019 tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or\nwholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more\nthan guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of\narguments offered to courts might well still present justi-\nciability concerns.\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority\nfound a political question solely on the basis that this case\nrequired resolution of an issue \u201ctextually committed\u201d to\nthe Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual\ncommitment, I respectfully concur in the Court\u2019s decision\nto reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This case\ndoes not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power\nto recognize foreign governments and the extent of their\nterritory is conferred exclusively on the President or is\nshared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the\nstatutory provision in question represents an attempt by\nCongress to dictate United States policy regarding the\nstatus of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect\nthat Congress has the power to mandate that an American\ncitizen born abroad be given the option of including in his\npassport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)\nwhat amounts to a statement of personal belief on the\nstatus of Jerusalem.\n   Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution cer-\ntainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe\nthe contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution\ngives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regu-\nlate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nv. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270\u2013271 (1876). The\nConstitution also gives Congress the power to make a\n\u201cuniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4, and\npursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws con-\ncerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents\nwho are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong\nKim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow\nCongress to mandate that identifying information be in-\ncluded in passports and CRBAs.\n   The President also has a measure of authority concern-\ning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President\nhas broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,\nAmerican Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\n(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the\npower to issue passports, even in the absence of any for-\nmal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See\nHaig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that\n\u201c[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,\nthe common perception was that the issuance of a pass-\nport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive\nand that the Executive would exercise this power in the\ninterests of the national security and foreign policy of the\nUnited States\u201d). We have described a passport as \u201ca letter\nof introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for\nthe bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bear-\ner.\u201d Id., at 292. This is apparent from the first page of\npetitioner\u2019s passport, which reads as follows:\n    \u201cThe Secretary of State of the United States of Amer-\n    ica hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit\n    the citizen / national of the United States named here-\n    in to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of\n    need to give all lawful aid and protection.\u201d App. 19.\nSimilarly, a CRBA is a certification made by a consular of-\nficial that the bearer acquired United States citizenship\nat birth.

As she\npoints out, Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), set forth\nseveral categories of legal questions that the Court had\npreviously held to be \u201cpolitical questions\u201d inappropriate for\njudicial determination. Those categories include (1) in-\nstances in which the Constitution clearly commits deci-\nsionmaking power to another branch of Government, and\n(2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for\nresolution. Id., at 217. They also include (3) issues that\ncourts cannot decide without making \u201can initial policy\ndetermination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\u201d\n(4) issues that a court cannot independently decide \u201cwith-\nout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\nof government,\u201d (5) cases in which there is \u201can unusual\nneed for unquestioning adherence to a political decision\nalready made,\u201d and (6) cases in which there is a potential\nfor \u201cembarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\nvarious departments on one question.\u201d Ibid.\n  As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR also points out, these categories\n(and in my view particularly the last four) embody \u201ccir-\ncumstances in which prudence may counsel against a\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourt\u2019s resolution of an issue presented.\u201d Ante, at 3 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine\n\u201cderiv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the\nrespect we owe the political departments\u201d); Goldwater v.\nCarter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201c[T]he political-question doctrine rests in\npart on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect\namong the three branches of Government\u201d); see also Jaffe,\nStanding to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74\nHarv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesita-\ntion where a legal issue is \u201cfelt to be so closely related to\na complex of decisions not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction\nthat its resolution by the court would either be poor in\nitself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger\ncomplex\u201d).\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR adds that the circumstances in\nwhich these prudential considerations lead the Court not\nto decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.\nAnte, at 7. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have\nbefore us such a case. Four sets of prudential considera-\ntions, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.\n   First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign\naffairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a\nsubsection of a section that concerns the relation between\nJerusalem and the State of Israel. See \u00a7214 of the Foreign\nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.\n1365 (\u201cUnited States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as\nthe Capital of Israel\u201d).) The Constitution primarily dele-\ngates the foreign affairs powers \u201cto the political depart-\nments of the government, Executive and Legislative,\u201d not\nto the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.\nWaterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting\ndiscretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that\nfact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typical-\nly is highly political. It is \u201cdelicate\u201d and \u201ccomplex.\u201d Chi-\ncago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often\nrests upon information readily available to the Executive\nBranch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,\nbut not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently\nis highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called\n\u201cprophecy.\u201d Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy\ntypically lies well beyond the experience or professional\ncapacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign\naffairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States\nto speak \u201cwith one voice and ac[t] as one,\u201d is particularly\nimportant. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242\n(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,\nJ. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and\nWechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n240 (6th ed. 2009).\n   The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that\nhave significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in\nthe fact that many of the cases in which the Court has in-\nvoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this\narea, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended\nupon the partner state\u2019s constitutional authority, Doe v.\nBraden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing\nexistence, Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285 (1902);\ncases concerning the existence of foreign states, govern-\nments, belligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central\nLeather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918); United States v.\nKlintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Pal-\nmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634\u2013635 (1818); and cases concerning\nthe territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v.\nSuffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson,\n2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829). See Baker, supra, at 186, 211\u2013213\n(citing these cases as the Court\u2019s principal foreign-\nrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nat 243\u2013247.\n   Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional\nquestion before us, they may well have to evaluate the\nforeign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The\nconstitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,\n\u00a7214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the re-\nquest of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the\nrequest of the citizen\u2019s legal guardian), shall \u201crecord\u201d in\nthe citizen\u2019s passport or consular birth report \u201cthe place\nof birth as Israel.\u201d 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is\nwhether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the\nPresident\u2019s inherent constitutional authority to make cer-\ntain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.\nAssn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\u2013415 (2003)\n(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,\n445 (1998) (\u201c[T]his Court has recognized that in the for-\neign affairs arena, the President has \u2018a degree of discretion\nand freedom from statutory restriction which would not be\nadmissible were domestic affairs alone involved\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.\n304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\nv. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637\u2013638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The Secretary of State argues that the President\u2019s con-\nstitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes\nthe power to recognize foreign governments, that this\nCourt has long recognized that the latter power belongs\nto the President exclusively, that the power includes the\npower to determine claims over disputed territory as well\nas the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the\nstatute unconstitutionally limits the President\u2019s exclusive\nauthority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.\nII, \u00a72, cl. 2; Art. II, \u00a73; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How.\n38, 50\u201351 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420\n(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition poli-\ncy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U.

S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntive passport authority).\n   Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,\npoints out that the Constitution also grants Congress\npowers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to\ndeclare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate\nnaturalization. See Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also Ameri-\ncan Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may\nshare some of the recognition power and its attendant\npower of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,\nPalmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,\n137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they\nadd that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into\nthis country and concerning the citizenship of children\nborn abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of\nNew York, 92 U. S. 259, 270\u2013271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue\nTing v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigra-\ntion); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688\n(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include\nthe power to specify the content of a passport (or consular\nbirth report). And when such a specification takes the\nform of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires\nthe President (through the Secretary of State) to execute\nthat statute. See Art. II, \u00a73.\n   Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned\nonly with purely administrative matters (or were its en-\nforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign\npolicy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitu-\ntional question might not involve judges in trying to an-\nswer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,\nadministrative matters can have implications that extend\nfar beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions\nin that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it\nmay well turn out that resolution of the constitutional\nargument will require a court to decide how far the stat-\nute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,\ndetermining not only whether but also the extent to\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich enforcement will interfere with the President\u2019s\nability to make significant recognition-related foreign\npolicy decisions.\n   Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivo-\ntofsky, for example, argues that replacing \u201cJerusalem\u201d on\nhis passport with \u201cIsrael\u201d will have no serious foreign\npolicy significance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46\u201352;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 25\u201326. And in support he points\nto (1) a State Department official\u2019s statement that birth-\nplace designation serves primarily as \u201can element of iden-\ntification,\u201d while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the\nfact that the State Department has recorded births in\nunrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza\nStrip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse\neffect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does\n(because of what the Government calls \u201cclerical errors\u201d)\ncarry with it the name of \u201cIsrael\u201d on certain official docu-\nments, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 7\u201310, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58\u201360,\n75\u201376. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the\n100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United\nStates recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel\nAviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel,\nwhile denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans\nborn in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18\u201320, 48\u201349;\nApp. 48.\n   At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing\nIsrael on the passports (and consular birth reports) of\nAmericans born in Jerusalem will have significantly ad-\nverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8,\n37\u201341. She says that doing so would represent \u201c \u2018an offi-\ncial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusa-\nlem as a city located within Israel,\u2019 \u201d id., at 38\u201339, that it\n\u201cwould be interpreted as an official act of recognizing\nJerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,\u201d App. 56,\nand that our \u201cnational security interests\u201d consequently\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Such an ac-\ntion, she says, \u201c \u2018would signal, symbolically or concretely,\nthat\u2019 \u201d the United States \u201c \u2018recognizes that Jerusalem is a\ncity that is located within the sovereign territory of Is-\nrael,\u2019\u201d and doing so, \u201c\u2018would critically compromise the ability\nof the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians\nand others in the region to further the peace process.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent 2; App. 52\u201353. She adds that the\nvery enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 pro-\nduced headlines in the Middle East stating the \u201cthe U. S.\nnow recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d Id., at 231;\nBrief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53\u201355, 227\u2013231.\n   A judge\u2019s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind\nis minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so\nrisks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy\ndecisionmaking by the other branches of Government.\nHow, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or\nthe extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication\nthat it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?\n   Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial\nresolution of the constitutional determination are not\nparticularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the\nkind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily\nintegrity, which courts have traditionally sought to pro-\ntect. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673\u2013\n674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of\nbodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an\ninterest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the\nConstitution grants to individuals and that courts tradi-\ntionally have protected from invasion by the other branches\nof Government. And I emphasize this fact because the\nneed for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign\npolicy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe\npointed out many years ago, \u201cOur courts would not refuse\nto entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of\nthe imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwere clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up\nwith our relations to the Chinese government.\u201d 74 Harv.\nL. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/\nJudicial Answers 63\u201364 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,\n553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).\n  The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to\nan ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen\nborn in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or\nHaifa, does not have the \u201coption\u201d to \u201cspecify or suppress the\nname of a country that accords with his or her ideology\u201d);\nsee also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens\nborn in Jerusalem \u201cfrom identifying their birthplace in a\nmanner that conforms with their convictions\u201d). And inso-\nfar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideo-\nlogical, courts have often refused to consider the matter,\nleaving the injured party to look to the political branches\nfor protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66\u2013\n67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739\u2013740\n(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim is unim-\nportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is\npurely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering\nsomewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to\nthe political branches for resolution of relevant legal is-\nsues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179\n(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).\n  Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different\nforeign policy views among the political branches of Gov-\nernment, those branches have nonjudicial methods of\nworking out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at\n1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and\nStewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding\nin similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide\ntreaty power question). The Executive and Legislative\nBranches frequently work out disagreements through\nongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example,\nbudget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, commit-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which,\ntaken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Con-\ngress as well as the President play an important role in\nthe shaping of foreign policy. Indeed, both the Legislative\nBranch and the Executive Branch typically understand\nthe need to work each with the other in order to create\neffective foreign policy. In that understanding, those\nrelated contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related\nrelationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of\ndisagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of\nthe political-question \u201cdoctrine ultimately turns, as\nLearned Hand put it, on \u2018how importunately the occasion\ndemands an answer,\u2019 \u201d Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of\nRights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to\nwork out their differences minimizes the need for judicial\nintervention here.\n   The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its mini-\nmal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious\nrisk that intervention will bring about \u201cembarrassment,\u201d\nshow lack of \u201crespect\u201d for the other branches, and poten-\ntially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For\nthese prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-\nquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of\nthis case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 simi-\nlar conclusion.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n",

Argued November 7, 2011\u2014Decided March 26, 2012\nPetitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem. His\n  mother requested that Zivotofsky\u2019s place of birth be listed as \u201cIsrael\u201d\n  on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to\n  \u00a7214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.\n  That provision states: \u201cFor purposes of the registration of birth, certi-\n  fication of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States cit-\n  izen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\n  quest of the citizen or the citizen\u2019s legal guardian, record the place of\n  birth as Israel.\u201d U. S. officials refused the request, citing a State De-\n  partment policy that prohibits recording \u201cIsrael\u201d as the place of birth\n  for those born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky\u2019s parents filed a suit on his\n  behalf against the Secretary of State. The District Court dismissed\n  the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question\n  regarding Jerusalem\u2019s political status. The D. C. Circuit affirmed,\n  reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive\n  power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that\n  power cannot be reviewed by the courts.\nHeld: The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zi-\n votofsky\u2019s claim. Pp. 5\u221212.\n    (a) This Court has said that a controversy \u201cinvolves a political\n question . . . where there is \u2018a textually demonstrable constitutional\n commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a\n lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolv-\n ing it.\u2019 \u201d Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228. The lower courts\n ruled that this case presents such a political question because they\n2                        ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky\u2019s claim\n    would require the Judiciary to define U. S. policy regarding the sta-\n    tus of Jerusalem. In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only\n    whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under \u00a7214(d) to\n    choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.\n    Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreo-\n    ver, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of \u00a7214(d),\n    the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is consti-\n    tutional. There is no \u201ctextually demonstrable constitutional com-\n    mitment\u201d of that question to another branch: At least since Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is \u201cem-\n    phatically the province and duty\u201d of the Judiciary to determine the\n    constitutionality of a statute. Nor is there \u201ca lack of judicially discov-\n    erable and manageable standards for resolving\u201d the question: Both\n    parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textu-\n    al, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that\n    \u00a7214(d) is constitutional. Pp. 5\u201312.\n      (b) Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case\n    presents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivo-\n    tofsky\u2019s claim. This Court is \u201ca court of final review and not first\n    view,\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.

The State Department\ndeclined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of\nnot taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem.\nWhen sued by an American who invoked the statute, the\nSecretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority\nto decide the case because it presented a political question.\nThe Court of Appeals so held.\n  We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determin-\ning whether this statute may be given effect, or instead\nmust be struck down in light of authority conferred on the\nExecutive by the Constitution.\n                          I\n                          A\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Au-\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v.

Id., at 1366.\nThe fourth and final provision, \u00a7214(d), is the only one at\nstake in this case. Entitled \u201cRecord of Place of Birth as\nIsrael for Passport Purposes,\u201d it provides that \u201c[f]or pur-\nposes of the registration of birth, certification of national-\nity, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born\nin the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\nquest of the citizen or the citizen\u2019s legal guardian, record\nthe place of birth as Israel.\u201d Ibid.\n   The State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual states\nthat \u201c[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located\nin territory disputed by another country, the city or area\nof birth may be written in the passport.\u201d 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual \u00a71383.5\u20132, App. 108. The manual specifically\ndirects that passport officials should enter \u201cJERUSALEM\u201d\nand should \u201cnot write Israel or Jordan\u201d when recording\nthe birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a pass-\nport.

He added that if the sec-\ntion is \u201cconstrued as mandatory,\u201d then it would \u201cinterfere\nwith the President\u2019s constitutional authority to formulate\nthe position of the United States, speak for the Nation in\ninternational affairs, and determine the terms on which\nrecognition is given to foreign states.\u201d Ibid. He concluded\nby emphasizing that \u201cU. S. policy regarding Jerusalem has\nnot changed.\u201d Ibid. The President made no specific refer-\nence to the passport mandate in \u00a7214(d).\n                              B\n   Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in\nJerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after \u00a7214(d) was\nenacted. Zivotofsky\u2019s parents were American citizens and\nhe accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional\nenactment. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401\nU. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American\ncitizens acquire citizenship at birth through \u201ccongres-\nsional generosity\u201d). Zivotofsky\u2019s mother filed an application\nfor a consular report of birth abroad and a United States\npassport. She requested that his place of birth be listed as\n\u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d on both documents. U. S. officials\ninformed Zivotofsky\u2019s mother that State Department\npolicy prohibits recording \u201cIsrael\u201d as Zivotofsky\u2019s place of\nbirth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a\npassport and consular report of birth abroad listing only\n\u201cJerusalem.\u201d App. 19\u201320.\n   Zivotofsky\u2019s parents filed a complaint on his behalf\nagainst the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a de-\nclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering\nthe Secretary to identify his place of birth as \u201cJerusalem,\nIsrael\u201d in the official documents. Id., at 17\u201318. The Dis-\ntrict Court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing\nand that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political\nquestion.\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that Zivotofsky did have standing. It then\nobserved that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that\n\u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d be recorded on his passport, \u201c[b]oth\nsides agree that the question now is whether \u00a7214(d)\nentitles [him] to have just \u2018Israel\u2019 listed as his place of\nbirth.\u201d 444 F. 3d 614, 619 (2006). The D. C. Circuit de-\ntermined that additional factual development might be\nhelpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable,\nas the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implica-\ntions of listing \u201cIsrael\u201d alone as a birthplace on the pass-\nport. Id., at 619\u2013620. It therefore remanded the case to\nthe District Court.\n   The District Court again found that the case was not\njusticiable. It explained that \u201c[r]esolving [Zivotofsky\u2019s]\nclaim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to\ndecide the political status of Jerusalem.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441474\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441474/zivotofsky-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (2007). Concluding that the claim therefore pre-\nsented a political question, the District Court dismissed\nthe case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   The D. C. Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the Consti-\ntution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize\nforeign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power\ncannot be reviewed by the courts. Therefore, \u201cdeciding\nwhether the Secretary of State must mark a passport . . .\nas Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court]\ninto an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to\nthe Executive alone.\u201d 571 F. 3d 1227, 1232\u20131233 (2009).\nThe D.

Circuit held that the political question doctrine\nprohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any\nsuggestion that Congress\u2019s decision to take \u201ca position on\nthe status of Jerusalem\u201d could change the analysis. Id., at\n1233.\n   Judge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote\nseparately to express his view that the political question\ndoctrine has no application to this case. He explained that\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe issue before the court was whether \u00a7214(d) \u201cimpermis-\nsibly intrude[s] on the President\u2019s exclusive power to\nrecognize foreign sovereigns.\u201d Id., at 1234. That question,\nhe observed, involves \u201ccommonplace issues of statutory\nand constitutional interpretation\u201d plainly within the con-\nstitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at\n1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined\nthat designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is\na policy \u201cin furtherance of the recognition power.\u201d Id., at\n1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that\npower exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found\n\u00a7214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded\nthat Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and con-\ncurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.\n  Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted\nreview. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim\npresents a political question and therefore cannot be ad-\njudicated. We disagree.\n  In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide\ncases properly before it, even those it \u201cwould gladly avoid.\u201d\nCohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1821). Our prece-\ndents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,\nknown as the \u201cpolitical question\u201d doctrine. See, e.g., Ja-\npan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S.\n221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy\n\u201cinvolves a political question . . . where there is \u2018a textu-\nally demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue\nto a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\u2019 \u201d\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case,\nwe have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the\ndispute before it.\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political\nquestion because deciding Zivotofsky\u2019s claim would force\nthe Judicial Branch to interfere with the President\u2019s exer-\ncise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The\nDistrict Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to\n\u201cdecide the political status of Jerusalem.\u201d 511 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 103. This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivo-\ntofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jeru-\nsalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to deter-\nmine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under\n\u00a7214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport\nas his place of birth.\n    For its part, the D. C. Circuit treated the two questions\nas one and the same. That court concluded that \u201c[o]nly\nthe Executive\u2014not Congress and not the courts\u2014has the\npower to define U. S. policy regarding Israel\u2019s sovereignty\nover Jerusalem,\u201d and also to \u201cdecide how best to imple-\nment that policy.\u201d 571 F. 3d, at 1232. Because the De-\npartment\u2019s passport rule was adopted to implement the\nPresident\u2019s \u201cexclusive and unreviewable constitutional\npower to keep the United States out of the debate over the\nstatus of Jerusalem,\u201d the validity of that rule was itself a\n\u201cnonjusticiable political question\u201d that \u201cthe Constitution\nleaves to the Executive alone.\u201d Id., at 1231\u20131233. Indeed,\nthe D. C. Circuit\u2019s opinion does not even mention \u00a7214(d)\nuntil the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis, and then\nonly to dismiss it as irrelevant: \u201cThat Congress took a\nposition on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a\nstatutory cause of action . . . is of no moment to whether\nthe judiciary has [the] authority to resolve this dispute\n. . . .\u201d Id., at 1233.\n    The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly\nrelevant to the Judiciary\u2019s power to decide Zivotofsky\u2019s\nclaim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant\na foreign policy decision of the political branches with the\ncourts\u2019 own unmoored determination of what United\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivo-\ntofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory\nright. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if\nZivotofsky\u2019s interpretation of the statute is correct, and\nwhether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar\njudicial exercise.\n   Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the inter-\npretation of \u00a7214(d), the only real question for the courts is\nwhether the statute is constitutional. At least since Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized\nthat when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the\nConstitution, \u201c[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d Id., at\n177. That duty will sometimes involve the \u201c[r]esolution of\nlitigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of\nthe three branches,\u201d but courts cannot avoid their respon-\nsibility merely \u201cbecause the issues have political implica-\ntions.\u201d INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 943 (1983).\n   In this case, determining the constitutionality of \u00a7214(d)\ninvolves deciding whether the statute impermissibly\nintrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution.\nIf so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky\u2019s case\nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the\nother hand, the statute does not trench on the President\u2019s\npowers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivo-\ntofsky a passport that complies with \u00a7214(d). Either way,\nthe political question doctrine is not implicated. \u201cNo\npolicy underlying the political question doctrine suggests\nthat Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitu-\ntionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.\u201d Id.,\nat 941\u2013942.\n   The Secretary contends that \u201cthere is \u2018a textually de-\nmonstrable constitutional commitment\u2019 \u201d to the President\nof the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as\na corollary, to determine whether an American born in\nJerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbirth on his passport. Nixon, 506 U. S., at 228 (quoting\nBaker, 369 U. S., at 217); see Brief for Respondent 49\u201350.\nPerhaps. But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment\nto the Executive of the power to determine the constitu-\ntionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately\nexercises that authority, including in a case such as this,\nwhere the question is whether Congress or the Executive\nis \u201caggrandizing its power at the expense of another\nbranch.\u201d Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878\n(1991); see, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176\n(1926) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it en-\ncroached upon the President\u2019s removal power); Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (finding a statute un-\nconstitutional because it \u201cintruded into the executive\nfunction\u201d); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988)\n(upholding a statute\u2019s constitutionality against a charge\nthat it \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with the President\u2019s\nexercise of his constitutionally appointed functions\u201d).\n   Our precedents have also found the political question\ndoctrine implicated when there is \u201c \u2018a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving\u2019 \u201d the\nquestion before the court. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting\nBaker, supra, at 217). Framing the issue as the lower\ncourts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide\nthe political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those\nconcerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is\nrecognized to be the more focused one of the constitution-\nality of \u00a7214(d). Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal\narguments regarding whether \u00a7214(d) is constitutional in\nlight of powers committed to the Executive, and whether\nCongress\u2019s own powers with respect to passports must be\nweighed in analyzing this question.\n   For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her\nargument on the political question issue, claiming that the\nConstitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to\nformulate recognition policy. She roots her claim in the\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution\u2019s declaration that the President shall \u201creceive\nAmbassadors and other public Ministers.\u201d U. S. Const.,\nArt. II, \u00a73. According to the Secretary, \u201c[c]enturies-long\nExecutive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence,\nand decisions by this Court\u201d confirm that the \u201creceive\nAmbassadors\u201d clause confers upon the Executive the\nexclusive power of recognition. Brief for Respondent 18.\n    The Secretary observes that \u201cPresident Washington and\nhis cabinet unanimously decided that the President could\nreceive the ambassador from the new government of\nFrance without first consulting Congress.\u201d Id., at 19\n(citing Letter from George Washington to the Cabinet\n(Apr. 18, 1793), reprinted in 25 Papers of Thomas Jeffer-\nson 568\u2013569 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1992); Thomas Jefferson,\nNotes on Washington\u2019s Questions on Neutrality and the\nAlliance with France (May 6, 1793), reprinted in id., at\n665\u2013666). She notes, too, that early attempts by the Leg-\nislature to affect recognition policy were regularly \u201cre-\njected in Congress as inappropriate incursions into the\nExecutive Branch\u2019s constitutional authority.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 21. And she cites precedents from this Court\nstating that \u201c[p]olitical recognition is exclusively a func-\ntion of the Executive.\u201d Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sab-\nbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 410 (1964); see Brief for Respondent\n24\u201327 (citing, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203\n(1942)).\n    The Secretary further contends that \u00a7214(d) constitutes\nan impermissible exercise of the recognition power be-\ncause \u201cthe decision as to how to describe the place of birth\n. . . operates as an official statement of whether the United\nStates recognizes a state\u2019s sovereignty over a territorial\narea.\u201d Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not\n\u201clist[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over\nthe relevant territory the United States does not recog-\nnize.\u201d Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, \u201clisting \u2018Israel\u2019 as\nthe place of birth would constitute an official decision by\n10                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city\nlocated within Israel. \u201d Id., at 38\u201339 (some internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an\nexercise of the recognition power, \u00a7214(d) is instead a\n\u201clegitimate and permissible\u201d exercise of Congress\u2019s \u201cau-\nthority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor\nLouis Henkin\u2019s observation that \u201c \u2018in the competition for\npower in foreign relations,\u2019 Congress has \u2018an impressive\narray of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitu-\ntion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and\nthe United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivo-\ntofsky suggests that Congress\u2019s authority to enact \u00a7214(d)\nderives specifically from its powers over naturalization,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., \u00a78,\ncl. 3. According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these\npowers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of\npassports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing\nAct of Aug. 18, 1856, \u00a723, 11 Stat. 60).\n   Zivotofsky contends that \u00a7214(d) fits squarely within\nthis tradition. He notes that the State Department\u2019s\ndesignated representative stated in her deposition for this\nlitigation that the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry is included only\nas \u201can element of identification.\u201d App. 76 (Deposition of\nCatherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for\nOverseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.\nMoreover, Zivotofsky argues, the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry\ncannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sover-\neigns, because the State Department authorizes recording\nunrecognized territories\u2014such as the Gaza Strip and the\nWest Bank\u2014as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43\n(citing 7 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a71383.5\u20135, App. 109\u2013\n110).\n   Further, Zivotofsky claims that even if \u00a7214(d) does\nimplicate the recognition power, that is not a power the\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution commits exclusively to the Executive. Zivo-\ntofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority\ngranted to the President in the \u201creceive Ambassadors\u201d\nclause. He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexander\nHamilton described the power conferred by this clause as\n\u201cmore a matter of dignity than of authority,\u201d and called it \u201ca\ncircumstance, which will be without consequence in the\nadministration of the government.\u201d The Federalist No. 69,\np. 468 (J. Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37. Zivo-\ntofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such\nas Congress\u2019s power to declare war, that suggest some con-\ngressional role in recognition. Reply Brief for Petitioner 23\n(citing U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 11). He cites, for example,\nan 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, ac-\nknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to\nrecognize because it is a power \u201cno where expressly dele-\ngated\u201d in the Constitution, and one that is \u201cnecessarily\ninvolved in some of the great powers given to Congress.\u201d\nMessage from the President of the United States Upon the\nSubject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of\nTexas, H. R. Doc. No. 35, 24th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; see Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 11\u201312.\n   Zivotofsky argues that language from this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively\nto the President is inapplicable to his claim, because that\nlanguage appeared in cases where the Court was asked to\nalter recognition policy developed by the Executive in the\nabsence of congressional opposition. See Brief for Petitioner\n44\u201346; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18\u201319. Finally, Zivotofsky\ncontends that even if the \u201creceive Ambassadors\u201d clause\nconfers some exclusive recognition power on the President,\nsimply allowing a choice as to the \u201cplace of birth\u201d entry on a\npassport does not significantly intrude on that power.\n   Recitation of these arguments\u2014which sound in familiar\nprinciples of constitutional interpretation\u2014is enough to\nestablish that this case does not \u201cturn on standards that defy\n12                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial application.\u201d Baker, 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of\nZivotofksy\u2019s claim demands careful examination of the tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the\nparties regarding the nature of the statute and of the pass-\nport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The\npolitical question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of\nthis case.\n                              III\n  To say that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim presents issues the Judi-\nciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a\ndecision in this case is simple. Because the District Court\nand the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by\nthe political question doctrine, we are without the benefit\nof thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of\nthe merits. Ours is \u201ca court of final review and not first\nview.\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Ordinarily, \u201cwe do not decide in the first in-\nstance issues not decided below.\u201d National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In\nparticular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we\ntypically remand for resolution of any claims the lower\ncourts\u2019 error prevented them from addressing. See, e.g.,\nBond v. United States, 564 U.

We see no\nreason to depart from this approach in this case. Having\ndetermined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the\nlower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D.

I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that this\ncase does not present a political question. I write sepa-\nrately, however, because I understand the inquiry re-\nquired by the political question doctrine to be more de-\nmanding than that suggested by the Court.\n                              I\n   The political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of\ncircumstances in which courts properly examine whether\na particular suit is justiciable\u2014that is, whether the dis-\npute is appropriate for resolution by courts. The doctrine\nis \u201cessentially a function of the separation of powers,\u201d\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), which recognizes\nthe limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords\nappropriate respect to the other branches\u2019 exercise of their\nown constitutional powers.\n   In Baker, this Court identified six circumstances in\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwhich an issue might present a political question: (1) \u201ca\ntextually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the\nissue to a coordinate political department\u201d; (2) \u201ca lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for\nresolving it\u201d; (3) \u201cthe impossibility of deciding without an\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudi-\ncial discretion\u201d; (4) \u201cthe impossibility of a court\u2019s undertak-\ning independent resolution without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government\u201d; (5) \u201can\nunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made\u201d; or (6) \u201cthe potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.\u201d Id., at 217. Baker estab-\nlished that \u201c[u]nless one of these formulations is inextri-\ncable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for\nnonjusticiability.\u201d Ibid. But Baker left unanswered when\nthe presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal,\nas well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the\nrelative importance of each in determining whether a case\nis suitable for adjudication.\n   In my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct\njustifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a\ndispute. When a case would require a court to decide an\nissue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordi-\nnate political department, as envisioned by Baker\u2019s first\nfactor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks\nauthority to resolve that issue. See, e.g., Nixon v. United\nStates, 506 U.

S. 267, 278 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nThat traditional role involves the application of some\nmanageable and cognizable standard within the compe-\ntence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts\nof a concrete case. When a court is given no standard by\nwhich to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute\nin the absence of a yet-unmade policy determination\ncharged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is be-\nyond the judicial role envisioned by Article III. See, e.g.,\nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973) (\u201c[I]t is difficult\nto conceive of an area of governmental activity in which\nthe courts have less competence\u201d than \u201c[t]he complex,\nsubtle, and professional decisions as to the composition,\ntraining, equipping, and control of a military force\u201d); Vieth,\n541 U. S., at 278 (\u201cOne of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard . . . \u201d). This is not to say, of course,\nthat courts are incapable of interpreting or applying\nsomewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of\nstatutory or constitutional interpretation. But where an\nissue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be \u201cno\ndoubt of [the] validity\u201d of a court\u2019s decision to abstain from\njudgment. Ibid.\n  The final three Baker factors address circumstances in\nwhich prudence may counsel against a court\u2019s resolution of\nan issue presented. Courts should be particularly cautious\nbefore forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that\njudicial intervention risks \u201cembarrassment from multifar-\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v.

S., at 217. We have re-\npeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met\nwhenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitu-\ntionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Gov-\nernment. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495\nU. S. 385, 390\u2013391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.\n486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate\na dispute merely because a decision \u201cmay have significant\npolitical overtones\u201d or affect \u201cthe conduct of this Nation\u2019s\nforeign relations,\u201d Japan Whaling Assn. v. American\nCetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts\ndecline to resolve a controversy within their traditional\ncompetence and proper jurisdiction simply because the\nquestion is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the\npotential real for conflict with the policy preferences of\nthe political branches.

In two respects, however, my understanding of the\npolitical question doctrine might require a court to engage\nin further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court.\n  First, the Court appropriately recognizes that petition-\ner\u2019s claim to a statutory right is \u201crelevant\u201d to the justicia-\nbility inquiry required in this case. Ante, at 6. In order to\nevaluate whether a case presents a political question, a\ncourt must first identify with precision the issue it is being\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Often when such factors are implicated in a case presenting a politi-\n\ncal question, other factors identified in Baker will likewise be apparent.\nSee, e.g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 236 (1993) (\u201c[i]n addi-\ntion to the textual commitment argument,\u201d finding persuasive that\n\u201copening the door of judicial review\u201d of impeachment procedures would\n\u201c \u2018expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of\nchaos\u2019 \u201d); Baker, 369 U. S., at 222 (explaining that the Court in Luther\nv. Borden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86466\"><a href=\"/opinion/86466/luther-v-borden/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1849), found present features associated with each\nof the three rationales underlying Baker\u2019s factors).\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nasked to decide. Here, petitioner\u2019s suit claims that a\nfederal statute provides him with a right to have \u201cIsrael\u201d\nlisted as his place of birth on his passport and other re-\nlated documents. App. 15\u201318. To decide that question, a\ncourt must determine whether the statute is constitu-\ntional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to\nissue petitioner\u2019s desired passport, or unconstitutional, in\nwhich case his suit is at an end. Resolution of that issue is\nnot one \u201ctextually committed\u201d to another branch; to the\ncontrary, it is committed to this one. In no fashion does the\nquestion require a court to review the wisdom of the Pres-\nident\u2019s policy toward Jerusalem or any other decision\ncommitted to the discretion of a coordinate department.\nFor that reason, I agree that the decision below should be\nreversed.\n   That is not to say, however, that no statute could give\nrise to a political question. It is not impossible to imagine\na case involving the application or even the constitutional-\nity of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable\nissue. Indeed, this Court refused to determine whether an\nOhio state constitutional provision offended the Repub-\nlican Guarantee Clause, Art. IV, \u00a74, holding that \u201cthe\nquestion of whether that guarantee of the Constitution\nhas been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.\u201d\nOhio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569 (1916).\nA similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute,\nfor instance, purporting to award financial relief to those\nimproperly \u201ctried\u201d of impeachment offenses. To adjudicate\nclaims under such a statute would require a court to re-\nsolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in\nNixon. Such examples are atypical, but they suffice to show\nthat the foreclosure altogether of political question analy-\nsis in statutory cases is unwarranted.\n   Second, the Court suggests that this case does not im-\nplicate the political question doctrine\u2019s concern with issues\nexhibiting \u201c \u2018a lack of judicially discoverable and managea-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But that was equally\ntrue in Nixon, a case in which we found that \u201cthe use of\nthe word \u2018try\u2019 in the first sentence of the Impeachment\nTrial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judi-\ncially manageable standard of review of the Senate\u2019s\nactions.\u201d 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion\neven though the parties\u2019 briefs focused upon the text of the\nImpeachment Trial Clause, \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s drafting\nhistory,\u201d \u201ccontemporaneous commentary,\u201d \u201cthe unbroken\npractice of the Senate for 150 years,\u201d contemporary dic-\ntionary meanings, \u201cHamilton\u2019s Federalist essays,\u201d and the\npractice in the House of Lords prior to ratification. Such\nevidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than\nthat on which the parties rely here.\n   In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which\nlitigants rely is common to judicial consideration that\ndetermines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable\nand manageable standards. Rather, it is whether that\nevidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate\nmeaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The\nanswer will almost always be yes, but if the parties\u2019 tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or\nwholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more\nthan guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of\narguments offered to courts might well still present justi-\nciability concerns.\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority\nfound a political question solely on the basis that this case\nrequired resolution of an issue \u201ctextually committed\u201d to\nthe Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual\ncommitment, I respectfully concur in the Court\u2019s decision\nto reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This case\ndoes not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power\nto recognize foreign governments and the extent of their\nterritory is conferred exclusively on the President or is\nshared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the\nstatutory provision in question represents an attempt by\nCongress to dictate United States policy regarding the\nstatus of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect\nthat Congress has the power to mandate that an American\ncitizen born abroad be given the option of including in his\npassport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)\nwhat amounts to a statement of personal belief on the\nstatus of Jerusalem.\n   Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution cer-\ntainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe\nthe contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution\ngives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regu-\nlate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v.

The\nConstitution also gives Congress the power to make a\n\u201cuniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 4, and\npursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws con-\ncerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents\nwho are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong\nKim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow\nCongress to mandate that identifying information be in-\ncluded in passports and CRBAs.\n   The President also has a measure of authority concern-\ning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President\nhas broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,\nAmerican Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\n(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the\npower to issue passports, even in the absence of any for-\nmal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See\nHaig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that\n\u201c[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,\nthe common perception was that the issuance of a pass-\nport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive\nand that the Executive would exercise this power in the\ninterests of the national security and foreign policy of the\nUnited States\u201d).

They also include (3) issues that\ncourts cannot decide without making \u201can initial policy\ndetermination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\u201d\n(4) issues that a court cannot independently decide \u201cwith-\nout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\nof government,\u201d (5) cases in which there is \u201can unusual\nneed for unquestioning adherence to a political decision\nalready made,\u201d and (6) cases in which there is a potential\nfor \u201cembarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\nvarious departments on one question.\u201d Ibid.\n  As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR also points out, these categories\n(and in my view particularly the last four) embody \u201ccir-\ncumstances in which prudence may counsel against a\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourt\u2019s resolution of an issue presented.\u201d Ante, at 3 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine\n\u201cderiv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the\nrespect we owe the political departments\u201d); Goldwater v.\nCarter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201c[T]he political-question doctrine rests in\npart on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect\namong the three branches of Government\u201d); see also Jaffe,\nStanding to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74\nHarv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesita-\ntion where a legal issue is \u201cfelt to be so closely related to\na complex of decisions not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction\nthat its resolution by the court would either be poor in\nitself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger\ncomplex\u201d).\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR adds that the circumstances in\nwhich these prudential considerations lead the Court not\nto decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.\nAnte, at 7. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have\nbefore us such a case. Four sets of prudential considera-\ntions, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.\n   First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign\naffairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a\nsubsection of a section that concerns the relation between\nJerusalem and the State of Israel. See \u00a7214 of the Foreign\nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.\n1365 (\u201cUnited States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as\nthe Capital of Israel\u201d).) The Constitution primarily dele-\ngates the foreign affairs powers \u201cto the political depart-\nments of the government, Executive and Legislative,\u201d not\nto the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.\nWaterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting\ndiscretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that\nfact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typical-\nly is highly political. It is \u201cdelicate\u201d and \u201ccomplex.\u201d Chi-\ncago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often\nrests upon information readily available to the Executive\nBranch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,\nbut not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently\nis highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called\n\u201cprophecy.\u201d Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy\ntypically lies well beyond the experience or professional\ncapacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign\naffairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States\nto speak \u201cwith one voice and ac[t] as one,\u201d is particularly\nimportant. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242\n(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,\nJ. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and\nWechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n240 (6th ed. 2009).\n   The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that\nhave significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in\nthe fact that many of the cases in which the Court has in-\nvoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this\narea, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended\nupon the partner state\u2019s constitutional authority, Doe v.\nBraden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86894\"><a href=\"/opinion/86894/doe-v-braden/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing\nexistence, Terlinden v.

See Baker, supra, at 186, 211\u2013213\n(citing these cases as the Court\u2019s principal foreign-\nrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nat 243\u2013247.\n   Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional\nquestion before us, they may well have to evaluate the\nforeign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The\nconstitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,\n\u00a7214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the re-\nquest of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the\nrequest of the citizen\u2019s legal guardian), shall \u201crecord\u201d in\nthe citizen\u2019s passport or consular birth report \u201cthe place\nof birth as Israel.\u201d 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is\nwhether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the\nPresident\u2019s inherent constitutional authority to make cer-\ntain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.\nAssn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\u2013415 (2003)\n(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,\n445 (1998) (\u201c[T]his Court has recognized that in the for-\neign affairs arena, the President has \u2018a degree of discretion\nand freedom from statutory restriction which would not be\nadmissible were domestic affairs alone involved\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.\n304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\nv. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637\u2013638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The Secretary of State argues that the President\u2019s con-\nstitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes\nthe power to recognize foreign governments, that this\nCourt has long recognized that the latter power belongs\nto the President exclusively, that the power includes the\npower to determine claims over disputed territory as well\nas the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the\nstatute unconstitutionally limits the President\u2019s exclusive\nauthority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.\nII, \u00a72, cl. 2; Art. II, \u00a73; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86769\"><a href=\"/opinion/86769/kennett-v-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50\u201351 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420\n(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition poli-\ncy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (execu-\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntive passport authority).\n   Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,\npoints out that the Constitution also grants Congress\npowers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to\ndeclare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate\nnaturalization. See Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also Ameri-\ncan Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may\nshare some of the recognition power and its attendant\npower of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,\nPalmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,\n137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they\nadd that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into\nthis country and concerning the citizenship of children\nborn abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of\nNew York, 92 U. S. 259, 270\u2013271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue\nTing v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigra-\ntion); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688\n(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include\nthe power to specify the content of a passport (or consular\nbirth report). And when such a specification takes the\nform of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires\nthe President (through the Secretary of State) to execute\nthat statute. See Art. II, \u00a73.\n   Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned\nonly with purely administrative matters (or were its en-\nforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign\npolicy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitu-\ntional question might not involve judges in trying to an-\nswer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,\nadministrative matters can have implications that extend\nfar beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions\nin that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it\nmay well turn out that resolution of the constitutional\nargument will require a court to decide how far the stat-\nute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,\ndetermining not only whether but also the extent to\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich enforcement will interfere with the President\u2019s\nability to make significant recognition-related foreign\npolicy decisions.\n   Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivo-\ntofsky, for example, argues that replacing \u201cJerusalem\u201d on\nhis passport with \u201cIsrael\u201d will have no serious foreign\npolicy significance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46\u201352;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 25\u201326. And in support he points\nto (1) a State Department official\u2019s statement that birth-\nplace designation serves primarily as \u201can element of iden-\ntification,\u201d while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the\nfact that the State Department has recorded births in\nunrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza\nStrip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse\neffect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does\n(because of what the Government calls \u201cclerical errors\u201d)\ncarry with it the name of \u201cIsrael\u201d on certain official docu-\nments, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 7\u201310, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58\u201360,\n75\u201376. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the\n100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United\nStates recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel\nAviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel,\nwhile denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans\nborn in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18\u201320, 48\u201349;\nApp. 48.\n   At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing\nIsrael on the passports (and consular birth reports) of\nAmericans born in Jerusalem will have significantly ad-\nverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8,\n37\u201341. She says that doing so would represent \u201c \u2018an offi-\ncial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusa-\nlem as a city located within Israel,\u2019 \u201d id., at 38\u201339, that it\n\u201cwould be interpreted as an official act of recognizing\nJerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,\u201d App. 56,\nand that our \u201cnational security interests\u201d consequently\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cwould be significantly harmed,\u201d id., at 49. Such an ac-\ntion, she says, \u201c \u2018would signal, symbolically or concretely,\nthat\u2019 \u201d the United States \u201c \u2018recognizes that Jerusalem is a\ncity that is located within the sovereign territory of Is-\nrael,\u2019\u201d and doing so, \u201c\u2018would critically compromise the ability\nof the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians\nand others in the region to further the peace process.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent 2; App. 52\u201353. She adds that the\nvery enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 pro-\nduced headlines in the Middle East stating the \u201cthe U. S.\nnow recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d Id., at 231;\nBrief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53\u201355, 227\u2013231.\n   A judge\u2019s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind\nis minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so\nrisks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy\ndecisionmaking by the other branches of Government.\nHow, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or\nthe extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication\nthat it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?\n   Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial\nresolution of the constitutional determination are not\nparticularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the\nkind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily\nintegrity, which courts have traditionally sought to pro-\ntect. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673\u2013\n674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of\nbodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an\ninterest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the\nConstitution grants to individuals and that courts tradi-\ntionally have protected from invasion by the other branches\nof Government. And I emphasize this fact because the\nneed for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign\npolicy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe\npointed out many years ago, \u201cOur courts would not refuse\nto entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of\nthe imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwere clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up\nwith our relations to the Chinese government.\u201d 74 Harv.\nL. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/\nJudicial Answers 63\u201364 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,\n553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).\n  The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to\nan ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen\nborn in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or\nHaifa, does not have the \u201coption\u201d to \u201cspecify or suppress the\nname of a country that accords with his or her ideology\u201d);\nsee also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens\nborn in Jerusalem \u201cfrom identifying their birthplace in a\nmanner that conforms with their convictions\u201d). And inso-\nfar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideo-\nlogical, courts have often refused to consider the matter,\nleaving the injured party to look to the political branches\nfor protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66\u2013\n67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739\u2013740\n(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky\u2019s claim is unim-\nportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is\npurely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering\nsomewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to\nthe political branches for resolution of relevant legal is-\nsues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179\n(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).\n  Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different\nforeign policy views among the political branches of Gov-\nernment, those branches have nonjudicial methods of\nworking out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at\n1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and\nStewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding\nin similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide\ntreaty power question). The Executive and Legislative\nBranches frequently work out disagreements through\nongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example,\nbudget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, commit-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which,\ntaken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Con-\ngress as well as the President play an important role in\nthe shaping of foreign policy. Indeed, both the Legislative\nBranch and the Executive Branch typically understand\nthe need to work each with the other in order to create\neffective foreign policy. In that understanding, those\nrelated contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related\nrelationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of\ndisagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of\nthe political-question \u201cdoctrine ultimately turns, as\nLearned Hand put it, on \u2018how importunately the occasion\ndemands an answer,\u2019 \u201d Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of\nRights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to\nwork out their differences minimizes the need for judicial\nintervention here.\n   The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its mini-\nmal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious\nrisk that intervention will bring about \u201cembarrassment,\u201d\nshow lack of \u201crespect\u201d for the other branches, and poten-\ntially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For\nthese prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-\nquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of\nthis case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 simi-\nlar conclusion.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
