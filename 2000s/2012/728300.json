NOVO NORDISK A/S ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10\u2013844.      Argued December 5, 2011\u2014Decided April 17, 2012\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture,\n  sale, and labeling of prescription drugs. A brand-name drug manu-\n  facturer seeking FDA approval for a drug submits a new drug appli-\n  cation (NDA) containing, among other things, a statement of the\n  drug\u2019s components and proposed labeling describing the uses for\n  which the drug may be marketed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (d).\n  Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer\u2019s drug, another\n  company may seek permission to market a generic version by filing\n  an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). See \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii),\n  (iv). But the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that would in-\n  fringe a brand manufacturer\u2019s patent. To facilitate the approval of\n  generic drugs as soon as patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amend-\n  ments require a brand manufacturer to submit its patent numbers\n  and expiration dates, \u00a7355(b)(1); and FDA regulations require a de-\n  scription of any method-of-use patent, known as a use code, see 21\n  CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e). The FDA does not attempt to verify\n  the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply. In-\n  stead, it simply publishes the codes, patent numbers, and expiration\n  dates in a large volume known as the Orange Book.\n     After consulting the Orange Book, an ANDA applicant enters one\n  of several certifications to assure the FDA that its generic drug will\n  not infringe the brand\u2019s patent. If the patent has not expired, an ap-\n  plicant may fulfill this requirement in one of two ways. First, it may\n  submit a so-called section viii statement asserting that it will market\n  the drug for only those methods of use not covered by the brand\u2019s pa-\n  tent, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii), and proposing a label that\n  \u201ccarves out\u201d the still-patented method(s) of use, see 21 CFR\n2       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                    NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n    \u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA will not approve an ANDA with a section\n    viii statement if the proposed label overlaps at all with the brand\u2019s\n    use code. Second, the ANDA applicant may file a so-called paragraph\n    IV certification stating that the brand\u2019s patent \u201cis invalid or will not\n    be infringed by the [generic drug\u2019s] manufacture, use, or sale.\u201d 21\n    U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Such filing is treated as an act of in-\n    fringement, giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting\n    in a delay in the generic drug\u2019s approval.\n       In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a study de-\n    tailing evidence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent in-\n    formation to the FDA in order to prevent or delay the marketing of\n    generic drugs. In response, Congress created a statutory counter-\n    claim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringe-\n    ment. The provision allows a generic manufacturer to \u201cassert a coun-\n    terclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand] to correct or delete\n    the patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b)\n    or (c) [of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355] on the ground that the patent does not\n    claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\u201d 21 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). This case concerns the scope of the counterclaim\n    provision.\n       Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture the brand-name ver-\n    sion of the diabetes drug repaglinide. The FDA has approved three\n    uses of the drug, but Novo\u2019s method-of-use patent claims only one.\n    Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of\n    the drug for the other two approved methods of use. Caraco initially\n    filed a paragraph IV certification and, considering this an act of in-\n    fringement, Novo brought suit. Caraco then submitted a section viii\n    statement and a proposed label carving out Novo\u2019s patented therapy.\n    But before the FDA could approve Caraco\u2019s ANDA, Novo changed its\n    use code to indicate that it held a patent on all three approved\n    methods of using repaglinide. Because Caraco\u2019s proposed label now\n    overlapped with Novo\u2019s use code, the FDA would not permit Caraco\n    to employ section viii to bring its drug to market.\n       Caraco filed a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement\n    action, seeking an order requiring Novo to \u201ccorrect\u201d its use code be-\n    cause the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of\n    using repaglinide. The District Court granted Caraco summary\n    judgment, but the Federal Circuit reversed. It read the counter-\n    claim\u2019s phrase \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of\n    using the drug\u201d as requiring Caraco to demonstrate that Novo\u2019s pa-\n    tent does not claim any approved method of use; because the patent\n    covers one approved method, the counterclaim was unavailable. The\n    court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use\n    codes because they are not \u201cpatent information submitted by the\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of \u00a7355. That information, the\n  court concluded, consists only of the patent number and expiration\n  date expressly required by the statutory provisions.\nHeld: A generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision\n to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the\n brand\u2019s patent as covering a particular method of using a drug.\n Pp. 10\u201324.\n    (a) The parties first dispute the meaning of \u201cnot an\u201d in the phrase\n \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\u201d\n Novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent\n claims no approved method of use, but Caraco reads this language to\n permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particu-\n lar method that the ANDA applicant seeks to market. In isolation,\n either of these readings is plausible, so the meaning of the phrase\n \u201cnot an\u201d turns on statutory context, see Johnson v. United States, 559\n U. S. ___, ___. This context favors Caraco: Congress understood that\n a drug may have multiple methods of use, not all of which a patent\n covers; and a section viii statement allows the FDA to approve a ge-\n neric drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market.\n The statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not fore-\n close marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones. Within\n this scheme, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the\n brand\u2019s assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic\n company wishes to pursue; the counterclaim\u2019s availability matches\n the availability of FDA approval under the statute. Pp. 11\u201315.\n    (b) The parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as \u201cpa-\n tent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d\n of \u00a7355. A use code, which is a description of the patent, surely quali-\n fies as \u201cpatent information.\u201d Novo nonetheless contends that use\n codes are not \u201csubmitted under\u201d subsections (b) and (c) because those\n provisions expressly require an NDA applicant to provide only \u201cthe\n patent number and the expiration date of any patent\u201d claiming the\n drug or a method of its use. But \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c) also govern the reg-\n ulatory process by which brands provide additional patent infor-\n mation to the FDA. The term \u201cunder\u201d is broad enough to include pa-\n tent information, like use codes, that brands submit as required by\n this scheme. This reading draws support from the Court\u2019s prior deci-\n sions in e.g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 665\u2013\n 668, and Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135; and it is bolstered by\n Congress\u2019s use of the narrower phrases \u201cdescribed in\u201d and \u201cprescribed\n by\u201d in neighboring provisions. See \u00a7\u00a7355(c)(2), (d)(6). Again, the con-\n clusion that use codes are \u201csubmitted under\u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c) fits the\n broader statutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA\u2019s imple-\n mentation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and so it is unsur-\n4       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                    NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n    prising that the counterclaim provision\u2019s language sweeps widely\n    enough to embrace them. Pp. 15\u201318.\n       (c) The counterclaim provision\u2019s description of available remedies\n    dispatches whatever remains of Novo\u2019s arguments. The Court\u2019s read-\n    ing gives content to both remedies: It \u201cdelete[s]\u201d a listing from the\n    Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and \u201ccor-\n    rect[s]\u201d the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent\u2019s\n    scope. By contrast, Novo\u2019s interpretation would all but read \u201ccorrect\u201d\n    out of the statute. If, as Novo contends, the counterclaim is available\n    only where the patent claims no approved method of use, the remedy\n    will always be to delete the patent information. And if the counter-\n    claim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates, the Orange\n    Book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction. Pp. 18\u2013\n    20.\n       (d) Novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaim\u2019s\n    drafting history, but neither overcomes the statutory text and con-\n    text. The company first points out that Congress failed to pass an\n    earlier bill that would have required brands to file descriptions of\n    method-of-use patents and would have allowed generic companies to\n    bring civil actions to \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d the information filed. Be-\n    cause that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge\n    overbroad descriptions of a patent, Novo contends that this Court\n    cannot read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the\n    same. But the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have\n    caused its failure. And the limited criticism of its mechanism for\n    challenging brands\u2019 descriptions of their patents focused on the crea-\n    tion of an independent cause of action\u2014stronger medicine than the\n    counterclaim at issue here. Finally, between that bill\u2019s demise and\n    the counterclaim\u2019s enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring\n    brands to supply use codes. The counterclaim provision\u2019s drafters\n    thus had no need to require this information.\n       Novo next contends that Congress established the counterclaim only\n    to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent\n    from the Orange Book\u2014a problem that had come to light when the\n    Federal Circuit held in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson,\n    268 F. 3d 1323, that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent.\n    Novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provi-\n    sion. But this Court thinks Mylan alerted Congress to a broader\n    problem: that generic companies generally had no avenue to chal-\n    lenge the accuracy of brands\u2019 patent listings, and that the FDA there-\n    fore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs\n    to market. Again, the proof of that lies in the statute itself\u2014its text\n    and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only\n    (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is baseless, but also (as here)\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  when it is overbroad. Moreover, Congress\u2019s equation of the two situa-\n  tions makes perfect sense. In either case, the brand submits mislead-\n  ing patent information to the FDA, delaying or blocking approval of a\n  generic drug that infringes no patent and thus, under the statute,\n  should go to market.

NOVO NORDISK A/S ET AL.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                [April 17, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evalu-\nates an application to market a generic drug, it considers\nwhether the proposed drug would infringe a patent held\nby the manufacturer of the brand-name version. To assess\nthat matter, the FDA requires brand manufacturers to\nsubmit descriptions of the scope of their patents, known as\nuse codes. The FDA does not attempt to determine if that\ninformation is accurate. Rather, the FDA assumes that\nit is so and decides whether to approve a generic drug on\nthat basis. As a result, the breadth of the use code may\nmake the difference between approval and denial of a\ngeneric company\u2019s application.\n   In this case, we consider whether Congress has author-\nized a generic company to challenge a use code\u2019s accuracy\nby bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufac-\nturer in a patent infringement suit. The relevant statute\nprovides that a generic company \u201cmay assert a counter-\nclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand manufac-\nturer] to correct or delete the patent information [it]\nsubmitted . . . under [two statutory subsections] on the\n2    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved\nmethod of using the drug.\u201d 117 Stat. 2452, 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). We hold that a generic manufacturer\nmay employ this provision to force correction of a use code\nthat inaccurately describes the brand\u2019s patent as covering\na particular method of using the drug in question.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling\nof prescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme.\nTo begin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer\nwishes to market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug\napplication (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA\nmust include, among other things, a statement of the\ndrug\u2019s components, scientific data showing that the drug\nis safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing\nthe uses for which the drug may be marketed. See\n\u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (d). The FDA may approve a brand-name\ndrug for multiple methods of use\u2014either to treat different\nconditions or to treat the same condition in different ways.\n   Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer\u2019s\ndrug, another company may seek permission to market\na generic version pursuant to legislation known as the\nHatch-Waxman Amendments. See Drug Price Competi-\ntion and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat.\n1585. Those amendments allow a generic competitor to\nfile an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) piggy-\nbacking on the brand\u2019s NDA. Rather than providing\nindependent evidence of safety and efficacy, the typical\nANDA shows that the generic drug has the same active\ningredients as, and is biologically equivalent to, the brand-\nname drug. See \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv). As we have previ-\nously recognized, this process is designed to speed the\nintroduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. See Eli\nLilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 676 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that\nwould infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA\u2019s approval\ndepends on the scope and duration of the patents cover-\ning the brand-name drug. Those patents come in different\nvarieties. One type protects the drug compound itself.\nAnother kind\u2014the one at issue here\u2014gives the brand\nmanufacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of\nusing the drug. In some circumstances, a brand manufac-\nturer may hold such a method-of-use patent even after its\npatent on the drug compound has expired.\n   To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as\npatents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA\nregulations direct brand manufacturers to file information\nabout their patents. The statute mandates that a brand\nsubmit in its NDA \u201cthe patent number and the expiration\ndate of any patent which claims the drug for which the\n[brand] submitted the [NDA] or which claims a method of\nusing such drug.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1). And the regulations issued\nunder that statute require that, once an NDA is approved,\nthe brand provide a description of any method-of-use\npatent it holds. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e)\n(2011). That description is known as a use code, and the\nbrand submits it on FDA Form 3542. As later discussed,\nthe FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the\nuse codes that brand manufacturers supply. It simply pub-\nlishes the codes, along with the corresponding patent\nnumbers and expiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued\nvolume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more\nofficially denominated Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations).\n   After consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an\nANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic\ndrug will not infringe the brand\u2019s patents. When no pa-\ntents are listed in the Orange Book or all listed patents\nhave expired (or will expire prior to the ANDA\u2019s approval),\nthe generic manufacturer simply certifies to that effect.\n4     CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I)\u2013(III). Otherwise, the\napplicant has two possible ways to obtain approval.\n   One option is to submit a so-called section viii state-\nment, which asserts that the generic manufacturer will\nmarket the drug for one or more methods of use not cov-\nered by the brand\u2019s patents. See \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii). A\nsection viii statement is typically used when the brand\u2019s\npatent on the drug compound has expired and the brand\nholds patents on only some approved methods of using\nthe drug. If the ANDA applicant follows this route, it will\npropose labeling for the generic drug that \u201ccarves out\u201d\nfrom the brand\u2019s approved label the still-patented methods\nof use. See 21 CFR \u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA may ap-\nprove such a modified label, see \u00a7314.127(a)(7), as an ex-\nception to the usual rule that a generic drug must bear\nthe same label as the brand-name product, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(v), (j)(4)(G). FDA acceptance of the carve-\nout label allows the generic company to place its drug\non the market (assuming the ANDA meets other require-\nments), but only for a subset of approved uses\u2014i.e., those\nnot covered by the brand\u2019s patents.\n   Of particular relevance here, the FDA will not approve\nsuch an ANDA if the generic\u2019s proposed carve-out label\noverlaps at all with the brand\u2019s use code. See 68 Fed. Reg.\n36682\u201336683 (2003). The FDA takes that code as a given:\nIt does not independently assess the patent\u2019s scope or\notherwise look behind the description authored by the\nbrand. According to the agency, it lacks \u201cboth [the] exper-\ntise and [the] authority\u201d to review patent claims; although\nit will forward questions about the accuracy of a use code\nto the brand,1 its own \u201crole with respect to patent listing is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Under the FDA\u2019s regulations, any person may dispute the accuracy\n\nof patent information listed in the Orange Book by notifying the agency\nin writing. See 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(f). The FDA will then request that the\nbrand verify the information, but will make no changes \u201c[u]nless the\n[brand] withdraws or amends\u201d the listing.

(\u201cA fundamental\nassumption of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is that\nthe courts are the appropriate mechanism for the resolu-\ntion of disputes about the scope and validity of patents\u201d).2\nThus, whether section viii is available to a generic manu-\nfacturer depends on how the brand describes its patent.\nOnly if the use code provides sufficient space for the gener-\nic\u2019s proposed label will the FDA approve an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement.\n   The generic manufacturer\u2019s second option is to file a so-\ncalled paragraph IV certification, which states that a\nlisted patent \u201cis invalid or will not be infringed by the\nmanufacture, use, or sale of the [generic] drug.\u201d 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will\ntypically take this path in either of two situations: if it\nwants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving\nout those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as\ndescribed above, that any carve-out label it is willing to\nadopt cannot avoid the brand\u2019s use code. Filing a para-\ngraph IV certification means provoking litigation. The\npatent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of in-\nfringement, which gives the brand an immediate right to\nsue. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(e)(2)(A). Assuming the brand\ndoes so, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA\nuntil 30 months pass or the court finds the patent invalid\nor not infringed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Accord-\ningly, the paragraph IV process is likely to keep the gen-\neric drug off the market for a lengthy period, but may\neventually enable the generic company to market its drug\nfor all approved uses.\n   In the late 1990\u2019s, evidence mounted that some brands\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Several courts have affirmed the FDA\u2019s view of its ministerial role.\nSee, e.g., Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 F. 3d 1335, 1349 (CA Fed.\n2003); aaaiPharma v. Thompson, 296 F. 3d 227, 242\u2013243 (CA4 2002).\nThat question is not before us, and we express no view on it.\n6    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nwere exploiting this statutory scheme to prevent or delay\nthe marketing of generic drugs, and the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) soon issued a study detailing these\nanticompetitive practices. See FTC, Generic Drug Entry\nPrior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study, pp. iii\u2013vi (July\n2002) (hereinafter FTC Study). That report focused at-\ntention on brands\u2019 submission of inaccurate patent infor-\nmation to the FDA. In one case cited by the FTC, Mylan\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F. 3d 1323 (CA\nFed. 2001), a brand whose original patent on a drug was\nset to expire listed a new patent ostensibly extending its\nrights over the drug, but in fact covering neither the com-\npound nor any method of using it. The FDA, as was (and\nis) its wont, accepted the listing at its word and accord-\ningly declined to approve a generic product. The generic\nmanufacturer sued to delete the improper listing from the\nOrange Book, but the Federal Circuit held that the Hatch-\nWaxman Amendments did not allow such a right of action.\nSee id., at 1330\u20131333. As the FTC noted, that ruling\nmeant that the only option for generic manufacturers in\nMylan\u2019s situation was to file a paragraph IV certification\n(triggering an infringement suit) and then wait out the\nusual 30-month period before the FDA could approve an\nANDA. See FTC Study 40\u201345.\n   Congress responded to these abuses by creating a mech-\nanism, in the form of a legal counterclaim, for generic\nmanufacturers to challenge patent information a brand\nhas submitted to the FDA. See Medicare Prescription\nDrug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117\nStat. 2452. The provision authorizes an ANDA applicant\nsued for patent infringement to\n    \u201cassert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the\n    [brand] to correct or delete the patent information\n    submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of\n    \u00a7355] on the ground that the patent does not claim\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    either\u2014\n      \u201c(aa) the drug for which the [brand\u2019s NDA] was\n      approved; or\n      \u201c(bb) an approved method of using the drug.\u201d 21\n      U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).\nThe counterclaim thus enables a generic competitor to\nobtain a judgment directing a brand to \u201ccorrect or delete\u201d\ncertain patent information that is blocking the FDA\u2019s\napproval of a generic product. This case raises the ques-\ntion whether the counterclaim is available to fix a brand\u2019s\nuse code.\n                              B\n   The parties to this case sell or seek to sell the diabetes\ndrug repaglinide. Respondents (collectively Novo) manu-\nfacture Prandin, the brand-name version of the drug. The\nFDA has approved three uses of Prandin to treat diabe-\ntes: repaglinide by itself; repaglinide in combination with\nmetformin; and repaglinide in combination with thiazoli-\ndinediones (TZDs). Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish\nto market a generic version of the drug for two of those\nuses.\n   Novo originally owned a patent for the repaglinide\ncompound, known as the \u2019035 patent, but it expired in\n2009. In 2004, Novo also acquired a method-of-use patent\nfor the drug, called the \u2019358 patent, which does not expire\nuntil 2018. That patent\u2014the one at issue here\u2014claims a\n\u201cmethod for treating [diabetes by] administering . . . rep-\naglinide in combination with metformin.\u201d 601 F. 3d 1359,\n1362 (CA Fed. 2010). Thus, Novo currently holds a patent\nfor one of the three FDA-approved uses of repaglinide\u2014its\nuse with metformin. But Novo holds no patent for the use\nof repaglinide with TZDs or its use alone.\n   In 2005, Caraco filed an ANDA seeking to market a\ngeneric version of repaglinide. At that time, the Orange\nBook entry for Prandin listed both the \u2019035 patent (the\n8     CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\ndrug compound) and the \u2019358 patent (the use of the drug\nwith metformin). Caraco assured the FDA that it would\nnot market its generic drug until the \u2019035 patent expired,\nthus making that patent irrelevant to the FDA\u2019s review of\nthe ANDA. Caraco filed a paragraph IV certification for\nthe remaining, \u2019358 patent, stating that it was \u201cinvalid or\n[would] not be infringed.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra,\nat 5. In accord with the patent statute, Novo treated this\nfiling as an act of infringement and brought suit.\n   When Caraco filed its ANDA, Novo\u2019s use code for the\n\u2019358 patent represented that the patent covered \u201c \u2018[u]se of\nrepaglinide in combination with metformin to lower blood\nglucose.\u2019 \u201d 601 F. 3d, at 1362\u20131363. The FDA therefore\nadvised Caraco that if it did not seek to market repag-\nlinide for use with metformin, it could submit a section\nviii statement. That would allow Caraco, assuming its\nANDA was otherwise in order, to market its generic drug\nfor the other two uses. Caraco took the FDA\u2019s cue and in\n2008 submitted a section viii statement, with proposed\nlabeling carving out Novo\u2019s patented metformin therapy.\nSee App. 166\u2013176.\n   Before the FDA took further action, however, Novo\nchanged its use code for the \u2019358 patent. The new use code\ndescribes \u201c \u2018[a] method for improving glycemic control in\nadults with type 2 diabetes.\u2019 \u201d3 601 F. 3d, at 1363. Be-\ncause that code indicates that the \u2019358 patent protects all\nthree approved methods of using repaglinide to treat\ndiabetes, Caraco\u2019s proposed carve-out of metformin ther-\napy was no longer sufficient; even with that exclusion,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Novo asserts that it made the change so that its use code would\n\nmirror its label, which the FDA had just asked it to alter. See Brief for\nRespondents 14. But the FDA, in calling for new labeling, neither\nrequested nor required Novo to amend its use code. And indeed, Novo\u2019s\ncounsel conceded before the Federal Circuit that Novo modified its use\ncode in part as \u201c \u2018a response to the [FDA\u2019s] section viii\u2019 \u201d suggestion. 601\nF. 3d, at 1380\u20131381.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCaraco\u2019s label now overlapped with Novo\u2019s use code on the\nother two uses. And Caraco could not carve out those uses\nas well, because at that point nothing would be left for\nit to market. The FDA has approved repaglinide for only\nthree uses, and Novo\u2019s use code encompassed them all.\nThe FDA accordingly informed Caraco that it could no\nlonger employ section viii to bring its drug to market.\n   Caraco responded to Novo\u2019s new, preclusive use code by\nfiling a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringe-\nment suit. The counterclaim sought an order requiring\nNovo to \u201ccorrect\u201d its use code \u201con the ground that [the\n\u2019358] patent does not claim\u201d two approved methods of\nusing repaglinide\u2014alone and in combination with TZDs.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I); see supra, at 6\u20137. That order would\npermit the FDA to accept Caraco\u2019s proposed carve-out\nlabel and approve the company\u2019s ANDA. The District\nCourt granted summary judgment to Caraco, enjoining\nNovo to \u201ccorrect . . . its inaccurate description of the \u2019358\npatent\u201d by submitting a new Form 3542 to the FDA that\nwould \u201creinstat[e] its former\u201d use code. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a\u201366a.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Caraco\nlacked \u201ca statutory basis to assert a counterclaim.\u201d 601\nF. 3d, at 1360. The court first read the statutory phrase\n\u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of\nusing the drug\u201d to require Caraco to demonstrate that\nthe \u2019358 patent does not claim any approved method of\nuse. See id., at 1365 (\u201c \u2018[A]n approved method\u2019 means \u2018any\napproved method\u2019 \u201d). Because the patent covers one ap-\nproved method of use\u2014repaglinide in combination with\nmetformin\u2014the counterclaim was unavailable. The court\nfurther ruled that the counterclaim provision does not\nreach use codes because they are not \u201cpatent information\nsubmitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c).\u201d On\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s view, that information consists only\nof the patent number and expiration date. See id., at\n10       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                     NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1366\u20131367. Judge Dyk dissented. He would have read\nthe phrase \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved\nmethod of using the drug\u201d to include situations where, as\nhere, the use code wrongly indicates that the patent covers\none or more particular approved methods of use. See id.,\nat 1376\u20131378. And he would have construed \u201cpatent in-\nformation submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d to\ninclude use codes. See id., at 1370\u20131376.4\n  We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now\nreverse.\n                             II\n  We begin \u201cwhere all such inquiries must begin: with the\nlanguage of the statute itself.\u201d United States v. Ron Pair\nEnterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989). This case\nrequires us to construe two statutory phrases. First, we\nmust decide when a \u201cpatent does not claim . . . an ap-\nproved method of using\u201d a drug. Second, we must deter-\nmine the content of \u201cpatent information submitted . . .\nunder subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of \u00a7355. We consider both of\nthose questions against the backdrop of yet a third statu-\ntory phrase, providing that the remedy for a prevailing\ncounterclaimant is an order requiring the brand \u201cto correct\nor delete\u201d that patent information. And we consider each\nquestion in the context of the entire statute. See Robinson\nv. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (Statutory in-\nterpretation focuses on \u201cthe language itself, the specific\ncontext in which that language is used, and the broader\ncontext of the statute as a whole\u201d). We cannot say that the\ncounterclaim clause is altogether free of ambiguity. But\nwhen we consider statutory text and context together, we\nconclude that a generic manufacturer in Caraco\u2019s position\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 On remand from the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision, the District Court\ndetermined that the \u2019358 patent was invalid and unenforceable. See\n775 F. Supp. 2d 985 (ED Mich. 2011). The Federal Circuit stayed\nNovo\u2019s appeal from that judgment pending the decision here.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncan use the counterclaim.5\n                               A\n  An ANDA applicant sued for patent infringement may\nbring a counterclaim \u201con the ground that the patent does\nnot claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\u201d 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). The parties debate the mean-\ning of this language. Novo (like the Federal Circuit) reads\n\u201cnot an\u201d to mean \u201cnot any,\u201d contending that \u201cthe counter-\nclaim is available only if the listed patent does not claim\nany (or, equivalently, claims no) approved method of using\nthe drug.\u201d Brief for Respondents 29 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). By that measure, Caraco may not bring\na counterclaim because Novo\u2019s \u2019358 patent claims the use of\nrepaglinide with metformin. In contrast, Caraco reads\n\u201cnot an\u201d to mean \u201cnot a particular one,\u201d so that the statute\npermits a counterclaim whenever the patent does not\nclaim a method of use for which the ANDA applicant seeks\nto market the drug. On that view, the counterclaim is\navailable here\u2014indeed, is available twice over\u2014because\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Before  proceeding to the merits, we dispose of a recently raised ju-\nrisdictional argument. Novo now contends that the federal courts lost\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over this infringement action (including the\ncounterclaim) at the moment Caraco filed its section viii statement. On\nNovo\u2019s theory, such a statement (unlike a paragraph IV certification)\ndoes not count as an act of infringement under the patent statute, see\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(e)(2)(A), and so cannot provide a jurisdictional basis\nfor the suit. But that argument is wrong even assuming (as Novo con-\ntends) that Caraco\u2019s section viii filing terminated its paragraph IV\ncertification and that a section viii filing is not an act of infringement.\nThe want of an infringing act is a merits problem, not a jurisdictional\none. Nothing in the section of the statute defining certain filings as\nacts of infringement suggests anything to the contrary. And \u201cwe are\nnot inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when\nthey are not framed as such.\u201d Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). In the absence of such a bar, the federal courts\nhave jurisdiction over this suit for a single, simple reason: It \u201car[ose]\nunder a[n] Act of Congress relating to patents.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71338(a).\n12    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe \u2019358 patent does not claim the use of repaglinide with\nTZDs or its use alone.\n  Truth be told, the answer to the general question \u201cWhat\ndoes \u2018not an\u2019 mean?\u201d is \u201cIt depends\u201d: The meaning of the\nphrase turns on its context. See Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (\u201cUltimately, con-\ntext determines meaning\u201d). \u201cNot an\u201d sometimes means\n\u201cnot any,\u201d in the way Novo claims. If your spouse tells you\nhe is late because he \u201cdid not take a cab,\u201d you will infer\nthat he took no cab at all (but took the bus instead). If\nyour child admits that she \u201cdid not read a book all sum-\nmer,\u201d you will surmise that she did not read any book (but\nwent to the movies a lot). And if a sports-fan friend be-\nmoans that \u201cthe New York Mets do not have a chance of\nwinning the World Series,\u201d you will gather that the team\nhas no chance whatsoever (because they have no hitting).\nBut now stop a moment. Suppose your spouse tells you\nthat he got lost because he \u201cdid not make a turn.\u201d You\nwould understand that he failed to make a particular turn,\nnot that he drove from the outset in a straight line. Sup-\npose your child explains her mediocre grade on a college\nexam by saying that she \u201cdid not read an assigned text.\u201d\nYou would infer that she failed to read a specific book, not\nthat she read nothing at all on the syllabus. And suppose\na lawyer friend laments that in her last trial, she \u201cdid not\nprove an element of the offense.\u201d You would grasp that\nshe is speaking not of all the elements, but of a particular\none. The examples could go on and on, but the point is\nsimple enough: When it comes to the meaning of \u201cnot an,\u201d\ncontext matters.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For this reason, we find Novo\u2019s reliance on the occasional dictionary\n\ndefinition of \u201ca[n]\u201d unconvincing. Although \u201can\u201d sometimes means\n\u201cany\u201d when used in negative structures, see, e.g., Microsoft Encarta\nCollege Dictionary 1 (2001) (fifth definition), it sometimes does not. Cf.\nFCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip. op., at 3\u20135) (rejecting\na proposed definition of \u201cpersonal\u201d because it did not always hold in\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

As described earlier (and as Congress understood), a\nsingle drug may have multiple methods of use, only one\nor some of which a patent covers. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(b)(1) (requiring that an NDA applicant file infor-\nmation about \u201cany patent which claims the drug . . . or\nwhich claims a method of using such drug\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorize the\nFDA to approve the marketing of a generic drug for par-\nticular unpatented uses; and section viii provides the\nmechanism for a generic company to identify those uses,\nso that a product with a label matching them can quickly\ncome to market. The statutory scheme, in other words,\ncontemplates that one patented use will not foreclose\nmarketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.\nWithin that framework, the counterclaim naturally func-\ntions to challenge the brand\u2019s assertion of rights over\nwhichever discrete use (or uses) the generic company\nwishes to pursue. That assertion, after all, is the thing\nblocking the generic drug\u2019s entry on the market. The\navailability of the counterclaim thus matches the availa-\nbility of FDA approval under the statute: A company may\nbring a counterclaim to show that a method of use is un-\npatented because establishing that fact allows the FDA to\nauthorize a generic drug via section viii.\n   Consider the point as applied to this case. Caraco wishes\nto market a generic version of repaglinide for two (and\nonly two) uses. Under the statute, the FDA could approve\nCaraco\u2019s application so long as no patent covers those\nuses, regardless whether a patent protects yet a third\nmethod of using the drug. Novo agrees that Caraco could\nbring a counterclaim if Novo\u2019s assertion of patent protec-\ntion for repaglinide lacked any basis\u2014for example, if Novo\nheld no patent, yet claimed rights to the pair of uses for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nordinary usage and the statutory context suggested it did not apply).\n\n14   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhich Caraco seeks to market its drug. But because Novo\nhas a valid patent on a different use, Novo argues that\nCaraco\u2019s counterclaim evaporates. And that is so even\nthough, once again, Caraco has no wish to market its\nproduct for that patented use and the FDA stands ready,\npursuant to the statute, to approve Caraco\u2019s product for\nthe other two. To put the matter simply, Novo thinks the\ncounterclaim disappears because it has a patent for a\nmethod of use in which neither Caraco nor the FDA is\ninterested at all. \u201cIt would take strong evidence to per-\nsuade us that this is what Congress wrought.\u201d Eli Lilly,\n496 U. S., at 673. That \u201cnot an\u201d sometimes (but some-\ntimes not) means \u201cnot any\u201d is not enough.\n  Novo argues that our reading must be wrong because\nCongress could have expressly \u201cimpose[d] additional . . .\nqualifications\u201d on the term \u201can approved method of\nus[e]\u201d\u2014and indeed did so in another place in the statute.\nBrief for Respondents 31; 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).\nNovo points here to section viii itself, which applies when\nthe brand\u2019s patent \u201cdoes not claim a use for which the\n[ANDA] applicant is seeking approval.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii)\n(emphasis added). But the mere possibility of clearer\nphrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading of a\nstatute; if it could (with all due respect to Congress), we\nwould interpret a great many statutes differently than we\ndo. Nor does Congress\u2019s use of more detailed language in\nanother provision, enacted years earlier, persuade us to\nput the counterclaim clause at odds with its statutory\ncontext. That is especially so because we can turn this\nform of argument back around on Novo. Congress, after\nall, could have more clearly expressed Novo\u2019s proposed\nmeaning in the easiest of ways\u2014by adding a single letter\nto make clear that \u201cnot an\u201d really means \u201cnot any.\u201d And\nindeed, Congress used a \u201cnot any\u201d construction in the very\nnext subclause, enacted at the very same time. See\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(II) (\u201cSubclause (I) does not authorize the\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

So\nif we needed any proof that Congress knew how to say\n\u201cnot any\u201d when it meant \u201cnot any,\u201d here we find it. We think\nthat sees, raises, and bests Novo\u2019s argument.\n   Our more essential point, though, has less gamesman-\nship about it: We think that the \u201cnot any\u201d construction\ndoes not appear in the relevant counterclaim provision\nbecause Congress did not mean what Novo wishes it had.\nAnd we think that is so because Congress meant (as it\nusually does) for the provision it enacted to fit within\nthe statutory scheme\u2014here, by facilitating the approval of\nnon-infringing generic drugs under section viii.\n                              B\n  Novo contends that Caraco\u2019s counterclaim must fail for\nanother, independent reason: On its view (as on the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s), the counterclaim does not provide a way to\ncorrect use codes because they are not \u201cpatent information\nsubmitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of\n\u00a7355. Once again, we disagree.\n  The statute does not define \u201cpatent information,\u201d but\na use code must qualify. It describes the method of use\nclaimed in a patent. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3),\n(e). That fits under any ordinary understanding of the\nlanguage.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Novo\u2019s only counter is to redefine a use code. Novo argues that a use\n\ncode need not be tied to the patent at all\u2014that \u201c[t]he relevant regula-\ntion requires [NDA] applicants to provide [only] \u2018a description of each\napproved method of use or indication.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 48\n(quoting 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1)). Because an \u201cindication\u201d refers\ngenerally to what a drug does (here, treat diabetes), see \u00a7201.57(c)(2),\nNovo claims that a use code may sweep more broadly than the patent.\nBut that is incorrect. First, Novo does not cite the regulations that\nspecify the information required for publication\u2014i.e., use codes. See\n\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3) (requiring a \u201cdescription of the patented method\nof use as required for publication\u201d); \u00a7314.53(e) (\u201c[F]or each use patent,\u201d\nFDA will publish \u201cthe approved indications or other conditions of use\n16    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n   The more difficult question arises from the \u201csubmitted\nunder\u201d phrase. The subsections mentioned there\u2014(b) and\n(c) of \u00a7355\u2014require an NDA applicant to submit specified\ninformation: \u201cthe patent number and the expiration date\nof any patent\u201d claiming the drug or a method of its use. 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (c)(2). According to Novo, only that\ninformation comes within the counterclaim provision. But\nsubsections (b) and (c) as well govern the regulatory pro-\ncess by which brands provide additional patent infor-\nmation to the FDA, both before and after an NDA is ap-\nproved. In particular, those subsections provide the basis\nfor the regulation requiring brands to submit use codes,\nsee 21 CFR \u00a7314.53; in issuing that regulation, the FDA\nnoted that \u201c[o]ur principal legal authority . . . is section\n505 of the act [codified at \u00a7355], in conjunction with our\ngeneral rulemaking authority.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 36697\u201336698\n(specifically referring to subsections (b) and (c)). And the\nform (Form 3542) on which brands submit their use codes\nstates that the information appearing there is \u201cprovided\nin accordance with Section [355](b) and (c).\u201d App. 97. So\nuse codes fall within the counterclaim\u2019s ambit if the phrase\n\u201csubmitted under\u201d reaches filings that not only subsec-\ntions (b) and (c) themselves, but also their implementing\nregulations require.\n   Several of our cases support giving \u201cunder\u201d this broad\nmeaning. For example, in Eli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 665\u2013668,\nwe examined a similar statutory reference to the \u201csubmis-\nsion of information under a Federal law which regulates\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncovered by a patent\u201d). Those provisions (whether referring to methods\nof use, conditions of use, or indications) all demand a description of the\npatent. And second, even the provision Novo cites\u2014which mandates\nthe submission of additional material, not listed in the Orange Book\u2014\nties information about indications to patent coverage; that regulation\nrequires (when quoted in full) that the brand provide \u201ca description of\neach approved method of use or indication and related patent claim of\nthe patent being submitted.\u201d \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,\u201d 35 U. S. C.\n\u00a7271(e)(1). We noted there that submitting information\n\u201cunder a Federal law\u201d suggests doing so \u201cin furtherance of\nor compliance with a comprehensive scheme of regula-\ntion.\u201d 496 U. S., at 667. Likewise, in Ardestani v. INS,\n502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991), we held that a regulatory pro-\nceeding \u201cunder section 554,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7504(b)(1)(C)(i),\nmeant any proceeding \u201csubject to,\u201d \u201cgoverned by,\u201d or\nconducted \u201cby reason of the authority of \u201d that statutory\nprovision.\n   So too here. \u201cPatent information submitted . . . under\nsubsection (b) or (c)\u201d most naturally refers to patent in-\nformation provided as part of the \u201ccomprehensive scheme\nof regulation\u201d premised on those subsections. Eli Lilly,\n496 U. S., at 667. It includes everything (about patents)\nthat the FDA requires brands to furnish in the proceed-\nings \u201csubject to,\u201d \u201cgoverned by,\u201d or conducted \u201cby reason of\nthe authority of \u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c). Ardestani, 502 U. S., at\n135. The breadth of the term \u201cunder\u201d becomes particu-\nlarly clear when compared with other phrases\u2014\u201cdescribed\nin\u201d and \u201cprescribed by\u201d\u2014appearing in neighboring provi-\nsions. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(c)(2) (\u201cpatent information\ndescribed in subsection (b)\u201d); \u00a7355(d)(6) (\u201cpatent infor-\nmation prescribed by subsection (b)\u201d). Those phrases\ndenote a patent number and expiration date and nothing\nmore. In contrast, the word \u201cunder\u201d naturally reaches\nbeyond that most barebones information to other patent\nmaterials the FDA demands in the regulatory process.\n   Once again, that congressional choice fits the broader\nstatutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA\u2019s\nimplementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\u2014and\nno less so because a regulation, rather than the statute\nitself, requires their submission.         Recall that those\nAmendments instruct the FDA (assuming other require-\nments are met) to approve an ANDA filed with a section\nviii statement when it proposes to market a drug for only\n18   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nunpatented methods of use. To fulfill that charge, the\nFDA must determine whether any patent covers a particu-\nlar method of use; and to do that, the agency (which views\nitself as lacking expertise in patent matters, see supra, at\n4\u20135, and n. 2) relies on the use codes submitted in the\nregulatory process. See 68 Fed. Reg. 36682\u201336683. An\noverbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the\nFDA\u2019s ability to approve generic drugs as the statute con-\ntemplates. So it is not surprising that the language Con-\ngress used in the counterclaim provision sweeps widely\nenough to embrace that filing.\n                              C\n  Another aspect of the counterclaim provision\u2014its de-\nscription of available remedies\u2014dispatches whatever\nremains of Novo\u2019s arguments. According to the statute,\na successful claimant may obtain an order requiring\nthe brand to \u201ccorrect or delete\u201d its patent information.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). Our interpretation of the statute gives\ncontent to both those remedies: It deletes a listing from\nthe Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent\nand corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed\nthe patent\u2019s scope. By contrast, Novo\u2019s two arguments\nwould all but read the term \u201ccorrect\u201d out of the statute.\n  Consider first how Novo\u2019s an-means-any contention\nwould accomplish that result. Recall that on Novo\u2019s view,\na counterclaim can succeed only if the patent challenged\ndoes not claim either the drug or any approved method of\nusing it. See supra, at 11. But when a generic manufac-\nturer makes that showing, the remedy must be to \u201cdelete\u201d\nthe listing; no correction would be enough. Novo agrees\nwith that proposition; \u201c[a]t bottom,\u201d Novo avers, \u201cthe\ncounterclaim is a delisting provision.\u201d Brief for Respond-\nents 20. But that raises the obvious question: Why did\nCongress also include the term \u201ccorrect\u201d in the statute?\n  Novo can come up with just one answer: The counter-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim, it proposes, can correct erroneous patent numbers.\nImagine, for example, that Novo mistakenly entered the\nnumber \u2019359, instead of \u2019358, when submitting information\nabout its repaglinide patent for publication in the Orange\nBook. Then, Novo suggests, Caraco could bring a counter-\nclaim to challenge the inaccurate listing (on the ground\nthat \u2019359 does not claim any method of use), and the rem-\nedy would be \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d (substituting an 8 for a 9). But\nwe think Novo\u2019s admission that this scenario would be\n\u201cunusual,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, considerably understates\nthe matter. As Novo concedes, brands have every incen-\ntive to provide the right patent number in the first place,\nand to immediately rectify any error brought to their\nattention. See id., at 40\u201341. By doing so, they place both\ngeneric companies and the FDA on notice of their patents\nand thereby prevent infringement. And conversely, gener-\nics have little or no incentive to bring a counterclaim that\nwill merely replace one digit in the Orange Book with\nanother. So we doubt Congress created a legal action to\n\u201ccorrect\u201d patent information just to fix such scrivener\u2019s\nerrors. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31\n(2001) (refusing to adopt an interpretation of a statute\nthat would render a piece of it \u201cinsignificant, if not wholly\nsuperfluous\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). That\nwould have been, in the most literal sense, to make a\nfederal case out of nothing.\n   The same problem afflicts Novo\u2019s alternative conten-\ntion\u2014that \u201cpatent information submitted . . . under sub-\nsection (b) or (c)\u201d includes only numbers and expiration\ndates (and not use codes). Once again, we cannot think\nCongress included the remedy of \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d so that\ncourts could expunge typos in patent numbers. And not\neven Novo has proffered a way for the counterclaim to\n\u201ccorrect\u201d an erroneous expiration date. Suppose, for ex-\nample, that a brand incorrectly lists the expiration date of\na valid patent as 2018 rather than 2015. The counter-\n20   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim would be useless: It authorizes a remedy only \u201con\nthe ground that\u201d the listed patent does not claim the drug\nor an approved method of using it\u2014and notwithstanding\nthe wrong expiration date, this patent does so. Alterna-\ntively, suppose the brand lists a patent as having a 2018\nexpiration date when in fact the patent has already\nlapsed. Then, a generic manufacturer could bring a coun-\nterclaim alleging that the patent no longer claims the\ndrug or a method of using it\u2014but the appropriate remedy\nwould be deletion, not correction, of the brand\u2019s listing.\nNovo\u2019s reading of \u201cpatent information,\u201d like its reading of\n\u201cnot an,\u201d effectively deletes the term \u201ccorrect\u201d from the\nstatute.\n                             III\n  Novo finally advances two arguments relating to the\ncounterclaim\u2019s drafting history. Neither contention, how-\never, overcomes the statutory text and context. Indeed,\nconsideration of the provision\u2019s background only strength-\nens our view of its meaning.\n                              A\n   Novo first contends that our interpretation of the stat-\nute \u201ceffectively resurrect[s] the scheme rejected by Con-\ngress.\u201d Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting Smith v. United\nStates, 507 U. S. 197, 203, n. 4 (1993)). In 2002, Novo\nnotes, Congress failed to pass a bill that would have re-\nquired brands to file specified \u201cpatent information,\u201d in-\ncluding, for method-of-use patents, a description of \u201cthe\napproved use covered by the [patent] claim.\u201d S. 812, 107th\nCong., 2d Sess., \u00a7103(a)(1), p. 7 (engrossed bill). That bill\nwould have allowed a generic company to bring its own\ncivil action\u2014not merely a counterclaim in ongoing litiga-\ntion\u2014to \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d the information filed. Id.,\nat 8. The Senate approved the bill, but the House of Repre-\nsentatives took no action on it. Novo argues that because\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthis failed legislation would have allowed a generic com-\npany to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, we\ncannot read the statute Congress eventually enacted as\ndoing so.\n   We disagree. We see no reason to assume, as Novo does,\nthat Congress rejected S. 812 because it required brands\nto submit patent information beyond a number and expi-\nration date. Indeed, Novo\u2019s argument highlights the perils\nof relying on the fate of prior bills to divine the meaning of\nenacted legislation. \u201cA bill can be proposed for any num-\nber of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many\nothers.\u201d Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 170 (2001)). S.\n812 contained numerous items, including a title on import-\ning prescription drugs (no controversy there!), that may\nhave caused its failure. See S. 812, Tit. II. Moreover,\nwhat criticism there was of the bill\u2019s mechanism for chal-\nlenging brands\u2019 patent claims focused not on the specifica-\ntion of \u201cpatent information,\u201d but instead on the creation of\nan independent cause of action\u2014stronger medicine than\nthe counterclaim Congress ultimately adopted.8 And\nfinally, Novo ignores a likely cause for the redrafting of\nthe provision on submitting information. Between S. 812\u2019s\ndemise and the counterclaim\u2019s enactment, the FDA issued\na rule requiring brands to supply material concerning\nmethod-of-use patents, including use codes. The drafters\nof the counterclaim provision knew about that rule,9 and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 See, e.g., 148 Cong. Rec. 15424 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Gregg)\n\n(\u201cProbably the most significant issue is the fact that it creates a new\ncause of action\u201d); id., at 15431\u201315432 (remarks of Sen. Grassley)\n(similar); id., at 14434 (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (similar).\n   9 See, e.g., Hearings on Barriers to Entry in the Pharmaceutical Mar-\n\nketplace before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 5\u20138 (2003) (statement of Daniel Troy, Chief Counsel to the\nFDA); id., at 19 (statement of Sen. Schumer) (\u201cThe bill provides a\ncritical complement to the work FDA has done in clarifying its regula-\ntions on patent listing, but it goes much further\u201d).\n22   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhad no need to duplicate its list of mandated filings. So\nthe drafting history does not support Novo\u2019s conclusion. If\nanything, the statute\u2019s evolution indicates that Congress\ndetermined to enforce the FDA\u2019s new listing provisions,\nincluding its use-code requirement, through the new\ncounterclaim.\n                              B\n   Novo next argues that Congress established the coun-\nterclaim only to solve the problem raised by the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Mylan, 268 F. 3d 1323\u2014the impossi-\nbility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the\nOrange Book. In Mylan, as earlier described, a generic\ncompany alleged that a brand had listed a patent that\ncovered neither the approved drug nor any method of\nusing it, and brought an action seeking delisting. See\nsupra, at 6. The Federal Circuit held that no such action\nwas available, even assuming the allegation was true.\nBecause several legislators saw Mylan as \u201cexemplif[ying]\u201d\nbrands\u2019 \u201cperceived abuse\u201d of the FDA\u2019s patent listing prac-\ntices, Brief for Respondents 35, Novo contends that we\nshould construe the counterclaim provision to aid only a\ngeneric company that \u201cfinds itself in the same position as\nMylan was in Mylan,\u201d Supp. Brief in Opposition 5\u20136.\n   Once again, we think not. Maybe Mylan triggered the\nlegislative effort to enact a counterclaim, or maybe it\ndidn\u2019t: By the time Congress acted, it also had at hand an\nFTC study broadly criticizing brands\u2019 patent listings and\nan FDA rule designed to address the very same issue. See\nsupra, at 6, 21. But even assuming Mylan \u201cprompted the\nproposal\u201d of the counterclaim, \u201cwhether that alone ac-\ncounted for its enactment is quite a different question.\u201d\nEli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 670, n. 3 (emphasis deleted). Here,\nwe think Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem\u2014\nthat generic companies generally had no avenue to chal-\nlenge the accuracy of brands\u2019 patent listings, and that the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFDA therefore could not approve proper applications to\nbring inexpensive drugs to market. The proof of that lies\nin the statute itself (where the best proof of what Congress\nmeans to address almost always resides). As we have de-\nscribed, the statute\u2019s text and context demonstrate that\nthe counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when\nthe patent listing is baseless, but also (as here) when it is\noverbroad. See supra, at 10\u201320. In particular, Congress\u2019s\ndecision to allow a counterclaimant to seek \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d\nof patent information explodes Novo\u2019s theory, because the\nremedy for a Mylan-type impropriety is complete delisting.\n   And to make matters still easier, Congress\u2019s equation of\nthe two situations\u2014the one in Mylan and the one here\u2014\nmakes perfect sense. Whether a brand lists a patent that\ncovers no use or describes a patent on one use as extend-\ning to others, the brand submits misleading patent in-\nformation to the FDA. In doing so, the brand equally ex-\nploits the FDA\u2019s determination that it cannot police patent\nclaims. And the brand\u2019s action may in either case delay or\nblock approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent\u2014\nand that under the statute should go to market. See su-\npra, at 4. That is the danger Caraco faces here, as much\nas it was the threat in Mylan: Novo seeks to preclude\nCaraco from selling repaglinide for unpatented uses until\n2018, when Novo\u2019s patent on a different use expires.\n   Indeed, the need for the counterclaim is greater here\nthan in Mylan. When a brand lists a patent that covers no\nuse, a generic company has a pathway aside from the\ncounterclaim to challenge the listing. As described ear-\nlier, the company may make a paragraph IV certification\nstating that the listed patent \u201cis invalid or will not\nbe infringed\u201d by the generic drug.               21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra, at 5. If the brand sues,\nthe generic company can argue that its product would not\ninfringe the patent. Using the counterclaim may enable a\ngeneric manufacturer to obtain delisting more quickly, see\n24   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. 54; but even without it, the company can\neventually get a judgment of non-infringement enabling\nthe FDA to approve its ANDA. In contrast, where (as\nhere) a brand files an overbroad use code, a generic com-\npany cannot use paragraph IV litigation to that end. A\nparagraph IV certification (unlike a section viii statement)\nrequires the generic company to propose labeling identical\nto the brand\u2019s; it cannot carve out any uses. See supra, at\n4. And that proposed label will necessarily infringe be-\ncause it will include the use(s) on which the brand does\nhave a patent. So here, a paragraph IV suit cannot lead to\na judgment enabling FDA approval; the counterclaim\noffers the only route to bring the generic drug to market\nfor non-infringing uses. Novo\u2019s view eliminates the coun-\nterclaim where it has the greatest value.\n                              IV\n  The statutory counterclaim we have considered enables\ncourts to resolve patent disputes so that the FDA can\nfulfill its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do\nnot infringe patent rights. The text and context of the\nprovision demonstrate that a generic company can employ\nthe counterclaim to challenge a brand\u2019s overbroad use\ncode.

NOVO NORDISK A/S ET AL.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                         [April 17, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   The Court today interprets the counterclaim set forth in\n21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) to permit generic manufac-\nturers to force brand manufacturers to \u201ccorrect\u201d inaccurate\nuse codes. While I too find the counterclaim not \u201cfree of\nambiguity,\u201d ante, at 10, I join the Court\u2019s opinion because\nI agree this is the most sensible reading in light of the\nexisting regulatory scheme. I write separately to add the\nfollowing observations.\n                                I\n  I first underscore that the counterclaim can only lessen\nthe difficulties created by an overly broad use code; it\ncannot fix them. The statutory scheme is designed to\nspeed the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market.\nSee ante, at 2 (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496\nU. S. 661, 676 (1990)). To that end, the statute provides\nfor the rapid approval of a drug that a generic manufac-\nturer seeks to market for unpatented methods of use. The\nmanufacturer need only submit an abbreviated new drug\napplication (ANDA) with a section viii statement and a\nproposed label that \u201ccarves out\u201d from the brand manufac-\nturer\u2019s label any patented methods of use. See ante, at 4.\nSo long as the use code is not overly broad (and all else is\nin order), FDA may approve the application without re-\n2    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\nquiring any further steps relating to the patent, and the\ngeneric drug may reach the public without undue delay.\nSee ibid.\n   An overly broad use code \u201cthrows a wrench\u201d into that\nscheme. Ante, at 18. The reason why is simple: FDA\nrelies on use codes in determining whether to approve an\nANDA, but it refuses to evaluate the accuracy of those use\ncodes. See ante, at 4\u20135. Thus, if the use code overlaps\nwith the generic manufacturer\u2019s proposed carve-out label\n(i.e., if the use code is overly broad), FDA will not approve\nan ANDA with a section viii statement. See ibid.\n   After today\u2019s opinion, the generic manufacturer can re-\nspond to this situation by taking the following steps: sub-\nmit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification (which\nrequires a proposed label materially identical to the brand\nmanufacturer\u2019s label, see ante, at 24), wait for the brand\nmanufacturer to institute suit, file a counterclaim, litigate\nthe counterclaim, and, if successful in securing the correc-\ntion of the use code, return to the start of the process and\ndo what it always wanted to do\u2014file an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement and a carve-out label.\n   The problem with this process is twofold. First, it re-\nsults in delay and expense the statutory scheme does not\nenvision. Second, there is no guarantee the process will\nwork. It depends on the brand manufacturer initiating\nparagraph IV litigation, but it is not obvious the brand\nwill have any incentive to do so. In light of today\u2019s hold-\ning, the upshot of such litigation will be the correction of\nthe use code through the assertion of a counterclaim\u2014an\noutcome that is desirable, to be sure, for the generic manu-\nfacturer, but perhaps less so for the brand manufacturer.\n   Meanwhile, it is not clear what happens if the brand\nmanufacturer does not file suit. FDA may approve\nthe generic manufacturer\u2019s application, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(B)(iii), \u201cwithout prejudice to infringement claims\nthe patent owner might assert when the ANDA applicant\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nproduces or markets the generic drug.\u201d Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 6 (hereinafter United States\nBrief). But the generic manufacturer, having been forced\nto proceed with a paragraph IV certification, will have se-\ncured approval to market a drug with a label materially\nidentical to the brand manufacturer\u2019s. That is not a posi-\ntion I imagine a generic manufacturer wants to be in: As\nthe Solicitor General\u2019s Office informed us at argument,\n\u201c[i]t would be inducement of infringement to sell a product\nwith labeling that suggests that the product be used for\na patented method of use.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 24; see also\nUnited States Brief 32 (noting that in this situation, if\na generic manufacturer proceeded with a paragraph IV\ncertification, \u201c[s]o long as the [new drug application\n(NDA)] holder\u2019s patent covers some approved method of\nusing the approved drug, the proposed labeling will be\ninfringing\u201d).\n   In short, the counterclaim cannot restore the smooth\nworking of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an\noverly broad use code. At best, it permits the generic\nmanufacturer to do what the scheme contemplates it\nshould do\u2014file an ANDA with a section viii statement\u2014\nbut only after expensive and time-consuming litigation. A\nfix is in order, but it must come from Congress or FDA.\n                             II\n   Precisely because the regulatory scheme depends on the\naccuracy and precision of use codes, I find FDA\u2019s guidance\nas to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes\nremarkably opaque. The relevant regulation states simply\nthat a brand manufacturer must provide \u201c[t]he description\nof the patented method of use as required for publication.\u201d\n21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3).

But it also provides\nthat brand manufacturers may \u201cus[e] no more than 240\ntotal characters including spaces,\u201d id., at 213a, and else-\nwhere FDA acknowledges \u201cthat in some cases 240 charac-\nters may not fully describe the use as claimed in the pa-\ntent.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 36683 (2003); see also ibid. (indicating\nfor this reason that use codes \u201care not meant to substitute\nfor the applicant\u2019s review of the patent\u201d).\n  Indeed, in some respects we are here today because\nof FDA\u2019s opacity in describing what is required of brand\nmanufacturers. In its initial NDA filing, Novo submitted\na use code for the \u2019358 patent that was not \u201coverly broad\u201d:\nIt described narrowly the single patented method of use.\nApp. 54\u201355, 99. Some years later FDA required that Novo\namend its label to \u201c[r]eplace all the separate indications\u201d\n\u201cwith the following sentence: \u2018Prandin is indicated as an\nadjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in\nadults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 163\u2013164,\n215. Novo then amended its use code to track the new\nlabel, id., at 482\u2013486, explaining that the amendment\n\u201ccorrespond[ed] with the change in labeling required by\nFDA,\u201d id., at 483. Novo understood its amended use code\nto comply with FDA regulations, likely on the ground it\npressed before us: that the regulations permit a brand\nmanufacturer to submit for publication in the Orange\nBook a description of either the patented method of use or\nthe indication (which refers to \u201cwhat a drug does,\u201d ante,\nat 15, n. 7). Brief for Respondents 10, 22, 48\u201350.\n  For the reasons explained by the Court, see ante, at 15,\nn. 7, Novo is mistaken. But the company can hardly be\nfaulted for so thinking. The regulations also require sub-\nmission of \u201ca description of each approved method of use\nor indication,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1), and the form\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

(explaining brand manufacturers\nshould \u201c[s]ubmit the description of the approved indication\nor method of use that you propose FDA include as the \u2018Use\nCode\u2019 in the Orange Book\u201d). Those sources at the least\nsuggest (as Novo thought) that a method of use here is\ndistinct from an indication and that either suffices as a\nuse code.\n   Prior to enactment of the counterclaim provision, Con-\ngress considered a bill that required brand manufacturers\nto submit a \u201cdescription of the approved use covered by the\n[patent] claim,\u201d and that allowed a generic manufacturer\nto bring a civil action to correct that information. See\nante, at 20. Congress rejected the bill, in part over criti-\ncism that it would encourage excess litigation.* Absent\ngreater clarity from FDA concerning what is required of\nbrand manufacturers in use codes, Congress\u2019 fears of un-\ndue litigation may be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See, e.g., 148 Cong.

Argued December 5, 2011\u2014Decided April 17, 2012\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture,\n  sale, and labeling of prescription drugs. A brand-name drug manu-\n  facturer seeking FDA approval for a drug submits a new drug appli-\n  cation (NDA) containing, among other things, a statement of the\n  drug\u2019s components and proposed labeling describing the uses for\n  which the drug may be marketed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (d).\n  Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer\u2019s drug, another\n  company may seek permission to market a generic version by filing\n  an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). See \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii),\n  (iv). But the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that would in-\n  fringe a brand manufacturer\u2019s patent. To facilitate the approval of\n  generic drugs as soon as patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amend-\n  ments require a brand manufacturer to submit its patent numbers\n  and expiration dates, \u00a7355(b)(1); and FDA regulations require a de-\n  scription of any method-of-use patent, known as a use code, see 21\n  CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e). The FDA does not attempt to verify\n  the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply. In-\n  stead, it simply publishes the codes, patent numbers, and expiration\n  dates in a large volume known as the Orange Book.\n     After consulting the Orange Book, an ANDA applicant enters one\n  of several certifications to assure the FDA that its generic drug will\n  not infringe the brand\u2019s patent. If the patent has not expired, an ap-\n  plicant may fulfill this requirement in one of two ways. First, it may\n  submit a so-called section viii statement asserting that it will market\n  the drug for only those methods of use not covered by the brand\u2019s pa-\n  tent, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii), and proposing a label that\n  \u201ccarves out\u201d the still-patented method(s) of use, see 21 CFR\n2       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                    NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n    \u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA will not approve an ANDA with a section\n    viii statement if the proposed label overlaps at all with the brand\u2019s\n    use code. Second, the ANDA applicant may file a so-called paragraph\n    IV certification stating that the brand\u2019s patent \u201cis invalid or will not\n    be infringed by the [generic drug\u2019s] manufacture, use, or sale.\u201d 21\n    U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Such filing is treated as an act of in-\n    fringement, giving the brand an immediate right to sue and resulting\n    in a delay in the generic drug\u2019s approval.\n       In 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a study de-\n    tailing evidence that brands were submitting inaccurate patent in-\n    formation to the FDA in order to prevent or delay the marketing of\n    generic drugs. In response, Congress created a statutory counter-\n    claim available to generic manufacturers sued for patent infringe-\n    ment. The provision allows a generic manufacturer to \u201cassert a coun-\n    terclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand] to correct or delete\n    the patent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b)\n    or (c) [of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355] on the ground that the patent does not\n    claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\u201d 21 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). This case concerns the scope of the counterclaim\n    provision.\n       Respondents (collectively Novo) manufacture the brand-name ver-\n    sion of the diabetes drug repaglinide. The FDA has approved three\n    uses of the drug, but Novo\u2019s method-of-use patent claims only one.\n    Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish to market a generic version of\n    the drug for the other two approved methods of use. Caraco initially\n    filed a paragraph IV certification and, considering this an act of in-\n    fringement, Novo brought suit. Caraco then submitted a section viii\n    statement and a proposed label carving out Novo\u2019s patented therapy.\n    But before the FDA could approve Caraco\u2019s ANDA, Novo changed its\n    use code to indicate that it held a patent on all three approved\n    methods of using repaglinide. Because Caraco\u2019s proposed label now\n    overlapped with Novo\u2019s use code, the FDA would not permit Caraco\n    to employ section viii to bring its drug to market.\n       Caraco filed a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringement\n    action, seeking an order requiring Novo to \u201ccorrect\u201d its use code be-\n    cause the patent did not claim two of the three approved methods of\n    using repaglinide. The District Court granted Caraco summary\n    judgment, but the Federal Circuit reversed. It read the counter-\n    claim\u2019s phrase \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of\n    using the drug\u201d as requiring Caraco to demonstrate that Novo\u2019s pa-\n    tent does not claim any approved method of use; because the patent\n    covers one approved method, the counterclaim was unavailable. The\n    court also ruled that the counterclaim provision does not reach use\n    codes because they are not \u201cpatent information submitted by the\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of \u00a7355. That information, the\n  court concluded, consists only of the patent number and expiration\n  date expressly required by the statutory provisions.\nHeld: A generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision\n to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the\n brand\u2019s patent as covering a particular method of using a drug.\n Pp. 10\u201324.\n    (a) The parties first dispute the meaning of \u201cnot an\u201d in the phrase\n \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of using the drug.\u201d\n Novo contends that the counterclaim is available only if the patent\n claims no approved method of use, but Caraco reads this language to\n permit a counterclaim whenever a patent does not claim the particu-\n lar method that the ANDA applicant seeks to market. In isolation,\n either of these readings is plausible, so the meaning of the phrase\n \u201cnot an\u201d turns on statutory context, see Johnson v. United States, 559\n U. S. ___, ___. This context favors Caraco: Congress understood that\n a drug may have multiple methods of use, not all of which a patent\n covers; and a section viii statement allows the FDA to approve a ge-\n neric drug for unpatented uses so that it can quickly come to market.\n The statute thus contemplates that one patented use will not fore-\n close marketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones. Within\n this scheme, the counterclaim naturally functions to challenge the\n brand\u2019s assertion of rights over whichever discrete uses the generic\n company wishes to pursue; the counterclaim\u2019s availability matches\n the availability of FDA approval under the statute. Pp. 11\u201315.\n    (b) The parties further dispute whether use codes qualify as \u201cpa-\n tent information submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d\n of \u00a7355. A use code, which is a description of the patent, surely quali-\n fies as \u201cpatent information.\u201d Novo nonetheless contends that use\n codes are not \u201csubmitted under\u201d subsections (b) and (c) because those\n provisions expressly require an NDA applicant to provide only \u201cthe\n patent number and the expiration date of any patent\u201d claiming the\n drug or a method of its use. But \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c) also govern the reg-\n ulatory process by which brands provide additional patent infor-\n mation to the FDA. The term \u201cunder\u201d is broad enough to include pa-\n tent information, like use codes, that brands submit as required by\n this scheme. This reading draws support from the Court\u2019s prior deci-\n sions in e.g., Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 665\u2013\n 668, and Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135; and it is bolstered by\n Congress\u2019s use of the narrower phrases \u201cdescribed in\u201d and \u201cprescribed\n by\u201d in neighboring provisions. See \u00a7\u00a7355(c)(2), (d)(6). Again, the con-\n clusion that use codes are \u201csubmitted under\u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c) fits the\n broader statutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA\u2019s imple-\n mentation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and so it is unsur-\n4       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                    NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                        Syllabus\n\n\n    prising that the counterclaim provision\u2019s language sweeps widely\n    enough to embrace them. Pp. 15\u201318.\n       (c) The counterclaim provision\u2019s description of available remedies\n    dispatches whatever remains of Novo\u2019s arguments. The Court\u2019s read-\n    ing gives content to both remedies: It \u201cdelete[s]\u201d a listing from the\n    Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent and \u201ccor-\n    rect[s]\u201d the listing when the brand has misdescribed the patent\u2019s\n    scope. By contrast, Novo\u2019s interpretation would all but read \u201ccorrect\u201d\n    out of the statute. If, as Novo contends, the counterclaim is available\n    only where the patent claims no approved method of use, the remedy\n    will always be to delete the patent information. And if the counter-\n    claim reaches only patent numbers and expiration dates, the Orange\n    Book will include few if any mistakes in need of correction. Pp. 18\u2013\n    20.\n       (d) Novo advances two arguments relating to the counterclaim\u2019s\n    drafting history, but neither overcomes the statutory text and con-\n    text. The company first points out that Congress failed to pass an\n    earlier bill that would have required brands to file descriptions of\n    method-of-use patents and would have allowed generic companies to\n    bring civil actions to \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d the information filed. Be-\n    cause that bill would have allowed a generic applicant to challenge\n    overbroad descriptions of a patent, Novo contends that this Court\n    cannot read the statute that was eventually enacted as doing the\n    same. But the earlier bill contained numerous items that may have\n    caused its failure. And the limited criticism of its mechanism for\n    challenging brands\u2019 descriptions of their patents focused on the crea-\n    tion of an independent cause of action\u2014stronger medicine than the\n    counterclaim at issue here. Finally, between that bill\u2019s demise and\n    the counterclaim\u2019s enactment, the FDA issued a rule requiring\n    brands to supply use codes. The counterclaim provision\u2019s drafters\n    thus had no need to require this information.\n       Novo next contends that Congress established the counterclaim only\n    to address the impossibility of deleting an improperly listed patent\n    from the Orange Book\u2014a problem that had come to light when the\n    Federal Circuit held in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson,\n    268 F. 3d 1323, that generics had no cause of action to delist a patent.\n    Novo thus contends that the counterclaim is a mere delisting provi-\n    sion. But this Court thinks Mylan alerted Congress to a broader\n    problem: that generic companies generally had no avenue to chal-\n    lenge the accuracy of brands\u2019 patent listings, and that the FDA there-\n    fore could not approve proper applications to bring inexpensive drugs\n    to market. Again, the proof of that lies in the statute itself\u2014its text\n    and context demonstrate that the counterclaim is available not only\n    (as in Mylan) when the patent listing is baseless, but also (as here)\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

NOVO NORDISK A/S ET AL.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                [April 17, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evalu-\nates an application to market a generic drug, it considers\nwhether the proposed drug would infringe a patent held\nby the manufacturer of the brand-name version. To assess\nthat matter, the FDA requires brand manufacturers to\nsubmit descriptions of the scope of their patents, known as\nuse codes. The FDA does not attempt to determine if that\ninformation is accurate. Rather, the FDA assumes that\nit is so and decides whether to approve a generic drug on\nthat basis. As a result, the breadth of the use code may\nmake the difference between approval and denial of a\ngeneric company\u2019s application.\n   In this case, we consider whether Congress has author-\nized a generic company to challenge a use code\u2019s accuracy\nby bringing a counterclaim against the brand manufac-\nturer in a patent infringement suit. The relevant statute\nprovides that a generic company \u201cmay assert a counter-\nclaim seeking an order requiring the [brand manufac-\nturer] to correct or delete the patent information [it]\nsubmitted . . . under [two statutory subsections] on the\n2    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nground that the patent does not claim . . . an approved\nmethod of using the drug.\u201d 117 Stat. 2452, 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). We hold that a generic manufacturer\nmay employ this provision to force correction of a use code\nthat inaccurately describes the brand\u2019s patent as covering\na particular method of using the drug in question.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The FDA regulates the manufacture, sale, and labeling\nof prescription drugs under a complex statutory scheme.\nTo begin at the beginning: When a brand manufacturer\nwishes to market a novel drug, it must submit a new drug\napplication (NDA) to the FDA for approval. The NDA\nmust include, among other things, a statement of the\ndrug\u2019s components, scientific data showing that the drug\nis safe and effective, and proposed labeling describing\nthe uses for which the drug may be marketed. See\n\u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (d). The FDA may approve a brand-name\ndrug for multiple methods of use\u2014either to treat different\nconditions or to treat the same condition in different ways.\n   Once the FDA has approved a brand manufacturer\u2019s\ndrug, another company may seek permission to market\na generic version pursuant to legislation known as the\nHatch-Waxman Amendments. See Drug Price Competi-\ntion and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat.\n1585. Those amendments allow a generic competitor to\nfile an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) piggy-\nbacking on the brand\u2019s NDA. Rather than providing\nindependent evidence of safety and efficacy, the typical\nANDA shows that the generic drug has the same active\ningredients as, and is biologically equivalent to, the brand-\nname drug. See \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv). As we have previ-\nously recognized, this process is designed to speed the\nintroduction of low-cost generic drugs to market. See Eli\nLilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 676 (1990).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because the FDA cannot authorize a generic drug that\nwould infringe a patent, the timing of an ANDA\u2019s approval\ndepends on the scope and duration of the patents cover-\ning the brand-name drug. Those patents come in different\nvarieties. One type protects the drug compound itself.\nAnother kind\u2014the one at issue here\u2014gives the brand\nmanufacturer exclusive rights over a particular method of\nusing the drug. In some circumstances, a brand manufac-\nturer may hold such a method-of-use patent even after its\npatent on the drug compound has expired.\n   To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as\npatents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA\nregulations direct brand manufacturers to file information\nabout their patents. The statute mandates that a brand\nsubmit in its NDA \u201cthe patent number and the expiration\ndate of any patent which claims the drug for which the\n[brand] submitted the [NDA] or which claims a method of\nusing such drug.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1). And the regulations issued\nunder that statute require that, once an NDA is approved,\nthe brand provide a description of any method-of-use\npatent it holds. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e)\n(2011). That description is known as a use code, and the\nbrand submits it on FDA Form 3542. As later discussed,\nthe FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the\nuse codes that brand manufacturers supply. It simply pub-\nlishes the codes, along with the corresponding patent\nnumbers and expiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued\nvolume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more\nofficially denominated Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations).\n   After consulting the Orange Book, a company filing an\nANDA must assure the FDA that its proposed generic\ndrug will not infringe the brand\u2019s patents. When no pa-\ntents are listed in the Orange Book or all listed patents\nhave expired (or will expire prior to the ANDA\u2019s approval),\nthe generic manufacturer simply certifies to that effect.\n4     CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nSee 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I)\u2013(III). Otherwise, the\napplicant has two possible ways to obtain approval.\n   One option is to submit a so-called section viii state-\nment, which asserts that the generic manufacturer will\nmarket the drug for one or more methods of use not cov-\nered by the brand\u2019s patents. See \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii). A\nsection viii statement is typically used when the brand\u2019s\npatent on the drug compound has expired and the brand\nholds patents on only some approved methods of using\nthe drug. If the ANDA applicant follows this route, it will\npropose labeling for the generic drug that \u201ccarves out\u201d\nfrom the brand\u2019s approved label the still-patented methods\nof use. See 21 CFR \u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iv). The FDA may ap-\nprove such a modified label, see \u00a7314.127(a)(7), as an ex-\nception to the usual rule that a generic drug must bear\nthe same label as the brand-name product, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(v), (j)(4)(G). FDA acceptance of the carve-\nout label allows the generic company to place its drug\non the market (assuming the ANDA meets other require-\nments), but only for a subset of approved uses\u2014i.e., those\nnot covered by the brand\u2019s patents.\n   Of particular relevance here, the FDA will not approve\nsuch an ANDA if the generic\u2019s proposed carve-out label\noverlaps at all with the brand\u2019s use code. See 68 Fed. Reg.\n36682\u201336683 (2003). The FDA takes that code as a given:\nIt does not independently assess the patent\u2019s scope or\notherwise look behind the description authored by the\nbrand. According to the agency, it lacks \u201cboth [the] exper-\ntise and [the] authority\u201d to review patent claims; although\nit will forward questions about the accuracy of a use code\nto the brand,1 its own \u201crole with respect to patent listing is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Under the FDA\u2019s regulations, any person may dispute the accuracy\n\nof patent information listed in the Orange Book by notifying the agency\nin writing. See 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(f). The FDA will then request that the\nbrand verify the information, but will make no changes \u201c[u]nless the\n[brand] withdraws or amends\u201d the listing.

(\u201cA fundamental\nassumption of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is that\nthe courts are the appropriate mechanism for the resolu-\ntion of disputes about the scope and validity of patents\u201d).2\nThus, whether section viii is available to a generic manu-\nfacturer depends on how the brand describes its patent.\nOnly if the use code provides sufficient space for the gener-\nic\u2019s proposed label will the FDA approve an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement.\n   The generic manufacturer\u2019s second option is to file a so-\ncalled paragraph IV certification, which states that a\nlisted patent \u201cis invalid or will not be infringed by the\nmanufacture, use, or sale of the [generic] drug.\u201d 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). A generic manufacturer will\ntypically take this path in either of two situations: if it\nwants to market the drug for all uses, rather than carving\nout those still allegedly under patent; or if it discovers, as\ndescribed above, that any carve-out label it is willing to\nadopt cannot avoid the brand\u2019s use code. Filing a para-\ngraph IV certification means provoking litigation. The\npatent statute treats such a filing as itself an act of in-\nfringement, which gives the brand an immediate right to\nsue. See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(e)(2)(A). Assuming the brand\ndoes so, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA\nuntil 30 months pass or the court finds the patent invalid\nor not infringed. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Accord-\ningly, the paragraph IV process is likely to keep the gen-\neric drug off the market for a lengthy period, but may\neventually enable the generic company to market its drug\nfor all approved uses.\n   In the late 1990\u2019s, evidence mounted that some brands\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Several courts have affirmed the FDA\u2019s view of its ministerial role.\nSee, e.g., Apotex, Inc. v. Thompson, 347 F. 3d 1335, 1349 (CA Fed.\n2003); aaaiPharma v. Thompson, 296 F. 3d 227, 242\u2013243 (CA4 2002).\nThat question is not before us, and we express no view on it.\n6    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nwere exploiting this statutory scheme to prevent or delay\nthe marketing of generic drugs, and the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) soon issued a study detailing these\nanticompetitive practices. See FTC, Generic Drug Entry\nPrior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study, pp. iii\u2013vi (July\n2002) (hereinafter FTC Study). That report focused at-\ntention on brands\u2019 submission of inaccurate patent infor-\nmation to the FDA. In one case cited by the FTC, Mylan\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, 268 F. 3d 1323 (CA\nFed. 2001), a brand whose original patent on a drug was\nset to expire listed a new patent ostensibly extending its\nrights over the drug, but in fact covering neither the com-\npound nor any method of using it. The FDA, as was (and\nis) its wont, accepted the listing at its word and accord-\ningly declined to approve a generic product. The generic\nmanufacturer sued to delete the improper listing from the\nOrange Book, but the Federal Circuit held that the Hatch-\nWaxman Amendments did not allow such a right of action.\nSee id., at 1330\u20131333. As the FTC noted, that ruling\nmeant that the only option for generic manufacturers in\nMylan\u2019s situation was to file a paragraph IV certification\n(triggering an infringement suit) and then wait out the\nusual 30-month period before the FDA could approve an\nANDA. See FTC Study 40\u201345.\n   Congress responded to these abuses by creating a mech-\nanism, in the form of a legal counterclaim, for generic\nmanufacturers to challenge patent information a brand\nhas submitted to the FDA. See Medicare Prescription\nDrug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 117\nStat. 2452. The provision authorizes an ANDA applicant\nsued for patent infringement to\n    \u201cassert a counterclaim seeking an order requiring the\n    [brand] to correct or delete the patent information\n    submitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c) [of\n    \u00a7355] on the ground that the patent does not claim\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    either\u2014\n      \u201c(aa) the drug for which the [brand\u2019s NDA] was\n      approved; or\n      \u201c(bb) an approved method of using the drug.\u201d 21\n      U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).\nThe counterclaim thus enables a generic competitor to\nobtain a judgment directing a brand to \u201ccorrect or delete\u201d\ncertain patent information that is blocking the FDA\u2019s\napproval of a generic product. This case raises the ques-\ntion whether the counterclaim is available to fix a brand\u2019s\nuse code.\n                              B\n   The parties to this case sell or seek to sell the diabetes\ndrug repaglinide. Respondents (collectively Novo) manu-\nfacture Prandin, the brand-name version of the drug. The\nFDA has approved three uses of Prandin to treat diabe-\ntes: repaglinide by itself; repaglinide in combination with\nmetformin; and repaglinide in combination with thiazoli-\ndinediones (TZDs). Petitioners (collectively Caraco) wish\nto market a generic version of the drug for two of those\nuses.\n   Novo originally owned a patent for the repaglinide\ncompound, known as the \u2019035 patent, but it expired in\n2009. In 2004, Novo also acquired a method-of-use patent\nfor the drug, called the \u2019358 patent, which does not expire\nuntil 2018. That patent\u2014the one at issue here\u2014claims a\n\u201cmethod for treating [diabetes by] administering . . . rep-\naglinide in combination with metformin.\u201d 601 F. 3d 1359,\n1362 (CA Fed. 2010). Thus, Novo currently holds a patent\nfor one of the three FDA-approved uses of repaglinide\u2014its\nuse with metformin. But Novo holds no patent for the use\nof repaglinide with TZDs or its use alone.\n   In 2005, Caraco filed an ANDA seeking to market a\ngeneric version of repaglinide. At that time, the Orange\nBook entry for Prandin listed both the \u2019035 patent (the\n8     CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\ndrug compound) and the \u2019358 patent (the use of the drug\nwith metformin). Caraco assured the FDA that it would\nnot market its generic drug until the \u2019035 patent expired,\nthus making that patent irrelevant to the FDA\u2019s review of\nthe ANDA. Caraco filed a paragraph IV certification for\nthe remaining, \u2019358 patent, stating that it was \u201cinvalid or\n[would] not be infringed.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra,\nat 5. In accord with the patent statute, Novo treated this\nfiling as an act of infringement and brought suit.\n   When Caraco filed its ANDA, Novo\u2019s use code for the\n\u2019358 patent represented that the patent covered \u201c \u2018[u]se of\nrepaglinide in combination with metformin to lower blood\nglucose.\u2019 \u201d 601 F. 3d, at 1362\u20131363. The FDA therefore\nadvised Caraco that if it did not seek to market repag-\nlinide for use with metformin, it could submit a section\nviii statement. That would allow Caraco, assuming its\nANDA was otherwise in order, to market its generic drug\nfor the other two uses. Caraco took the FDA\u2019s cue and in\n2008 submitted a section viii statement, with proposed\nlabeling carving out Novo\u2019s patented metformin therapy.\nSee App. 166\u2013176.\n   Before the FDA took further action, however, Novo\nchanged its use code for the \u2019358 patent. The new use code\ndescribes \u201c \u2018[a] method for improving glycemic control in\nadults with type 2 diabetes.\u2019 \u201d3 601 F. 3d, at 1363. Be-\ncause that code indicates that the \u2019358 patent protects all\nthree approved methods of using repaglinide to treat\ndiabetes, Caraco\u2019s proposed carve-out of metformin ther-\napy was no longer sufficient; even with that exclusion,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Novo asserts that it made the change so that its use code would\n\nmirror its label, which the FDA had just asked it to alter. See Brief for\nRespondents 14. But the FDA, in calling for new labeling, neither\nrequested nor required Novo to amend its use code. And indeed, Novo\u2019s\ncounsel conceded before the Federal Circuit that Novo modified its use\ncode in part as \u201c \u2018a response to the [FDA\u2019s] section viii\u2019 \u201d suggestion. 601\nF. 3d, at 1380\u20131381.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCaraco\u2019s label now overlapped with Novo\u2019s use code on the\nother two uses. And Caraco could not carve out those uses\nas well, because at that point nothing would be left for\nit to market. The FDA has approved repaglinide for only\nthree uses, and Novo\u2019s use code encompassed them all.\nThe FDA accordingly informed Caraco that it could no\nlonger employ section viii to bring its drug to market.\n   Caraco responded to Novo\u2019s new, preclusive use code by\nfiling a statutory counterclaim in the ongoing infringe-\nment suit. The counterclaim sought an order requiring\nNovo to \u201ccorrect\u201d its use code \u201con the ground that [the\n\u2019358] patent does not claim\u201d two approved methods of\nusing repaglinide\u2014alone and in combination with TZDs.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I); see supra, at 6\u20137. That order would\npermit the FDA to accept Caraco\u2019s proposed carve-out\nlabel and approve the company\u2019s ANDA. The District\nCourt granted summary judgment to Caraco, enjoining\nNovo to \u201ccorrect . . . its inaccurate description of the \u2019358\npatent\u201d by submitting a new Form 3542 to the FDA that\nwould \u201creinstat[e] its former\u201d use code. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a\u201366a.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Caraco\nlacked \u201ca statutory basis to assert a counterclaim.\u201d 601\nF. 3d, at 1360. The court first read the statutory phrase\n\u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved method of\nusing the drug\u201d to require Caraco to demonstrate that\nthe \u2019358 patent does not claim any approved method of\nuse. See id., at 1365 (\u201c \u2018[A]n approved method\u2019 means \u2018any\napproved method\u2019 \u201d). Because the patent covers one ap-\nproved method of use\u2014repaglinide in combination with\nmetformin\u2014the counterclaim was unavailable. The court\nfurther ruled that the counterclaim provision does not\nreach use codes because they are not \u201cpatent information\nsubmitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c).\u201d On\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s view, that information consists only\nof the patent number and expiration date. See id., at\n10       CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                     NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1366\u20131367. Judge Dyk dissented. He would have read\nthe phrase \u201cthe patent does not claim . . . an approved\nmethod of using the drug\u201d to include situations where, as\nhere, the use code wrongly indicates that the patent covers\none or more particular approved methods of use. See id.,\nat 1376\u20131378. And he would have construed \u201cpatent in-\nformation submitted . . . under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d to\ninclude use codes. See id., at 1370\u20131376.4\n  We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now\nreverse.\n                             II\n  We begin \u201cwhere all such inquiries must begin: with the\nlanguage of the statute itself.\u201d United States v. Ron Pair\nEnterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241 (1989). This case\nrequires us to construe two statutory phrases. First, we\nmust decide when a \u201cpatent does not claim . . . an ap-\nproved method of using\u201d a drug. Second, we must deter-\nmine the content of \u201cpatent information submitted . . .\nunder subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of \u00a7355. We consider both of\nthose questions against the backdrop of yet a third statu-\ntory phrase, providing that the remedy for a prevailing\ncounterclaimant is an order requiring the brand \u201cto correct\nor delete\u201d that patent information. And we consider each\nquestion in the context of the entire statute. See Robinson\nv. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) (Statutory in-\nterpretation focuses on \u201cthe language itself, the specific\ncontext in which that language is used, and the broader\ncontext of the statute as a whole\u201d). We cannot say that the\ncounterclaim clause is altogether free of ambiguity.

S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). The parties debate the mean-\ning of this language. Novo (like the Federal Circuit) reads\n\u201cnot an\u201d to mean \u201cnot any,\u201d contending that \u201cthe counter-\nclaim is available only if the listed patent does not claim\nany (or, equivalently, claims no) approved method of using\nthe drug.\u201d Brief for Respondents 29 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). By that measure, Caraco may not bring\na counterclaim because Novo\u2019s \u2019358 patent claims the use of\nrepaglinide with metformin. In contrast, Caraco reads\n\u201cnot an\u201d to mean \u201cnot a particular one,\u201d so that the statute\npermits a counterclaim whenever the patent does not\nclaim a method of use for which the ANDA applicant seeks\nto market the drug. On that view, the counterclaim is\navailable here\u2014indeed, is available twice over\u2014because\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Before  proceeding to the merits, we dispose of a recently raised ju-\nrisdictional argument. Novo now contends that the federal courts lost\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over this infringement action (including the\ncounterclaim) at the moment Caraco filed its section viii statement. On\nNovo\u2019s theory, such a statement (unlike a paragraph IV certification)\ndoes not count as an act of infringement under the patent statute, see\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7271(e)(2)(A), and so cannot provide a jurisdictional basis\nfor the suit. But that argument is wrong even assuming (as Novo con-\ntends) that Caraco\u2019s section viii filing terminated its paragraph IV\ncertification and that a section viii filing is not an act of infringement.\nThe want of an infringing act is a merits problem, not a jurisdictional\none. Nothing in the section of the statute defining certain filings as\nacts of infringement suggests anything to the contrary. And \u201cwe are\nnot inclined to interpret statutes as creating a jurisdictional bar when\nthey are not framed as such.\u201d Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). In the absence of such a bar, the federal courts\nhave jurisdiction over this suit for a single, simple reason: It \u201car[ose]\nunder a[n] Act of Congress relating to patents.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71338(a).\n12    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe \u2019358 patent does not claim the use of repaglinide with\nTZDs or its use alone.\n  Truth be told, the answer to the general question \u201cWhat\ndoes \u2018not an\u2019 mean?\u201d is \u201cIt depends\u201d: The meaning of the\nphrase turns on its context. See Johnson v. United States,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (\u201cUltimately, con-\ntext determines meaning\u201d). \u201cNot an\u201d sometimes means\n\u201cnot any,\u201d in the way Novo claims. If your spouse tells you\nhe is late because he \u201cdid not take a cab,\u201d you will infer\nthat he took no cab at all (but took the bus instead). If\nyour child admits that she \u201cdid not read a book all sum-\nmer,\u201d you will surmise that she did not read any book (but\nwent to the movies a lot). And if a sports-fan friend be-\nmoans that \u201cthe New York Mets do not have a chance of\nwinning the World Series,\u201d you will gather that the team\nhas no chance whatsoever (because they have no hitting).\nBut now stop a moment. Suppose your spouse tells you\nthat he got lost because he \u201cdid not make a turn.\u201d You\nwould understand that he failed to make a particular turn,\nnot that he drove from the outset in a straight line. Sup-\npose your child explains her mediocre grade on a college\nexam by saying that she \u201cdid not read an assigned text.\u201d\nYou would infer that she failed to read a specific book, not\nthat she read nothing at all on the syllabus. And suppose\na lawyer friend laments that in her last trial, she \u201cdid not\nprove an element of the offense.\u201d You would grasp that\nshe is speaking not of all the elements, but of a particular\none. The examples could go on and on, but the point is\nsimple enough: When it comes to the meaning of \u201cnot an,\u201d\ncontext matters.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For this reason, we find Novo\u2019s reliance on the occasional dictionary\n\ndefinition of \u201ca[n]\u201d unconvincing. Although \u201can\u201d sometimes means\n\u201cany\u201d when used in negative structures, see, e.g., Microsoft Encarta\nCollege Dictionary 1 (2001) (fifth definition), it sometimes does not. Cf.\nFCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip. op., at 3\u20135) (rejecting\na proposed definition of \u201cpersonal\u201d because it did not always hold in\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   And the statutory context here supports Caraco\u2019s posi-\ntion. As described earlier (and as Congress understood), a\nsingle drug may have multiple methods of use, only one\nor some of which a patent covers. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(b)(1) (requiring that an NDA applicant file infor-\nmation about \u201cany patent which claims the drug . . . or\nwhich claims a method of using such drug\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorize the\nFDA to approve the marketing of a generic drug for par-\nticular unpatented uses; and section viii provides the\nmechanism for a generic company to identify those uses,\nso that a product with a label matching them can quickly\ncome to market. The statutory scheme, in other words,\ncontemplates that one patented use will not foreclose\nmarketing a generic drug for other unpatented ones.\nWithin that framework, the counterclaim naturally func-\ntions to challenge the brand\u2019s assertion of rights over\nwhichever discrete use (or uses) the generic company\nwishes to pursue. That assertion, after all, is the thing\nblocking the generic drug\u2019s entry on the market. The\navailability of the counterclaim thus matches the availa-\nbility of FDA approval under the statute: A company may\nbring a counterclaim to show that a method of use is un-\npatented because establishing that fact allows the FDA to\nauthorize a generic drug via section viii.\n   Consider the point as applied to this case. Caraco wishes\nto market a generic version of repaglinide for two (and\nonly two) uses. Under the statute, the FDA could approve\nCaraco\u2019s application so long as no patent covers those\nuses, regardless whether a patent protects yet a third\nmethod of using the drug. Novo agrees that Caraco could\nbring a counterclaim if Novo\u2019s assertion of patent protec-\ntion for repaglinide lacked any basis\u2014for example, if Novo\nheld no patent, yet claimed rights to the pair of uses for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nordinary usage and the statutory context suggested it did not apply).\n\n14   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwhich Caraco seeks to market its drug. But because Novo\nhas a valid patent on a different use, Novo argues that\nCaraco\u2019s counterclaim evaporates. And that is so even\nthough, once again, Caraco has no wish to market its\nproduct for that patented use and the FDA stands ready,\npursuant to the statute, to approve Caraco\u2019s product for\nthe other two. To put the matter simply, Novo thinks the\ncounterclaim disappears because it has a patent for a\nmethod of use in which neither Caraco nor the FDA is\ninterested at all. \u201cIt would take strong evidence to per-\nsuade us that this is what Congress wrought.\u201d Eli Lilly,\n496 U. S., at 673. That \u201cnot an\u201d sometimes (but some-\ntimes not) means \u201cnot any\u201d is not enough.\n  Novo argues that our reading must be wrong because\nCongress could have expressly \u201cimpose[d] additional . . .\nqualifications\u201d on the term \u201can approved method of\nus[e]\u201d\u2014and indeed did so in another place in the statute.\nBrief for Respondents 31; 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I).\nNovo points here to section viii itself, which applies when\nthe brand\u2019s patent \u201cdoes not claim a use for which the\n[ANDA] applicant is seeking approval.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(viii)\n(emphasis added). But the mere possibility of clearer\nphrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading of a\nstatute; if it could (with all due respect to Congress), we\nwould interpret a great many statutes differently than we\ndo. Nor does Congress\u2019s use of more detailed language in\nanother provision, enacted years earlier, persuade us to\nput the counterclaim clause at odds with its statutory\ncontext. That is especially so because we can turn this\nform of argument back around on Novo. Congress, after\nall, could have more clearly expressed Novo\u2019s proposed\nmeaning in the easiest of ways\u2014by adding a single letter\nto make clear that \u201cnot an\u201d really means \u201cnot any.\u201d And\nindeed, Congress used a \u201cnot any\u201d construction in the very\nnext subclause, enacted at the very same time. See\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(II) (\u201cSubclause (I) does not authorize the\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

So\nif we needed any proof that Congress knew how to say\n\u201cnot any\u201d when it meant \u201cnot any,\u201d here we find it. We think\nthat sees, raises, and bests Novo\u2019s argument.\n   Our more essential point, though, has less gamesman-\nship about it: We think that the \u201cnot any\u201d construction\ndoes not appear in the relevant counterclaim provision\nbecause Congress did not mean what Novo wishes it had.\nAnd we think that is so because Congress meant (as it\nusually does) for the provision it enacted to fit within\nthe statutory scheme\u2014here, by facilitating the approval of\nnon-infringing generic drugs under section viii.\n                              B\n  Novo contends that Caraco\u2019s counterclaim must fail for\nanother, independent reason: On its view (as on the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s), the counterclaim does not provide a way to\ncorrect use codes because they are not \u201cpatent information\nsubmitted by the [brand] under subsection (b) or (c)\u201d of\n\u00a7355. Once again, we disagree.\n  The statute does not define \u201cpatent information,\u201d but\na use code must qualify. It describes the method of use\nclaimed in a patent. See 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3),\n(e). That fits under any ordinary understanding of the\nlanguage.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Novo\u2019s only counter is to redefine a use code. Novo argues that a use\n\ncode need not be tied to the patent at all\u2014that \u201c[t]he relevant regula-\ntion requires [NDA] applicants to provide [only] \u2018a description of each\napproved method of use or indication.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 48\n(quoting 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1)). Because an \u201cindication\u201d refers\ngenerally to what a drug does (here, treat diabetes), see \u00a7201.57(c)(2),\nNovo claims that a use code may sweep more broadly than the patent.\nBut that is incorrect. First, Novo does not cite the regulations that\nspecify the information required for publication\u2014i.e., use codes. See\n\u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3) (requiring a \u201cdescription of the patented method\nof use as required for publication\u201d); \u00a7314.53(e) (\u201c[F]or each use patent,\u201d\nFDA will publish \u201cthe approved indications or other conditions of use\n16    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n   The more difficult question arises from the \u201csubmitted\nunder\u201d phrase. The subsections mentioned there\u2014(b) and\n(c) of \u00a7355\u2014require an NDA applicant to submit specified\ninformation: \u201cthe patent number and the expiration date\nof any patent\u201d claiming the drug or a method of its use. 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(b)(1), (c)(2). According to Novo, only that\ninformation comes within the counterclaim provision. But\nsubsections (b) and (c) as well govern the regulatory pro-\ncess by which brands provide additional patent infor-\nmation to the FDA, both before and after an NDA is ap-\nproved. In particular, those subsections provide the basis\nfor the regulation requiring brands to submit use codes,\nsee 21 CFR \u00a7314.53; in issuing that regulation, the FDA\nnoted that \u201c[o]ur principal legal authority . . . is section\n505 of the act [codified at \u00a7355], in conjunction with our\ngeneral rulemaking authority.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 36697\u201336698\n(specifically referring to subsections (b) and (c)). And the\nform (Form 3542) on which brands submit their use codes\nstates that the information appearing there is \u201cprovided\nin accordance with Section [355](b) and (c).\u201d App. 97. So\nuse codes fall within the counterclaim\u2019s ambit if the phrase\n\u201csubmitted under\u201d reaches filings that not only subsec-\ntions (b) and (c) themselves, but also their implementing\nregulations require.\n   Several of our cases support giving \u201cunder\u201d this broad\nmeaning. For example, in Eli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 665\u2013668,\nwe examined a similar statutory reference to the \u201csubmis-\nsion of information under a Federal law which regulates\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncovered by a patent\u201d). Those provisions (whether referring to methods\nof use, conditions of use, or indications) all demand a description of the\npatent. And second, even the provision Novo cites\u2014which mandates\nthe submission of additional material, not listed in the Orange Book\u2014\nties information about indications to patent coverage; that regulation\nrequires (when quoted in full) that the brand provide \u201ca description of\neach approved method of use or indication and related patent claim of\nthe patent being submitted.\u201d \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

We noted there that submitting information\n\u201cunder a Federal law\u201d suggests doing so \u201cin furtherance of\nor compliance with a comprehensive scheme of regula-\ntion.\u201d 496 U. S., at 667. Likewise, in Ardestani v. INS,\n502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991), we held that a regulatory pro-\nceeding \u201cunder section 554,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7504(b)(1)(C)(i),\nmeant any proceeding \u201csubject to,\u201d \u201cgoverned by,\u201d or\nconducted \u201cby reason of the authority of \u201d that statutory\nprovision.\n   So too here. \u201cPatent information submitted . . . under\nsubsection (b) or (c)\u201d most naturally refers to patent in-\nformation provided as part of the \u201ccomprehensive scheme\nof regulation\u201d premised on those subsections. Eli Lilly,\n496 U. S., at 667. It includes everything (about patents)\nthat the FDA requires brands to furnish in the proceed-\nings \u201csubject to,\u201d \u201cgoverned by,\u201d or conducted \u201cby reason of\nthe authority of \u201d \u00a7\u00a7355(b) and (c). Ardestani, 502 U. S., at\n135. The breadth of the term \u201cunder\u201d becomes particu-\nlarly clear when compared with other phrases\u2014\u201cdescribed\nin\u201d and \u201cprescribed by\u201d\u2014appearing in neighboring provi-\nsions. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(c)(2) (\u201cpatent information\ndescribed in subsection (b)\u201d); \u00a7355(d)(6) (\u201cpatent infor-\nmation prescribed by subsection (b)\u201d). Those phrases\ndenote a patent number and expiration date and nothing\nmore. In contrast, the word \u201cunder\u201d naturally reaches\nbeyond that most barebones information to other patent\nmaterials the FDA demands in the regulatory process.\n   Once again, that congressional choice fits the broader\nstatutory context. Use codes are pivotal to the FDA\u2019s\nimplementation of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\u2014and\nno less so because a regulation, rather than the statute\nitself, requires their submission.         Recall that those\nAmendments instruct the FDA (assuming other require-\nments are met) to approve an ANDA filed with a section\nviii statement when it proposes to market a drug for only\n18   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nunpatented methods of use. To fulfill that charge, the\nFDA must determine whether any patent covers a particu-\nlar method of use; and to do that, the agency (which views\nitself as lacking expertise in patent matters, see supra, at\n4\u20135, and n. 2) relies on the use codes submitted in the\nregulatory process. See 68 Fed. Reg. 36682\u201336683. An\noverbroad use code therefore throws a wrench into the\nFDA\u2019s ability to approve generic drugs as the statute con-\ntemplates. So it is not surprising that the language Con-\ngress used in the counterclaim provision sweeps widely\nenough to embrace that filing.\n                              C\n  Another aspect of the counterclaim provision\u2014its de-\nscription of available remedies\u2014dispatches whatever\nremains of Novo\u2019s arguments. According to the statute,\na successful claimant may obtain an order requiring\nthe brand to \u201ccorrect or delete\u201d its patent information.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). Our interpretation of the statute gives\ncontent to both those remedies: It deletes a listing from\nthe Orange Book when the brand holds no relevant patent\nand corrects the listing when the brand has misdescribed\nthe patent\u2019s scope. By contrast, Novo\u2019s two arguments\nwould all but read the term \u201ccorrect\u201d out of the statute.\n  Consider first how Novo\u2019s an-means-any contention\nwould accomplish that result. Recall that on Novo\u2019s view,\na counterclaim can succeed only if the patent challenged\ndoes not claim either the drug or any approved method of\nusing it. See supra, at 11. But when a generic manufac-\nturer makes that showing, the remedy must be to \u201cdelete\u201d\nthe listing; no correction would be enough. Novo agrees\nwith that proposition; \u201c[a]t bottom,\u201d Novo avers, \u201cthe\ncounterclaim is a delisting provision.\u201d Brief for Respond-\nents 20. But that raises the obvious question: Why did\nCongress also include the term \u201ccorrect\u201d in the statute?\n  Novo can come up with just one answer: The counter-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim, it proposes, can correct erroneous patent numbers.\nImagine, for example, that Novo mistakenly entered the\nnumber \u2019359, instead of \u2019358, when submitting information\nabout its repaglinide patent for publication in the Orange\nBook. Then, Novo suggests, Caraco could bring a counter-\nclaim to challenge the inaccurate listing (on the ground\nthat \u2019359 does not claim any method of use), and the rem-\nedy would be \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d (substituting an 8 for a 9). But\nwe think Novo\u2019s admission that this scenario would be\n\u201cunusual,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, considerably understates\nthe matter. As Novo concedes, brands have every incen-\ntive to provide the right patent number in the first place,\nand to immediately rectify any error brought to their\nattention. See id., at 40\u201341. By doing so, they place both\ngeneric companies and the FDA on notice of their patents\nand thereby prevent infringement. And conversely, gener-\nics have little or no incentive to bring a counterclaim that\nwill merely replace one digit in the Orange Book with\nanother. So we doubt Congress created a legal action to\n\u201ccorrect\u201d patent information just to fix such scrivener\u2019s\nerrors. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31\n(2001) (refusing to adopt an interpretation of a statute\nthat would render a piece of it \u201cinsignificant, if not wholly\nsuperfluous\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). That\nwould have been, in the most literal sense, to make a\nfederal case out of nothing.\n   The same problem afflicts Novo\u2019s alternative conten-\ntion\u2014that \u201cpatent information submitted . . . under sub-\nsection (b) or (c)\u201d includes only numbers and expiration\ndates (and not use codes). Once again, we cannot think\nCongress included the remedy of \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d so that\ncourts could expunge typos in patent numbers. And not\neven Novo has proffered a way for the counterclaim to\n\u201ccorrect\u201d an erroneous expiration date. Suppose, for ex-\nample, that a brand incorrectly lists the expiration date of\na valid patent as 2018 rather than 2015. The counter-\n20   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim would be useless: It authorizes a remedy only \u201con\nthe ground that\u201d the listed patent does not claim the drug\nor an approved method of using it\u2014and notwithstanding\nthe wrong expiration date, this patent does so. Alterna-\ntively, suppose the brand lists a patent as having a 2018\nexpiration date when in fact the patent has already\nlapsed. Then, a generic manufacturer could bring a coun-\nterclaim alleging that the patent no longer claims the\ndrug or a method of using it\u2014but the appropriate remedy\nwould be deletion, not correction, of the brand\u2019s listing.\nNovo\u2019s reading of \u201cpatent information,\u201d like its reading of\n\u201cnot an,\u201d effectively deletes the term \u201ccorrect\u201d from the\nstatute.\n                             III\n  Novo finally advances two arguments relating to the\ncounterclaim\u2019s drafting history. Neither contention, how-\never, overcomes the statutory text and context. Indeed,\nconsideration of the provision\u2019s background only strength-\nens our view of its meaning.\n                              A\n   Novo first contends that our interpretation of the stat-\nute \u201ceffectively resurrect[s] the scheme rejected by Con-\ngress.\u201d Brief for Respondents 44 (quoting Smith v. United\nStates, 507 U. S. 197, 203, n. 4 (1993)). In 2002, Novo\nnotes, Congress failed to pass a bill that would have re-\nquired brands to file specified \u201cpatent information,\u201d in-\ncluding, for method-of-use patents, a description of \u201cthe\napproved use covered by the [patent] claim.\u201d S. 812, 107th\nCong., 2d Sess., \u00a7103(a)(1), p. 7 (engrossed bill). That bill\nwould have allowed a generic company to bring its own\ncivil action\u2014not merely a counterclaim in ongoing litiga-\ntion\u2014to \u201cdelete\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d the information filed. Id.,\nat 8. The Senate approved the bill, but the House of Repre-\nsentatives took no action on it. Novo argues that because\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthis failed legislation would have allowed a generic com-\npany to challenge overbroad descriptions of a patent, we\ncannot read the statute Congress eventually enacted as\ndoing so.\n   We disagree. We see no reason to assume, as Novo does,\nthat Congress rejected S. 812 because it required brands\nto submit patent information beyond a number and expi-\nration date. Indeed, Novo\u2019s argument highlights the perils\nof relying on the fate of prior bills to divine the meaning of\nenacted legislation. \u201cA bill can be proposed for any num-\nber of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many\nothers.\u201d Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 170 (2001)). S.\n812 contained numerous items, including a title on import-\ning prescription drugs (no controversy there!), that may\nhave caused its failure. See S. 812, Tit. II. Moreover,\nwhat criticism there was of the bill\u2019s mechanism for chal-\nlenging brands\u2019 patent claims focused not on the specifica-\ntion of \u201cpatent information,\u201d but instead on the creation of\nan independent cause of action\u2014stronger medicine than\nthe counterclaim Congress ultimately adopted.8 And\nfinally, Novo ignores a likely cause for the redrafting of\nthe provision on submitting information. Between S. 812\u2019s\ndemise and the counterclaim\u2019s enactment, the FDA issued\na rule requiring brands to supply material concerning\nmethod-of-use patents, including use codes. The drafters\nof the counterclaim provision knew about that rule,9 and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 See, e.g., 148 Cong. Rec. 15424 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Gregg)\n\n(\u201cProbably the most significant issue is the fact that it creates a new\ncause of action\u201d); id., at 15431\u201315432 (remarks of Sen. Grassley)\n(similar); id., at 14434 (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (similar).\n   9 See, e.g., Hearings on Barriers to Entry in the Pharmaceutical Mar-\n\nketplace before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 108th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 5\u20138 (2003) (statement of Daniel Troy, Chief Counsel to the\nFDA); id., at 19 (statement of Sen. Schumer) (\u201cThe bill provides a\ncritical complement to the work FDA has done in clarifying its regula-\ntions on patent listing, but it goes much further\u201d).\n22   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhad no need to duplicate its list of mandated filings. So\nthe drafting history does not support Novo\u2019s conclusion. If\nanything, the statute\u2019s evolution indicates that Congress\ndetermined to enforce the FDA\u2019s new listing provisions,\nincluding its use-code requirement, through the new\ncounterclaim.\n                              B\n   Novo next argues that Congress established the coun-\nterclaim only to solve the problem raised by the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s decision in Mylan, 268 F. 3d 1323\u2014the impossi-\nbility of deleting an improperly listed patent from the\nOrange Book. In Mylan, as earlier described, a generic\ncompany alleged that a brand had listed a patent that\ncovered neither the approved drug nor any method of\nusing it, and brought an action seeking delisting. See\nsupra, at 6. The Federal Circuit held that no such action\nwas available, even assuming the allegation was true.\nBecause several legislators saw Mylan as \u201cexemplif[ying]\u201d\nbrands\u2019 \u201cperceived abuse\u201d of the FDA\u2019s patent listing prac-\ntices, Brief for Respondents 35, Novo contends that we\nshould construe the counterclaim provision to aid only a\ngeneric company that \u201cfinds itself in the same position as\nMylan was in Mylan,\u201d Supp. Brief in Opposition 5\u20136.\n   Once again, we think not. Maybe Mylan triggered the\nlegislative effort to enact a counterclaim, or maybe it\ndidn\u2019t: By the time Congress acted, it also had at hand an\nFTC study broadly criticizing brands\u2019 patent listings and\nan FDA rule designed to address the very same issue. See\nsupra, at 6, 21. But even assuming Mylan \u201cprompted the\nproposal\u201d of the counterclaim, \u201cwhether that alone ac-\ncounted for its enactment is quite a different question.\u201d\nEli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 670, n. 3 (emphasis deleted). Here,\nwe think Mylan alerted Congress to a broader problem\u2014\nthat generic companies generally had no avenue to chal-\nlenge the accuracy of brands\u2019 patent listings, and that the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFDA therefore could not approve proper applications to\nbring inexpensive drugs to market. The proof of that lies\nin the statute itself (where the best proof of what Congress\nmeans to address almost always resides). As we have de-\nscribed, the statute\u2019s text and context demonstrate that\nthe counterclaim is available not only (as in Mylan) when\nthe patent listing is baseless, but also (as here) when it is\noverbroad. See supra, at 10\u201320. In particular, Congress\u2019s\ndecision to allow a counterclaimant to seek \u201ccorrect[ion]\u201d\nof patent information explodes Novo\u2019s theory, because the\nremedy for a Mylan-type impropriety is complete delisting.\n   And to make matters still easier, Congress\u2019s equation of\nthe two situations\u2014the one in Mylan and the one here\u2014\nmakes perfect sense. Whether a brand lists a patent that\ncovers no use or describes a patent on one use as extend-\ning to others, the brand submits misleading patent in-\nformation to the FDA. In doing so, the brand equally ex-\nploits the FDA\u2019s determination that it cannot police patent\nclaims. And the brand\u2019s action may in either case delay or\nblock approval of a generic drug that infringes no patent\u2014\nand that under the statute should go to market. See su-\npra, at 4. That is the danger Caraco faces here, as much\nas it was the threat in Mylan: Novo seeks to preclude\nCaraco from selling repaglinide for unpatented uses until\n2018, when Novo\u2019s patent on a different use expires.\n   Indeed, the need for the counterclaim is greater here\nthan in Mylan. When a brand lists a patent that covers no\nuse, a generic company has a pathway aside from the\ncounterclaim to challenge the listing. As described ear-\nlier, the company may make a paragraph IV certification\nstating that the listed patent \u201cis invalid or will not\nbe infringed\u201d by the generic drug.               21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV); see supra, at 5. If the brand sues,\nthe generic company can argue that its product would not\ninfringe the patent. Using the counterclaim may enable a\ngeneric manufacturer to obtain delisting more quickly, see\n24   CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n                 NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                 Opinion of the Court \n\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. 54; but even without it, the company can\neventually get a judgment of non-infringement enabling\nthe FDA to approve its ANDA. In contrast, where (as\nhere) a brand files an overbroad use code, a generic com-\npany cannot use paragraph IV litigation to that end. A\nparagraph IV certification (unlike a section viii statement)\nrequires the generic company to propose labeling identical\nto the brand\u2019s; it cannot carve out any uses. See supra, at\n4. And that proposed label will necessarily infringe be-\ncause it will include the use(s) on which the brand does\nhave a patent. So here, a paragraph IV suit cannot lead to\na judgment enabling FDA approval; the counterclaim\noffers the only route to bring the generic drug to market\nfor non-infringing uses. Novo\u2019s view eliminates the coun-\nterclaim where it has the greatest value.\n                              IV\n  The statutory counterclaim we have considered enables\ncourts to resolve patent disputes so that the FDA can\nfulfill its statutory duty to approve generic drugs that do\nnot infringe patent rights. The text and context of the\nprovision demonstrate that a generic company can employ\nthe counterclaim to challenge a brand\u2019s overbroad use\ncode. We accordingly hold that Caraco may bring a coun-\nterclaim seeking to \u201ccorrect\u201d Novo\u2019s use code \u201con the\nground that\u201d the \u2019358 patent \u201cdoes not claim . . . an ap-\nproved method of using the drug\u201d\u2014indeed, does not claim\ntwo.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. \u00a7355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) to permit generic manufac-\nturers to force brand manufacturers to \u201ccorrect\u201d inaccurate\nuse codes. While I too find the counterclaim not \u201cfree of\nambiguity,\u201d ante, at 10, I join the Court\u2019s opinion because\nI agree this is the most sensible reading in light of the\nexisting regulatory scheme. I write separately to add the\nfollowing observations.\n                                I\n  I first underscore that the counterclaim can only lessen\nthe difficulties created by an overly broad use code; it\ncannot fix them. The statutory scheme is designed to\nspeed the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to market.\nSee ante, at 2 (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496\nU. S. 661, 676 (1990)). To that end, the statute provides\nfor the rapid approval of a drug that a generic manufac-\nturer seeks to market for unpatented methods of use. The\nmanufacturer need only submit an abbreviated new drug\napplication (ANDA) with a section viii statement and a\nproposed label that \u201ccarves out\u201d from the brand manufac-\nturer\u2019s label any patented methods of use. See ante, at 4.\nSo long as the use code is not overly broad (and all else is\nin order), FDA may approve the application without re-\n2    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\nquiring any further steps relating to the patent, and the\ngeneric drug may reach the public without undue delay.\nSee ibid.\n   An overly broad use code \u201cthrows a wrench\u201d into that\nscheme. Ante, at 18. The reason why is simple: FDA\nrelies on use codes in determining whether to approve an\nANDA, but it refuses to evaluate the accuracy of those use\ncodes. See ante, at 4\u20135. Thus, if the use code overlaps\nwith the generic manufacturer\u2019s proposed carve-out label\n(i.e., if the use code is overly broad), FDA will not approve\nan ANDA with a section viii statement. See ibid.\n   After today\u2019s opinion, the generic manufacturer can re-\nspond to this situation by taking the following steps: sub-\nmit an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification (which\nrequires a proposed label materially identical to the brand\nmanufacturer\u2019s label, see ante, at 24), wait for the brand\nmanufacturer to institute suit, file a counterclaim, litigate\nthe counterclaim, and, if successful in securing the correc-\ntion of the use code, return to the start of the process and\ndo what it always wanted to do\u2014file an ANDA with a\nsection viii statement and a carve-out label.\n   The problem with this process is twofold. First, it re-\nsults in delay and expense the statutory scheme does not\nenvision. Second, there is no guarantee the process will\nwork. It depends on the brand manufacturer initiating\nparagraph IV litigation, but it is not obvious the brand\nwill have any incentive to do so. In light of today\u2019s hold-\ning, the upshot of such litigation will be the correction of\nthe use code through the assertion of a counterclaim\u2014an\noutcome that is desirable, to be sure, for the generic manu-\nfacturer, but perhaps less so for the brand manufacturer.\n   Meanwhile, it is not clear what happens if the brand\nmanufacturer does not file suit. FDA may approve\nthe generic manufacturer\u2019s application, see 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7355(j)(5)(B)(iii), \u201cwithout prejudice to infringement claims\nthe patent owner might assert when the ANDA applicant\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But the generic manufacturer, having been forced\nto proceed with a paragraph IV certification, will have se-\ncured approval to market a drug with a label materially\nidentical to the brand manufacturer\u2019s. That is not a posi-\ntion I imagine a generic manufacturer wants to be in: As\nthe Solicitor General\u2019s Office informed us at argument,\n\u201c[i]t would be inducement of infringement to sell a product\nwith labeling that suggests that the product be used for\na patented method of use.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 24; see also\nUnited States Brief 32 (noting that in this situation, if\na generic manufacturer proceeded with a paragraph IV\ncertification, \u201c[s]o long as the [new drug application\n(NDA)] holder\u2019s patent covers some approved method of\nusing the approved drug, the proposed labeling will be\ninfringing\u201d).\n   In short, the counterclaim cannot restore the smooth\nworking of a statutory scheme thrown off kilter by an\noverly broad use code. At best, it permits the generic\nmanufacturer to do what the scheme contemplates it\nshould do\u2014file an ANDA with a section viii statement\u2014\nbut only after expensive and time-consuming litigation. A\nfix is in order, but it must come from Congress or FDA.\n                             II\n   Precisely because the regulatory scheme depends on the\naccuracy and precision of use codes, I find FDA\u2019s guidance\nas to what is required of brand manufacturers in use codes\nremarkably opaque. The relevant regulation states simply\nthat a brand manufacturer must provide \u201c[t]he description\nof the patented method of use as required for publication.\u201d\n21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3). The form on which brand\nmanufacturers submit that information provides some\nadditional detail, explaining that \u201c[e]ach approved use\nclaimed by the patent should be separately identified . . .\n4    CARACO PHARMACEUTICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. v.\n\n                  NOVO NORDISK A/S \n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n\nand contain adequate information to assist . . . applicants\nin determining whether a listed method of use patent\nclaims a use for which the . . . applicant is not seeking\napproval.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 214a. But it also provides\nthat brand manufacturers may \u201cus[e] no more than 240\ntotal characters including spaces,\u201d id., at 213a, and else-\nwhere FDA acknowledges \u201cthat in some cases 240 charac-\nters may not fully describe the use as claimed in the pa-\ntent.\u201d 68 Fed. Reg. 36683 (2003); see also ibid. (indicating\nfor this reason that use codes \u201care not meant to substitute\nfor the applicant\u2019s review of the patent\u201d).\n  Indeed, in some respects we are here today because\nof FDA\u2019s opacity in describing what is required of brand\nmanufacturers. In its initial NDA filing, Novo submitted\na use code for the \u2019358 patent that was not \u201coverly broad\u201d:\nIt described narrowly the single patented method of use.\nApp. 54\u201355, 99. Some years later FDA required that Novo\namend its label to \u201c[r]eplace all the separate indications\u201d\n\u201cwith the following sentence: \u2018Prandin is indicated as an\nadjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in\nadults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 163\u2013164,\n215. Novo then amended its use code to track the new\nlabel, id., at 482\u2013486, explaining that the amendment\n\u201ccorrespond[ed] with the change in labeling required by\nFDA,\u201d id., at 483. Novo understood its amended use code\nto comply with FDA regulations, likely on the ground it\npressed before us: that the regulations permit a brand\nmanufacturer to submit for publication in the Orange\nBook a description of either the patented method of use or\nthe indication (which refers to \u201cwhat a drug does,\u201d ante,\nat 15, n. 7). Brief for Respondents 10, 22, 48\u201350.\n  For the reasons explained by the Court, see ante, at 15,\nn. 7, Novo is mistaken. But the company can hardly be\nfaulted for so thinking. The regulations also require sub-\nmission of \u201ca description of each approved method of use\nor indication,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(1), and the form\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

(explaining brand manufacturers\nshould \u201c[s]ubmit the description of the approved indication\nor method of use that you propose FDA include as the \u2018Use\nCode\u2019 in the Orange Book\u201d). Those sources at the least\nsuggest (as Novo thought) that a method of use here is\ndistinct from an indication and that either suffices as a\nuse code.\n   Prior to enactment of the counterclaim provision, Con-\ngress considered a bill that required brand manufacturers\nto submit a \u201cdescription of the approved use covered by the\n[patent] claim,\u201d and that allowed a generic manufacturer\nto bring a civil action to correct that information. See\nante, at 20. Congress rejected the bill, in part over criti-\ncism that it would encourage excess litigation.* Absent\ngreater clarity from FDA concerning what is required of\nbrand manufacturers in use codes, Congress\u2019 fears of un-\ndue litigation may be realized.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * See, e.g., 148 Cong.
