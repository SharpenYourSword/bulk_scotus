MILYARD, WARDEN, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10\u20139995. Argued February 27, 2012\u2014Decided April 24, 2012\nIn 1987, petitioner Patrick Wood was convicted of murder and other\n  crimes by a Colorado court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood\n  filed a federal habeas petition in 2008. After receiving Wood\u2019s peti-\n  tion, the U. S. District Court asked the State if it planned to argue\n  that the petition was untimely. In response, the State twice informed\n  the District Court that it would \u201cnot challenge, but [was] not conced-\n  ing,\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. Thereafter, the District Court\n  rejected Wood\u2019s claims on the merits. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit\n  ordered the parties to brief both the merits and the timeliness of\n  Wood\u2019s petition. After briefing, the court held the petition time\n  barred, concluding that the court had authority to raise timeliness on\n  its own motion, and that the State had not taken the issue off the ta-\n  ble by declining to raise a statute of limitations defense in the Dis-\n  trict Court.\nHeld:\n    1. Courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\u2014\n though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on\n their own initiative in exceptional cases. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (a) \u201cOrdinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is\n forfeited if not raised in a defendant\u2019s answer or in an amendment\n thereto.\u201d Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202. An affirmative de-\n fense, once forfeited, is excluded from the case and, as a rule, cannot\n be asserted on appeal.\n    In Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 133, this Court recognized a\n modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a\n forfeited defense. There, the Seventh Circuit addressed a nonexhaus-\n tion defense the State raised for the first time on appeal. The ex-\n haustion doctrine, this Court noted, is founded on concerns broader\n2                           WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respect-\n    ful, harmonious relations between the state and federal judiciaries.\n    Id., at 133\u2013135. With that comity interest in mind, the Court held\n    that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a nonexhaus-\n    tion argument inadvertently overlooked by the State in the district\n    court. Id. at 132, 134.\n       In Day, the Court affirmed a federal district court\u2019s authority to\n    consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances\n    so warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. The State in Day, having miscalcu-\n    lated a time span, erroneously informed the District Court that Day\u2019s\n    habeas petition was timely. Apprised of the error by a Magistrate\n    Judge, the District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition as un-\n    timely. This Court affirmed, holding that \u201cdistrict courts are permit-\n    ted, but not obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state\n    prisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209. Such leeway was appropri-\n    ate, the Court again reasoned, because AEDPA\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions, like the exhaustion doctrine, \u201cimplicat[es] values beyond the\n    concerns of the parties.\u201d Id., at 205.\n       The Court clarified, however, that a federal court does not have\n    carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation. See\n    Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 243\u2013244. It would be \u201can\n    abuse of discretion\u201d for a court \u201cto override a State\u2019s deliberate waiv-\n    er of a limitations defense.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 202. In Day itself, the\n    State\u2019s timeliness concession resulted from \u201cinadvertent error,\u201d id., at\n    211, not a deliberate decision to proceed to the merits. Pp. 6\u20139.\n          (b) Consistent with Granberry and Day, the Court declines to\n    adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its\n    own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The institutional inter-\n    ests served by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations are also present when\n    a habeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recog-\n    nized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense. P. 9.\n       2. The Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed\n    Wood\u2019s petition as untimely. In the District Court, the State was\n    well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it, and of\n    the arguments that could be made in support of that defense. Yet,\n    the State twice informed the District Court that it would not \u201cchal-\n    lenge\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. In so doing, the State delib-\n    erately waived the statute of limitations defense. In light of that\n    waiver, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Court\u2019s\n    lead and decided the merits of Wood\u2019s petition. Pp. 9\u201311.\n403 Fed.

KEVIN MILYARD,\n\n               WARDEN, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 24, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns the authority of a federal court to\nraise, on its own motion, a statute of limitations defense to\na habeas corpus petition. After state prisoner Patrick\nWood filed a federal habeas corpus petition, the State\ntwice informed the U. S. District Court that it \u201c[would] not\nchallenge, but [is] not conceding, the timeliness of Wood\u2019s\nhabeas petition.\u201d App. 70a; see id., at 87a. Thereafter,\nthe District Court rejected Wood\u2019s claims on the merits.\nOn appeal, the Tenth Circuit directed the parties to brief\nthe question whether Wood\u2019s federal petition was timely.\nPost-briefing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of\nWood\u2019s petition, but solely on the ground that it was\nuntimely.\n  Our precedent establishes that a court may consider a\nstatute of limitations or other threshold bar the State\nfailed to raise in answering a habeas petition. Granberry\nv. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 134 (1987) (exhaustion defense);\nDay v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202 (2006) (statute of\nlimitations defense). Does court discretion to take up\ntimeliness hold when a State is aware of a limitations\n2                         WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense, and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the\ncourt of first instance? The answer Day instructs is \u201cno\u201d:\nA court is not at liberty, we have cautioned, to bypass,\noverride, or excuse a State\u2019s deliberate waiver of a limita-\ntions defense. Id., at 202, 210, n. 11. The Tenth Circuit,\nwe accordingly hold, abused its discretion by resurrecting\nthe limitations issue instead of reviewing the District\nCourt\u2019s disposition on the merits of Wood\u2019s claims.\n                              I\n  In the course of a 1986 robbery at a pizza shop in a\nColorado town, the shop\u2019s assistant manager was shot and\nkilled. Petitioner Patrick Wood was identified as the per-\npetrator. At a bench trial in January 1987, Wood was\nconvicted of murder, robbery, and menacing, and sen-\ntenced to life imprisonment. The Colorado Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed Wood\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct\nappeal in May 1989, and the Colorado Supreme Court\ndenied Wood\u2019s petition for certiorari five months later.\nWood did not ask this Court to review his conviction in the\n90 days he had to do so.\n  Wood then pursued postconviction relief, asserting con-\nstitutional infirmities in his trial, conviction, and sen-\ntence. Prior to the federal petition at issue here, which\nwas filed in 2008, Wood, proceeding pro se, twice sought\nrelief in state court. First, in 1995, he filed a motion to\nvacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to Colorado\nRule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984).1 He also asked\nthe Colorado trial court to appoint counsel to aid him in\npursuit of the motion. When some months passed with no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984) provides, in rele-\n\nvant part: \u201c[E]very person convicted of a crime is entitled as a matter of\nright to make application for postconviction review upon the groun[d]\n. . . [t]hat the conviction was obtained or sentence imposed in violation\nof the Constitution or laws of the United States or the constitution or\nlaws of this state.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresponsive action, Wood filed a request for a ruling on his\nmotion and accompanying request for counsel. The state\ncourt then granted Wood\u2019s plea for the appointment of\ncounsel, but the record is completely blank on any further\naction regarding the 1995 motion. Second, Wood filed a\nnew pro se motion for postconviction relief in Colorado\ncourt in 2004. On the first page of his second motion, he\nindicated that \u201c[n]o other postconviction proceedings [had\nbeen] filed.\u201d Record in No. 08\u2013cv\u201300247 (D Colo.), Doc.\n15\u20135 (Exh. E), p. 1. The state court denied Wood\u2019s motion\nfour days after receiving it.\n   Wood filed a federal habeas petition in 2008, which the\nDistrict Court initially dismissed as untimely. App. 41a\u2013\n46a. On reconsideration, the District Court vacated the\ndismissal and instructed the State to file a preanswer\nresponse \u201climited to addressing the affirmative defenses of\ntimeliness . . . and/or exhaustion of state court remedies.\u201d\nId., at 64a\u201365a. On timeliness, the State represented in\nits preanswer response: \u201cRespondents will not challenge,\nbut are not conceding, the timeliness of Wood\u2019s [federal]\nhabeas petition.\u201d Id., at 70a. Consistently, in its full an-\nswer to Wood\u2019s federal petition, the State repeated: \u201cRe-\nspondents are not challenging, but do not concede, the\ntimeliness of the petition.\u201d Id., at 87a.\n   Disposing of Wood\u2019s petition, the District Court dis-\nmissed certain claims for failure to exhaust state reme-\ndies, and denied on the merits Wood\u2019s two remaining\nclaims\u2014one alleging a double jeopardy violation and one\nchallenging the validity of Wood\u2019s waiver of his Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial. Id., at 96a\u2013111a. On\nappeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief,\nalong with the merits of Wood\u2019s double jeopardy and Sixth\nAmendment claims, \u201cthe timeliness of Wood\u2019s application\nfor [federal habeas relief].\u201d Id., at 129a. After briefing,\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Wood\u2019s petition\nwithout addressing the merits; instead, the Tenth Circuit\n4                        WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nheld the petition time barred. 403 Fed. Appx. 335 (2010).\nIn so ruling, the Court of Appeals concluded it had author-\nity to raise timeliness on its own motion. Id., at 337, n. 2.\nIt further ruled that the State had not taken that issue off\nthe table by declining to interpose a statute of limitations\ndefense in the District Court. Ibid.\n   We granted review, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve two\nissues: first, whether a court of appeals has the author-\nity to address the timeliness of a habeas petition on the\ncourt\u2019s own initiative;2 second, assuming a court of appeals\nhas such authority, whether the State\u2019s representations to\nthe District Court in this case nonetheless precluded the\nTenth Circuit from considering the timeliness of Wood\u2019s\npetition.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner has\none year to file a federal petition for habeas corpus relief,\nstarting from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration\nof the time for seeking such review.\u201d             28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). For a prisoner whose judgment became\nfinal before AEDPA was enacted, the one-year limitations\nperiod runs from the AEDPA\u2019s effective date: April 24,\n1996. See Serrano v. Williams, 383 F. 3d 1181, 1183\n(CA10 2004). \u201cThe one-year clock is stopped, however,\nduring the time the petitioner\u2019s \u2018properly filed\u2019 application\nfor state postconviction relief \u2018is pending.\u2019 \u201d Day, 547 U. S.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Tenth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that it had authority to raise an\n\nAEDPA statute of limitations defense sua sponte conflicts with the view\nof the Eighth Circuit. Compare 403 Fed. Appx. 335, 337, n. 2 (CA10\n2010) (case below), with Sasser v. Norris, 553 F. 3d 1121, 1128 (CA8\n2009) (\u201cThe discretion to consider the statute of limitations defense\nsua sponte does not extend to the appellate level.\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nat 201 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2)).3\n   The state judgment against Wood became final on direct\nreview in early 1990. See supra, at 2. Wood\u2019s time for\nfiling a federal petition therefore began to run on the date\nof AEDPA\u2019s enactment, April 24, 1996, and expired on\nApril 24, 1997, unless Wood had a \u201cproperly filed\u201d applica-\ntion for state postconviction relief \u201cpending\u201d in Colorado\nstate court during that period. Wood maintains he had\nsuch an application pending on April 24, 1996: the Rule\n35(c) motion he filed in 1995. That motion, Wood asserts,\nremained pending (thus continuing to suspend the one-\nyear clock) until at least August 2004, when he filed his\nsecond motion for postconviction relief in state court. The\n2004 motion, the State does not contest, was \u201cproperly\nfiled.\u201d Wood argues that this second motion further tolled\nthe limitations period until February 5, 2007, exactly one\nyear before he filed the federal petition at issue here. If\nWood is correct that his 1995 motion remained \u201cpending\u201d\nin state court from April 1996 until August 2004, his\nfederal petition would be timely.\n   In its preanswer response to Wood\u2019s petition, the State\nset forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations\nissue. It noted that Wood\u2019s \u201ctime for filing a habeas peti-\ntion began to run on April 24, 1996, when the AEDPA\nbecame effective\u201d and that Wood \u201chad until April 24, 1997,\nplus any tolling periods, to timely file his habeas petition.\u201d\nApp. 69a\u201370a. The State next identified the crucial ques-\ntion: Did Wood\u2019s 1995 state petition arrest the one-year\nstatute of limitations period from 1996 until 2004? Id., at\n70a. \u201c[I]t is certainly arguable,\u201d the State then asserted,\n\u201cthat the 1995 postconviction motion was abandoned\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The one-year clock may also be stopped\u2014or \u201ctolled\u201d\u2014for equitable\n\nreasons, notably when an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d prevents a\nprisoner from filing his federal petition on time. See Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). Wood does not contend that the equitable\ntolling doctrine applies to his case. App. 144a, n. 5.\n6                        WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore 1997 and thus did not toll the AEDPA statute of\nlimitations at all.\u201d Ibid. But rather than inviting a deci-\nsion on the statute of limitations question, the State in-\nformed the District Court it would \u201cnot challenge\u201d Wood\u2019s\npetition on timeliness grounds; instead, the State simply\ndefended against Wood\u2019s double jeopardy and Sixth\nAmendment claims on the merits.\n                                B\n   \u201cOrdinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation\nis forfeited if not raised in a defendant\u2019s answer or in\nan amendment thereto.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 202 (citing Fed.\nRules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a)). See also Habeas\nCorpus Rule 5(b) (requiring the State to plead a statute\nof limitations defense in its answer).4 An affirmative\ndefense, once forfeited, is \u201cexclu[ded] from the case,\u201d 5 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71278,\npp. 644\u2013645 (3d ed. 2004), and, as a rule, cannot be as-\nserted on appeal. See Day, 547 U.

Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F. 2d 13,\n22 (CA1 1991) (\u201cIt is hornbook law that theories not raised\nsquarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the\nfirst time on appeal.\u201d).\n   In Granberry v. Greer, we recognized a modest exception\nto the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited\naffirmative defense. 481 U. S., at 134. The District Court\nin Granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the\nmerits. Id., at 130. On appeal, the State argued for the\nfirst time that the petition should be dismissed because\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We note here the distinction between defenses that are \u201cwaived\u201d and\n\nthose that are \u201cforfeited.\u201d A waived claim or defense is one that a party\nhas knowingly and intelligently relinquished; a forfeited plea is one\nthat a party has merely failed to preserve. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443, 458, n. 13 (2004); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 733\n(1993).

See Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) (list-\ning \u201cfailure to exhaust state remedies\u201d as a threshold bar\nto federal habeas relief). Despite the State\u2019s failure to\nraise the nonexhaustion argument in the District Court,\nthe Seventh Circuit accepted the argument and ruled for\nthe State on that ground. We granted certiorari to decide\nwhether a court of appeals has discretion to address a non-\nexhaustion defense that the State failed to raise in the\ndistrict court. Id., at 130.\n   Although \u201cexpress[ing] our reluctance to adopt rules\nthat allow a party to withhold raising a defense until after\nthe \u2018main event\u2019 . . . is over,\u201d id., at 132, we nonetheless\nconcluded that the bar to court of appeals\u2019 consideration of\na forfeited habeas defense is not absolute. Id., at 133. The\nexhaustion doctrine, we noted, is founded on concerns\nbroader than those of the parties; in particular, the doc-\ntrine fosters respectful, harmonious relations between the\nstate and federal judiciaries. Id., at 133\u2013135. With that\ncomity interest in mind, we held that federal appellate\ncourts have discretion, in \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d to consider a\nnonexhaustion argument \u201cinadverten[tly]\u201d overlooked by\nthe State in the District Court. Id., at 132, 134.5\n   In Day, we affirmed a federal district court\u2019s authority\nto consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary\ncircumstances so warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. There, the\nState miscalculated a time span, specifically, the number\nof days running between the finality of Day\u2019s state-court\nconviction and the filing of his federal habeas petition.\nId., at 203. As a result, the State erroneously informed\nthe District Court that Day\u2019s petition was timely. Ibid. A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although our decision in Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129 (1987),\n\ndid not expressly distinguish between forfeited and waived defenses, we\nmade clear in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), that a federal\ncourt has the authority to resurrect only forfeited defenses. See infra,\nat 8\u20139.\n8                    WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMagistrate Judge caught the State\u2019s computation error\nand recommended that the petition be dismissed as un-\ntimely, notwithstanding the State\u2019s timeliness concession.\nId., at 204. The District Court adopted the recommenda-\ntion, and the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s\nsua sponte dismissal of the petition as untimely. Ibid.\n   Concluding that it would make \u201cscant sense\u201d to treat\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations differently from other\nthreshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners, we\nheld \u201cthat district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to\nconsider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s\nhabeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209; ibid. (noting that Habeas\nCorpus Rule 5(b) places \u201c \u2018a statute of limitations\u2019 defense\non a par with \u2018failure to exhaust state remedies, a proce-\ndural bar, [and] non-retroactivity.\u2019 \u201d). Affording federal\ncourts leeway to consider a forfeited timeliness defense\nwas appropriate, we again reasoned, because AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, \u201cim-\nplicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.\u201d Day,\n547 U. S., at 205 (quoting Acosta v. Artuz, 221 F. 3d 117,\n123 (CA2 2000)); 547 U. S., at 205\u2013206 (\u201cThe AEDPA\nstatute of limitation promotes judicial efficiency and con-\nservation of judicial resources, safeguards the accuracy of\nstate court judgments by requiring resolution of constitu-\ntional questions while the record is fresh, and lends final-\nity to state court judgments within a reasonable time.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   We clarified, however, that a federal court does not have\ncarte blanche to depart from the principle of party presen-\ntation basic to our adversary system. See Greenlaw v.\nUnited States, 554 U. S. 237, 243\u2013244 (2008). Only where\nthe State does not \u201cstrategically withh[o]ld the [limita-\ntions] defense or cho[o]se to relinquish it,\u201d and where the\npetitioner is accorded a fair opportunity to present his\nposition, may a district court consider the defense on its\nown initiative and \u201c \u2018determine whether the interests of\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njustice would be better served\u2019 by addressing the merits or\nby dismissing the petition as time barred.\u201d Day, 547 U. S.,\nat 210\u2013211 (quoting Granberry, 481 U. S., at 136; internal\nquotation marks omitted). It would be \u201can abuse of discre-\ntion,\u201d we observed, for a court \u201cto override a State\u2019s delib-\nerate waiver of a limitations defense.\u201d 547 U. S., at 202.\nIn Day\u2019s case itself, we emphasized, the State\u2019s concession\nof timeliness resulted from \u201cinadvertent error,\u201d id., at 211,\nnot from any deliberate decision to proceed straightaway\nto the merits.\n   Consistent with Granberry and Day, we decline to adopt\nan absolute rule barring a court of appeals from rais-\ning, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The\ninstitutional interests served by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limi-\ntations are also present when a habeas case moves to the\ncourt of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with re-\nspect to a nonexhaustion defense. We accordingly hold, in\nresponse to the first question presented, see supra, at 4,\nthat courts of appeals, like district courts, have the au-\nthority\u2014though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited\ntimeliness defense on their own initiative.\n                             C\n  We turn now to the second, case-specific, inquiry. See\nibid. Although a court of appeals has discretion to ad-\ndress, sua sponte, the timeliness of a habeas petition,\nappellate courts should reserve that authority for use in\nexceptional cases. For good reason, appellate courts ordi-\nnarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been\nraised and preserved in the court of first instance. See\nsupra, at 6. That restraint is all the more appropriate\nwhen the appellate court itself spots an issue the parties\ndid not air below, and therefore would not have antici-\npated in developing their arguments on appeal.\n  Due regard for the trial court\u2019s processes and time in-\nvestment is also a consideration appellate courts should\n10                   WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot overlook. It typically takes a district court more\ntime to decide a habeas case on the merits, than it does to\nresolve a petition on threshold procedural grounds. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, R. Hanson &\nH. Daley, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging\nState Court Criminal Convictions 23 (NCJ\u2013155504, 1995)\n(district courts spent an average of 477 days to decide a\nhabeas petition on the merits, and 268 days to resolve\na petition on procedural grounds). When a court of appeals\nraises a procedural impediment to disposition on the mer-\nits, and disposes of the case on that ground, the district\ncourt\u2019s labor is discounted and the appellate court acts\nnot as a court of review but as one of first view.\n   In light of the foregoing discussion of the relevant con-\nsiderations, we hold that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion when it dismissed Wood\u2019s petition as untimely.\nIn the District Court, the State was well aware of the\nstatute of limitations defense available to it and of the\narguments that could be made in support of the defense.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136. Yet the State twice informed the Dis-\ntrict Court that it \u201cwill not challenge, but [is] not conced-\ning\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. See supra, at 3.\nEssentially, the District Court asked the State: Will you\noppose the petition on statute of limitations grounds? The\nState answered: Such a challenge would be supportable,\nbut we won\u2019t make the challenge here.\n   \u201c[W]aiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or aban-\ndonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443, 458, n. 13 (2004) (quoting United States v. Olano, 507\nU. S. 725, 733 (1993)). The State\u2019s conduct in this case fits\nthat description. Its decision not to contest the timeliness\nof Wood\u2019s petition did not stem from an \u201cinadvertent er-\nror,\u201d as did the State\u2019s concession in Day. See 547 U. S.,\nat 211. Rather, the State, after expressing its clear and\naccurate understanding of the timeliness issue, see supra,\nat 5\u20136, deliberately steered the District Court away from\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), the Court\nheld that a federal district court may raise sua sponte a\nforfeited statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus\npetition. Relying on Day and Granberry v. Greer, 481\nU. S. 129 (1987), the Court now holds that a court of ap-\npeals may do the same. Because I continue to think that\nDay was wrongly decided and that Granberry is inappo-\nsite, I cannot join the Court\u2019s opinion. See Day, 547 U. S.,\nat 212\u2013219 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS and BREYER,\nJJ., dissenting).\n   As the dissent in Day explained, the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure apply in habeas corpus cases to the extent\nthat they are consistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,\nthe habeas corpus statute, and the historical practice of\nhabeas proceedings. Id., at 212 (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby,\n545 U. S. 524, 529\u2013530 (2005), and Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U. S. 202, 208 (2003)). As relevant here, the Rules of\nCivil Procedure provide that a defendant forfeits his stat-\nute of limitations defense if he fails to raise it in his an-\nswer or in an amendment thereto. 547 U. S., at 212 (citing\nRules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). That forfeiture rule is fully con-\nsistent with habeas corpus procedure. As an initial mat-\nter, the rule comports with the Habeas Rules\u2019 instruction\n2                     WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat a State \u201cmust\u201d plead any limitations defense in its\nanswer. Id., at 212\u2013213 (quoting Rule 5(b) (emphasis\ndeleted)). Moreover, the rule does not conflict with the\nhabeas statute, which imposes a 1-year period of limita-\ntions without any indication that typical forfeiture rules\ndo not apply. Id., at 213 (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)).\nFinally, the rule does not interfere with historical practice.\nPrior to the enactment of a habeas statute of limitations in\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), habeas practice included no limitations pe-\nriod at all, much less one immune to forfeiture. 547 U. S.,\nat 212.\n   As the dissent in Day further explained, id., at 214,\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is distinguishable from the\nequitable defenses that we have traditionally permitted\nfederal habeas courts to raise sua sponte. See, e.g., Gran-\nberry, supra, at 133 (holding that appellate courts may\nconsider a habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state rem-\nedies despite a State\u2019s forfeiture of the defense). Those\njudicially created defenses were rooted in concerns of com-\nity and finality that arise when federal courts collaterally\nreview state criminal convictions. Day, 547 U. S., at 214.\nBut those same concerns did not lead this Court to recog-\nnize any equitable time bar against habeas petitions. Id.,\nat 214\u2013215. Thus, nothing in this Court\u2019s pre-existing\ndoctrine of equitable defenses supported the Day Court\u2019s\n\u201cdecision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \u2018limita-\ntions period\u2019 of \u00a72244(d) by making it the subject of sua\nsponte dismissal.\u201d Id., at 215\u2013216.\n   For these reasons, I believe that the Day Court was\nwrong to hold that district courts may raise sua sponte\nforfeited statute of limitations defenses in habeas cases. I\ntherefore would not extend Day\u2019s reasoning to proceedings\nin the courts of appeals. Appellate courts, moreover, are\nparticularly ill suited to consider issues forfeited below.\nUnlike district courts, courts of appeals cannot permit a\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nState to amend its answer to add a defense, nor can they\ndevelop the facts that are often necessary to resolve ques-\ntions of timeliness. Cf. id., at 209 (majority opinion) (find-\ning no difference between a district court\u2019s ability to raise\na forfeited limitations defense sua sponte and its ability to\nnotice the State\u2019s forfeiture and permit an amended plead-\ning under Rule of Civil Procedure 15).\n   In light of these considerations, I cannot join the Court\u2019s\nholding that a court of appeals has discretion to consider\nsua sponte a forfeited limitations defense. Nor can I join\nthe Court\u2019s separate holding that the Court of Appeals\nabused its discretion by raising a defense that had been\ndeliberately waived by the State. As the dissent in Day\nnoted, there is no principled reason to distinguish between\nforfeited and waived limitations defenses when determin-\ning whether courts may raise such defenses sua sponte.\nSee 547 U. S., at 218, n. 3 (explaining that, if \u201c \u2018values\nbeyond the concerns of the parties\u2019 \u201d justify sua sponte\nconsideration of forfeited defenses, such values equally\nsupport sua sponte consideration of waived defenses).\nTherefore, I concur only in the judgment.\n",

Argued February 27, 2012\u2014Decided April 24, 2012\nIn 1987, petitioner Patrick Wood was convicted of murder and other\n  crimes by a Colorado court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood\n  filed a federal habeas petition in 2008. After receiving Wood\u2019s peti-\n  tion, the U. S. District Court asked the State if it planned to argue\n  that the petition was untimely. In response, the State twice informed\n  the District Court that it would \u201cnot challenge, but [was] not conced-\n  ing,\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. Thereafter, the District Court\n  rejected Wood\u2019s claims on the merits. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit\n  ordered the parties to brief both the merits and the timeliness of\n  Wood\u2019s petition. After briefing, the court held the petition time\n  barred, concluding that the court had authority to raise timeliness on\n  its own motion, and that the State had not taken the issue off the ta-\n  ble by declining to raise a statute of limitations defense in the Dis-\n  trict Court.\nHeld:\n    1. Courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\u2014\n though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on\n their own initiative in exceptional cases. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (a) \u201cOrdinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is\n forfeited if not raised in a defendant\u2019s answer or in an amendment\n thereto.\u201d Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202. An affirmative de-\n fense, once forfeited, is excluded from the case and, as a rule, cannot\n be asserted on appeal.\n    In Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 133, this Court recognized a\n modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a\n forfeited defense. There, the Seventh Circuit addressed a nonexhaus-\n tion defense the State raised for the first time on appeal. The ex-\n haustion doctrine, this Court noted, is founded on concerns broader\n2                           WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respect-\n    ful, harmonious relations between the state and federal judiciaries.\n    Id., at 133\u2013135. With that comity interest in mind, the Court held\n    that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a nonexhaus-\n    tion argument inadvertently overlooked by the State in the district\n    court. Id. at 132, 134.\n       In Day, the Court affirmed a federal district court\u2019s authority to\n    consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances\n    so warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. The State in Day, having miscalcu-\n    lated a time span, erroneously informed the District Court that Day\u2019s\n    habeas petition was timely. Apprised of the error by a Magistrate\n    Judge, the District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition as un-\n    timely. This Court affirmed, holding that \u201cdistrict courts are permit-\n    ted, but not obliged, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state\n    prisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209. Such leeway was appropri-\n    ate, the Court again reasoned, because AEDPA\u2019s statute of limita-\n    tions, like the exhaustion doctrine, \u201cimplicat[es] values beyond the\n    concerns of the parties.\u201d Id., at 205.\n       The Court clarified, however, that a federal court does not have\n    carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation. See\n    Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 243\u2013244. It would be \u201can\n    abuse of discretion\u201d for a court \u201cto override a State\u2019s deliberate waiv-\n    er of a limitations defense.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 202. In Day itself, the\n    State\u2019s timeliness concession resulted from \u201cinadvertent error,\u201d id., at\n    211, not a deliberate decision to proceed to the merits. Pp. 6\u20139.\n          (b) Consistent with Granberry and Day, the Court declines to\n    adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from raising, on its\n    own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The institutional inter-\n    ests served by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations are also present when\n    a habeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recog-\n    nized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense. P. 9.\n       2. The Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed\n    Wood\u2019s petition as untimely. In the District Court, the State was\n    well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it, and of\n    the arguments that could be made in support of that defense. Yet,\n    the State twice informed the District Court that it would not \u201cchal-\n    lenge\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. In so doing, the State delib-\n    erately waived the statute of limitations defense. In light of that\n    waiver, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Court\u2019s\n    lead and decided the merits of Wood\u2019s petition. Pp. 9\u201311.\n403 Fed.

After state prisoner Patrick\nWood filed a federal habeas corpus petition, the State\ntwice informed the U. S.

Thereafter,\nthe District Court rejected Wood\u2019s claims on the merits.\nOn appeal, the Tenth Circuit directed the parties to brief\nthe question whether Wood\u2019s federal petition was timely.\nPost-briefing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of\nWood\u2019s petition, but solely on the ground that it was\nuntimely.\n  Our precedent establishes that a court may consider a\nstatute of limitations or other threshold bar the State\nfailed to raise in answering a habeas petition.

MILYARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense, and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the\ncourt of first instance? The answer Day instructs is \u201cno\u201d:\nA court is not at liberty, we have cautioned, to bypass,\noverride, or excuse a State\u2019s deliberate waiver of a limita-\ntions defense. Id., at 202, 210, n. 11. The Tenth Circuit,\nwe accordingly hold, abused its discretion by resurrecting\nthe limitations issue instead of reviewing the District\nCourt\u2019s disposition on the merits of Wood\u2019s claims.\n                              I\n  In the course of a 1986 robbery at a pizza shop in a\nColorado town, the shop\u2019s assistant manager was shot and\nkilled. Petitioner Patrick Wood was identified as the per-\npetrator. At a bench trial in January 1987, Wood was\nconvicted of murder, robbery, and menacing, and sen-\ntenced to life imprisonment. The Colorado Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed Wood\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct\nappeal in May 1989, and the Colorado Supreme Court\ndenied Wood\u2019s petition for certiorari five months later.\nWood did not ask this Court to review his conviction in the\n90 days he had to do so.\n  Wood then pursued postconviction relief, asserting con-\nstitutional infirmities in his trial, conviction, and sen-\ntence. Prior to the federal petition at issue here, which\nwas filed in 2008, Wood, proceeding pro se, twice sought\nrelief in state court. First, in 1995, he filed a motion to\nvacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to Colorado\nRule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984).1 He also asked\nthe Colorado trial court to appoint counsel to aid him in\npursuit of the motion. When some months passed with no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984) provides, in rele-\n\nvant part: \u201c[E]very person convicted of a crime is entitled as a matter of\nright to make application for postconviction review upon the groun[d]\n. . . [t]hat the conviction was obtained or sentence imposed in violation\nof the Constitution or laws of the United States or the constitution or\nlaws of this state.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresponsive action, Wood filed a request for a ruling on his\nmotion and accompanying request for counsel. The state\ncourt then granted Wood\u2019s plea for the appointment of\ncounsel, but the record is completely blank on any further\naction regarding the 1995 motion. Second, Wood filed a\nnew pro se motion for postconviction relief in Colorado\ncourt in 2004. On the first page of his second motion, he\nindicated that \u201c[n]o other postconviction proceedings [had\nbeen] filed.\u201d Record in No. 08\u2013cv\u201300247 (D Colo.), Doc.\n15\u20135 (Exh. E), p. 1. The state court denied Wood\u2019s motion\nfour days after receiving it.\n   Wood filed a federal habeas petition in 2008, which the\nDistrict Court initially dismissed as untimely. App. 41a\u2013\n46a. On reconsideration, the District Court vacated the\ndismissal and instructed the State to file a preanswer\nresponse \u201climited to addressing the affirmative defenses of\ntimeliness . . . and/or exhaustion of state court remedies.\u201d\nId., at 64a\u201365a. On timeliness, the State represented in\nits preanswer response: \u201cRespondents will not challenge,\nbut are not conceding, the timeliness of Wood\u2019s [federal]\nhabeas petition.\u201d Id., at 70a. Consistently, in its full an-\nswer to Wood\u2019s federal petition, the State repeated: \u201cRe-\nspondents are not challenging, but do not concede, the\ntimeliness of the petition.\u201d Id., at 87a.\n   Disposing of Wood\u2019s petition, the District Court dis-\nmissed certain claims for failure to exhaust state reme-\ndies, and denied on the merits Wood\u2019s two remaining\nclaims\u2014one alleging a double jeopardy violation and one\nchallenging the validity of Wood\u2019s waiver of his Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial. Id., at 96a\u2013111a. On\nappeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief,\nalong with the merits of Wood\u2019s double jeopardy and Sixth\nAmendment claims, \u201cthe timeliness of Wood\u2019s application\nfor [federal habeas relief].\u201d Id., at 129a. After briefing,\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Wood\u2019s petition\nwithout addressing the merits; instead, the Tenth Circuit\n4                        WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nheld the petition time barred. 403 Fed. Appx. 335 (2010).\nIn so ruling, the Court of Appeals concluded it had author-\nity to raise timeliness on its own motion. Id., at 337, n. 2.\nIt further ruled that the State had not taken that issue off\nthe table by declining to interpose a statute of limitations\ndefense in the District Court. Ibid.\n   We granted review, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to resolve two\nissues: first, whether a court of appeals has the author-\nity to address the timeliness of a habeas petition on the\ncourt\u2019s own initiative;2 second, assuming a court of appeals\nhas such authority, whether the State\u2019s representations to\nthe District Court in this case nonetheless precluded the\nTenth Circuit from considering the timeliness of Wood\u2019s\npetition.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner has\none year to file a federal petition for habeas corpus relief,\nstarting from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration\nof the time for seeking such review.\u201d             28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). For a prisoner whose judgment became\nfinal before AEDPA was enacted, the one-year limitations\nperiod runs from the AEDPA\u2019s effective date: April 24,\n1996. See Serrano v. Williams, 383 F. 3d 1181, 1183\n(CA10 2004). \u201cThe one-year clock is stopped, however,\nduring the time the petitioner\u2019s \u2018properly filed\u2019 application\nfor state postconviction relief \u2018is pending.\u2019 \u201d Day, 547 U. S.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Tenth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that it had authority to raise an\n\nAEDPA statute of limitations defense sua sponte conflicts with the view\nof the Eighth Circuit. Compare 403 Fed. Appx. 335, 337, n. 2 (CA10\n2010) (case below), with Sasser v. Norris, 553 F. 3d 1121, 1128 (CA8\n2009) (\u201cThe discretion to consider the statute of limitations defense\nsua sponte does not extend to the appellate level.\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nat 201 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(2)).3\n   The state judgment against Wood became final on direct\nreview in early 1990. See supra, at 2. Wood\u2019s time for\nfiling a federal petition therefore began to run on the date\nof AEDPA\u2019s enactment, April 24, 1996, and expired on\nApril 24, 1997, unless Wood had a \u201cproperly filed\u201d applica-\ntion for state postconviction relief \u201cpending\u201d in Colorado\nstate court during that period. Wood maintains he had\nsuch an application pending on April 24, 1996: the Rule\n35(c) motion he filed in 1995. That motion, Wood asserts,\nremained pending (thus continuing to suspend the one-\nyear clock) until at least August 2004, when he filed his\nsecond motion for postconviction relief in state court. The\n2004 motion, the State does not contest, was \u201cproperly\nfiled.\u201d Wood argues that this second motion further tolled\nthe limitations period until February 5, 2007, exactly one\nyear before he filed the federal petition at issue here. If\nWood is correct that his 1995 motion remained \u201cpending\u201d\nin state court from April 1996 until August 2004, his\nfederal petition would be timely.\n   In its preanswer response to Wood\u2019s petition, the State\nset forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations\nissue. It noted that Wood\u2019s \u201ctime for filing a habeas peti-\ntion began to run on April 24, 1996, when the AEDPA\nbecame effective\u201d and that Wood \u201chad until April 24, 1997,\nplus any tolling periods, to timely file his habeas petition.\u201d\nApp. 69a\u201370a. The State next identified the crucial ques-\ntion: Did Wood\u2019s 1995 state petition arrest the one-year\nstatute of limitations period from 1996 until 2004? Id., at\n70a. \u201c[I]t is certainly arguable,\u201d the State then asserted,\n\u201cthat the 1995 postconviction motion was abandoned\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The one-year clock may also be stopped\u2014or \u201ctolled\u201d\u2014for equitable\n\nreasons, notably when an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d prevents a\nprisoner from filing his federal petition on time. See Holland v. Flor-\nida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). Wood does not contend that the equitable\ntolling doctrine applies to his case. App. 144a, n. 5.\n6                        WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore 1997 and thus did not toll the AEDPA statute of\nlimitations at all.\u201d Ibid. But rather than inviting a deci-\nsion on the statute of limitations question, the State in-\nformed the District Court it would \u201cnot challenge\u201d Wood\u2019s\npetition on timeliness grounds; instead, the State simply\ndefended against Wood\u2019s double jeopardy and Sixth\nAmendment claims on the merits.\n                                B\n   \u201cOrdinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation\nis forfeited if not raised in a defendant\u2019s answer or in\nan amendment thereto.\u201d Day, 547 U. S., at 202 (citing Fed.\nRules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a)). See also Habeas\nCorpus Rule 5(b) (requiring the State to plead a statute\nof limitations defense in its answer).4 An affirmative\ndefense, once forfeited, is \u201cexclu[ded] from the case,\u201d 5 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71278,\npp. 644\u2013645 (3d ed. 2004), and, as a rule, cannot be as-\nserted on appeal. See Day, 547 U.

Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, 950 F. 2d 13,\n22 (CA1 1991) (\u201cIt is hornbook law that theories not raised\nsquarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the\nfirst time on appeal.\u201d).\n   In Granberry v. Greer, we recognized a modest exception\nto the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited\naffirmative defense. 481 U. S., at 134. The District Court\nin Granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the\nmerits. Id., at 130. On appeal, the State argued for the\nfirst time that the petition should be dismissed because\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We note here the distinction between defenses that are \u201cwaived\u201d and\n\nthose that are \u201cforfeited.\u201d A waived claim or defense is one that a party\nhas knowingly and intelligently relinquished; a forfeited plea is one\nthat a party has merely failed to preserve. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443, 458, n. 13 (2004); United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 733\n(1993). That distinction is key to our decision in Wood\u2019s case.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe petitioner had failed to exhaust relief available in\nstate court. Ibid. See Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) (list-\ning \u201cfailure to exhaust state remedies\u201d as a threshold bar\nto federal habeas relief). Despite the State\u2019s failure to\nraise the nonexhaustion argument in the District Court,\nthe Seventh Circuit accepted the argument and ruled for\nthe State on that ground. We granted certiorari to decide\nwhether a court of appeals has discretion to address a non-\nexhaustion defense that the State failed to raise in the\ndistrict court. Id., at 130.\n   Although \u201cexpress[ing] our reluctance to adopt rules\nthat allow a party to withhold raising a defense until after\nthe \u2018main event\u2019 . . . is over,\u201d id., at 132, we nonetheless\nconcluded that the bar to court of appeals\u2019 consideration of\na forfeited habeas defense is not absolute. Id., at 133. The\nexhaustion doctrine, we noted, is founded on concerns\nbroader than those of the parties; in particular, the doc-\ntrine fosters respectful, harmonious relations between the\nstate and federal judiciaries. Id., at 133\u2013135. With that\ncomity interest in mind, we held that federal appellate\ncourts have discretion, in \u201cexceptional cases,\u201d to consider a\nnonexhaustion argument \u201cinadverten[tly]\u201d overlooked by\nthe State in the District Court. Id., at 132, 134.5\n   In Day, we affirmed a federal district court\u2019s authority\nto consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary\ncircumstances so warrant. 547 U. S., at 201. There, the\nState miscalculated a time span, specifically, the number\nof days running between the finality of Day\u2019s state-court\nconviction and the filing of his federal habeas petition.\nId., at 203. As a result, the State erroneously informed\nthe District Court that Day\u2019s petition was timely. Ibid. A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Although our decision in Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129 (1987),\n\ndid not expressly distinguish between forfeited and waived defenses, we\nmade clear in Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), that a federal\ncourt has the authority to resurrect only forfeited defenses. See infra,\nat 8\u20139.\n8                    WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMagistrate Judge caught the State\u2019s computation error\nand recommended that the petition be dismissed as un-\ntimely, notwithstanding the State\u2019s timeliness concession.\nId., at 204. The District Court adopted the recommenda-\ntion, and the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s\nsua sponte dismissal of the petition as untimely. Ibid.\n   Concluding that it would make \u201cscant sense\u201d to treat\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations differently from other\nthreshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners, we\nheld \u201cthat district courts are permitted, but not obliged, to\nconsider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state prisoner\u2019s\nhabeas petition.\u201d Id., at 209; ibid. (noting that Habeas\nCorpus Rule 5(b) places \u201c \u2018a statute of limitations\u2019 defense\non a par with \u2018failure to exhaust state remedies, a proce-\ndural bar, [and] non-retroactivity.\u2019 \u201d). Affording federal\ncourts leeway to consider a forfeited timeliness defense\nwas appropriate, we again reasoned, because AEDPA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, \u201cim-\nplicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.\u201d Day,\n547 U. S., at 205 (quoting Acosta v. Artuz, 221 F. 3d 117,\n123 (CA2 2000)); 547 U. S., at 205\u2013206 (\u201cThe AEDPA\nstatute of limitation promotes judicial efficiency and con-\nservation of judicial resources, safeguards the accuracy of\nstate court judgments by requiring resolution of constitu-\ntional questions while the record is fresh, and lends final-\nity to state court judgments within a reasonable time.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   We clarified, however, that a federal court does not have\ncarte blanche to depart from the principle of party presen-\ntation basic to our adversary system. See Greenlaw v.\nUnited States, 554 U. S. 237, 243\u2013244 (2008).

S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njustice would be better served\u2019 by addressing the merits or\nby dismissing the petition as time barred.\u201d Day, 547 U. S.,\nat 210\u2013211 (quoting Granberry, 481 U. S., at 136; internal\nquotation marks omitted). It would be \u201can abuse of discre-\ntion,\u201d we observed, for a court \u201cto override a State\u2019s delib-\nerate waiver of a limitations defense.\u201d 547 U. S., at 202.\nIn Day\u2019s case itself, we emphasized, the State\u2019s concession\nof timeliness resulted from \u201cinadvertent error,\u201d id., at 211,\nnot from any deliberate decision to proceed straightaway\nto the merits.\n   Consistent with Granberry and Day, we decline to adopt\nan absolute rule barring a court of appeals from rais-\ning, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense. The\ninstitutional interests served by AEDPA\u2019s statute of limi-\ntations are also present when a habeas case moves to the\ncourt of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with re-\nspect to a nonexhaustion defense. We accordingly hold, in\nresponse to the first question presented, see supra, at 4,\nthat courts of appeals, like district courts, have the au-\nthority\u2014though not the obligation\u2014to raise a forfeited\ntimeliness defense on their own initiative.\n                             C\n  We turn now to the second, case-specific, inquiry. See\nibid. Although a court of appeals has discretion to ad-\ndress, sua sponte, the timeliness of a habeas petition,\nappellate courts should reserve that authority for use in\nexceptional cases. For good reason, appellate courts ordi-\nnarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been\nraised and preserved in the court of first instance. See\nsupra, at 6. That restraint is all the more appropriate\nwhen the appellate court itself spots an issue the parties\ndid not air below, and therefore would not have antici-\npated in developing their arguments on appeal.\n  Due regard for the trial court\u2019s processes and time in-\nvestment is also a consideration appellate courts should\n10                   WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot overlook. It typically takes a district court more\ntime to decide a habeas case on the merits, than it does to\nresolve a petition on threshold procedural grounds. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, R. Hanson &\nH. Daley, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging\nState Court Criminal Convictions 23 (NCJ\u2013155504, 1995)\n(district courts spent an average of 477 days to decide a\nhabeas petition on the merits, and 268 days to resolve\na petition on procedural grounds). When a court of appeals\nraises a procedural impediment to disposition on the mer-\nits, and disposes of the case on that ground, the district\ncourt\u2019s labor is discounted and the appellate court acts\nnot as a court of review but as one of first view.\n   In light of the foregoing discussion of the relevant con-\nsiderations, we hold that the Tenth Circuit abused its\ndiscretion when it dismissed Wood\u2019s petition as untimely.\nIn the District Court, the State was well aware of the\nstatute of limitations defense available to it and of the\narguments that could be made in support of the defense.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136. Yet the State twice informed the Dis-\ntrict Court that it \u201cwill not challenge, but [is] not conced-\ning\u201d the timeliness of Wood\u2019s petition. See supra, at 3.\nEssentially, the District Court asked the State: Will you\noppose the petition on statute of limitations grounds? The\nState answered: Such a challenge would be supportable,\nbut we won\u2019t make the challenge here.\n   \u201c[W]aiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or aban-\ndonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.\n443, 458, n. 13 (2004) (quoting United States v. Olano, 507\nU. S. 725, 733 (1993)). The State\u2019s conduct in this case fits\nthat description. Its decision not to contest the timeliness\nof Wood\u2019s petition did not stem from an \u201cinadvertent er-\nror,\u201d as did the State\u2019s concession in Day. See 547 U. S.,\nat 211.

KEVIN MILYARD,\n\n               WARDEN, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 24, 2012] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n   In Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198 (2006), the Court\nheld that a federal district court may raise sua sponte a\nforfeited statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus\npetition. Relying on Day and Granberry v. Greer, 481\nU. S. 129 (1987), the Court now holds that a court of ap-\npeals may do the same. Because I continue to think that\nDay was wrongly decided and that Granberry is inappo-\nsite, I cannot join the Court\u2019s opinion. See Day, 547 U. S.,\nat 212\u2013219 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS and BREYER,\nJJ., dissenting).\n   As the dissent in Day explained, the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure apply in habeas corpus cases to the extent\nthat they are consistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules,\nthe habeas corpus statute, and the historical practice of\nhabeas proceedings. Id., at 212 (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby,\n545 U. S. 524, 529\u2013530 (2005), and Woodford v. Garceau,\n538 U. S. 202, 208 (2003)). As relevant here, the Rules of\nCivil Procedure provide that a defendant forfeits his stat-\nute of limitations defense if he fails to raise it in his an-\nswer or in an amendment thereto. 547 U. S., at 212 (citing\nRules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)). That forfeiture rule is fully con-\nsistent with habeas corpus procedure. As an initial mat-\nter, the rule comports with the Habeas Rules\u2019 instruction\n2                     WOOD v. MILYARD\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat a State \u201cmust\u201d plead any limitations defense in its\nanswer. Id., at 212\u2013213 (quoting Rule 5(b) (emphasis\ndeleted)). Moreover, the rule does not conflict with the\nhabeas statute, which imposes a 1-year period of limita-\ntions without any indication that typical forfeiture rules\ndo not apply. Id., at 213 (citing 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)).\nFinally, the rule does not interfere with historical practice.\nPrior to the enactment of a habeas statute of limitations in\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), habeas practice included no limitations pe-\nriod at all, much less one immune to forfeiture. 547 U. S.,\nat 212.\n   As the dissent in Day further explained, id., at 214,\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is distinguishable from the\nequitable defenses that we have traditionally permitted\nfederal habeas courts to raise sua sponte. See, e.g., Gran-\nberry, supra, at 133 (holding that appellate courts may\nconsider a habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to exhaust state rem-\nedies despite a State\u2019s forfeiture of the defense). Those\njudicially created defenses were rooted in concerns of com-\nity and finality that arise when federal courts collaterally\nreview state criminal convictions. Day, 547 U. S., at 214.\nBut those same concerns did not lead this Court to recog-\nnize any equitable time bar against habeas petitions. Id.,\nat 214\u2013215. Thus, nothing in this Court\u2019s pre-existing\ndoctrine of equitable defenses supported the Day Court\u2019s\n\u201cdecision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \u2018limita-\ntions period\u2019 of \u00a72244(d) by making it the subject of sua\nsponte dismissal.\u201d Id., at 215\u2013216.\n   For these reasons, I believe that the Day Court was\nwrong to hold that district courts may raise sua sponte\nforfeited statute of limitations defenses in habeas cases. I\ntherefore would not extend Day\u2019s reasoning to proceedings\nin the courts of appeals. Appellate courts, moreover, are\nparticularly ill suited to consider issues forfeited below.\nUnlike district courts, courts of appeals cannot permit a\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nState to amend its answer to add a defense, nor can they\ndevelop the facts that are often necessary to resolve ques-\ntions of timeliness. Cf. id., at 209 (majority opinion) (find-\ning no difference between a district court\u2019s ability to raise\na forfeited limitations defense sua sponte and its ability to\nnotice the State\u2019s forfeiture and permit an amended plead-\ning under Rule of Civil Procedure 15).\n   In light of these considerations, I cannot join the Court\u2019s\nholding that a court of appeals has discretion to consider\nsua sponte a forfeited limitations defense. Nor can I join\nthe Court\u2019s separate holding that the Court of Appeals\nabused its discretion by raising a defense that had been\ndeliberately waived by the State. As the dissent in Day\nnoted, there is no principled reason to distinguish between\nforfeited and waived limitations defenses when determin-\ning whether courts may raise such defenses sua sponte.\nSee 547 U. S., at 218, n. 3 (explaining that, if \u201c \u2018values\nbeyond the concerns of the parties\u2019 \u201d justify sua sponte\nconsideration of forfeited defenses, such values equally\nsupport sua sponte consideration of waived defenses).\nTherefore, I concur only in the judgment.\n</pre>",
