Argued February 28, 2012—Decided April 18, 2012\nWhile visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United\n States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intel-\n ligence officers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Rahim’s\n relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the\n Palestine Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Pro-\n tection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action\n against “[a]n individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing\n committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation. 106\n Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dis-\n missed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPA’s au-\n thorization of suit against “[a]n individual” extended liability only to\n natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District\n of Columbia Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: As used in the TVPA, the term “individual” encompasses only\n natural persons. Consequently, the Act does not impose liability\n against organizations. Pp. 2–11.\n    (a) The ordinary, everyday meaning of “individual” refers to a hu-\n man being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course\n does not employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act defines\n “person” to include certain artificial entities “as well as individuals,”\n 1 U. S. C. §1, thereby marking “individual” as distinct from artificial\n entities. Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an “individ-\n ual” and an organizational entity. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §§92(k), 511.\n And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined “person” in a\n separate Act to include “any individual or entity.” 18 U. S. C.\n2               MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    §2331(3). Pp. 2–5.\n       (b) Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than\n    or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some in-\n    dication that it intended such a result. There are no such indications\n    in the TVPA. To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that\n    Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons\n    alone. The Act’s liability provision uses the word “individual” five\n    times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four\n    times to refer to the victim. See TVPA §2(a). Since only a natural\n    person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult\n    to conclude that Congress used “individual” four times in the same\n    sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural\n    person and any nonsovereign organization. In addition, the TVPA\n    holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to “any person who\n    may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.” See TVPA\n    §2(a)(2). “Persons” often has a broader meaning in the law than “in-\n    dividual,” and frequently includes non-natural persons. Construing\n    “individual” in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits\n    Congress’ use of disparate terms. Pp. 5–6.\n       (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 6–11.\n          (1) Petitioners dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires\n    this Court’s result. First, they rely on definitions that frame “indi-\n    vidual” in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of “oneness,” but\n    these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.\n    Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liabil-\n    ity against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to\n    the legal systems of other nations. But while “Congress is under-\n    stood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory\n    principles,” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S.\n    104, 108, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to sub-\n    ject organizations to liability. Petitioners next argue that the TVPA’s\n    scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal\n    statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or ex-\n    trajudicial killing. But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs\n    the term “individual,” as the TVPA, to describe the covered defend-\n    ant. Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA con-\n    templates liability against officers who do not personally execute the\n    torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act em-\n    braces liability against nonsovereign organizations. Pp. 6–8.\n          (2) Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their\n    broad reading of “individual,” but “reliance on legislative history is\n    unnecessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language.” Mila-\n    vetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. In\n    any event, the history supports this Court’s interpretation. Pp. 8–10.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Moreover, Congress appeared well aware of the limited\n  nature of the cause of action it established in the TVPA.

It does not define “individual.”\n   Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued\nunder the Act—namely, that the Act does not create an\nexception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n1976, 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq., which renders foreign\nsovereigns largely immune from suits in U. S. courts.\nThey argue, however, that the TVPA does not similarly\nrestrict liability against other juridical entities. In peti-\ntioners’ view, by permitting suit against “[a]n individual,”\nthe TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons\nand nonsovereign organizations (a category that, petition-\ners assert, includes respondents). We decline to read\n“individual” so unnaturally. The ordinary meaning of the\nword, fortified by its statutory context, persuades us that\nthe Act authorizes suit against natural persons alone.\n                             A\n  Because the TVPA does not define the term “individual,”\nwe look first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See FCC v.\nAT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When\na statute does not define a term, we typically give the\nphrase its ordinary meaning” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As a noun, “individual” ordinarily means “[a]\nhuman being, a person.” 7 Oxford English Dictionary 880\n(2d ed. 1989); see also, e.g., Random House Dictionary\nof the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (“a person”);\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1152 (1986)\n4          MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(“a particular person”) (hereinafter Webster’s). After all,\nthat is how we use the word in everyday parlance. We say\n“the individual went to the store,” “the individual left\nthe room,” and “the individual took the car,” each time re-\nferring unmistakably to a natural person. And no one, we\nhazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organiza-\ntion as an “individual.” Evidencing that common usage,\nthis Court routinely uses “individual” to denote a natural\nperson, and in particular to distinguish between a natural\nperson and a corporation. See, e.g., Goodyear Dunlop\nTires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. __, __ (2011)\n(slip op., at 7) (“For an individual, the paradigm forum\nfor the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s\ndomicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in\nwhich the corporation is fairly regarded as at home”).\n    Congress does not, in the ordinary course, employ the\nword any differently. The Dictionary Act instructs that\n“[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nunless the context indicates otherwise . . . the wor[d]\n‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associa-\ntions, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock com-\npanies, as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1 (emphasis\nadded). With the phrase “as well as,” the definition marks\n“individual” as distinct from the list of artificial entities\nthat precedes it.\n    In a like manner, federal statutes routinely distinguish\nbetween an “individual” and an organizational entity of\nsome kind. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §92(k) (“ ‘Person’ includes\npartnerships, associations, and corporations, as well as\nindividuals”); §511 (same); 15 U. S. C. §717a (“ ‘Person’\nincludes an individual or a corporation”); 16 U. S. C. §796\n(“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or a corporation”); 8\nU. S. C. §1101(b)(3) (“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or an\norganization”). Indeed, the very same Congress that\nenacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for\nU. S. nationals injured “by reason of an act of interna-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional terrorism” and defined “person” as it appears in\nthe statute to include “any individual or entity capable of\nholding a legal or beneficial interest in property.” Federal\nCourts Administration Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. §§2333(a),\n2331(3) (emphasis added)).\n                             B\n  This is not to say that the word “individual” invariably\nmeans “natural person” when used in a statute. Congress\nremains free, as always, to give the word a broader or\ndifferent meaning. But before we will assume it has done\nso, there must be some indication Congress intended such\na result. Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point\nto only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue\nCode) in which Congress expressly defines “individual” to\ninclude corporate entities. See 26 U. S. C. §542(a)(2). Or\nperhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York,\n524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998), the statutory context makes\nthat intention clear, because any other reading of “indi-\nvidual” would lead to an “ ‘absurd’ ” result Congress could\nnot plausibly have intended.\n  There are no such indications in the TVPA. As noted,\nthe Act does not define “individual,” much less do so in a\nmanner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage.\nAnd the statutory context strengthens—not undermines—\nthe conclusion that Congress intended to create a cause of\naction against natural persons alone. The Act’s liability\nprovision uses the word “individual” five times in the same\nsentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i.e., the defend-\nant) and four times to refer to the victim. See §2(a). Only\na natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial\nkilling. “Since there is a presumption that a given term\nis used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a\npresumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is\nrepeated within a given sentence,” Brown v. Gardner, 513\nU. S. 115, 118 (1994) (citation omitted), it is difficult in-\n6            MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndeed to conclude that Congress employed the term “in-\ndividual” four times in one sentence to refer to a natural\nperson and once to refer to a natural person and any\nnonsovereign organization. See also §3(b)(1) (using term\n“individual” six times in referring to victims of torture).\n  It is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators lia-\nble for extrajudicial killing to “any person who may be a\nclaimant in an action for wrongful death.” §2(a)(2) (em-\nphasis added). “Person,” we have recognized, often has a\nbroader meaning in the law than “individual,” see Clinton,\n524 U. S., at 428, n. 13, and frequently includes nonnatu-\nral persons, see, e.g., 1 U. S. C. §1. We generally seek\nto respect Congress’ decision to use different terms to de-\nscribe different categories of people or things. See Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Our\nconstruction of “individual” to encompass solely natural\npersons credits Congress’ use of the disparate terms;\npetitioners’ construction does not.3\n  In sum, the text of the statute persuades us that the Act\nauthorizes liability solely against natural persons.\n                             III\n\n    Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. \n\n                               A\n   Petitioners first dispute that the plain text of the TVPA\nrequires today’s result. Although they concede that an\nordinary meaning of “individual” is “human being,” peti-\ntioners point to definitions of “individual” that “frame the\nterm . . . in distinctly non-human terms, instead placing\ntheir emphases on the oneness of something.” Brief for\n——————\n  3 The parties debate whether estates, or other nonnatural persons, in\n\nfact may be claimants in a wrongful-death action. We think the debate\nlargely immaterial. Regardless of whether jurisdictions today allow for\nsuch actions, Congress’ use of the broader term evidences an intent to\naccommodate that possibility.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners 18 (citing, e.g., Webster’s 1152 (defining “indi-\nvidual” as “a single or particular being or thing or group\nof being or things”)). Those definitions, however, do not\naccount even for petitioners’ preferred interpretation of “in-\ndividual” in the Act, for foreign states—which petition-\ners concede are not liable under the Act—do not differ\nfrom nonsovereign organizations in their degree of “one-\nness.” Moreover, “[w]ords that can have more than one\nmeaning are given content . . . by their surroundings,”\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n466 (2001), and for the reasons explained supra, petition-\ners’ definition makes for an awkward fit in the context of\nthe TVPA.\n  Petitioners next claim that federal tort statutes uni-\nformly provide for liability against organizations, a con-\nvention they maintain is common to the legal systems of\nother nations. We are not convinced, however, that any\nsuch “domestic and international presumption of organi-\nzational liability” in tort actions overcomes the ordi-\nnary meaning of “individual.” Brief for Petitioners 16. It\nis true that “Congress is understood to legislate against\na background of common-law adjudicatory principles.”\nAstoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104,\n108 (1991). But Congress plainly can override those prin-\nciples, see, e.g., id., at 108–109, and, as explained supra,\nthe TVPA’s text evinces a clear intent not to subject non-\nsovereign organizations to liability.4\n——————\n  4 Petitioners’ separate contention that the TVPA must be construed\n\nin light of international agreements prohibiting torture and extrajudi-\ncial killing fails for similar reasons. Whatever the scope of those agree-\nments, the TVPA does not define “individual” by reference to them,\nand principles they elucidate cannot overcome the statute’s text. The\nsame is true of petitioners’ suggestion that Congress in the TVPA\nimported a “specialized usage” of the word “individual” in international\nlaw. Brief for Petitioners 6. There is no indication in the text of the\nstatute or legislative history that Congress knew of any such special-\nized usage of the term, much less intended to import it into the Act.\n8          MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We also decline petitioners’ suggestion to construe the\nTVPA’s scope of liability to conform with other federal\nstatutes that petitioners contend provide civil remedies to\nvictims of torture or extrajudicial killing. None of the\nthree statutes petitioners identify employs the term “in-\ndividual” to describe the covered defendant, and so none\nassists in the interpretive task we face today. See 42\nU. S. C. §1983; 28 U. S. C. §§1603(a), 1605A(c) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV); 18 U. S. C. §§2333, 2334(a)–(b), 2337. The\nsame is true of the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, so\nit offers no comparative value here regardless of whether\ncorporate entities can be held liable in a federal common-\nlaw action brought under that statute. Compare Doe v.\nExxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11 (CADC 2011), with\nKiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F. 3d 111 (CA2\n2010), cert. granted, 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Finally, al-\nthough petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contem-\nplates liability against officers who do not personally\nexecute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e.g.,\nChavez v. Carranza, 559 F. 3d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not\nfollow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liabil-\nity against nonsovereign organizations. An officer who\ngives an order to torture or kill is an “individual” in that\nword’s ordinary usage; an organization is not.\n                              B\n   Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports\ntheir broad reading of “individual.” But “reliance on legis-\nlative history is unnecessary in light of the statute’s un-\nambiguous language.” Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A.\nv. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2010) (slip op., at\n6, n. 3). In any event, the excerpts petitioners cite do not\nhelp their cause. Petitioners note that the Senate Report\nstates that “[t]he legislation uses the term ‘individual’ to\nmake crystal clear that foreign states or their entities\ncannot be sued under this bill under any circumstances.”\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep. No. 102–249, p. 7 (1991) (S. Rep.); see also H. R.\nRep. No. 102–367, pt. 1, p. 4 (1991) (H. R. Rep.) (“Only\n‘individuals,’ not foreign states, can be sued”). Yet that\nstatement, while clarifying that the Act does not encom-\npass liability against foreign states, says nothing about\nliability against nonsovereign organizations. The other\nexcerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the\nmeaning of “individual,” for they signal only that the Act\ndoes not impose liability on perpetrators who act without\nauthority or color of law of a foreign state. See, e.g., H. R.\nRep., at 5 (“The bill does not attempt to deal with torture\nor killing by purely private groups”); S. Rep., at 8 (The bill\n“does not cover purely private criminal acts by individuals\nor nongovernmental organizations”).\n   Indeed, although we need not rely on legislative history\ngiven the text’s clarity, we note that the history only sup-\nports our interpretation of “individual.” The version of the\nTVPA that was introduced in the 100th Congress estab-\nlished liability against a “person.” Hearing and Markup\non H. R. 1417 before the House Committee on Foreign\nAffairs and Its Subcommittee on Human Rights and\nInternational Organizations, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 82\n(1988). During the markup session of the House Foreign\nAffairs Committee, one of the bill’s sponsors proposed an\namendment “to make it clear we are applying it to indi-\nviduals and not to corporations.” Id., at 81, 87. Counsel\nexplained that it was a “fairly simple” matter “of changing\nthe word ‘person’ to ‘individuals’ in several places in the\nbill.” Id., at 87–88. The amendment was unanimously\nadopted, and the version of the bill reported out of Com-\nmittee reflected the change. Id., at 88; H. R. Rep. No. 693,\npt. 1, p. 1 (1988). A materially identical version of the bill\nwas enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Congress. Although\nwe are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history,\ncf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545\nU. S. 546, 568 (2005), we nevertheless find it telling that\n10         MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sole explanation for substituting “individual” for “per-\nson” confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ final argument is that the Act would be\nrendered toothless by a construction of “individual” that\nlimits liability to natural persons. They contend that pre-\ncluding organizational liability may foreclose effective\nremedies for victims and their relatives for any number of\nreasons. Victims may be unable to identify the men and\nwomen who subjected them to torture, all the while know-\ning the organization for whom they work. Personal juris-\ndiction may be more easily established over corporate than\nhuman beings. And natural persons may be more likely\nthan organizations to be judgment proof. Indeed, we are\ntold that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to re-\ncover successfully against a natural person—one only after\nthe defendant won the state lottery. See Jean v. Dorelien,\n431 F. 3d 776, 778 (CA11 2005).\n   We acknowledge petitioners’ concerns about the limita-\ntions on recovery. But they are ones that Congress im-\nposed and that we must respect. “[N]o legislation pursues\nits purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United States, 480\nU. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam), and petitioners’\npurposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of\nthe plain text. We add only that Congress appeared well\naware of the limited nature of the cause of action it estab-\nlished in the Act. See, e.g., 138 Cong. Rec. 4177 (1992)\n(remarks of Sen. Simpson) (noting that “as a practical\nmatter, this legislation will result in a very small number\nof cases”); 137 Cong. Rec. 2671 (1991) (remarks of Sen.\nSpecter) (“Let me emphasize that the bill is a limited\nmeasure. It is estimated that only a few of these lawsuits\nwill ever be brought”).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Argued February 28, 2012—Decided April 18, 2012\nWhile visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United\n States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intel-\n ligence officers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Rahim’s\n relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the\n Palestine Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Pro-\n tection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action\n against “[a]n individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing\n committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation. 106\n Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dis-\n missed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPA’s au-\n thorization of suit against “[a]n individual” extended liability only to\n natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District\n of Columbia Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: As used in the TVPA, the term “individual” encompasses only\n natural persons. Consequently, the Act does not impose liability\n against organizations. Pp. 2–11.\n    (a) The ordinary, everyday meaning of “individual” refers to a hu-\n man being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course\n does not employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act defines\n “person” to include certain artificial entities “as well as individuals,”\n 1 U. S. C. §1, thereby marking “individual” as distinct from artificial\n entities. Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an “individ-\n ual” and an organizational entity. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §§92(k), 511.\n And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined “person” in a\n separate Act to include “any individual or entity.” 18 U. S. C.\n2               MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    §2331(3). Pp. 2–5.\n       (b) Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than\n    or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some in-\n    dication that it intended such a result. There are no such indications\n    in the TVPA. To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that\n    Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons\n    alone. The Act’s liability provision uses the word “individual” five\n    times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four\n    times to refer to the victim. See TVPA §2(a). Since only a natural\n    person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult\n    to conclude that Congress used “individual” four times in the same\n    sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural\n    person and any nonsovereign organization. In addition, the TVPA\n    holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to “any person who\n    may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.” See TVPA\n    §2(a)(2). “Persons” often has a broader meaning in the law than “in-\n    dividual,” and frequently includes non-natural persons. Construing\n    “individual” in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits\n    Congress’ use of disparate terms. Pp. 5–6.\n       (c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 6–11.\n          (1) Petitioners dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires\n    this Court’s result. First, they rely on definitions that frame “indi-\n    vidual” in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of “oneness,” but\n    these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.\n    Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liabil-\n    ity against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to\n    the legal systems of other nations. But while “Congress is under-\n    stood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory\n    principles,” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S.\n    104, 108, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to sub-\n    ject organizations to liability. Petitioners next argue that the TVPA’s\n    scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal\n    statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or ex-\n    trajudicial killing. But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs\n    the term “individual,” as the TVPA, to describe the covered defend-\n    ant. Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA con-\n    templates liability against officers who do not personally execute the\n    torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act em-\n    braces liability against nonsovereign organizations. Pp. 6–8.\n          (2) Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their\n    broad reading of “individual,” but “reliance on legislative history is\n    unnecessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language.” Mila-\n    vetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. In\n    any event, the history supports this Court’s interpretation. Pp. 8–10.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

It does not define “individual.”\n   Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued\nunder the Act—namely, that the Act does not create an\nexception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n1976, 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq., which renders foreign\nsovereigns largely immune from suits in U. S. courts.\nThey argue, however, that the TVPA does not similarly\nrestrict liability against other juridical entities. In peti-\ntioners’ view, by permitting suit against “[a]n individual,”\nthe TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons\nand nonsovereign organizations (a category that, petition-\ners assert, includes respondents). We decline to read\n“individual” so unnaturally. The ordinary meaning of the\nword, fortified by its statutory context, persuades us that\nthe Act authorizes suit against natural persons alone.\n                             A\n  Because the TVPA does not define the term “individual,”\nwe look first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See FCC v.\nAT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When\na statute does not define a term, we typically give the\nphrase its ordinary meaning” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As a noun, “individual” ordinarily means “[a]\nhuman being, a person.” 7 Oxford English Dictionary 880\n(2d ed. 1989); see also, e.g., Random House Dictionary\nof the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (“a person”);\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1152 (1986)\n4          MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(“a particular person”) (hereinafter Webster’s). After all,\nthat is how we use the word in everyday parlance. We say\n“the individual went to the store,” “the individual left\nthe room,” and “the individual took the car,” each time re-\nferring unmistakably to a natural person. And no one, we\nhazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organiza-\ntion as an “individual.” Evidencing that common usage,\nthis Court routinely uses “individual” to denote a natural\nperson, and in particular to distinguish between a natural\nperson and a corporation. See, e.g., Goodyear Dunlop\nTires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. __, __ (2011)\n(slip op., at 7) (“For an individual, the paradigm forum\nfor the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s\ndomicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in\nwhich the corporation is fairly regarded as at home”).\n    Congress does not, in the ordinary course, employ the\nword any differently. The Dictionary Act instructs that\n“[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,\nunless the context indicates otherwise . . . the wor[d]\n‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associa-\ntions, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock com-\npanies, as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1 (emphasis\nadded). With the phrase “as well as,” the definition marks\n“individual” as distinct from the list of artificial entities\nthat precedes it.\n    In a like manner, federal statutes routinely distinguish\nbetween an “individual” and an organizational entity of\nsome kind. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §92(k) (“ ‘Person’ includes\npartnerships, associations, and corporations, as well as\nindividuals”); §511 (same); 15 U. S. C. §717a (“ ‘Person’\nincludes an individual or a corporation”); 16 U. S. C. §796\n(“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or a corporation”); 8\nU. S. C. §1101(b)(3) (“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or an\norganization”). Indeed, the very same Congress that\nenacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for\nU.

S. C. §§2333(a),\n2331(3) (emphasis added)).\n                             B\n  This is not to say that the word “individual” invariably\nmeans “natural person” when used in a statute. Congress\nremains free, as always, to give the word a broader or\ndifferent meaning. But before we will assume it has done\nso, there must be some indication Congress intended such\na result. Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point\nto only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue\nCode) in which Congress expressly defines “individual” to\ninclude corporate entities. See 26 U. S. C. §542(a)(2). Or\nperhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York,\n524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998), the statutory context makes\nthat intention clear, because any other reading of “indi-\nvidual” would lead to an “ ‘absurd’ ” result Congress could\nnot plausibly have intended.\n  There are no such indications in the TVPA. As noted,\nthe Act does not define “individual,” much less do so in a\nmanner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage.\nAnd the statutory context strengthens—not undermines—\nthe conclusion that Congress intended to create a cause of\naction against natural persons alone. The Act’s liability\nprovision uses the word “individual” five times in the same\nsentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i.e., the defend-\nant) and four times to refer to the victim. See §2(a). Only\na natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial\nkilling. “Since there is a presumption that a given term\nis used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a\npresumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is\nrepeated within a given sentence,” Brown v. Gardner, 513\nU. S. 115, 118 (1994) (citation omitted), it is difficult in-\n6            MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndeed to conclude that Congress employed the term “in-\ndividual” four times in one sentence to refer to a natural\nperson and once to refer to a natural person and any\nnonsovereign organization. See also §3(b)(1) (using term\n“individual” six times in referring to victims of torture).\n  It is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators lia-\nble for extrajudicial killing to “any person who may be a\nclaimant in an action for wrongful death.” §2(a)(2) (em-\nphasis added). “Person,” we have recognized, often has a\nbroader meaning in the law than “individual,” see Clinton,\n524 U. S., at 428, n. 13, and frequently includes nonnatu-\nral persons, see, e.g., 1 U. S. C. §1. We generally seek\nto respect Congress’ decision to use different terms to de-\nscribe different categories of people or things. See Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Our\nconstruction of “individual” to encompass solely natural\npersons credits Congress’ use of the disparate terms;\npetitioners’ construction does not.3\n  In sum, the text of the statute persuades us that the Act\nauthorizes liability solely against natural persons.\n                             III\n\n    Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. \n\n                               A\n   Petitioners first dispute that the plain text of the TVPA\nrequires today’s result. Although they concede that an\nordinary meaning of “individual” is “human being,” peti-\ntioners point to definitions of “individual” that “frame the\nterm . . . in distinctly non-human terms, instead placing\ntheir emphases on the oneness of something.” Brief for\n——————\n  3 The parties debate whether estates, or other nonnatural persons, in\n\nfact may be claimants in a wrongful-death action. We think the debate\nlargely immaterial. Regardless of whether jurisdictions today allow for\nsuch actions, Congress’ use of the broader term evidences an intent to\naccommodate that possibility.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioners 18 (citing, e.g., Webster’s 1152 (defining “indi-\nvidual” as “a single or particular being or thing or group\nof being or things”)). Those definitions, however, do not\naccount even for petitioners’ preferred interpretation of “in-\ndividual” in the Act, for foreign states—which petition-\ners concede are not liable under the Act—do not differ\nfrom nonsovereign organizations in their degree of “one-\nness.” Moreover, “[w]ords that can have more than one\nmeaning are given content . . . by their surroundings,”\nWhitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n466 (2001), and for the reasons explained supra, petition-\ners’ definition makes for an awkward fit in the context of\nthe TVPA.\n  Petitioners next claim that federal tort statutes uni-\nformly provide for liability against organizations, a con-\nvention they maintain is common to the legal systems of\nother nations. We are not convinced, however, that any\nsuch “domestic and international presumption of organi-\nzational liability” in tort actions overcomes the ordi-\nnary meaning of “individual.” Brief for Petitioners 16. It\nis true that “Congress is understood to legislate against\na background of common-law adjudicatory principles.”\nAstoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104,\n108 (1991). But Congress plainly can override those prin-\nciples, see, e.g., id., at 108–109, and, as explained supra,\nthe TVPA’s text evinces a clear intent not to subject non-\nsovereign organizations to liability.4\n——————\n  4 Petitioners’ separate contention that the TVPA must be construed\n\nin light of international agreements prohibiting torture and extrajudi-\ncial killing fails for similar reasons. Whatever the scope of those agree-\nments, the TVPA does not define “individual” by reference to them,\nand principles they elucidate cannot overcome the statute’s text. The\nsame is true of petitioners’ suggestion that Congress in the TVPA\nimported a “specialized usage” of the word “individual” in international\nlaw. Brief for Petitioners 6. There is no indication in the text of the\nstatute or legislative history that Congress knew of any such special-\nized usage of the term, much less intended to import it into the Act.\n8          MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We also decline petitioners’ suggestion to construe the\nTVPA’s scope of liability to conform with other federal\nstatutes that petitioners contend provide civil remedies to\nvictims of torture or extrajudicial killing. None of the\nthree statutes petitioners identify employs the term “in-\ndividual” to describe the covered defendant, and so none\nassists in the interpretive task we face today. See 42\nU. S. C. §1983; 28 U. S. C. §§1603(a), 1605A(c) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV); 18 U. S. C. §§2333, 2334(a)–(b), 2337. The\nsame is true of the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, so\nit offers no comparative value here regardless of whether\ncorporate entities can be held liable in a federal common-\nlaw action brought under that statute. Compare Doe v.\nExxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11 (CADC 2011), with\nKiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F. 3d 111 (CA2\n2010), cert. granted, 565 U. S. ___ (2011). Finally, al-\nthough petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contem-\nplates liability against officers who do not personally\nexecute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e.g.,\nChavez v. Carranza, 559 F. 3d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not\nfollow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liabil-\nity against nonsovereign organizations. An officer who\ngives an order to torture or kill is an “individual” in that\nword’s ordinary usage; an organization is not.\n                              B\n   Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports\ntheir broad reading of “individual.” But “reliance on legis-\nlative history is unnecessary in light of the statute’s un-\nambiguous language.” Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P. A.\nv. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2010) (slip op., at\n6, n. 3). In any event, the excerpts petitioners cite do not\nhelp their cause. Petitioners note that the Senate Report\nstates that “[t]he legislation uses the term ‘individual’ to\nmake crystal clear that foreign states or their entities\ncannot be sued under this bill under any circumstances.”\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep. No. 102–249, p. 7 (1991) (S. Rep.); see also H. R.\nRep. No. 102–367, pt. 1, p. 4 (1991) (H. R. Rep.) (“Only\n‘individuals,’ not foreign states, can be sued”). Yet that\nstatement, while clarifying that the Act does not encom-\npass liability against foreign states, says nothing about\nliability against nonsovereign organizations. The other\nexcerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the\nmeaning of “individual,” for they signal only that the Act\ndoes not impose liability on perpetrators who act without\nauthority or color of law of a foreign state. See, e.g., H. R.\nRep., at 5 (“The bill does not attempt to deal with torture\nor killing by purely private groups”); S. Rep., at 8 (The bill\n“does not cover purely private criminal acts by individuals\nor nongovernmental organizations”).\n   Indeed, although we need not rely on legislative history\ngiven the text’s clarity, we note that the history only sup-\nports our interpretation of “individual.” The version of the\nTVPA that was introduced in the 100th Congress estab-\nlished liability against a “person.” Hearing and Markup\non H. R. 1417 before the House Committee on Foreign\nAffairs and Its Subcommittee on Human Rights and\nInternational Organizations, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 82\n(1988). During the markup session of the House Foreign\nAffairs Committee, one of the bill’s sponsors proposed an\namendment “to make it clear we are applying it to indi-\nviduals and not to corporations.” Id., at 81, 87. Counsel\nexplained that it was a “fairly simple” matter “of changing\nthe word ‘person’ to ‘individuals’ in several places in the\nbill.” Id., at 87–88. The amendment was unanimously\nadopted, and the version of the bill reported out of Com-\nmittee reflected the change. Id., at 88; H. R. Rep. No. 693,\npt. 1, p. 1 (1988). A materially identical version of the bill\nwas enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Congress. Although\nwe are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history,\ncf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545\nU. S. 546, 568 (2005), we nevertheless find it telling that\n10         MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sole explanation for substituting “individual” for “per-\nson” confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.\n                              C\n   Petitioners’ final argument is that the Act would be\nrendered toothless by a construction of “individual” that\nlimits liability to natural persons. They contend that pre-\ncluding organizational liability may foreclose effective\nremedies for victims and their relatives for any number of\nreasons. Victims may be unable to identify the men and\nwomen who subjected them to torture, all the while know-\ning the organization for whom they work. Personal juris-\ndiction may be more easily established over corporate than\nhuman beings. And natural persons may be more likely\nthan organizations to be judgment proof. Indeed, we are\ntold that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to re-\ncover successfully against a natural person—one only after\nthe defendant won the state lottery. See Jean v. Dorelien,\n431 F. 3d 776, 778 (CA11 2005).\n   We acknowledge petitioners’ concerns about the limita-\ntions on recovery. But they are ones that Congress im-\nposed and that we must respect. “[N]o legislation pursues\nits purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United States, 480\nU. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam), and petitioners’\npurposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of\nthe plain text. We add only that Congress appeared well\naware of the limited nature of the cause of action it estab-\nlished in the Act. See, e.g., 138 Cong. Rec. 4177 (1992)\n(remarks of Sen. Simpson) (noting that “as a practical\nmatter, this legislation will result in a very small number\nof cases”); 137 Cong. Rec. 2671 (1991) (remarks of Sen.\nSpecter) (“Let me emphasize that the bill is a limited\nmeasure. It is estimated that only a few of these lawsuits\nwill ever be brought”).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

There\nare no doubt valid arguments for such an extension. But\nCongress has seen fit to proceed in more modest steps in\nthe Act, and it is not the province of this Branch to do\notherwise. The judgment of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

The\nword “individual” is open to multiple interpretations,\npermitting it, linguistically speaking, to include natural\npersons, corporations, and other entities.

See, e.g., ante, at 9 (describ-\ning markup session in which one of the bill’s sponsors\nproposed an amendment containing the word “individual”\nto “make it clear” that the statute applied to “individuals\nand not to corporations”); Hearing on S. 1629 et al. be-\nfore the Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs\nof the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong.,\n2d Sess., 65 (1990) (witness explaining to committee that\nthere would be a “problem” with suing an “independent en-\ntity or a series of entities that are not governments,” such\nas the Palestine Liberation Organization); id., at 75\n(allaying concerns that there will be a flood of lawsuits\n“because of the requirement [in the statute] that an indi-\nvidual has to identify his or her precise torture[r] and they\nhave to be both in the United States”); see also ante, at 8–\n9 (making clear that petitioners’ citations to the legislative\n2          MOHAMAD v.
