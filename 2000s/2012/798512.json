DELIA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10\u20131018. Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 17, 2012\nRespondent Delia, a firefighter employed by the City of Rialto, Califor-\n  nia, missed work after becoming ill on the job. Suspicious of Delia\u2019s\n  extended absence, the City hired a private investigation firm to con-\n  duct surveillance on him. When Delia was seen buying fiberglass in-\n  sulation and other building supplies, the City initiated an internal af-\n  fairs investigation. It hired petitioner Filarsky, a private attorney, to\n  interview Delia. At the interview, which Delia\u2019s attorney and two\n  fire department officials also attended, Delia acknowledged buying\n  the supplies, but denied having done any work on his home. To veri-\n  fy Delia\u2019s claim, Filarsky asked Delia to allow a fire department offi-\n  cial to enter his home and view the unused materials. When Delia\n  refused, Filarsky ordered him to bring the materials out of his home\n  for the official to see. This prompted Delia\u2019s attorney to threaten a\n  civil rights action against the City and Filarsky. Nonetheless, after\n  the interview concluded, officials followed Delia to his home, where\n  he produced the materials.\n     Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 against the City,\n  the Fire Department, Filarsky, and other individuals, alleging that\n  the order to produce the building materials violated his Fourth and\n  Fourteenth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary\n  judgment to the individual defendants on the basis of qualified im-\n  munity. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed with re-\n  spect to all individual defendants except Filarsky, concluding that he\n  was not entitled to seek qualified immunity because he was a private\n  attorney, not a City employee.\nHeld: A private individual temporarily retained by the government to\n carry out its work is entitled to seek qualified immunity from suit\n under \u00a71983. Pp. 4\u221216.\n2                           FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) In determining whether the Court of Appeals made a valid dis-\n    tinction between City employees and Filarsky for qualified immunity\n    purposes, this Court looks to the general principles of tort immunities\n    and defenses applicable at common law, and the reasons the Court\n    has afforded protection from suit under \u00a71983. See Imbler v. Pacht-\n    man, 424 U. S. 409, 418. The common law as it existed in 1871, when\n    Congress enacted \u00a71983, did not draw a distinction between full-time\n    public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in\n    according protection to those carrying out government responsibili-\n    ties. Government at that time was smaller in both size and reach,\n    had fewer responsibilities, and operated primarily at the local level.\n    Government work was carried out to a significant extent by individ-\n    uals who did not devote all their time to public duties, but instead pur-\n    sued private callings as well. In according protection from suit to in-\n    dividuals doing the government\u2019s work, the common law did not draw\n    distinctions based on the nature of a worker\u2019s engagement with the\n    government. Indeed, examples of individuals receiving immunity for\n    actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occa-\n    sional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself. Common\n    law principles of immunity were incorporated into \u00a71983 and should\n    not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent. See Pulliam v. Al-\n    len, 466 U. S. 522, 529. Immunity under \u00a71983 therefore should not\n    vary depending on whether an individual working for the government\n    does so as a permanent or full-time employee, or on some other basis.\n    Pp. 4\u201311.\n       (b) Nothing about the reasons this Court has given for recognizing\n    immunity under \u00a71983 counsels against carrying forward the com-\n    mon law rule. First, the government interest in avoiding \u201cunwarranted\n    timidity\u201d on the part of those engaged in the public\u2019s business\u2014\n    which has been called \u201cthe most important special government im-\n    munity-producing concern,\u201d Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399,\n    409\u2014is equally implicated regardless of whether the individual sued\n    as a state actor works for the government full-time or on some other\n    basis. Second, affording immunity to those acting on the govern-\n    ment\u2019s behalf serves to \u201c \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not de-\n    terred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.\u2019 \u201d\n    Id., at 408. The government, in need of specialized knowledge or ex-\n    pertise, may look outside its permanent workforce to secure the ser-\n    vices of private individuals. But because those individuals are free to\n    choose other work that would not expose them to liability for gov-\n    ernment actions, the most talented candidates might decline public\n    engagements if they did not receive the same immunity enjoyed by\n    their public employee counterparts. Third, the public interest in en-\n    suring performance of government duties free from the distractions\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that can accompany lawsuits is implicated whether those duties are\n  discharged by private individuals or permanent government employ-\n  ees. Finally, distinguishing among those who carry out the public\u2019s\n  business based on their particular relationship with the government\n  creates significant line-drawing problems and can deprive state ac-\n  tors of the ability to \u201c \u2018reasonably anticipate when their conduct may\n  give rise to liability for damages,\u2019 \u201d Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n  635, 646. Pp. 11\u221213.\n    (c) This conclusion is not contrary to Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158,\n  or Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399. Wyatt did not implicate\n  the reasons underlying recognition of qualified immunity because the\n  defendant in that case had no connection to government and pursued\n  purely private ends. Richardson involved the unusual circumstances\n  of prison guards employed by a private company who worked in a\n  privately run prison facility. Nothing of the sort is involved here, or\n  in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist\n  in carrying out its work.

FILARSKY, PETITIONER v. NICHOLAS B.\n\n                    DELIA\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 17, 2012] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Section 1983 provides a cause of action against state\nactors who violate an individual\u2019s rights under federal law.\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. At common law, those who carried out\nthe work of government enjoyed various protections from\nliability when doing so, in order to allow them to serve the\ngovernment without undue fear of personal exposure. Our\ndecisions have looked to these common law protections\nin affording either absolute or qualified immunity to indi-\nviduals sued under \u00a71983. The question in this case is\nwhether an individual hired by the government to do its\nwork is prohibited from seeking such immunity, solely be-\ncause he works for the government on something other\nthan a permanent or full-time basis.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  Nicholas Delia, a firefighter employed by the City of\nRialto, California, became ill while responding to a toxic\nspill in August 2006. Under a doctor\u2019s orders, Delia\nmissed three weeks of work. The City became suspicious\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof Delia\u2019s extended absence, and hired a private investi-\ngation firm to conduct surveillance on him. The private\ninvestigators observed Delia purchasing building supplies\u2014\nincluding several rolls of fiberglass insulation\u2014from a\nhome improvement store. The City surmised that Delia\nwas missing work to do construction on his home rather\nthan because of illness, and it initiated a formal internal\naffairs investigation of him.\n   Delia was ordered to appear for an administrative in-\nvestigation interview. The City hired Steve Filarsky to\nconduct the interview. Filarsky was an experienced employ-\nment lawyer who had previously represented the City in\nseveral investigations. Delia and his attorney attended\nthe interview, along with Filarsky and two fire depart-\nment officials, Mike Peel and Frank Bekker. During the\ninterview, Filarsky questioned Delia about the building sup-\nplies. Delia acknowledged that he had purchased the\nsupplies, but claimed that he had not yet done the work on\nhis home.\n   During a break, Filarsky met with Peel, Bekker, and\nFire Chief Stephen Wells. Filarsky proposed resolving the\ninvestigation by verifying Delia\u2019s claim that he had not\ndone any work on his home. To do so, Filarsky recom-\nmended asking Delia to produce the building materials.\nChief Wells approved the plan.\n   When the meeting resumed, Filarsky requested permis-\nsion for Peel to enter Delia\u2019s home to view the materials.\nOn the advice of counsel, Delia refused. Filarsky then\nasked Delia if he would be willing to bring the materials\nout onto his lawn, so that Peel could observe them without\nentering his home. Delia again refused to consent. Un-\nable to obtain Delia\u2019s cooperation, Filarsky ordered him to\nproduce the materials for inspection.\n   Delia\u2019s counsel objected to the order, asserting that it\nwould violate the Fourth Amendment. When that objec-\ntion proved unavailing, Delia\u2019s counsel threatened to sue\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe City. He went on to tell Filarsky that \u201c[w]e might\nquite possibly find a way to figure if we can name you Mr.\nFilarsky. . . . If you want to take that chance, you go right\nahead.\u201d App. 131\u2013132. The threat was repeated over and\nover: \u201c[E]verybody is going to get named, and they are\ngoing to sweat it out as to whether or not they have indi-\nvidual liability . . . .\u201d \u201c[Y]ou order him and you will be\nnamed and that is not an idle threat.\u201d \u201cWhoever issues\nthat order is going to be named in the lawsuit.\u201d \u201c[W]e will\nseek any and all damages including individual liability . . . .\n[W]e are coming if you order this.\u201d \u201c[M]ake sure the spell-\ning is clear [in the order] so we know who to sue.\u201d Id.,\nat 134\u2013136, 148\u2013149. Despite these threats, Filarsky\nprepared an order directing Delia to produce the materi-\nals, which Chief Wells signed.\n   As soon as the interview concluded, Peel and Bekker\nfollowed Delia to his home. Once there, Delia, his attor-\nney, and a union representative went into Delia\u2019s house,\nbrought out the four rolls of insulation, and placed them\non Delia\u2019s lawn. Peel and Bekker, who remained in their\ncar during this process, thanked Delia for showing them\nthe insulation and drove off.\n                            B\n  Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 against\nthe City, its Fire Department, Chief Wells, Peel, Bekker,\nFilarsky, and ten unidentified individuals, alleging that\nthe order to produce the building materials violated his\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment to all the\nindividual defendants, concluding that they were pro-\ntected by qualified immunity. The court held that Delia\nhad \u201cnot demonstrated a violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right,\u201d because \u201cDelia was not threatened\nwith insubordination or termination if he did not comply\nwith any order given and none of these defendants entered\n4                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[his] house.\u201d Delia v. Rialto, No. CV 08\u201303359 (CD Cal.,\nMar. 9, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 42, 48.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nwith respect to all defendants except Filarsky. The Court\nof Appeals concluded that the order violated the Fourth\nAmendment, but agreed with the District Court that Delia\n\u201cha[d] not demonstrated that a constitutional right was\nclearly established as of the date of Chief Wells\u2019s order,\nsuch that defendants would have known that their actions\nwere unlawful.\u201d Delia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1079\n(2010). As to Filarsky, however, the court concluded that\nbecause he was a private attorney and not a City employ-\nee, he was not entitled to seek the protection of qualified\nimmunity. Id., at 1080\u20131081. The court noted that its\ndecision conflicted with a decision of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit, see Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F. 3d\n301, 310 (1997), but considered itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent and therefore \u201cnot free to follow the Cullinan\ndecision.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at 1080 (citing Gonzalez v. Spencer,\n336 F. 3d 832 (CA9 2003)).\n  Filarsky filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted.\n564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  Section 1983 provides a cause of action against any\nperson who deprives an individual of federally guaranteed\nrights \u201cunder color\u201d of state law. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Any-\none whose conduct is \u201cfairly attributable to the state\u201d can\nbe sued as a state actor under \u00a71983. See Lugar v. Ed-\nmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 937 (1982). At common\nlaw, government actors were afforded certain protections\nfrom liability, based on the reasoning that \u201cthe public good\ncan best be secured by allowing officers charged with the\nduty of deciding upon the rights of others, to act upon\ntheir own free, unbiased convictions, uninfluenced by any\napprehensions.\u201d Wasson v. Mitchell, 18 Iowa 153, 155\u2013156\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1864) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also W.\nProsser, Law of Torts \u00a725, p. 150 (1941) (common law\nprotections derived from the need to avoid the \u201cimpossible\nburden [that] would fall upon all our agencies of govern-\nment\u201d if those acting on behalf of the government were\n\u201cunduly hampered and intimidated in the discharge of\ntheir duties\u201d by a fear of personal liability). Our decisions\nhave recognized similar immunities under \u00a71983, reason-\ning that common law protections \u201c \u2018well grounded in his-\ntory and reason\u2019 had not been abrogated \u2018by covert inclusion\nin the general language\u2019 of \u00a71983.\u201d Imbler v. Pachtman,\n424 U. S. 409, 418 (1976) (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove,\n341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951)).\n   In this case, there is no dispute that qualified immunity\nis available for the sort of investigative activities at issue.\nSee Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 243\u2013244 (2009).\nThe Court of Appeals granted this protection to Chief\nWells, Peel, and Bekker, but denied it to Filarsky, because\nhe was not a public employee but was instead a private\nindividual \u201cretained by the City to participate in internal\naffairs investigations.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at 1079\u20131080. In de-\ntermining whether this distinction is valid, we look to the\n\u201cgeneral principles of tort immunities and defenses\u201d appli-\ncable at common law, and the reasons we have afforded\nprotection from suit under \u00a71983. Imbler, supra, at 418.\n                              A\n  Under our precedent, the inquiry begins with the com-\nmon law as it existed when Congress passed \u00a71983 in\n1871. Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984). Under-\nstanding the protections the common law afforded to those\nexercising government power in 1871 requires an appreci-\nation of the nature of government at that time. In the\nmid-nineteenth century, government was smaller in both\nsize and reach. It had fewer responsibilities, and operated\nprimarily at the local level. Local governments faced tight\n6                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbudget constraints, and generally had neither the need\nnor the ability to maintain an established bureaucracy\nstaffed by professionals. See B. Campbell, The Growth of\nAmerican Government: Governance From the Cleveland\nEra to the Present 14\u201316, 20\u201321 (1995); id., at 20 (noting\nthat in the 1880s \u201c[t]he governor\u2019s office staff in Wisconsin\n. . . totaled five workers if we count the lieutenant gover-\nnor and the janitor\u201d).\n    As one commentator has observed, there was at that\ntime \u201cno very clear conception of a professional office, that\nis, an office the incumbent of which devotes his entire time\nto the discharge of public functions, who has no other\noccupation, and who receives a sufficiently large compen-\nsation to enable him to live without resorting to other\nmeans.\u201d F. Goodnow, Principles of the Administrative\nLaw of the United States 227 (1905). Instead, to a signifi-\ncant extent, government was \u201cadministered by members of\nsociety who temporarily or occasionally discharge[d] public\nfunctions.\u201d Id., at 228. Whether government relied pri-\nmarily upon professionals or occasional workers obviously\nvaried across the country and across different government\nfunctions. But even at the turn of the twentieth century,\na public servant was often one who \u201cdoes not devote his\nentire time to his public duties, but is, at the same time\nthat he is holding public office, permitted to carry on some\nother regular business, and as a matter of fact finds his\nmain means of support in such business or in his private\nmeans since he receives from his office a compensation\ninsufficient to support him.\u201d Id., at 227.\n    Private citizens were actively involved in government\nwork, especially where the work most directly touched the\nlives of the people. It was not unusual, for example, to see\nthe owner of the local general store step behind a window\nin his shop to don his postman\u2019s hat. See, e.g., Stole\nStamps, Maysville, KY, The Evening Bulletin, p. 1, Sept.\n25, 1895 (reporting that \u201c[t]he post office and general store\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat Mount Hope was broken into,\u201d resulting in the loss of\n$400 worth of cutlery and stamps). Nor would it have\nbeen a surprise to find, on a trip to the docks, the local\nferryman collecting harbor fees as public wharfmaster.\nSee 3 E. Johnson, A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians\n1346 (1912).\n  Even such a core government activity as criminal prose-\ncution was often carried out by a mixture of public em-\nployees and private individuals temporarily serving the\npublic. At the time \u00a71983 was enacted, private lawyers\nwere regularly engaged to conduct criminal prosecutions\non behalf of the State. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gibbs,\n70 Mass. 146 (1855); White v. Polk County, 17 Iowa 413\n(1864). Abraham Lincoln himself accepted several such\nappointments. See, e.g., An Awful Crime and Speedy\nPunishment, Springfield Daily Register, May 14, 1853\n(reporting that \u201cA. Lincoln, esq. was appointed prosecutor\u201d\nin a rape case). In addition, private lawyers often assisted\npublic prosecutors in significant cases. See, e.g., Com-\nmonwealth v. Knapp, 10 Mass. 477, 490\u2013491 (1830);\nChambers v. State, 22 Tenn. 237 (1842). And public prose-\ncutors themselves continued to represent private clients\nwhile in office\u2014sometimes creating odd conflicts of inter-\nest. See People v. Bussey, 82 Mich. 49, 46 N. W. 97, 98\n(1890) (public prosecutor employed as private counsel by\nthe defendant\u2019s wife in several civil suits against the\ndefendant); Phillip v.

DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Attorney General of the United States was expected to\nand did maintain an active private law practice. To cite a\nnotable illustration, in Hayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792),\nthe first Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, sought a\nwrit of mandamus from this Court to compel a lower court\nto hear William Hayburn\u2019s petition to be put on the pen-\nsion list. When this Court did not allow the Attorney\nGeneral to seek the writ in his official capacity, Randolph\nreadily solved the problem by arguing the case as Hay-\nburn\u2019s private lawyer. Ibid.; see also Letter from Edmund\nRandolph to James Madison (Aug. 12, 1792), reprinted in\n14 The Papers of James Madison 348, 349 (R. Rutland,\nT. Mason, R. Brugger, J. Sisson, & F. Teute eds. 1983);\nBloch, The Early Role of the Attorney General in Our\nConstitutional Scheme: In the Beginning There Was\nPragmatism, 1989 Duke L. J. 561, 598\u2013599, n. 121, 619.\n   Given all this, it should come as no surprise that the\ncommon law did not draw a distinction between public\nservants and private individuals engaged in public service\nin according protection to those carrying out government\nresponsibilities. Government actors involved in adjudica-\ntive activities, for example, were protected by an absolute\nimmunity from suit. See Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335,\n347\u2013348 (1872); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Non-\nContract Law \u00a7781 (1889). This immunity applied equally\nto \u201cthe highest judge in the State or nation\u201d and \u201cthe\nlowest officer who sits as a court and tries petty causes,\u201d\nT. Cooley, Law of Torts 409 (1879), including those who\nserved as judges on a part-time or episodic basis. Justices\nof the peace, for example, often maintained active private\nlaw practices (or even had nonlegal livelihoods), and gen-\nerally served in a judicial capacity only part-time. See\nHubbell v. Harbeck, 54 Hun. 147, 7 N. Y. S. 243 (1889);\nIngraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847). In fact, justices of\nthe peace were not even paid a salary by the government,\nbut instead received compensation through fees payable\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby the parties that came before them. See W. Murfee, The\nJustice of the Peace \u00a71145 (1886). Yet the common law\nextended the same immunity \u201cto a justice of the peace as\nto any other judicial officer.\u201d Pratt v. Gardner, 56 Mass.\n63, 70 (1848); see also Mangold v. Thorpe, 33 N. J. L. 134,\n137\u2013138 (1868).\n   The common law also extended certain protections to\nindividuals engaged in law enforcement activities, such as\nsheriffs and constables. At the time \u00a71983 was enacted,\nhowever, \u201c[t]he line between public and private policing\nwas frequently hazy. Private detectives and privately em-\nployed patrol personnel often were publicly appointed\nas special policemen, and the means and objects of detec-\ntive work, in particular, made it difficult to distinguish\nbetween those on the public payroll and private detec-\ntives.\u201d Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. Rev.\n1165, 1210 (1999) (footnotes and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The protections provided by the common law did\nnot turn on whether someone we today would call a police\nofficer worked for the government full-time or instead\nfor both public and private employers. Rather, at common\nlaw, \u201c[a] special constable, duly appointed according to\nlaw, ha[d] all the powers of a regular constable so far as\nmay be necessary for the proper discharge of the special\nduties intrusted to him, and in the lawful discharge of\nthose duties, [was] as fully protected as any other officer.\u201d\nW. Murfee, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other\nMinisterial Officers \u00a71121, p. 609 (1884).\n   Sheriffs executing a warrant were empowered by the\ncommon law to enlist the aid of the able-bodied men of the\ncommunity in doing so. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 332 (1765); In re Quarles,\n158 U. S. 532, 535 (1895). While serving as part of\nthis \u201cposse comitatus,\u201d a private individual had the same\nauthority as the sheriff, and was protected to the same\nextent. See, e.g., Robinson v. State, 93 Ga. 77, 18 S. E.\n10                   FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1018, 1019 (1893) (\u201cA member of a posse comitatus sum-\nmoned by the sheriff to aid in the execution of a warrant\nfor a felony in the sheriff \u2019s hands is entitled to the same\nprotection in the discharge of his duties as the sheriff\nhimself \u201d); State v. Mooring, 115 N. C. 709, 20 S. E. 182\n(1894) (considering it \u201cwell settled by the courts\u201d that a\nsheriff may break open the doors of a house to execute a\nsearch warrant and that \u201cif he act in good faith in doing\nso, both he and his posse comitatus will be protected\u201d);\nNorth Carolina v. Gosnell, 74 F. 734, 738\u2013739 (CC WDNC\n1896) (\u201cBoth judicial and ministerial officers, in the execu-\ntion of the duties of their office, are under the strong\nprotection of the law; and their legally summoned assis-\ntants, for such time as in service, are officers of the law\u201d);\nReed v.

See, e.g., Gregory v. Brooks, 37 Conn. 365,\n372 (1870) (public wharfmaster not liable for ordering re-\nmoval of a vessel unless the order was issued maliciously);\nHenderson v. Smith, 26 W.

Allen,\n466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Under this assumption, immu-\nnity under \u00a71983 should not vary depending on whether\nan individual working for the government does so as a\nfull-time employee, or on some other basis.\n                              B\n   Nothing about the reasons we have given for recognizing\nimmunity under \u00a71983 counsels against carrying forward\nthe common law rule. As we have explained, such immu-\nnity \u201cprotect[s] government\u2019s ability to perform its tradi-\ntional functions.\u201d Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167 (1992).\nIt does so by helping to avoid \u201cunwarranted timidity\u201d in\nperformance of public duties, ensuring that talented can-\ndidates are not deterred from public service, and prevent-\ning the harmful distractions from carrying out the work of\ngovernment that can often accompany damages suits.\nRichardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 409\u2013411 (1997).\n   We have called the government interest in avoiding\n\u201cunwarranted timidity\u201d on the part of those engaged in the\npublic\u2019s business \u201cthe most important special government\nimmunity-producing concern.\u201d Id., at 409. Ensuring that\nthose who serve the government do so \u201cwith the decisive-\nness and the judgment required by the public good,\u201d\nScheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 240 (1974), is of vital\nimportance regardless whether the individual sued as a\nstate actor works full-time or on some other basis.\n   Affording immunity not only to public employees but\n12                  FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso to others acting on behalf of the government similarly\nserves to \u201c \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not de-\nterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public\nservice.\u2019 \u201d Richardson, supra, at 408 (quoting Wyatt, su-\npra, at 167). The government\u2019s need to attract talented\nindividuals is not limited to full-time public employees.\nIndeed, it is often when there is a particular need for\nspecialized knowledge or expertise that the government\nmust look outside its permanent work force to secure the\nservices of private individuals. This case is a good exam-\nple: Filarsky had 29 years of specialized experience as an\nattorney in labor, employment, and personnel matters,\nwith particular expertise in conducting internal affairs\ninvestigations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59, 89; App. 156.\nThe City of Rialto certainly had no permanent employee\nwith anything approaching those qualifications. To the\nextent such private individuals do not depend on the\ngovernment for their livelihood, they have freedom to\nselect other work\u2014work that will not expose them to\nliability for government actions. This makes it more likely\nthat the most talented candidates will decline public en-\ngagements if they do not receive the same immunity en-\njoyed by their public employee counterparts.\n   Sometimes, as in this case, private individuals will\nwork in close coordination with public employees, and face\nthreatened legal action for the same conduct. See App.\n134 (Delia\u2019s lawyer: \u201ceverybody is going to get named\u201d in\nthreatened suit). Because government employees will\noften be protected from suit by some form of immunity,\nthose working alongside them could be left holding the\nbag\u2014facing full liability for actions taken in conjunction\nwith government employees who enjoy immunity for the\nsame activity. Under such circumstances, any private\nindividual with a choice might think twice before accept-\ning a government assignment.\n   The public interest in ensuring performance of govern-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment duties free from the distractions that can accompany\neven routine lawsuits is also implicated when individuals\nother than permanent government employees discharge\nthese duties. See Richardson, supra, at 411. Not only will\nsuch individuals\u2019 performance of any ongoing government\nresponsibilities suffer from the distraction of lawsuits, but\nsuch distractions will also often affect any public employ-\nees with whom they work by embroiling those employees\nin litigation. This case is again a good example: If the suit\nagainst Filarsky moves forward, it is highly likely that\nChief Wells, Bekker, and Peel will all be required to tes-\ntify, given their roles in the dispute. Allowing suit under\n\u00a71983 against private individuals assisting the govern-\nment will substantially undermine an important reason\nimmunity is accorded public employees in the first place.\n   Distinguishing among those who carry out the public\u2019s\nbusiness based on the nature of their particular relation-\nship with the government also creates significant line-\ndrawing problems. It is unclear, for example, how Fil-\narsky would be categorized if he regularly spent half his\ntime working for the City, or worked exclusively on one\nCity project for an entire year. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201336.\nSuch questions deprive state actors of the ability to \u201crea-\nsonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to\nliability for damages,\u201d Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 646 (1987) (alteration and internal quotation marks\nomitted), frustrating the purposes immunity is meant to\nserve. An uncertain immunity is little better than no\nimmunity at all.\n                            III\n  Our decisions in Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158 (1992), and\nRichardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997), are not to\nthe contrary. In Wyatt, we held that individuals who used\na state replevin law to compel the local sheriff to seize\ndisputed property from a former business partner were\n14                   FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot entitled to seek qualified immunity. Cf. Lugar, 457\nU. S. 922 (holding that an individual who uses a state\nreplevin, garnishment, or attachment statute later de-\nclared to be unconstitutional acts under color of state law\nfor purposes of \u00a71983). We explained that the reasons\nunderlying recognition of qualified immunity did not sup-\nport its extension to individuals who had no connection\nto government and pursued purely private ends. Because\nsuch individuals \u201chold no office requiring them to exercise\ndiscretion; nor are they principally concerned with en-\nhancing the public good,\u201d we concluded that extending\nimmunity to them would \u201chave no bearing on whether\npublic officials are able to act forcefully and decisively in\ntheir jobs or on whether qualified applicants enter public\nservice.\u201d 504 U. S., at 168.\n   Wyatt is plainly not implicated by the circumstances of\nthis case. Unlike the defendants in Wyatt, who were us-\ning the mechanisms of government to achieve their own\nends, individuals working for the government in pursuit of\ngovernment objectives are \u201cprincipally concerned with en-\nhancing the public good.\u201d Ibid. Whether such individ-\nuals have assurance that they will be able to seek protec-\ntion if sued under \u00a71983 directly affects the government\u2019s\nability to achieve its objectives through their public ser-\nvice. Put simply, Wyatt involved no government agents,\nno government interests, and no government need for\nimmunity.\n   In Richardson, we considered whether guards employed\nby a privately run prison facility could seek the protection\nof qualified immunity. Although the Court had previously\ndetermined that public-employee prison guards were\nentitled to qualified immunity, see Procunier v. Navarette,\n434 U. S. 555 (1978), it determined that prison guards\nemployed by a private company and working in a privately\nrun prison facility did not enjoy the same protection. We\nexplained that the various incentives characteristic of the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate market in that case ensured that the guards would\nnot perform their public duties with unwarranted timidity\nor be deterred from entering that line of work. 521 U. S.,\nat 410\u2013411.\n  Richardson was a self-consciously \u201cnarrow[ ]\u201d decision.\nId., at 413 (\u201c[W]e have answered the immunity question\nnarrowly, in the context in which it arose\u201d). The Court\nmade clear that its holding was not meant to foreclose all\nclaims of immunity by private individuals. Ibid. Instead,\nthe Court emphasized that the particular circumstances of\nthat case\u2014\u201ca private firm, systematically organized to\nassume a major lengthy administrative task (managing an\ninstitution) with limited direct supervision by the govern-\nment, undertak[ing] that task for profit and potentially\nin competition with other firms\u201d\u2014combined sufficiently to\nmitigate the concerns underlying recognition of govern-\nmental immunity under \u00a71983. Ibid. Nothing of the sort\nis involved here, or in the typical case of an individual\nhired by the government to assist in carrying out its work.\n                          *    *    *\n   A straightforward application of the rule set out above\nis sufficient to resolve this case. Though not a public em-\nployee, Filarsky was retained by the City to assist in\nconducting an official investigation into potential wrong-\ndoing. There is no dispute that government employees\nperforming such work are entitled to seek the protection\nof qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals rejected\nFilarsky\u2019s claim to the protection accorded Wells, Bekker,\nand Peel solely because he was not a permanent, full-time\nemployee of the City. The common law, however, did not\ndraw such distinctions, and we see no justification for\ndoing so under \u00a71983.\n   New York City has a Department of Investigation\nstaffed by full-time public employees who investigate city\npersonnel, and the resources to pay for it. The City of\n16                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRialto has neither, and so must rely on the occasional\nservices of private individuals such as Mr. Filarsky. There\nis no reason Rialto\u2019s internal affairs investigator should be\ndenied the qualified immunity enjoyed by the ones who\nwork for New York.\n   In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals denying qualified immunity to Filarsky is\nreversed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. \u00a71983 alleging a constitutional\nviolation committed in the course of the investigation? I\nagree that the answer is yes and that the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals holding private attorney Filarsky\ncategorically ineligible for qualified immunity must be re-\nversed. Qualified immunity may be overcome, however, if\nthe defendant knew or should have known that his con-\nduct violated a right \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of\nthe episode in suit. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.\n800, 818 (1982). Because the Ninth Circuit did not con-\nsider the application of that standard to Filarsky, the\nmatter, as I see it, may be pursued on remand.\n  Filarsky was retained by the City of Rialto to investi-\ngate whether city firefighter Delia was taking time off\nfrom work under the false pretense of a disabling physical\ncondition. In pursuit of the investigation, Filarsky asked\nDelia to consent to a search of his home to determine what\nDelia had done with several rolls of insulation he had\nrecently purchased at a home improvement store. When\nDelia, on counsel\u2019s advice, refused to consent to the search,\nFilarsky \u201chatch[ed] a plan\u201d to overcome Delia\u2019s resistance.\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nDelia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1077 (CA9 2010). \u201c[W]e\nwill do it a different way,\u201d Filarsky informed Delia. App.\n129; see 621 F. 3d, at 1077 (\u201cUnable to obtain Delia\u2019s\nconsent to a warrantless search of his house . . . , Filarsky\ntried a different tactic.\u201d).\n   Following Filarsky\u2019s advice, Fire Chief Wells ordered\nDelia to bring the insulation out of his house and place the\nrolls on his lawn for inspection. App. 158. Filarsky rec-\nommended this course, the Ninth Circuit observed, mind-\nful that \u201can individual does not have an expectation of\nprivacy in items exposed to the public, thereby eliminating\nthe need for a search warrant.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at 1077. Delia\ncomplied with Chief Wells\u2019s order by producing the rolls,\nall of them unused, App. 78, 85, after which the investi-\ngation into the legitimacy of Delia\u2019s absence from work\napparently ended.\n   In explaining why the individual defendants other than\nFilarsky were entitled to summary judgment on their\nqualified immunity pleas, the Ninth Circuit stated that\n\u201cno . . . threat to [Delia\u2019s] employment\u201d attended Fire\nChief Wells\u2019s order. 621 F. 3d, at 1079. The District\nCourt similarly stated that \u201cDelia was not threatened with\ninsubordination or termination if he did not comply with\n[the] order.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48.\n   These statements are at odds with the facts, as re-\ncounted by the Court of Appeals. \u201cAt the onset of the in-\nterview,\u201d the Ninth Circuit stressed, \u201cFilarsky warned Delia\nthat he was obligated to fully cooperate,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f at\nany time it is deemed you are not cooperating then you\ncan be held to be insubordinate and subject to disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at\n1072 (internal quotation marks omitted). Continuing in\nthis vein, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cDelia\u2019s\nactions were involuntary and coerced by the direct threat\nof sanctions including loss of his firefighter position.\u201d Id.,\nat 1077; see id., at 1085 (\u201cDelia\u2019s actions were involun-\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

First, if\nit is \u201cclearly established,\u201d as the Ninth Circuit thought it\nwas, that \u201cthe warrantless search of a home is presump-\ntively unreasonable,\u201d id., at 1075, and that a well-trained\ninvestigating officer would so comprehend,1 may an official\ncircumvent the warrant requirement by ordering the per-\nson under investigation to cart his personal property out\nof the house for inspection?2 And if it is \u201cclearly estab-\nlished\u201d that an employee may not be fired for exercising a\nconstitutional right, see id., at 1079,3 is it not equally\nplain that discipline or discharge may not be threatened to\ninduce surrender of such a right?\n   In short, the Court has responded appropriately to the\nquestion tendered for our review, but the Circuit\u2019s law will\nremain muddled absent the Court of Appeals\u2019 focused\nattention to the question whether Filarsky\u2019s conduct\nviolated \u201cclearly established\u201d law.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Delia also suggests that Filarsky\u2019s conduct should be measured\n\nagainst a \u201creasonable attorney\u201d standard: whether an attorney provid-\ning advice in a public-employee investigation should have known that\nthe search of Delia\u2019s personal property, stored in his home, would be\nlawless.

I agree\nwith and join today\u2019s opinion holding that this distinction\nis not a sound basis on which to deny immunity.\n   I add only that it does not follow that every private\nindividual who works for the government in some capacity\nnecessarily may claim qualified immunity when sued\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Such individuals must satisfy\nour usual test for conferring immunity. As the Court\nexplains, that test \u201clook[s] to the \u2018general principles of tort\nimmunities and defenses\u2019 applicable at common law, and\nthe reasons we have afforded protection from suit under\n\u00a71983.\u201d Ante, at 5 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.\n409, 418 (1976)).\n   Thus in Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997),\nwe denied qualified immunity to prison guards who were\nprivately employed, despite their quintessentially public\nfunction. We did so because we found \u201cno special reasons\nsignificantly favoring an extension of governmental im-\nmunity\u201d in that context. Id., at 412. We left open, how-\never, the question whether immunity would be appropriate\nfor \u201ca private individual briefly associated with a govern-\nment body, serving as an adjunct to government in an\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nessential governmental activity, or acting under close of-\nficial supervision.\u201d Id., at 413.\n    Filarsky, supported by the United States as amicus\ncuriae, contends that he fits into this coda because he\nworked in close coordination with and under the supervi-\nsion of City employees. Whether Filarsky was supervised\nby those employees, and did not himself do the supervis-\ning, is unclear. But there is no doubt that Filarsky\nworked alongside the employees in investigating Delia.\nIn such circumstances, I agree that Filarsky should be\nallowed to claim qualified immunity from a \u00a71983 suit.\nAs the Court\u2019s opinion persuasively explains, there is a\n\u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 tradition of immunity\u201d applicable to indi-\nviduals who perform government work in capacities other\nthan as formal employees. Id., at 404; see ante, at 5\u201311.\nAnd conferring qualified immunity on individuals like\nFilarsky helps \u201cprotec[t] government\u2019s ability to perform\nits traditional functions,\u201d and thereby helps \u201cprotect the\npublic at large.\u201d Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167\u2013168\n(1992). When a private individual works closely with\nimmune government employees, there is a real risk that\nthe individual will be intimidated from performing his\nduties fully if he, and he alone, may bear the price of\nliability for collective conduct. See ante, at 12; see also\nante, at 13 (noting distraction caused to immune public\nemployees by \u00a71983 litigation brought against nonimmune\nassociates).\n    This does not mean that a private individual may assert\nqualified immunity only when working in close coordina-\ntion with government employees. For example, Richard-\nson\u2019s suggestion that immunity is also appropriate for\nindividuals \u201cserving as an adjunct to government in an\nessential governmental activity,\u201d 521 U. S., at 413, would\nseem to encompass modern-day special prosecutors and\ncomparable individuals hired for their independence.\nThere may yet be other circumstances in which immunity\n                Cite as: 566 U.

The point is simply that\nsuch cases should be decided as they arise, as is our\nlongstanding practice in the field of immunity law.\n",

Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 17, 2012\nRespondent Delia, a firefighter employed by the City of Rialto, Califor-\n  nia, missed work after becoming ill on the job. Suspicious of Delia\u2019s\n  extended absence, the City hired a private investigation firm to con-\n  duct surveillance on him. When Delia was seen buying fiberglass in-\n  sulation and other building supplies, the City initiated an internal af-\n  fairs investigation. It hired petitioner Filarsky, a private attorney, to\n  interview Delia. At the interview, which Delia\u2019s attorney and two\n  fire department officials also attended, Delia acknowledged buying\n  the supplies, but denied having done any work on his home. To veri-\n  fy Delia\u2019s claim, Filarsky asked Delia to allow a fire department offi-\n  cial to enter his home and view the unused materials. When Delia\n  refused, Filarsky ordered him to bring the materials out of his home\n  for the official to see. This prompted Delia\u2019s attorney to threaten a\n  civil rights action against the City and Filarsky. Nonetheless, after\n  the interview concluded, officials followed Delia to his home, where\n  he produced the materials.\n     Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 against the City,\n  the Fire Department, Filarsky, and other individuals, alleging that\n  the order to produce the building materials violated his Fourth and\n  Fourteenth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary\n  judgment to the individual defendants on the basis of qualified im-\n  munity. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed with re-\n  spect to all individual defendants except Filarsky, concluding that he\n  was not entitled to seek qualified immunity because he was a private\n  attorney, not a City employee.\nHeld: A private individual temporarily retained by the government to\n carry out its work is entitled to seek qualified immunity from suit\n under \u00a71983. Pp. 4\u221216.\n2                           FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) In determining whether the Court of Appeals made a valid dis-\n    tinction between City employees and Filarsky for qualified immunity\n    purposes, this Court looks to the general principles of tort immunities\n    and defenses applicable at common law, and the reasons the Court\n    has afforded protection from suit under \u00a71983. See Imbler v. Pacht-\n    man, 424 U. S. 409, 418. The common law as it existed in 1871, when\n    Congress enacted \u00a71983, did not draw a distinction between full-time\n    public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in\n    according protection to those carrying out government responsibili-\n    ties. Government at that time was smaller in both size and reach,\n    had fewer responsibilities, and operated primarily at the local level.\n    Government work was carried out to a significant extent by individ-\n    uals who did not devote all their time to public duties, but instead pur-\n    sued private callings as well. In according protection from suit to in-\n    dividuals doing the government\u2019s work, the common law did not draw\n    distinctions based on the nature of a worker\u2019s engagement with the\n    government. Indeed, examples of individuals receiving immunity for\n    actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occa-\n    sional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself. Common\n    law principles of immunity were incorporated into \u00a71983 and should\n    not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent. See Pulliam v. Al-\n    len, 466 U. S. 522, 529. Immunity under \u00a71983 therefore should not\n    vary depending on whether an individual working for the government\n    does so as a permanent or full-time employee, or on some other basis.\n    Pp. 4\u201311.\n       (b) Nothing about the reasons this Court has given for recognizing\n    immunity under \u00a71983 counsels against carrying forward the com-\n    mon law rule. First, the government interest in avoiding \u201cunwarranted\n    timidity\u201d on the part of those engaged in the public\u2019s business\u2014\n    which has been called \u201cthe most important special government im-\n    munity-producing concern,\u201d Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399,\n    409\u2014is equally implicated regardless of whether the individual sued\n    as a state actor works for the government full-time or on some other\n    basis. Second, affording immunity to those acting on the govern-\n    ment\u2019s behalf serves to \u201c \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not de-\n    terred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.\u2019 \u201d\n    Id., at 408. The government, in need of specialized knowledge or ex-\n    pertise, may look outside its permanent workforce to secure the ser-\n    vices of private individuals. But because those individuals are free to\n    choose other work that would not expose them to liability for gov-\n    ernment actions, the most talented candidates might decline public\n    engagements if they did not receive the same immunity enjoyed by\n    their public employee counterparts. Third, the public interest in en-\n    suring performance of government duties free from the distractions\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that can accompany lawsuits is implicated whether those duties are\n  discharged by private individuals or permanent government employ-\n  ees. Finally, distinguishing among those who carry out the public\u2019s\n  business based on their particular relationship with the government\n  creates significant line-drawing problems and can deprive state ac-\n  tors of the ability to \u201c \u2018reasonably anticipate when their conduct may\n  give rise to liability for damages,\u2019 \u201d Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n  635, 646. Pp. 11\u221213.\n    (c) This conclusion is not contrary to Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158,\n  or Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399. Wyatt did not implicate\n  the reasons underlying recognition of qualified immunity because the\n  defendant in that case had no connection to government and pursued\n  purely private ends. Richardson involved the unusual circumstances\n  of prison guards employed by a private company who worked in a\n  privately run prison facility. Nothing of the sort is involved here, or\n  in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist\n  in carrying out its work.

S. C. \u00a71983. At common law, those who carried out\nthe work of government enjoyed various protections from\nliability when doing so, in order to allow them to serve the\ngovernment without undue fear of personal exposure. Our\ndecisions have looked to these common law protections\nin affording either absolute or qualified immunity to indi-\nviduals sued under \u00a71983. The question in this case is\nwhether an individual hired by the government to do its\nwork is prohibited from seeking such immunity, solely be-\ncause he works for the government on something other\nthan a permanent or full-time basis.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  Nicholas Delia, a firefighter employed by the City of\nRialto, California, became ill while responding to a toxic\nspill in August 2006. Under a doctor\u2019s orders, Delia\nmissed three weeks of work. The City became suspicious\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof Delia\u2019s extended absence, and hired a private investi-\ngation firm to conduct surveillance on him. The private\ninvestigators observed Delia purchasing building supplies\u2014\nincluding several rolls of fiberglass insulation\u2014from a\nhome improvement store. The City surmised that Delia\nwas missing work to do construction on his home rather\nthan because of illness, and it initiated a formal internal\naffairs investigation of him.\n   Delia was ordered to appear for an administrative in-\nvestigation interview. The City hired Steve Filarsky to\nconduct the interview. Filarsky was an experienced employ-\nment lawyer who had previously represented the City in\nseveral investigations. Delia and his attorney attended\nthe interview, along with Filarsky and two fire depart-\nment officials, Mike Peel and Frank Bekker. During the\ninterview, Filarsky questioned Delia about the building sup-\nplies. Delia acknowledged that he had purchased the\nsupplies, but claimed that he had not yet done the work on\nhis home.\n   During a break, Filarsky met with Peel, Bekker, and\nFire Chief Stephen Wells. Filarsky proposed resolving the\ninvestigation by verifying Delia\u2019s claim that he had not\ndone any work on his home. To do so, Filarsky recom-\nmended asking Delia to produce the building materials.\nChief Wells approved the plan.\n   When the meeting resumed, Filarsky requested permis-\nsion for Peel to enter Delia\u2019s home to view the materials.\nOn the advice of counsel, Delia refused. Filarsky then\nasked Delia if he would be willing to bring the materials\nout onto his lawn, so that Peel could observe them without\nentering his home. Delia again refused to consent. Un-\nable to obtain Delia\u2019s cooperation, Filarsky ordered him to\nproduce the materials for inspection.\n   Delia\u2019s counsel objected to the order, asserting that it\nwould violate the Fourth Amendment. When that objec-\ntion proved unavailing, Delia\u2019s counsel threatened to sue\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

If you want to take that chance, you go right\nahead.\u201d App. 131\u2013132. The threat was repeated over and\nover: \u201c[E]verybody is going to get named, and they are\ngoing to sweat it out as to whether or not they have indi-\nvidual liability . . . .\u201d \u201c[Y]ou order him and you will be\nnamed and that is not an idle threat.\u201d \u201cWhoever issues\nthat order is going to be named in the lawsuit.\u201d \u201c[W]e will\nseek any and all damages including individual liability . . . .\n[W]e are coming if you order this.\u201d \u201c[M]ake sure the spell-\ning is clear [in the order] so we know who to sue.\u201d Id.,\nat 134\u2013136, 148\u2013149. Despite these threats, Filarsky\nprepared an order directing Delia to produce the materi-\nals, which Chief Wells signed.\n   As soon as the interview concluded, Peel and Bekker\nfollowed Delia to his home. Once there, Delia, his attor-\nney, and a union representative went into Delia\u2019s house,\nbrought out the four rolls of insulation, and placed them\non Delia\u2019s lawn. Peel and Bekker, who remained in their\ncar during this process, thanked Delia for showing them\nthe insulation and drove off.\n                            B\n  Delia brought an action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 against\nthe City, its Fire Department, Chief Wells, Peel, Bekker,\nFilarsky, and ten unidentified individuals, alleging that\nthe order to produce the building materials violated his\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment to all the\nindividual defendants, concluding that they were pro-\ntected by qualified immunity. The court held that Delia\nhad \u201cnot demonstrated a violation of a clearly established\nconstitutional right,\u201d because \u201cDelia was not threatened\nwith insubordination or termination if he did not comply\nwith any order given and none of these defendants entered\n4                    FILARSKY v.

The Court\nof Appeals concluded that the order violated the Fourth\nAmendment, but agreed with the District Court that Delia\n\u201cha[d] not demonstrated that a constitutional right was\nclearly established as of the date of Chief Wells\u2019s order,\nsuch that defendants would have known that their actions\nwere unlawful.\u201d Delia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1079\n(2010). As to Filarsky, however, the court concluded that\nbecause he was a private attorney and not a City employ-\nee, he was not entitled to seek the protection of qualified\nimmunity. Id., at 1080\u20131081. The court noted that its\ndecision conflicted with a decision of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit, see Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F. 3d\n301, 310 (1997), but considered itself bound by Circuit\nprecedent and therefore \u201cnot free to follow the Cullinan\ndecision.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at 1080 (citing Gonzalez v.

DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbudget constraints, and generally had neither the need\nnor the ability to maintain an established bureaucracy\nstaffed by professionals. See B. Campbell, The Growth of\nAmerican Government: Governance From the Cleveland\nEra to the Present 14\u201316, 20\u201321 (1995); id., at 20 (noting\nthat in the 1880s \u201c[t]he governor\u2019s office staff in Wisconsin\n. . . totaled five workers if we count the lieutenant gover-\nnor and the janitor\u201d).\n    As one commentator has observed, there was at that\ntime \u201cno very clear conception of a professional office, that\nis, an office the incumbent of which devotes his entire time\nto the discharge of public functions, who has no other\noccupation, and who receives a sufficiently large compen-\nsation to enable him to live without resorting to other\nmeans.\u201d F. Goodnow, Principles of the Administrative\nLaw of the United States 227 (1905). Instead, to a signifi-\ncant extent, government was \u201cadministered by members of\nsociety who temporarily or occasionally discharge[d] public\nfunctions.\u201d Id., at 228. Whether government relied pri-\nmarily upon professionals or occasional workers obviously\nvaried across the country and across different government\nfunctions. But even at the turn of the twentieth century,\na public servant was often one who \u201cdoes not devote his\nentire time to his public duties, but is, at the same time\nthat he is holding public office, permitted to carry on some\nother regular business, and as a matter of fact finds his\nmain means of support in such business or in his private\nmeans since he receives from his office a compensation\ninsufficient to support him.\u201d Id., at 227.\n    Private citizens were actively involved in government\nwork, especially where the work most directly touched the\nlives of the people. It was not unusual, for example, to see\nthe owner of the local general store step behind a window\nin his shop to don his postman\u2019s hat. See, e.g., Stole\nStamps, Maysville, KY, The Evening Bulletin, p. 1, Sept.\n25, 1895 (reporting that \u201c[t]he post office and general store\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Nor would it have\nbeen a surprise to find, on a trip to the docks, the local\nferryman collecting harbor fees as public wharfmaster.\nSee 3 E. Johnson, A History of Kentucky and Kentuckians\n1346 (1912).\n  Even such a core government activity as criminal prose-\ncution was often carried out by a mixture of public em-\nployees and private individuals temporarily serving the\npublic. At the time \u00a71983 was enacted, private lawyers\nwere regularly engaged to conduct criminal prosecutions\non behalf of the State. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

To cite a\nnotable illustration, in Hayburn\u2019s Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792),\nthe first Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, sought a\nwrit of mandamus from this Court to compel a lower court\nto hear William Hayburn\u2019s petition to be put on the pen-\nsion list. When this Court did not allow the Attorney\nGeneral to seek the writ in his official capacity, Randolph\nreadily solved the problem by arguing the case as Hay-\nburn\u2019s private lawyer.

Government actors involved in adjudica-\ntive activities, for example, were protected by an absolute\nimmunity from suit. See Bradley v. Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88468\"><a href=\"/opinion/88468/bradley-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n347\u2013348 (1872); J.

Thorpe, 33 N. J. L. 134,\n137\u2013138 (1868).\n   The common law also extended certain protections to\nindividuals engaged in law enforcement activities, such as\nsheriffs and constables. At the time \u00a71983 was enacted,\nhowever, \u201c[t]he line between public and private policing\nwas frequently hazy. Private detectives and privately em-\nployed patrol personnel often were publicly appointed\nas special policemen, and the means and objects of detec-\ntive work, in particular, made it difficult to distinguish\nbetween those on the public payroll and private detec-\ntives.\u201d Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. Rev.\n1165, 1210 (1999) (footnotes and internal quotation marks\nomitted). The protections provided by the common law did\nnot turn on whether someone we today would call a police\nofficer worked for the government full-time or instead\nfor both public and private employers. Rather, at common\nlaw, \u201c[a] special constable, duly appointed according to\nlaw, ha[d] all the powers of a regular constable so far as\nmay be necessary for the proper discharge of the special\nduties intrusted to him, and in the lawful discharge of\nthose duties, [was] as fully protected as any other officer.\u201d\nW. Murfee, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other\nMinisterial Officers \u00a71121, p. 609 (1884).\n   Sheriffs executing a warrant were empowered by the\ncommon law to enlist the aid of the able-bodied men of the\ncommunity in doing so. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 332 (1765); In re Quarles,\n158 U. S. 532, 535 (1895). While serving as part of\nthis \u201cposse comitatus,\u201d a private individual had the same\nauthority as the sheriff, and was protected to the same\nextent. See, e.g., Robinson v.

Allen,\n466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Under this assumption, immu-\nnity under \u00a71983 should not vary depending on whether\nan individual working for the government does so as a\nfull-time employee, or on some other basis.\n                              B\n   Nothing about the reasons we have given for recognizing\nimmunity under \u00a71983 counsels against carrying forward\nthe common law rule. As we have explained, such immu-\nnity \u201cprotect[s] government\u2019s ability to perform its tradi-\ntional functions.\u201d Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167 (1992).\nIt does so by helping to avoid \u201cunwarranted timidity\u201d in\nperformance of public duties, ensuring that talented can-\ndidates are not deterred from public service, and prevent-\ning the harmful distractions from carrying out the work of\ngovernment that can often accompany damages suits.\nRichardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399, 409\u2013411 (1997).\n   We have called the government interest in avoiding\n\u201cunwarranted timidity\u201d on the part of those engaged in the\npublic\u2019s business \u201cthe most important special government\nimmunity-producing concern.\u201d Id., at 409. Ensuring that\nthose who serve the government do so \u201cwith the decisive-\nness and the judgment required by the public good,\u201d\nScheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 240 (1974), is of vital\nimportance regardless whether the individual sued as a\nstate actor works full-time or on some other basis.\n   Affording immunity not only to public employees but\n12                  FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso to others acting on behalf of the government similarly\nserves to \u201c \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not de-\nterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public\nservice.\u2019 \u201d Richardson, supra, at 408 (quoting Wyatt, su-\npra, at 167). The government\u2019s need to attract talented\nindividuals is not limited to full-time public employees.\nIndeed, it is often when there is a particular need for\nspecialized knowledge or expertise that the government\nmust look outside its permanent work force to secure the\nservices of private individuals. This case is a good exam-\nple: Filarsky had 29 years of specialized experience as an\nattorney in labor, employment, and personnel matters,\nwith particular expertise in conducting internal affairs\ninvestigations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59, 89; App. 156.\nThe City of Rialto certainly had no permanent employee\nwith anything approaching those qualifications. To the\nextent such private individuals do not depend on the\ngovernment for their livelihood, they have freedom to\nselect other work\u2014work that will not expose them to\nliability for government actions. This makes it more likely\nthat the most talented candidates will decline public en-\ngagements if they do not receive the same immunity en-\njoyed by their public employee counterparts.\n   Sometimes, as in this case, private individuals will\nwork in close coordination with public employees, and face\nthreatened legal action for the same conduct. See App.\n134 (Delia\u2019s lawyer: \u201ceverybody is going to get named\u201d in\nthreatened suit). Because government employees will\noften be protected from suit by some form of immunity,\nthose working alongside them could be left holding the\nbag\u2014facing full liability for actions taken in conjunction\nwith government employees who enjoy immunity for the\nsame activity. Under such circumstances, any private\nindividual with a choice might think twice before accept-\ning a government assignment.\n   The public interest in ensuring performance of govern-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment duties free from the distractions that can accompany\neven routine lawsuits is also implicated when individuals\nother than permanent government employees discharge\nthese duties. See Richardson, supra, at 411. Not only will\nsuch individuals\u2019 performance of any ongoing government\nresponsibilities suffer from the distraction of lawsuits, but\nsuch distractions will also often affect any public employ-\nees with whom they work by embroiling those employees\nin litigation. This case is again a good example: If the suit\nagainst Filarsky moves forward, it is highly likely that\nChief Wells, Bekker, and Peel will all be required to tes-\ntify, given their roles in the dispute. Allowing suit under\n\u00a71983 against private individuals assisting the govern-\nment will substantially undermine an important reason\nimmunity is accorded public employees in the first place.\n   Distinguishing among those who carry out the public\u2019s\nbusiness based on the nature of their particular relation-\nship with the government also creates significant line-\ndrawing problems. It is unclear, for example, how Fil-\narsky would be categorized if he regularly spent half his\ntime working for the City, or worked exclusively on one\nCity project for an entire year. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201336.\nSuch questions deprive state actors of the ability to \u201crea-\nsonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to\nliability for damages,\u201d Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S.\n635, 646 (1987) (alteration and internal quotation marks\nomitted), frustrating the purposes immunity is meant to\nserve. An uncertain immunity is little better than no\nimmunity at all.\n                            III\n  Our decisions in Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158 (1992), and\nRichardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997), are not to\nthe contrary. In Wyatt, we held that individuals who used\na state replevin law to compel the local sheriff to seize\ndisputed property from a former business partner were\n14                   FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot entitled to seek qualified immunity. Cf. Lugar, 457\nU. S. 922 (holding that an individual who uses a state\nreplevin, garnishment, or attachment statute later de-\nclared to be unconstitutional acts under color of state law\nfor purposes of \u00a71983). We explained that the reasons\nunderlying recognition of qualified immunity did not sup-\nport its extension to individuals who had no connection\nto government and pursued purely private ends. Because\nsuch individuals \u201chold no office requiring them to exercise\ndiscretion; nor are they principally concerned with en-\nhancing the public good,\u201d we concluded that extending\nimmunity to them would \u201chave no bearing on whether\npublic officials are able to act forcefully and decisively in\ntheir jobs or on whether qualified applicants enter public\nservice.\u201d 504 U. S., at 168.\n   Wyatt is plainly not implicated by the circumstances of\nthis case. Unlike the defendants in Wyatt, who were us-\ning the mechanisms of government to achieve their own\nends, individuals working for the government in pursuit of\ngovernment objectives are \u201cprincipally concerned with en-\nhancing the public good.\u201d Ibid. Whether such individ-\nuals have assurance that they will be able to seek protec-\ntion if sued under \u00a71983 directly affects the government\u2019s\nability to achieve its objectives through their public ser-\nvice. Put simply, Wyatt involved no government agents,\nno government interests, and no government need for\nimmunity.\n   In Richardson, we considered whether guards employed\nby a privately run prison facility could seek the protection\nof qualified immunity. Although the Court had previously\ndetermined that public-employee prison guards were\nentitled to qualified immunity, see Procunier v. Navarette,\n434 U. S. 555 (1978), it determined that prison guards\nemployed by a private company and working in a privately\nrun prison facility did not enjoy the same protection. We\nexplained that the various incentives characteristic of the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate market in that case ensured that the guards would\nnot perform their public duties with unwarranted timidity\nor be deterred from entering that line of work. 521 U. S.,\nat 410\u2013411.\n  Richardson was a self-consciously \u201cnarrow[ ]\u201d decision.\nId., at 413 (\u201c[W]e have answered the immunity question\nnarrowly, in the context in which it arose\u201d). The Court\nmade clear that its holding was not meant to foreclose all\nclaims of immunity by private individuals. Ibid. Instead,\nthe Court emphasized that the particular circumstances of\nthat case\u2014\u201ca private firm, systematically organized to\nassume a major lengthy administrative task (managing an\ninstitution) with limited direct supervision by the govern-\nment, undertak[ing] that task for profit and potentially\nin competition with other firms\u201d\u2014combined sufficiently to\nmitigate the concerns underlying recognition of govern-\nmental immunity under \u00a71983. Ibid. Nothing of the sort\nis involved here, or in the typical case of an individual\nhired by the government to assist in carrying out its work.\n                          *    *    *\n   A straightforward application of the rule set out above\nis sufficient to resolve this case. Though not a public em-\nployee, Filarsky was retained by the City to assist in\nconducting an official investigation into potential wrong-\ndoing. There is no dispute that government employees\nperforming such work are entitled to seek the protection\nof qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals rejected\nFilarsky\u2019s claim to the protection accorded Wells, Bekker,\nand Peel solely because he was not a permanent, full-time\nemployee of the City. The common law, however, did not\ndraw such distinctions, and we see no justification for\ndoing so under \u00a71983.\n   New York City has a Department of Investigation\nstaffed by full-time public employees who investigate city\npersonnel, and the resources to pay for it. The City of\n16                    FILARSKY v.

S. C. \u00a71983 alleging a constitutional\nviolation committed in the course of the investigation? I\nagree that the answer is yes and that the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals holding private attorney Filarsky\ncategorically ineligible for qualified immunity must be re-\nversed. Qualified immunity may be overcome, however, if\nthe defendant knew or should have known that his con-\nduct violated a right \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of\nthe episode in suit. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.\n800, 818 (1982). Because the Ninth Circuit did not con-\nsider the application of that standard to Filarsky, the\nmatter, as I see it, may be pursued on remand.\n  Filarsky was retained by the City of Rialto to investi-\ngate whether city firefighter Delia was taking time off\nfrom work under the false pretense of a disabling physical\ncondition. In pursuit of the investigation, Filarsky asked\nDelia to consent to a search of his home to determine what\nDelia had done with several rolls of insulation he had\nrecently purchased at a home improvement store. When\nDelia, on counsel\u2019s advice, refused to consent to the search,\nFilarsky \u201chatch[ed] a plan\u201d to overcome Delia\u2019s resistance.\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nDelia v. Rialto, 621 F. 3d 1069, 1077 (CA9 2010). \u201c[W]e\nwill do it a different way,\u201d Filarsky informed Delia. App.\n129; see 621 F. 3d, at 1077 (\u201cUnable to obtain Delia\u2019s\nconsent to a warrantless search of his house . . . , Filarsky\ntried a different tactic.\u201d).\n   Following Filarsky\u2019s advice, Fire Chief Wells ordered\nDelia to bring the insulation out of his house and place the\nrolls on his lawn for inspection. App. 158. Filarsky rec-\nommended this course, the Ninth Circuit observed, mind-\nful that \u201can individual does not have an expectation of\nprivacy in items exposed to the public, thereby eliminating\nthe need for a search warrant.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at 1077. Delia\ncomplied with Chief Wells\u2019s order by producing the rolls,\nall of them unused, App. 78, 85, after which the investi-\ngation into the legitimacy of Delia\u2019s absence from work\napparently ended.\n   In explaining why the individual defendants other than\nFilarsky were entitled to summary judgment on their\nqualified immunity pleas, the Ninth Circuit stated that\n\u201cno . . . threat to [Delia\u2019s] employment\u201d attended Fire\nChief Wells\u2019s order. 621 F. 3d, at 1079. The District\nCourt similarly stated that \u201cDelia was not threatened with\ninsubordination or termination if he did not comply with\n[the] order.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48.\n   These statements are at odds with the facts, as re-\ncounted by the Court of Appeals. \u201cAt the onset of the in-\nterview,\u201d the Ninth Circuit stressed, \u201cFilarsky warned Delia\nthat he was obligated to fully cooperate,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f at\nany time it is deemed you are not cooperating then you\ncan be held to be insubordinate and subject to disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination.\u201d 621 F. 3d, at\n1072 (internal quotation marks omitted). Continuing in\nthis vein, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cDelia\u2019s\nactions were involuntary and coerced by the direct threat\nof sanctions including loss of his firefighter position.\u201d Id.,\nat 1077; see id., at 1085 (\u201cDelia\u2019s actions were involun-\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

First, if\nit is \u201cclearly established,\u201d as the Ninth Circuit thought it\nwas, that \u201cthe warrantless search of a home is presump-\ntively unreasonable,\u201d id., at 1075, and that a well-trained\ninvestigating officer would so comprehend,1 may an official\ncircumvent the warrant requirement by ordering the per-\nson under investigation to cart his personal property out\nof the house for inspection?2 And if it is \u201cclearly estab-\nlished\u201d that an employee may not be fired for exercising a\nconstitutional right, see id., at 1079,3 is it not equally\nplain that discipline or discharge may not be threatened to\ninduce surrender of such a right?\n   In short, the Court has responded appropriately to the\nquestion tendered for our review, but the Circuit\u2019s law will\nremain muddled absent the Court of Appeals\u2019 focused\nattention to the question whether Filarsky\u2019s conduct\nviolated \u201cclearly established\u201d law.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Delia also suggests that Filarsky\u2019s conduct should be measured\n\nagainst a \u201creasonable attorney\u201d standard: whether an attorney provid-\ning advice in a public-employee investigation should have known that\nthe search of Delia\u2019s personal property, stored in his home, would be\nlawless. See Brief for Respondent 45\u201346.\n  2 An additional inquiry may be appropriate: Although conceived as a\n\nsubstitute for a warrantless entry, should the inspection order Filarsky\ncounseled pass muster as a permissible discovery device? Cf. Okla-\nhoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186, 195, 208\u2013211 (1946)\n(subpoena duces tecum for a corporation\u2019s business records, authorized\nby \u00a79 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, encountered no Fourth Amend-\nment shoal).\n  3 The Ninth Circuit referred to cases holding that public employees\u2019\n\njob retention cannot be conditioned on relinquishing the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s safeguard against self-incrimination: Uniformed Sanitation Men\nAssn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New York, 392 U. S.\n280 (1968), and Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U. S. 273 (1968).\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

NICHOLAS B.\n\n                    DELIA\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [April 17, 2012] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   The Court of Appeals denied qualified immunity to\nFilarsky solely because, as retained outside counsel, he\nwas not a formal employee of the City of Rialto. I agree\nwith and join today\u2019s opinion holding that this distinction\nis not a sound basis on which to deny immunity.\n   I add only that it does not follow that every private\nindividual who works for the government in some capacity\nnecessarily may claim qualified immunity when sued\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983. Such individuals must satisfy\nour usual test for conferring immunity. As the Court\nexplains, that test \u201clook[s] to the \u2018general principles of tort\nimmunities and defenses\u2019 applicable at common law, and\nthe reasons we have afforded protection from suit under\n\u00a71983.\u201d Ante, at 5 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.\n409, 418 (1976)).\n   Thus in Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U. S. 399 (1997),\nwe denied qualified immunity to prison guards who were\nprivately employed, despite their quintessentially public\nfunction. We did so because we found \u201cno special reasons\nsignificantly favoring an extension of governmental im-\nmunity\u201d in that context. Id., at 412. We left open, how-\never, the question whether immunity would be appropriate\nfor \u201ca private individual briefly associated with a govern-\nment body, serving as an adjunct to government in an\n2                    FILARSKY v. DELIA\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nessential governmental activity, or acting under close of-\nficial supervision.\u201d Id., at 413.\n    Filarsky, supported by the United States as amicus\ncuriae, contends that he fits into this coda because he\nworked in close coordination with and under the supervi-\nsion of City employees. Whether Filarsky was supervised\nby those employees, and did not himself do the supervis-\ning, is unclear. But there is no doubt that Filarsky\nworked alongside the employees in investigating Delia.\nIn such circumstances, I agree that Filarsky should be\nallowed to claim qualified immunity from a \u00a71983 suit.\nAs the Court\u2019s opinion persuasively explains, there is a\n\u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 tradition of immunity\u201d applicable to indi-\nviduals who perform government work in capacities other\nthan as formal employees. Id., at 404; see ante, at 5\u201311.\nAnd conferring qualified immunity on individuals like\nFilarsky helps \u201cprotec[t] government\u2019s ability to perform\nits traditional functions,\u201d and thereby helps \u201cprotect the\npublic at large.\u201d Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 167\u2013168\n(1992). When a private individual works closely with\nimmune government employees, there is a real risk that\nthe individual will be intimidated from performing his\nduties fully if he, and he alone, may bear the price of\nliability for collective conduct. See ante, at 12; see also\nante, at 13 (noting distraction caused to immune public\nemployees by \u00a71983 litigation brought against nonimmune\nassociates).\n    This does not mean that a private individual may assert\nqualified immunity only when working in close coordina-\ntion with government employees. For example, Richard-\nson\u2019s suggestion that immunity is also appropriate for\nindividuals \u201cserving as an adjunct to government in an\nessential governmental activity,\u201d 521 U. S., at 413, would\nseem to encompass modern-day special prosecutors and\ncomparable individuals hired for their independence.\nThere may yet be other circumstances in which immunity\n                Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nis warranted for private actors. The point is simply that\nsuch cases should be decided as they arise, as is our\nlongstanding practice in the field of immunity law.\n</pre>",
