Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 25, 2012\nOrdinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency against a tax-\n payer within \u201c3 years after the return was filed,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(a),\n but that period is extended to 6 years when a taxpayer \u201comits from\n gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in ex-\n cess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,\u201d\n \u00a76501(e)(1)(A). Respondent taxpayers overstated the basis of certain\n property that they had sold. As a result, their returns understated\n the gross income they received from the sale by an amount in excess\n of 25%. The Commissioner asserted the deficiency outside the 3-year\n limitations period but within the 6-year period. The Fourth Circuit\n concluded that the taxpayers\u2019 overstatements of basis, and resulting\n understatements of gross income, did not trigger the extended limita-\n  tions period.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n634 F. 3d 249, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV\u2013C, concluding that \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) does not apply to an over-\n  statement of basis. Pp. 2\u20138.\n    (a) In Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U. S. 28, the Court inter-\n  preted a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 containing\n  language materially indistinguishable from the language at issue\n  here, holding that taxpayer misstatements that overstate the basis in\n  property do not fall within the statute\u2019s scope. The Court recognized\n  that such an overstatement wrongly understates a taxpayer\u2019s income,\n  but concluded that the phrase \u201comits . . . an amount\u201d limited the\n  statute\u2019s scope to situations in which specific receipts are left out of\n2       UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the computation of gross income. The Court also noted that while the\n    statute\u2019s language was not \u201cunambiguous,\u201d id., at 33, the statutory\n    history showed that Congress intended to restrict the extended limi-\n    tations period to situations that did not include overstatements of ba-\n    sis. Finally, the Court found its conclusion \u201cin harmony with the\n    unambiguous language of \u00a76501(e)(1)(A),\u201d id., at 37, the provision\n    enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and applicable\n    here. Pp. 2\u20134.\n       (b) Colony determines the outcome of this case. The operative lan-\n    guage of the 1939 provision and the provision at issue is identical. It\n    would be difficult to give the same language here a different interpre-\n    tation without overruling Colony, a course of action stare decisis\n    counsels against. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\n    U. S. 130, 139. The Government suggests that differences in other\n    nearby parts of the 1954 Code favor a different interpretation than\n    the one adopted in Colony. However, its arguments are too fragile to\n    bear the significant weight it seeks to place upon them. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (c) The Court also rejects the Government\u2019s argument that a re-\n    cently promulgated Treasury Regulation interpreting the statute\u2019s\n    operative language in its favor should be granted deference under\n    Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\n    U. S. 837. See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand\n    X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982. Colony has already interpret-\n    ed the statute, and there is no longer any different construction that\n    is consistent with Colony and available for adoption by the agency.\n    Pp. 7\u20138.\n\n   BREYER, J. delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV\u2013C.\nROBERTS, C.

HOME CONCRETE\n            & SUPPLY, LLC, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                                [April 25, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Part IV\u2013C.\n   Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency\nagainst a taxpayer within \u201c3 years after the return was\nfiled.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(a) (2000 ed.). The 3-year period\nis extended to 6 years, however, when a taxpayer \u201comits\nfrom gross income an amount properly includible therein\nwhich is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross\nincome stated in the return.\u201d \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). The question before us is whether this latter\nprovision applies (and extends the ordinary 3-year limita-\ntions period) when the taxpayer overstates his basis in\nproperty that he has sold, thereby understating the gain\nthat he received from its sale. Following Colony, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 357 U. S. 28 (1958), we hold that the provi-\nsion does not apply to an overstatement of basis. Hence\nthe 6-year period does not apply.\n                            I\n  For present purposes the relevant underlying circum-\nstances are not in dispute. We consequently assume that\n(1) the respondent taxpayers filed their relevant tax re-\n2    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nturns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis\nof certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a\nresult the returns understated the gross income that the\ntaxpayers received from the sale of the property; and\n(4) the understatement exceeded the statute\u2019s 25% thresh-\nold. We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner\nasserted the relevant deficiency within the extended 6-\nyear limitations period, but outside the default 3-year\nperiod. Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations\napplies, the Government\u2019s efforts to assert a tax deficiency\ncame too late. Our conclusion\u2014that the extended limita-\ntions period does not apply\u2014follows directly from this\nCourt\u2019s earlier decision in Colony.\n                            II\n  In Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the In-\nternal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of\nwhich is identical to the language now before us. The\nCommissioner there had determined\n    \u201cthat the taxpayer had understated the gross profits\n    on the sales of certain lots of land for residential pur-\n    poses as a result of having overstated the \u2018basis\u2019 of\n    such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain\n    unallowable items of development expense.\u201d Id., at\n    30.\nThe Commissioner\u2019s assessment came after the ordinary\n3-year limitations period had run. And, it was conse-\nquently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the\n1939 Code, had \u201comit[ted] from gross income an amount\nproperly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per cen-\ntum of the amount of gross income stated in the return . . . .\u201d\n26 U. S. C. \u00a7275(c) (1940 ed.). The Code provision ap-\nplicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially\nindistinguishable language. See \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.)\n(same, but replacing \u201cper centum\u201d with \u201cpercent\u201d). See also\nAppendix, infra.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Colony this Court held that taxpayer misstatements,\noverstating the basis in property, do not fall within the\nscope of the statute. But the Court recognized the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s contrary argument for inclusion. 357 U. S., at\n32. Then as now, the Code itself defined \u201cgross income\u201d in\nthis context as the difference between gross revenue (often\nthe amount the taxpayer received upon selling the prop-\nerty) and basis (often the amount the taxpayer paid for the\nproperty). Compare 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a722, 111 (1940 ed.) with\n\u00a7\u00a761(a)(3), 1001(a) (2000 ed.). And, the Commissioner\npointed out, an overstatement of basis can diminish the\n\u201camount\u201d of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off\nthe return might do. 357 U. S., at 32. Either way, the\nerror wrongly understates the taxpayer\u2019s income.\n   But, the Court added, the Commissioner\u2019s argument did\nnot fully account for the provision\u2019s language, in particular\nthe word \u201comit.\u201d The key phrase says \u201comits . . . an\namount.\u201d The word \u201comits\u201d (unlike, say, \u201creduces\u201d or \u201cun-\nderstates\u201d) means \u201c \u2018[t]o leave out or unmentioned; not\nto insert, include, or name.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary (2d ed. 1939)). Thus, taken\nliterally, \u201comit\u201d limits the statute\u2019s scope to situations in\nwhich specific receipts or accruals of income are left out\nof the computation of gross income; to inflate the basis,\nhowever, is not to \u201comit\u201d a specific item, not even of profit.\n   While finding this latter interpretation of the language\nthe \u201cmore plausibl[e],\u201d the Court also noted that the lan-\nguage was not \u201cunambiguous.\u201d Colony, 357 U. S., at 33. It\nthen examined various congressional Reports discussing\nthe relevant statutory language. It found in those Reports\n    \u201cpersuasive indications that Congress merely had in\n    mind failures to report particular income receipts and\n    accruals, and did not intend the [extended] limitation\n    to apply whenever gross income was understated . . . .\u201d\n    Id., at 35.\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThis \u201chistory,\u201d the Court said, \u201cshows . . . that the Con-\ngress intended an exception to the usual three-year stat-\nute of limitations only in the restricted type of situation\nalready described,\u201d a situation that did not include over-\nstatements of basis. Id., at 36.\n  The Court wrote that Congress, in enacting the\nprovision,\n    \u201cmanifested no broader purpose than to give the\n    Commissioner an additional two [now three] years to\n    investigate tax returns in cases where, because of a\n    taxpayer\u2019s omission to report some taxable item, the\n    Commissioner is at a special disadvantage . . . [be-\n    cause] the return on its face provides no clue to the ex-\n    istence of the omitted item. . . . [W]hen, as here [i.e.,\n    where the overstatement of basis is at issue], the un-\n    derstatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting\n    an item disclosed on the face of the return the Com-\n    missioner is at no such disadvantage . . . whether the\n    error be one affecting \u2018gross income\u2019 or one, such as\n    overstated deductions, affecting other parts of the re-\n    turn.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n  Finally, the Court noted that Congress had recently\nenacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. And the\nCourt observed that \u201cthe conclusion we reach is in har-\nmony with the unambiguous language of \u00a76501(e)(1)(A),\u201d\nid., at 37, i.e., the provision relevant in this present case.\n                             III\n   In our view, Colony determines the outcome in this case.\nThe provision before us is a 1954 reenactment of the 1939\nprovision that Colony interpreted. The operative language\nis identical. It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to\ngive the same language here a different interpretation\nwithout effectively overruling Colony, a course of action\nthat basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto take. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\nU. S. 130, 139 (2008) (\u201c[S]tare decisis in respect to statu-\ntory interpretation has special force, for Congress remains\nfree to alter what we have done\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.\n164, 172\u2013173 (1989).\n  The Government, in an effort to convince us to interpret\nthe operative language before us differently, points to\ndifferences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code. It\nsuggests that these differences counsel in favor of a differ-\nent interpretation than the one adopted in Colony. For\nexample, the Government points to a new provision,\n\u00a76501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says:\n    \u201cIn the case of a trade or business, the term \u2018gross in-\n    come\u2019 means the total of the amounts received or ac-\n    crued from the sale of goods or services (if such\n    amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior\n    to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.\u201d\nIf the section\u2019s basic phrase \u201comi[ssion] from gross income\u201d\ndoes not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what\nColony held), then what need would there be for clause (i),\nwhich leads to the same result in a specific subset of\ncases?\n   And why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph,\nreferring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who\n\u201comits . . . items includible in [the] gross estate\u201d? See\n\u00a76501(e)(2) (emphasis added). By speaking of \u201citems\u201d\nthere does it not imply that omission of an \u201camount\u201d cov-\ners more than omission of individual items\u2014indeed that\nit includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, di-\nminish the amount of the profit that should have been re-\nported as gross income?\n   In our view, these points are too fragile to bear the sig-\nnificant argumentative weight the Government seeks to\nplace upon them. For example, at least one plausible\n6    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreason why Congress might have added clause (i) has\nnothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the\ngeneral rule. Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code\n(prior to Colony), it did not yet know how the Court would\ninterpret the provision\u2019s operative language. At least one\nlower court had decided that the provision did not apply to\noverstatements about the cost of goods that a business\nlater sold. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner,\n204 F. 2d 570 (CA3 1953). But see Reis v. Commissioner,\n142 F. 2d 900, 902\u2013903 (CA6 1944). And Congress could\nwell have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the\nSupreme Court, Uptegrove\u2019s interpretation would remain\nthe law where a \u201ctrade or business\u201d was at issue.\n   Nor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without\nwork to do. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid mak-\ning any provision \u201csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). That provision also\nexplains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of\ndetermining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25%\nof \u201cgross income.\u201d For example, it tells us that a merchant\nwho fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods\nhas not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than\n$40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to\nacquire those goods. But without clause (i), the general\nstatutory definition of \u201cgross income\u201d requires subtracting\nthe cost from the sales price. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a761(a)(3),\n1012. Under such a definition of \u201cgross income,\u201d the cal-\nculation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000,\nminus (2) \u201cthe cost of such sales,\u201d say, $25,000. The\n$10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the\n\u201cgross income\u201d of $15,000. And the clause does this work\nin respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of\nour interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.\n   The Government\u2019s argument about subsection (e)(2)\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201citem\u201d instead of \u201camount\u201d is yet weaker.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about\nthe word \u201camount.\u201d It wrote:\n    \u201cThe Commissioner states that the draftsman\u2019s use\n    of the word \u2018amount\u2019 (instead of, for example, \u2018item\u2019)\n    suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of\n    the error\u2014that is whether or not gross income was\n    understated by as much as 25%.\u201d 357 U. S., at 32.\nBut the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner\u2019s logic,\nrejected the argument (and the significance of the word\n\u201camount\u201d) as insufficient to prove the Commissioner\u2019s\nconclusion. And the addition of the word \u201citem\u201d in a dif-\nferent subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive\nforce sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion. The\nword\u2019s appearance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new.\nBut to rely in the case before us on this solitary word\nchange in a different subsection is like hoping that a new\nbatboy will change the outcome of the World Series.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   Finally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation\n\u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131, which was promulgated in final form in\nDecember 2010. See 26 CFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131 (2011). The\nregulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and\ninterprets the operative language of the statute in the\nGovernment\u2019s favor. The regulation says that \u201can un-\nderstated amount of gross income resulting from an over-\nstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an\nomission from gross income.\u201d \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131(a)(1)(iii). In\nthe Government\u2019s view this new regulation in effect over-\nturns Colony\u2019s interpretation of this statute.\n   The Government points out that the Treasury Regula-\ntion constitutes \u201can agency\u2019s construction of a statute\nwhich it administers.\u201d Chevron, U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).\n8    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nSee also Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v.\nUnited States, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (applying Chevron in\nthe tax context). The Court has written that a \u201ccourt\u2019s\nprior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency\nconstruction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only\nif the prior court decision holds that its construction fol-\nlows from the unambiguous terms of the statute . . . .\u201d\nNational Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005) (emphasis\nadded). And, as the Government notes, in Colony itself\nthe Court wrote that \u201cit cannot be said that the language\nis unambiguous.\u201d 357 U. S., at 33. Hence, the Government\nconcludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case.\nThe question, rather, is whether the agency\u2019s construction\nis a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron,\nsupra, at 843. And, since the Government argues that the\nregulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible,\nconstruction of the statute, the Government believes it\nmust win.\n                             B\n  We do not accept this argument.

Those\nopinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as\nthat of deciding whether, or when, a particular statute in\neffect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap, there-\nby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a rea-\nsonable gap-filling interpretation. Thus, in Chevron the\nCourt said that, when\n    \u201cCongress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to\n    fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the\n    agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute\n    by regulation. . . . Sometimes the legislative delega-\n    tion to an agency on a particular question is implicit\n    rather than explicit. [But in either instance], a court\n    may not substitute its own construction of a statutory\n    provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the\n    administrator of an agency.\u201d 467 U.

S. 199, 231 (1974).\n  Chevron and later cases find in unambiguous language\na clear sign that Congress did not delegate gap-filling\nauthority to an agency; and they find in ambiguous lan-\nguage at least a presumptive indication that Congress did\ndelegate that gap-filling authority. Thus, in Chevron the\nCourt wrote that a statute\u2019s silence or ambiguity as to\na particular issue means that Congress has not \u201cdirectly\naddressed the precise question at issue\u201d (thus likely dele-\ngating gap-filling power to the agency). 467 U.

But the Court decided that\ncase nearly 30 years before it decided Chevron. There is\nno reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by\nColony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress\nhad delegated gap-filling power to the agency. At the\nsame time, there is every reason to believe that the Court\nthought that Congress had \u201cdirectly spoken to the ques-\ntion at hand,\u201d and thus left \u201c[no] gap for the agency to fill.\u201d\nChevron, supra, at 842\u2013843.\n   For one thing, the Court said that the taxpayer had the\nbetter side of the textual argument. Colony, 357 U. S., at\n33. For another, its examination of legislative history led\nit to believe that Congress had decided the question defini-\ntively, leaving no room for the agency to reach a contrary\nresult. It found in that history \u201cpersuasive indications\u201d\nthat Congress intended overstatements of basis to fall\noutside the statute\u2019s scope, and it said that it was satisfied\nthat Congress \u201cintended an exception . . . only in the re-\nstricted type of situation\u201d it had already described.

And it reached this conclusion despite the fact\nthat, in the years leading up to Colony, the Commissioner\nhad consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit\ncourts. See, e.g., Uptegrove, 204 F. 2d 570; Reis, 142 F. 2d\n900; Goodenow v. Commisioner, 238 F. 2d 20 (CA8 1956);\nAmerican Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 386\n(1942). Cf. Slaff v. Commisioner, 220 F. 2d 65 (CA9 1955);\nDavis v. Hightower, 230 F. 2d 549 (CA5 1956). Thus, the\nCourt was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. And finally, after\ncompleting its analysis, Colony found its interpretation of\nthe 1939 Code \u201cin harmony with the [now] unambiguous\nlanguage\u201d of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests\nthat the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as incon-\nsistent with its conclusion. 357 U. S., at 37.\n   It may be that judges today would use other methods to\ndetermine whether Congress left a gap to fill. But that\nis beside the point. The question is whether the Court in\nColony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in\nour view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the\nCourt) makes clear that it did not.\n   Given principles of stare decisis, we must follow that\ninterpretation. And there being no gap to fill, the Gov-\nernment\u2019s gap-filling regulation cannot change Colony\u2019s\ninterpretation of the statute. We agree with the taxpayer\nthat overstatements of basis, and the resulting under-\nstatement of gross income, do not trigger the extended\nlimitations period of \u00a76501(e)(1)(A). The Court of Appeals\nreached the same conclusion. See 634 F. 3d 249 (CA4\n2011). And its judgment is affirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n12   UNITED STATES v.

See 26 CFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131\n(2011).

That view, of course, did not carry the\nday in Brand X, and the Government quite reasonably\nrelies on the Brand X majority\u2019s innovative pronounce-\nment that a \u201ccourt\u2019s prior judicial construction of a statute\n2     UNITED STATES v.

Indeed, the Court\nwas unaware of even the utility (much less the necessity)\nof making the ambiguous/nonambiguous determination in\ncases decided pre-Chevron, before that opinion made the\nso-called \u201cStep 1\u201d determination of ambiguity vel non a\ncustomary (though hardly mandatory1) part of judicial-\nreview analysis. For many of those earlier cases, there-\nfore, it will be incredibly difficult to determine whether the\ndecision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous,\nor rather an unambiguous, statute.\n   Thus, one would have thought that the Brand X major-\nity would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case, in-\nvolving a pre-Chevron opinion that (mirabile dictu) makes\nit inescapably clear that the Court thought the statute\nambiguous: \u201cIt cannot be said that the language is unam\u00ad\nbiguous.\u201d Colony, supra, at 33 (emphasis added).

See Entergy Corp. v.\nRiverkeeper, Inc., 556 U. S. 208, 218, and n. 4 (2009). The same would\nbe true if the agency interpretation is clearly beyond the scope of any\nconceivable ambiguity.

See United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 245\u2013246 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review\nof Agency Action, 58 Vand. L.

But in order to evade Brand X and yet\nreaffirm Colony, the plurality would add yet another lop-\nsided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our\nlaw of administrative review has become: To trigger the\nBrand X power of an authorized \u201cgap-filling\u201d agency to\ngive content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determi-\nnation that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice;\nthe pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that\nCongress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to\nbe resolved by the agency. And here, today\u2019s plurality\nopinion finds, \u201c[t]here is no reason to believe that the\nlinguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a post-\nChevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap-\nfilling power to the agency.\u201d Ante, at 10. The notion,\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nseemingly, is that post-Chevron a finding of ambiguity is\naccompanied by a finding of agency authority to resolve\nthe ambiguity, but pre-Chevron that was not so. The\npremise is false. Post-Chevron cases do not \u201cconclude\u201d\nthat Congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved\nby the agency; that is simply the legal effect of ambi-\nguity\u2014a legal effect that should obtain whenever the\nlanguage is in fact (as Colony found) ambiguous.\n    Does the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to\nColony\u2019s determination of ambiguity because the Court did\nnot know, in that era, the importance of that determina-\ntion\u2014that it would empower the agency to (in effect)\nrevise the Court\u2019s determination of statutory meaning?\nBut as I suggested earlier, that was an ignorance which all\nof our cases shared not just pre-Chevron, but pre-Brand X.\nBefore then it did not really matter whether the Court was\nresolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute\u2019s clear\nmeaning. The opinion might (or might not) advert to\nthat point in the course of its analysis, but either way\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute would be the law.\nSo it is no small number of still-authoritative cases\nthat today\u2019s plurality opinion would exile to the Land of\nUncertainty.\n    Perhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach, the\nplurality opinion then pivots (as the \u00e0 la mode vernacular\nhas it)\u2014from focusing on whether Colony concluded that\nthere was gap-filling authority to focusing on whether\nColony concluded that there was any gap to be filled: \u201cThe\nquestion is whether the Court in Colony concluded that\nthe statute left such a gap. And, in our view, the opinion\n. . . makes clear that it did not.\u201d Ante, at 11. How does the\nplurality know this? Because Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion\n\u201csaid that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual\nargument\u201d; because it found that legislative history indi-\ncated \u201cthat Congress intended overstatements of basis to\nfall outside the statute\u2019s scope\u201d; because it concluded that\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Ante, at 10\u201311 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But these are the sorts of arguments\nthat courts always use in resolving ambiguities. They do\nnot prove that no ambiguity existed, unless one believes\nthat an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never\nexisted in the first place. Colony said unambiguously that\nthe text was ambiguous, and that should be an end of the\nmatter\u2014unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis\neffect to Colony as a pre-Chevron decision.\n   Rather than making our judicial-review jurisprudence\ncuriouser and curiouser, the Court should abandon the\nopinion that produces these contortions, Brand X. I join\nthe judgment announced by the Court because it is indis-\nputable that Colony resolved the construction of the statu-\ntory language at issue here, and that construction must\ntherefore control.

Natural Resources Defense Coun\u00ad\ncil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978), which held that Congress\nprescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the\nadministrative procedures that Congress has created. It\nseems to me that the dissent\u2019s vision of a troika partner-\nship (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage.\nThe discourse, conversation, and exchange that the dis-\nsent perceives is peculiarly one-sided. Congress pre-\nscribes; and where Congress\u2019s prescription is ambiguous\nthe Executive can (within the scope of the ambiguity)\nclarify that prescription; and if the product is constitu-\ntional the courts obey. I hardly think it amounts to a\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d that Congress or (as this Court would allow in\nits Brand X decision) the Executive can change its pre-\nscription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.\nWhat is needed for the system to work is that Congress,\nthe Executive, and the private parties subject to their\ndispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts\nwill give to their instructions. That goal would be ob-\nstructed if the judicially established meaning of a tech-\nnical legal term used in a very specific context could be\noverturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble\nas those asserted here.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    21   K.

See 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The Treasury De-\npartment has determined that taxpayers omit income\nunder this section not only when they fail to report a sale\nof property but also when they overstate their basis in\nthe property sold. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131, 26\nCFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131 (2011). The question is whether this\notherwise reasonable interpretation is foreclosed by the\nCourt\u2019s contrary reading of an earlier version of the stat-\nute in Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U. S. 28 (1958).\n  In Colony there was no need to decide whether the\nmeaning of the provision changed when Congress reen-\nacted it as part of the 1954 revision of the Tax Code. Al-\nthough the main text of the statute remained the same,\nCongress added new provisions leading to the permissible\nconclusion that it would have a different meaning going\nforward. The Colony decision reserved judgment on this\nissue. In my view, the amended statute leaves room for\nthe Department\u2019s reading. A summary of the reasons for\n2    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nconcluding the Department\u2019s interpretation is permissible,\nand for this respectful dissent, now follows.\n                              I\n  The statute at issue in Colony, 26 U. S. C. \u00a7275(c) (1940\ned.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1939. It provided for a longer period of limitations if\nthe Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer\nwho had \u201comit[ted] from gross income an amount . . . in\nexcess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income\nstated in the return.\u201d\n  There was disagreement in the courts about the mean-\ning of this provision in the statute as first enacted. The\nTax Court of the United States, and the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an over-\nstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross\nincome and could trigger the extended limitations period.\nSee, e.g., Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F. 2d 900, 902\u2013903\n(1944); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C.\n386 (1942). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case\nwhere a corporation misreported its income after inflating\nthe cost of goods it sold from inventory. See Uptegrove\nLumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F. 2d 570, 571\u2013573\n(1953). In the Third Circuit\u2019s view there could be an\nomission only where the taxpayer had left an entire \u201citem\nof gain out of his computation of gross income.\u201d Id., at\n571. In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court\nresolved that dispute against the Government. Acknowl-\nedging that \u201cit cannot be said that the language is unam-\nbiguous,\u201d 357 U. S., at 33, and relying in large part on the\nlegislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded\nthat the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an\nomission from gross income under \u00a7275(c).\n  If the Government is to prevail in the instant case the\nregulation in question must be a proper implementation of\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe same language the Court considered in Colony; but the\nstatutory interpretation issue here cannot be resolved, and\nthe Colony decision cannot be deemed controlling, without\nfirst considering the inferences that should be drawn from\nadded statutory text. The additional language was not\npart of the statute that governed the taxpayer\u2019s liability in\nColony, and the Court did not consider it in that case.\nCongress revised the Internal Revenue Code in 1954,\nseveral years before Colony was decided but after the tax\nyears in question in that case. Although the interpreta-\ntion adopted by the Court in Colony can be a proper be-\nginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute,\nit ought not to be the end.\n   The central language of the new provision remained\nthe same as the old, with the longer period of limitations\nstill applicable where a taxpayer had \u201comit[ted] from gross\nincome an amount . . . in excess of 25 per[cent] of the\namount of gross income stated in the return.\u201d In Colony,\nhowever, the Court left open whether Congress had none-\ntheless \u201cmanifested an intention to clarify or to change the\n1939 Code.\u201d Id., at 37. The 1954 revisions, of course,\ncould not provide a direct response to Colony, which had\nnot yet been decided. But there were indications that,\nwhatever the earlier version of the statute had meant,\nCongress expected that the overstatement of basis would\nbe considered an omission from gross income as a general\nrule going forward.\n   For example, the new law created a special exception for\nbusinesses by defining their gross income to be \u201cthe total\nof the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods\nor services\u201d without factoring in \u201cthe cost of such sales or\nservices.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(e)(1)(A)(i) (1958 ed.) (cur-\nrently \u00a76501(e)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)). The prin-\ncipal purpose of this provision, perhaps motivated by the\nfacts in the Third Circuit\u2019s Uptegrove decision, seems to have\nbeen to ensure that the extended statute of limitations\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwould not be activated by a business\u2019s overstatement of\nthe cost of goods sold. This did important work. There\nare, after all, unique complexities involved in calculating\ninventory costs. See, e.g., O. Whittington & K. Pany,\nPrinciples of Auditing and Other Assurance Services 488\n(15th ed. 2006) (\u201cThe audit of inventories presents the\nauditors with significant risk because: (a) they often rep-\nresent a very substantial portion of current assets, (b)\nnumerous valuation methods are used for inventories, (c)\nthe valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods\nsold, and (d) the determination of inventory quality, condi-\ntion, and value is inherently complex\u201d); see also Internal\nRevenue Service, Publication 538, Accounting Periods and\nMethods 17 (rev. Mar. 2008) (discussing methods for\nidentifying the cost of items in inventory). Congress\nsought fit to make clear that errors in these kinds of calcu-\nlations would not extend the limitations period.\n   Colony itself might be classified as a special \u201cbusiness\ninventory\u201d case. Unlike the taxpayers here, the taxpayer\nin Colony claimed to be a business with income from the\nsale of goods, though the \u201cgoods\u201d it held for sale were real\nestate lots. See Intermountain Ins. Serv. of Vail v. Com-\nmissioner, 650 F. 3d 691, 703 (CADC 2011) (Tatel, J.)\n(\u201cColony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or busi-\nness with income from the sale of goods or services\u2014i.e.,\nas falling within [clause] (i)\u2019s scope had the subsection\napplied pre-1954 . . .\u201d). The Court, in turn, observed that\nits construction of the pre-1954 statute in favor of the\ntaxpayer was \u201cin harmony with the unambiguous lan-\nguage of [newly enacted] \u00a76501(e)(1)(A).\u201d 357 U. S., at 37.\nClause (i) of the new provision, as just noted, ensured that\nthe extended limitations period would not cover overstated\ncosts of goods sold. The revised statute\u2019s special treatment\nof these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in\nother cases could have the effect of extending the limita-\ntions period.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   It is also significant that, after 1954, the statute contin-\nued to address the omission of a substantial \u201camount\u201d that\nshould have been included in gross income. In the same\nround of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established\nan extended limitations period in certain cases where\n\u201citems\u201d had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.\n26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(e)(2) (1958 ed.). There is at least some\nevidence that this term was used at that time to \u201cmak[e]\nit clear\u201d that the extended limitations period would not\napply \u201cmerely because of differences between the taxpayer\nand the Government as to the valuation of property.\u201d\nStaff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxa-\ntion, Summary of the New Provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1954, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 130 (Comm.\nPrint 1955). Congress\u2019s decision not to use the term\n\u201citems\u201d to achieve the same result when it reenacted the\nstatutory provision at issue is presumed to have been\npurposeful. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23\n(1983). This consideration casts further doubt on the\npremise that the new version of the statute, \u00a76501(e)(1)(A)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as\nits predecessor.\n                             II\n   In the instant case the Court concludes these statutory\nchanges are \u201ctoo fragile to bear the significant argumenta-\ntive weight the Government seeks to place upon them.\u201d\nAnte, at 5. But in this context, the changes are meaning-\nful. Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version\nof the statute could not be described as unambiguous, al-\nthough it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of\nbasis was not an omission from gross income. See 357\nU. S., at 33. The statutory revisions, which were not\nconsidered in Colony, may not compel the opposite conclu-\nsion under the new statute; but they strongly favor it. As\na result, there was room for the Treasury Department to\n6    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ninterpret the new provision in that manner. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845 (1984).\n   In an earlier case, and in an unrelated controversy not\nimplicating the Internal Revenue Code, the Court held\nthat a judicial construction of an ambiguous statute did\nnot foreclose an agency\u2019s later, inconsistent interpretation\nof the same provision. National Cable & Telecommunica-\ntions Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,\n982\u2013983 (2005) (\u201cOnly a judicial precedent holding that\nthe statute unambiguously forecloses the agency\u2019s inter-\npretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to\nfill, displaces a conflicting agency construction\u201d). This\ngeneral rule recognizes that filling gaps left by ambigu-\nities in a statute \u201cinvolves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.\u201d Id., at\n980. There has been no opportunity to decide whether the\nanalysis would be any different if an agency sought to\ninterpret an ambiguous statute in a way that was incon-\nsistent with this Court\u2019s own, earlier reading of the law.\nSee id., at 1003 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n   These issues are not implicated here. In Colony the\nCourt did interpret the same phrase that must be inter-\npreted in this case. The language was in a predecessor\nstatute, however, and Congress has added new language\nthat, in my view, controls the analysis and should instruct\nthe Court to reach a different outcome today. The Treas-\nury Department\u2019s regulations were promulgated in light of\nthese statutory revisions, which were not at issue in Col-\nony. There is a serious difficulty to insisting, as the Court\ndoes today, that an ambiguous provision must continue to\nbe read the same way even after it has been reenacted\nwith additional language suggesting Congress would\npermit a different interpretation. Agencies with the re-\nsponsibility and expertise necessary to administer ongoing\nregulatory schemes should have the latitude and discre-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntion to implement their interpretation of provisions reen-\nacted in a new statutory framework. And this is especially\nso when the new language enacted by Congress seems to\nfavor the very interpretation at issue. The approach taken\nby the Court instead forecloses later interpretations of a\nlaw that has changed in relevant ways. Cf. United States\nv. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 247 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cWorst of all, the majority\u2019s approach will lead\nto the ossification of large portions of our statutory law.\nWhere Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities remain am-\nbiguities subject to the agency\u2019s ongoing clarification\u201d).\nThe Court goes too far, in my respectful view, in constrict-\ning Congress\u2019s ability to leave agencies in charge of filling\nstatutory gaps.\n   Our legal system presumes there will be continuing\ndialogue among the three branches of Government on\nquestions of statutory interpretation and application. See\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 326 (2004)\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cConstant, constructive dis-\ncourse between our courts and our legislatures is an inte-\ngral and admirable part of the constitutional design\u201d);\nMistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989) (\u201cOur\nprinciple of separation of powers anticipates that the\ncoordinate Branches will converse with each other on\nmatters of vital common interest\u201d). In some cases Con-\ngress will set out a general principle, to be administered in\nmore detail by an agency in the exercise of its discretion.\nThe agency may be in a proper position to evaluate the\nbest means of implementing the statute in its practical\napplication. Where the agency exceeds its authority, of\ncourse, courts must invalidate the regulation. And agency\ninterpretations that lead to unjust or unfair consequences\ncan be corrected, much like disfavored judicial interpreta-\ntions, by congressional action. These instructive ex-\nchanges would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering\nto earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new,\n8      UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelevant statutory amendments. Courts instead should be\nopen to an agency\u2019s adoption of a different interpretation\nwhere, as here, Congress has given new instruction by an\namended statute.\n   Under the circumstances, the Treasury Department had\nauthority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new\ntax provision at issue. See Mayo Foundation for Medical\nEd. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. __, __ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10). This was also the conclusion reached in\nwell-reasoned opinions issued in several cases before the\nCourts of Appeals. E.g., Intermountain, 650 F. 3d, at 705\u2013\n706 (reaching this conclusion \u201cbecause the Court in Colony\nnever purported to interpret [the new provision]; because\n[the new provision]\u2019s \u2018omits from gross income\u2019 text is at\nleast ambiguous, if not best read to include overstate-\nments of basis; and because neither the section\u2019s structure\nnor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity\u201d).\n   The Department\u2019s clarification of an ambiguous statute,\napplicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate\nsettled expectations. Given the statutory changes de-\nscribed above, taxpayers had reason to question whether\nColony\u2019s holding extended to the revised \u00a76501(e)(1). See,\ne.g., CC & F Western Operations L. P. v. Commissioner,\n273 F. 3d 402, 406, n. 2 (CA1 2001) (\u201cWhether Colony\u2019s\nmain holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least\ndoubtful\u201d). Having worked no change in the law, and\ninstead having interpreted a statutory provision without\nan established meaning, the Department\u2019s regulation does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect. Cf. Smiley v.\nCitibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741, 744,\nn. 3 (1996) (rejecting retroactivity argument); Manhattan\nGen. Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U.

Argued January 17, 2012\u2014Decided April 25, 2012\nOrdinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency against a tax-\n payer within \u201c3 years after the return was filed,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(a),\n but that period is extended to 6 years when a taxpayer \u201comits from\n gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in ex-\n cess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,\u201d\n \u00a76501(e)(1)(A). Respondent taxpayers overstated the basis of certain\n property that they had sold. As a result, their returns understated\n the gross income they received from the sale by an amount in excess\n of 25%. The Commissioner asserted the deficiency outside the 3-year\n limitations period but within the 6-year period. The Fourth Circuit\n concluded that the taxpayers\u2019 overstatements of basis, and resulting\n understatements of gross income, did not trigger the extended limita-\n  tions period.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n634 F. 3d 249, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part IV\u2013C, concluding that \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) does not apply to an over-\n  statement of basis. Pp. 2\u20138.\n    (a) In Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U. S. 28, the Court inter-\n  preted a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 containing\n  language materially indistinguishable from the language at issue\n  here, holding that taxpayer misstatements that overstate the basis in\n  property do not fall within the statute\u2019s scope. The Court recognized\n  that such an overstatement wrongly understates a taxpayer\u2019s income,\n  but concluded that the phrase \u201comits . . . an amount\u201d limited the\n  statute\u2019s scope to situations in which specific receipts are left out of\n2       UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the computation of gross income. The Court also noted that while the\n    statute\u2019s language was not \u201cunambiguous,\u201d id., at 33, the statutory\n    history showed that Congress intended to restrict the extended limi-\n    tations period to situations that did not include overstatements of ba-\n    sis. Finally, the Court found its conclusion \u201cin harmony with the\n    unambiguous language of \u00a76501(e)(1)(A),\u201d id., at 37, the provision\n    enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and applicable\n    here. Pp. 2\u20134.\n       (b) Colony determines the outcome of this case. The operative lan-\n    guage of the 1939 provision and the provision at issue is identical. It\n    would be difficult to give the same language here a different interpre-\n    tation without overruling Colony, a course of action stare decisis\n    counsels against. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\n    U. S. 130, 139. The Government suggests that differences in other\n    nearby parts of the 1954 Code favor a different interpretation than\n    the one adopted in Colony. However, its arguments are too fragile to\n    bear the significant weight it seeks to place upon them. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (c) The Court also rejects the Government\u2019s argument that a re-\n    cently promulgated Treasury Regulation interpreting the statute\u2019s\n    operative language in its favor should be granted deference under\n    Chevron U.

HOME CONCRETE\n            & SUPPLY, LLC, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n                                [April 25, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court,\nexcept as to Part IV\u2013C.\n   Ordinarily, the Government must assess a deficiency\nagainst a taxpayer within \u201c3 years after the return was\nfiled.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(a) (2000 ed.). The 3-year period\nis extended to 6 years, however, when a taxpayer \u201comits\nfrom gross income an amount properly includible therein\nwhich is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross\nincome stated in the return.\u201d \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded). The question before us is whether this latter\nprovision applies (and extends the ordinary 3-year limita-\ntions period) when the taxpayer overstates his basis in\nproperty that he has sold, thereby understating the gain\nthat he received from its sale. Following Colony, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 357 U. S. 28 (1958), we hold that the provi-\nsion does not apply to an overstatement of basis. Hence\nthe 6-year period does not apply.\n                            I\n  For present purposes the relevant underlying circum-\nstances are not in dispute. We consequently assume that\n(1) the respondent taxpayers filed their relevant tax re-\n2    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nturns in April 2000; (2) the returns overstated the basis\nof certain property that the taxpayers had sold; (3) as a\nresult the returns understated the gross income that the\ntaxpayers received from the sale of the property; and\n(4) the understatement exceeded the statute\u2019s 25% thresh-\nold. We also take as undisputed that the Commissioner\nasserted the relevant deficiency within the extended 6-\nyear limitations period, but outside the default 3-year\nperiod. Thus, unless the 6-year statute of limitations\napplies, the Government\u2019s efforts to assert a tax deficiency\ncame too late. Our conclusion\u2014that the extended limita-\ntions period does not apply\u2014follows directly from this\nCourt\u2019s earlier decision in Colony.\n                            II\n  In Colony this Court interpreted a provision of the In-\nternal Revenue Code of 1939, the operative language of\nwhich is identical to the language now before us. The\nCommissioner there had determined\n    \u201cthat the taxpayer had understated the gross profits\n    on the sales of certain lots of land for residential pur-\n    poses as a result of having overstated the \u2018basis\u2019 of\n    such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain\n    unallowable items of development expense.\u201d Id., at\n    30.\nThe Commissioner\u2019s assessment came after the ordinary\n3-year limitations period had run. And, it was conse-\nquently timely only if the taxpayer, in the words of the\n1939 Code, had \u201comit[ted] from gross income an amount\nproperly includible therein which is in excess of 25 per cen-\ntum of the amount of gross income stated in the return . . . .\u201d\n26 U. S. C. \u00a7275(c) (1940 ed.). The Code provision ap-\nplicable to this case, adopted in 1954, contains materially\nindistinguishable language. See \u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (2000 ed.)\n(same, but replacing \u201cper centum\u201d with \u201cpercent\u201d). See also\nAppendix, infra.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Colony this Court held that taxpayer misstatements,\noverstating the basis in property, do not fall within the\nscope of the statute. But the Court recognized the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s contrary argument for inclusion. 357 U. S., at\n32. Then as now, the Code itself defined \u201cgross income\u201d in\nthis context as the difference between gross revenue (often\nthe amount the taxpayer received upon selling the prop-\nerty) and basis (often the amount the taxpayer paid for the\nproperty). Compare 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a722, 111 (1940 ed.) with\n\u00a7\u00a761(a)(3), 1001(a) (2000 ed.). And, the Commissioner\npointed out, an overstatement of basis can diminish the\n\u201camount\u201d of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off\nthe return might do. 357 U. S., at 32. Either way, the\nerror wrongly understates the taxpayer\u2019s income.\n   But, the Court added, the Commissioner\u2019s argument did\nnot fully account for the provision\u2019s language, in particular\nthe word \u201comit.\u201d The key phrase says \u201comits . . . an\namount.\u201d The word \u201comits\u201d (unlike, say, \u201creduces\u201d or \u201cun-\nderstates\u201d) means \u201c \u2018[t]o leave out or unmentioned; not\nto insert, include, or name.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary (2d ed. 1939)). Thus, taken\nliterally, \u201comit\u201d limits the statute\u2019s scope to situations in\nwhich specific receipts or accruals of income are left out\nof the computation of gross income; to inflate the basis,\nhowever, is not to \u201comit\u201d a specific item, not even of profit.\n   While finding this latter interpretation of the language\nthe \u201cmore plausibl[e],\u201d the Court also noted that the lan-\nguage was not \u201cunambiguous.\u201d Colony, 357 U. S., at 33. It\nthen examined various congressional Reports discussing\nthe relevant statutory language. It found in those Reports\n    \u201cpersuasive indications that Congress merely had in\n    mind failures to report particular income receipts and\n    accruals, and did not intend the [extended] limitation\n    to apply whenever gross income was understated . . . .\u201d\n    Id., at 35.\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThis \u201chistory,\u201d the Court said, \u201cshows . . . that the Con-\ngress intended an exception to the usual three-year stat-\nute of limitations only in the restricted type of situation\nalready described,\u201d a situation that did not include over-\nstatements of basis. Id., at 36.\n  The Court wrote that Congress, in enacting the\nprovision,\n    \u201cmanifested no broader purpose than to give the\n    Commissioner an additional two [now three] years to\n    investigate tax returns in cases where, because of a\n    taxpayer\u2019s omission to report some taxable item, the\n    Commissioner is at a special disadvantage . . . [be-\n    cause] the return on its face provides no clue to the ex-\n    istence of the omitted item. . . . [W]hen, as here [i.e.,\n    where the overstatement of basis is at issue], the un-\n    derstatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting\n    an item disclosed on the face of the return the Com-\n    missioner is at no such disadvantage . . . whether the\n    error be one affecting \u2018gross income\u2019 or one, such as\n    overstated deductions, affecting other parts of the re-\n    turn.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n  Finally, the Court noted that Congress had recently\nenacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. And the\nCourt observed that \u201cthe conclusion we reach is in har-\nmony with the unambiguous language of \u00a76501(e)(1)(A),\u201d\nid., at 37, i.e., the provision relevant in this present case.\n                             III\n   In our view, Colony determines the outcome in this case.\nThe provision before us is a 1954 reenactment of the 1939\nprovision that Colony interpreted. The operative language\nis identical. It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to\ngive the same language here a different interpretation\nwithout effectively overruling Colony, a course of action\nthat basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto take. John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552\nU. S. 130, 139 (2008) (\u201c[S]tare decisis in respect to statu-\ntory interpretation has special force, for Congress remains\nfree to alter what we have done\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.\n164, 172\u2013173 (1989).\n  The Government, in an effort to convince us to interpret\nthe operative language before us differently, points to\ndifferences in other nearby parts of the 1954 Code. It\nsuggests that these differences counsel in favor of a differ-\nent interpretation than the one adopted in Colony. For\nexample, the Government points to a new provision,\n\u00a76501(e)(1)(A)(i), which says:\n    \u201cIn the case of a trade or business, the term \u2018gross in-\n    come\u2019 means the total of the amounts received or ac-\n    crued from the sale of goods or services (if such\n    amounts are required to be shown on the return) prior\n    to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.\u201d\nIf the section\u2019s basic phrase \u201comi[ssion] from gross income\u201d\ndoes not apply to overstatements of basis (which is what\nColony held), then what need would there be for clause (i),\nwhich leads to the same result in a specific subset of\ncases?\n   And why, the Government adds, does a later paragraph,\nreferring to gifts and estates, speak of a taxpayer who\n\u201comits . . . items includible in [the] gross estate\u201d? See\n\u00a76501(e)(2) (emphasis added). By speaking of \u201citems\u201d\nthere does it not imply that omission of an \u201camount\u201d cov-\ners more than omission of individual items\u2014indeed that\nit includes overstatements of basis, which, after all, di-\nminish the amount of the profit that should have been re-\nported as gross income?\n   In our view, these points are too fragile to bear the sig-\nnificant argumentative weight the Government seeks to\nplace upon them. For example, at least one plausible\n6    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreason why Congress might have added clause (i) has\nnothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the\ngeneral rule. Rather when Congress wrote the 1954 Code\n(prior to Colony), it did not yet know how the Court would\ninterpret the provision\u2019s operative language. At least one\nlower court had decided that the provision did not apply to\noverstatements about the cost of goods that a business\nlater sold. See Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner,\n204 F. 2d 570 (CA3 1953). But see Reis v. Commissioner,\n142 F. 2d 900, 902\u2013903 (CA6 1944). And Congress could\nwell have wanted to ensure that, come what may in the\nSupreme Court, Uptegrove\u2019s interpretation would remain\nthe law where a \u201ctrade or business\u201d was at issue.\n   Nor does our interpretation leave clause (i) without\nwork to do. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid mak-\ning any provision \u201csuperfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). That provision also\nexplains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of\ndetermining whether a conceded omission amounts to 25%\nof \u201cgross income.\u201d For example, it tells us that a merchant\nwho fails to include $10,000 of revenue from sold goods\nhas not met the 25% test if total revenue is more than\n$40,000, regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to\nacquire those goods. But without clause (i), the general\nstatutory definition of \u201cgross income\u201d requires subtracting\nthe cost from the sales price. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a761(a)(3),\n1012. Under such a definition of \u201cgross income,\u201d the cal-\nculation would take (1) total revenue from sales, $40,000,\nminus (2) \u201cthe cost of such sales,\u201d say, $25,000. The\n$10,000 of revenue would thus amount to 67% of the\n\u201cgross income\u201d of $15,000. And the clause does this work\nin respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of\nour interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.\n   The Government\u2019s argument about subsection (e)(2)\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201citem\u201d instead of \u201camount\u201d is yet weaker.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Court in Colony addressed a similar argument about\nthe word \u201camount.\u201d It wrote:\n    \u201cThe Commissioner states that the draftsman\u2019s use\n    of the word \u2018amount\u2019 (instead of, for example, \u2018item\u2019)\n    suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of\n    the error\u2014that is whether or not gross income was\n    understated by as much as 25%.\u201d 357 U. S., at 32.\nBut the Court, while recognizing the Commissioner\u2019s logic,\nrejected the argument (and the significance of the word\n\u201camount\u201d) as insufficient to prove the Commissioner\u2019s\nconclusion. And the addition of the word \u201citem\u201d in a dif-\nferent subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive\nforce sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion. The\nword\u2019s appearance in subsection (e)(2), we concede, is new.\nBut to rely in the case before us on this solitary word\nchange in a different subsection is like hoping that a new\nbatboy will change the outcome of the World Series.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   Finally, the Government points to Treasury Regulation\n\u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131, which was promulgated in final form in\nDecember 2010. See 26 CFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131 (2011). The\nregulation, as relevant here, departs from Colony and\ninterprets the operative language of the statute in the\nGovernment\u2019s favor. The regulation says that \u201can un-\nderstated amount of gross income resulting from an over-\nstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an\nomission from gross income.\u201d \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131(a)(1)(iii). In\nthe Government\u2019s view this new regulation in effect over-\nturns Colony\u2019s interpretation of this statute.\n   The Government points out that the Treasury Regula-\ntion constitutes \u201can agency\u2019s construction of a statute\nwhich it administers.\u201d Chevron, U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).\n8    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nSee also Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v.\nUnited States, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (applying Chevron in\nthe tax context). The Court has written that a \u201ccourt\u2019s\nprior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency\nconstruction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only\nif the prior court decision holds that its construction fol-\nlows from the unambiguous terms of the statute . . . .\u201d\nNational Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005) (emphasis\nadded). And, as the Government notes, in Colony itself\nthe Court wrote that \u201cit cannot be said that the language\nis unambiguous.\u201d 357 U. S., at 33. Hence, the Government\nconcludes, Colony cannot govern the outcome in this case.\nThe question, rather, is whether the agency\u2019s construction\nis a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron,\nsupra, at 843. And, since the Government argues that the\nregulation embodies a reasonable, hence permissible,\nconstruction of the statute, the Government believes it\nmust win.\n                             B\n  We do not accept this argument. In our view, Colony\nhas already interpreted the statute, and there is no longer\nany different construction that is consistent with Colony\nand available for adoption by the agency.\n                                C\n  The fatal flaw in the Government\u2019s contrary argument\nis that it overlooks the reason why Brand X held that a\n\u201cprior judicial construction,\u201d unless reflecting an \u201cunam-\nbiguous\u201d statute, does not trump a different agency con-\nstruction of that statute. 545 U. S., at 982. The Court\nreveals that reason when it points out that \u201cit is for agen-\ncies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps.\u201d Ibid. The fact that\na statute is unambiguous means that there is \u201cno gap for\nthe agency to fill\u201d and thus \u201cno room for agency discre-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Those\nopinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as\nthat of deciding whether, or when, a particular statute in\neffect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap, there-\nby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a rea-\nsonable gap-filling interpretation. Thus, in Chevron the\nCourt said that, when\n    \u201cCongress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to\n    fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the\n    agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute\n    by regulation. . . . Sometimes the legislative delega-\n    tion to an agency on a particular question is implicit\n    rather than explicit. [But in either instance], a court\n    may not substitute its own construction of a statutory\n    provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the\n    administrator of an agency.\u201d 467 U. S., at 843\u2013844.\nSee also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\n(2001); Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S.\n735, 741 (1996); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421,\n448 (1987); Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231 (1974).\n  Chevron and later cases find in unambiguous language\na clear sign that Congress did not delegate gap-filling\nauthority to an agency; and they find in ambiguous lan-\nguage at least a presumptive indication that Congress did\ndelegate that gap-filling authority. Thus, in Chevron the\nCourt wrote that a statute\u2019s silence or ambiguity as to\na particular issue means that Congress has not \u201cdirectly\naddressed the precise question at issue\u201d (thus likely dele-\ngating gap-filling power to the agency). 467 U. S., at 843.\nIn Mead the Court, describing Chevron, explained:\n    \u201cCongress . . . may not have expressly delegated au-\n    thority or responsibility to implement a particular\n    provision or fill a particular gap. Yet it can still be\n10   UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n     apparent from the agency\u2019s generally conferred au-\n     thority and other statutory circumstances that Con-\n     gress would expect the agency to be able to speak with\n     the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the\n     statute or fills a space in the enacted law, even one\n     about which Congress did not actually have an intent\n     as to a particular result.\u201d 533 U. S., at 229 (internal\n     quotation marks omitted).\nChevron added that \u201c[i]f a court, employing traditional\ntools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress\nhad an intention on the precise question at issue, that\nintention is the law and must be given effect.\u201d 467 U. S.,\nat 843, n. 9 (emphasis added).\n   As the Government points out, the Court in Colony\nstated that the statutory language at issue is not \u201cunam-\nbiguous.\u201d 357 U. S., at 33. But the Court decided that\ncase nearly 30 years before it decided Chevron. There is\nno reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by\nColony reflects a post-Chevron conclusion that Congress\nhad delegated gap-filling power to the agency. At the\nsame time, there is every reason to believe that the Court\nthought that Congress had \u201cdirectly spoken to the ques-\ntion at hand,\u201d and thus left \u201c[no] gap for the agency to fill.\u201d\nChevron, supra, at 842\u2013843.\n   For one thing, the Court said that the taxpayer had the\nbetter side of the textual argument. Colony, 357 U. S., at\n33. For another, its examination of legislative history led\nit to believe that Congress had decided the question defini-\ntively, leaving no room for the agency to reach a contrary\nresult. It found in that history \u201cpersuasive indications\u201d\nthat Congress intended overstatements of basis to fall\noutside the statute\u2019s scope, and it said that it was satisfied\nthat Congress \u201cintended an exception . . . only in the re-\nstricted type of situation\u201d it had already described.

And it reached this conclusion despite the fact\nthat, in the years leading up to Colony, the Commissioner\nhad consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit\ncourts. See, e.g., Uptegrove, 204 F. 2d 570; Reis, 142 F. 2d\n900; Goodenow v. Commisioner, 238 F. 2d 20 (CA8 1956);\nAmerican Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C. 386\n(1942). Cf. Slaff v. Commisioner, 220 F. 2d 65 (CA9 1955);\nDavis v. Hightower, 230 F. 2d 549 (CA5 1956). Thus, the\nCourt was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. And finally, after\ncompleting its analysis, Colony found its interpretation of\nthe 1939 Code \u201cin harmony with the [now] unambiguous\nlanguage\u201d of the 1954 Code, which at a minimum suggests\nthat the Court saw nothing in the 1954 Code as incon-\nsistent with its conclusion. 357 U. S., at 37.\n   It may be that judges today would use other methods to\ndetermine whether Congress left a gap to fill. But that\nis beside the point. The question is whether the Court in\nColony concluded that the statute left such a gap. And, in\nour view, the opinion (written by Justice Harlan for the\nCourt) makes clear that it did not.\n   Given principles of stare decisis, we must follow that\ninterpretation.

Because of justifiable taxpayer reli-\nance I would not take that course\u2014and neither does the\nCourt\u2019s opinion, which says that \u201cColony determines the\noutcome in this case.\u201d Ante, at 4. That should be the end\nof the matter.\n   The plurality, however, goes on to address the Govern-\nment\u2019s argument that Treasury Regulation \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131\neffectively overturned Colony. See 26 CFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131\n(2011). In my view, that cannot be: \u201cOnce a court has\ndecided upon its de novo construction of the statute, there\nno longer is a different construction that is consistent with\nthe court\u2019s holding and available for adoption by the agen-\ncy.\u201d National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand\nX Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 1018, n. 12 (2005)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). That view, of course, did not carry the\nday in Brand X, and the Government quite reasonably\nrelies on the Brand X majority\u2019s innovative pronounce-\nment that a \u201ccourt\u2019s prior judicial construction of a statute\n2     UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ntrumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chev\u00ad\nron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its\nconstruction follows from the unambiguous terms of the\nstatute.\u201d Id., at 982.\n   In cases decided pre-Brand X, the Court had no inkling\nthat it must utter the magic words \u201cambiguous\u201d or \u201cun-\nambiguous\u201d in order to (poof !) expand or abridge execu-\ntive power, and (poof !) enable or disable administrative\ncontradiction of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Court\nwas unaware of even the utility (much less the necessity)\nof making the ambiguous/nonambiguous determination in\ncases decided pre-Chevron, before that opinion made the\nso-called \u201cStep 1\u201d determination of ambiguity vel non a\ncustomary (though hardly mandatory1) part of judicial-\nreview analysis. For many of those earlier cases, there-\nfore, it will be incredibly difficult to determine whether the\ndecision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous,\nor rather an unambiguous, statute.\n   Thus, one would have thought that the Brand X major-\nity would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case, in-\nvolving a pre-Chevron opinion that (mirabile dictu) makes\nit inescapably clear that the Court thought the statute\nambiguous: \u201cIt cannot be said that the language is unam\u00ad\nbiguous.\u201d Colony, supra, at 33 (emphasis added). As\ntoday\u2019s plurality opinion explains, Colony \u201csaid that the\ntaxpayer had the better side of the textual argument,\u201d\nante, at 10 (emphasis added)\u2014not what Brand X requires\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 \u201cStep 1\u201d has never been an essential part of Chevron analysis.\n\nWhether a particular statute is ambiguous makes no difference if the\ninterpretation adopted by the agency is clearly reasonable\u2014and it\nwould be a waste of time to conduct that inquiry. See Entergy Corp. v.\nRiverkeeper, Inc., 556 U. S. 208, 218, and n. 4 (2009). The same would\nbe true if the agency interpretation is clearly beyond the scope of any\nconceivable ambiguity. It does not matter whether the word \u201cyellow\u201d is\nambiguous when the agency has interpreted it to mean \u201cpurple.\u201d See\nStephenson & Vermeule, Chevron Has Only One Step, 95 Va. L.

See United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 245\u2013246 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning); Bressman, How Mead Has Muddled Judicial Review\nof Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1457\u20131475\n(2005). Of course there is no doubt that, with regard to\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Treasury Department\nsatisfies the Mead requirement of some indication \u201cthat\nCongress delegated authority to the agency generally to\nmake rules carrying the force of law.\u201d 533 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 11\u201312). But in order to evade Brand X and yet\nreaffirm Colony, the plurality would add yet another lop-\nsided story to the ugly and improbable structure that our\nlaw of administrative review has become: To trigger the\nBrand X power of an authorized \u201cgap-filling\u201d agency to\ngive content to an ambiguous text, a pre-Chevron determi-\nnation that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice;\nthe pre-Chevron Court must in addition have found that\nCongress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to\nbe resolved by the agency. And here, today\u2019s plurality\nopinion finds, \u201c[t]here is no reason to believe that the\nlinguistic ambiguity noted by Colony reflects a post-\nChevron conclusion that Congress had delegated gap-\nfilling power to the agency.\u201d Ante, at 10. The notion,\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nseemingly, is that post-Chevron a finding of ambiguity is\naccompanied by a finding of agency authority to resolve\nthe ambiguity, but pre-Chevron that was not so. The\npremise is false. Post-Chevron cases do not \u201cconclude\u201d\nthat Congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved\nby the agency; that is simply the legal effect of ambi-\nguity\u2014a legal effect that should obtain whenever the\nlanguage is in fact (as Colony found) ambiguous.\n    Does the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to\nColony\u2019s determination of ambiguity because the Court did\nnot know, in that era, the importance of that determina-\ntion\u2014that it would empower the agency to (in effect)\nrevise the Court\u2019s determination of statutory meaning?\nBut as I suggested earlier, that was an ignorance which all\nof our cases shared not just pre-Chevron, but pre-Brand X.\nBefore then it did not really matter whether the Court was\nresolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute\u2019s clear\nmeaning. The opinion might (or might not) advert to\nthat point in the course of its analysis, but either way\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute would be the law.\nSo it is no small number of still-authoritative cases\nthat today\u2019s plurality opinion would exile to the Land of\nUncertainty.\n    Perhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach, the\nplurality opinion then pivots (as the \u00e0 la mode vernacular\nhas it)\u2014from focusing on whether Colony concluded that\nthere was gap-filling authority to focusing on whether\nColony concluded that there was any gap to be filled: \u201cThe\nquestion is whether the Court in Colony concluded that\nthe statute left such a gap. And, in our view, the opinion\n. . . makes clear that it did not.\u201d Ante, at 11. How does the\nplurality know this? Because Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion\n\u201csaid that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual\nargument\u201d; because it found that legislative history indi-\ncated \u201cthat Congress intended overstatements of basis to\nfall outside the statute\u2019s scope\u201d; because it concluded that\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Ante, at 10\u201311 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But these are the sorts of arguments\nthat courts always use in resolving ambiguities. They do\nnot prove that no ambiguity existed, unless one believes\nthat an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never\nexisted in the first place. Colony said unambiguously that\nthe text was ambiguous, and that should be an end of the\nmatter\u2014unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis\neffect to Colony as a pre-Chevron decision.\n   Rather than making our judicial-review jurisprudence\ncuriouser and curiouser, the Court should abandon the\nopinion that produces these contortions, Brand X. I join\nthe judgment announced by the Court because it is indis-\nputable that Colony resolved the construction of the statu-\ntory language at issue here, and that construction must\ntherefore control. And I join the Court\u2019s opinion except for\nPart IV\u2013C.\n                         *     *    *\n   I must add a word about the peroration of the dissent,\nwhich asserts that \u201c[o]ur legal system presumes there\nwill be continuing dialogue among the three branches of\nGovernment on questions of statutory interpretation and\napplication,\u201d and that the \u201cconstructive discourse,\u201d \u201c \u2018con-\nvers[ations],\u2019 \u201d and \u201cinstructive exchanges\u201d would be \u201cfore-\nclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpreta-\ntions of a statute even in light of new, relevant statutory\namendments.\u201d Post, at 7\u20138 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). This\npassage is reminiscent of Professor K. C.

Natural Resources Defense Coun\u00ad\ncil, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978), which held that Congress\nprescribes and we obey, with no discretion to add to the\nadministrative procedures that Congress has created. It\nseems to me that the dissent\u2019s vision of a troika partner-\nship (legislative-executive-judicial) is a similar mirage.\nThe discourse, conversation, and exchange that the dis-\nsent perceives is peculiarly one-sided. Congress pre-\nscribes; and where Congress\u2019s prescription is ambiguous\nthe Executive can (within the scope of the ambiguity)\nclarify that prescription; and if the product is constitu-\ntional the courts obey. I hardly think it amounts to a\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d that Congress or (as this Court would allow in\nits Brand X decision) the Executive can change its pre-\nscription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.\nWhat is needed for the system to work is that Congress,\nthe Executive, and the private parties subject to their\ndispositions, be able to predict the meaning that the courts\nwill give to their instructions. That goal would be ob-\nstructed if the judicially established meaning of a tech-\nnical legal term used in a very specific context could be\noverturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble\nas those asserted here.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    21   K.

See 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a76501(e)(1)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The Treasury De-\npartment has determined that taxpayers omit income\nunder this section not only when they fail to report a sale\nof property but also when they overstate their basis in\nthe property sold. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131, 26\nCFR \u00a7301.6501(e)\u20131 (2011). The question is whether this\notherwise reasonable interpretation is foreclosed by the\nCourt\u2019s contrary reading of an earlier version of the stat-\nute in Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U. S. 28 (1958).\n  In Colony there was no need to decide whether the\nmeaning of the provision changed when Congress reen-\nacted it as part of the 1954 revision of the Tax Code. Al-\nthough the main text of the statute remained the same,\nCongress added new provisions leading to the permissible\nconclusion that it would have a different meaning going\nforward. The Colony decision reserved judgment on this\nissue. In my view, the amended statute leaves room for\nthe Department\u2019s reading. A summary of the reasons for\n2    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nconcluding the Department\u2019s interpretation is permissible,\nand for this respectful dissent, now follows.\n                              I\n  The statute at issue in Colony, 26 U. S. C. \u00a7275(c) (1940\ned.), was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1939. It provided for a longer period of limitations if\nthe Government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer\nwho had \u201comit[ted] from gross income an amount . . . in\nexcess of 25 per centum of the amount of gross income\nstated in the return.\u201d\n  There was disagreement in the courts about the mean-\ning of this provision in the statute as first enacted. The\nTax Court of the United States, and the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that an over-\nstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross\nincome and could trigger the extended limitations period.\nSee, e.g., Reis v. Commissioner, 142 F. 2d 900, 902\u2013903\n(1944); American Liberty Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 1 T. C.\n386 (1942). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case\nwhere a corporation misreported its income after inflating\nthe cost of goods it sold from inventory. See Uptegrove\nLumber Co. v. Commissioner, 204 F. 2d 570, 571\u2013573\n(1953). In the Third Circuit\u2019s view there could be an\nomission only where the taxpayer had left an entire \u201citem\nof gain out of his computation of gross income.\u201d Id., at\n571. In the Colony decision, issued in 1958, this Court\nresolved that dispute against the Government. Acknowl-\nedging that \u201cit cannot be said that the language is unam-\nbiguous,\u201d 357 U. S., at 33, and relying in large part on the\nlegislative history of the 1939 Code, the Court concluded\nthat the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an\nomission from gross income under \u00a7275(c).\n  If the Government is to prevail in the instant case the\nregulation in question must be a proper implementation of\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe same language the Court considered in Colony; but the\nstatutory interpretation issue here cannot be resolved, and\nthe Colony decision cannot be deemed controlling, without\nfirst considering the inferences that should be drawn from\nadded statutory text. The additional language was not\npart of the statute that governed the taxpayer\u2019s liability in\nColony, and the Court did not consider it in that case.\nCongress revised the Internal Revenue Code in 1954,\nseveral years before Colony was decided but after the tax\nyears in question in that case. Although the interpreta-\ntion adopted by the Court in Colony can be a proper be-\nginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute,\nit ought not to be the end.\n   The central language of the new provision remained\nthe same as the old, with the longer period of limitations\nstill applicable where a taxpayer had \u201comit[ted] from gross\nincome an amount . . . in excess of 25 per[cent] of the\namount of gross income stated in the return.\u201d In Colony,\nhowever, the Court left open whether Congress had none-\ntheless \u201cmanifested an intention to clarify or to change the\n1939 Code.\u201d Id., at 37. The 1954 revisions, of course,\ncould not provide a direct response to Colony, which had\nnot yet been decided. But there were indications that,\nwhatever the earlier version of the statute had meant,\nCongress expected that the overstatement of basis would\nbe considered an omission from gross income as a general\nrule going forward.\n   For example, the new law created a special exception for\nbusinesses by defining their gross income to be \u201cthe total\nof the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods\nor services\u201d without factoring in \u201cthe cost of such sales or\nservices.\u201d 26 U.

The prin-\ncipal purpose of this provision, perhaps motivated by the\nfacts in the Third Circuit\u2019s Uptegrove decision, seems to have\nbeen to ensure that the extended statute of limitations\n4    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwould not be activated by a business\u2019s overstatement of\nthe cost of goods sold. This did important work. There\nare, after all, unique complexities involved in calculating\ninventory costs. See, e.g., O. Whittington & K. Pany,\nPrinciples of Auditing and Other Assurance Services 488\n(15th ed. 2006) (\u201cThe audit of inventories presents the\nauditors with significant risk because: (a) they often rep-\nresent a very substantial portion of current assets, (b)\nnumerous valuation methods are used for inventories, (c)\nthe valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods\nsold, and (d) the determination of inventory quality, condi-\ntion, and value is inherently complex\u201d); see also Internal\nRevenue Service, Publication 538, Accounting Periods and\nMethods 17 (rev. Mar. 2008) (discussing methods for\nidentifying the cost of items in inventory). Congress\nsought fit to make clear that errors in these kinds of calcu-\nlations would not extend the limitations period.\n   Colony itself might be classified as a special \u201cbusiness\ninventory\u201d case. Unlike the taxpayers here, the taxpayer\nin Colony claimed to be a business with income from the\nsale of goods, though the \u201cgoods\u201d it held for sale were real\nestate lots. See Intermountain Ins. Serv. of Vail v. Com-\nmissioner, 650 F. 3d 691, 703 (CADC 2011) (Tatel, J.)\n(\u201cColony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or busi-\nness with income from the sale of goods or services\u2014i.e.,\nas falling within [clause] (i)\u2019s scope had the subsection\napplied pre-1954 . . .\u201d). The Court, in turn, observed that\nits construction of the pre-1954 statute in favor of the\ntaxpayer was \u201cin harmony with the unambiguous lan-\nguage of [newly enacted] \u00a76501(e)(1)(A).\u201d 357 U. S., at 37.\nClause (i) of the new provision, as just noted, ensured that\nthe extended limitations period would not cover overstated\ncosts of goods sold. The revised statute\u2019s special treatment\nof these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in\nother cases could have the effect of extending the limita-\ntions period.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   It is also significant that, after 1954, the statute contin-\nued to address the omission of a substantial \u201camount\u201d that\nshould have been included in gross income. In the same\nround of revisions to the Tax Code, Congress established\nan extended limitations period in certain cases where\n\u201citems\u201d had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.\n26 U. S. C. \u00a76501(e)(2) (1958 ed.). There is at least some\nevidence that this term was used at that time to \u201cmak[e]\nit clear\u201d that the extended limitations period would not\napply \u201cmerely because of differences between the taxpayer\nand the Government as to the valuation of property.\u201d\nStaff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxa-\ntion, Summary of the New Provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1954, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 130 (Comm.\nPrint 1955). Congress\u2019s decision not to use the term\n\u201citems\u201d to achieve the same result when it reenacted the\nstatutory provision at issue is presumed to have been\npurposeful. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23\n(1983). This consideration casts further doubt on the\npremise that the new version of the statute, \u00a76501(e)(1)(A)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV), necessarily has the same meaning as\nits predecessor.\n                             II\n   In the instant case the Court concludes these statutory\nchanges are \u201ctoo fragile to bear the significant argumenta-\ntive weight the Government seeks to place upon them.\u201d\nAnte, at 5. But in this context, the changes are meaning-\nful. Colony made clear that the text of the earlier version\nof the statute could not be described as unambiguous, al-\nthough it ultimately concluded that an overstatement of\nbasis was not an omission from gross income. See 357\nU. S., at 33. The statutory revisions, which were not\nconsidered in Colony, may not compel the opposite conclu-\nsion under the new statute; but they strongly favor it. As\na result, there was room for the Treasury Department to\n6    UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ninterpret the new provision in that manner. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845 (1984).\n   In an earlier case, and in an unrelated controversy not\nimplicating the Internal Revenue Code, the Court held\nthat a judicial construction of an ambiguous statute did\nnot foreclose an agency\u2019s later, inconsistent interpretation\nof the same provision. National Cable & Telecommunica-\ntions Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,\n982\u2013983 (2005) (\u201cOnly a judicial precedent holding that\nthe statute unambiguously forecloses the agency\u2019s inter-\npretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to\nfill, displaces a conflicting agency construction\u201d). This\ngeneral rule recognizes that filling gaps left by ambigu-\nities in a statute \u201cinvolves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.\u201d Id., at\n980. There has been no opportunity to decide whether the\nanalysis would be any different if an agency sought to\ninterpret an ambiguous statute in a way that was incon-\nsistent with this Court\u2019s own, earlier reading of the law.\nSee id., at 1003 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n   These issues are not implicated here. In Colony the\nCourt did interpret the same phrase that must be inter-\npreted in this case. The language was in a predecessor\nstatute, however, and Congress has added new language\nthat, in my view, controls the analysis and should instruct\nthe Court to reach a different outcome today. The Treas-\nury Department\u2019s regulations were promulgated in light of\nthese statutory revisions, which were not at issue in Col-\nony. There is a serious difficulty to insisting, as the Court\ndoes today, that an ambiguous provision must continue to\nbe read the same way even after it has been reenacted\nwith additional language suggesting Congress would\npermit a different interpretation. Agencies with the re-\nsponsibility and expertise necessary to administer ongoing\nregulatory schemes should have the latitude and discre-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntion to implement their interpretation of provisions reen-\nacted in a new statutory framework. And this is especially\nso when the new language enacted by Congress seems to\nfavor the very interpretation at issue. The approach taken\nby the Court instead forecloses later interpretations of a\nlaw that has changed in relevant ways. Cf. United States\nv. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 247 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cWorst of all, the majority\u2019s approach will lead\nto the ossification of large portions of our statutory law.\nWhere Chevron applies, statutory ambiguities remain am-\nbiguities subject to the agency\u2019s ongoing clarification\u201d).\nThe Court goes too far, in my respectful view, in constrict-\ning Congress\u2019s ability to leave agencies in charge of filling\nstatutory gaps.\n   Our legal system presumes there will be continuing\ndialogue among the three branches of Government on\nquestions of statutory interpretation and application. See\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 326 (2004)\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (\u201cConstant, constructive dis-\ncourse between our courts and our legislatures is an inte-\ngral and admirable part of the constitutional design\u201d);\nMistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989) (\u201cOur\nprinciple of separation of powers anticipates that the\ncoordinate Branches will converse with each other on\nmatters of vital common interest\u201d). In some cases Con-\ngress will set out a general principle, to be administered in\nmore detail by an agency in the exercise of its discretion.\nThe agency may be in a proper position to evaluate the\nbest means of implementing the statute in its practical\napplication. Where the agency exceeds its authority, of\ncourse, courts must invalidate the regulation. And agency\ninterpretations that lead to unjust or unfair consequences\ncan be corrected, much like disfavored judicial interpreta-\ntions, by congressional action. These instructive ex-\nchanges would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering\nto earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new,\n8      UNITED STATES v. HOME CONCRETE & SUPPLY, LLC\n\n                      KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelevant statutory amendments. Courts instead should be\nopen to an agency\u2019s adoption of a different interpretation\nwhere, as here, Congress has given new instruction by an\namended statute.\n   Under the circumstances, the Treasury Department had\nauthority to adopt its reasonable interpretation of the new\ntax provision at issue. See Mayo Foundation for Medical\nEd. and Research v. United States, 562 U. S. __, __ (2011)\n(slip op., at 10). This was also the conclusion reached in\nwell-reasoned opinions issued in several cases before the\nCourts of Appeals. E.g., Intermountain, 650 F. 3d, at 705\u2013\n706 (reaching this conclusion \u201cbecause the Court in Colony\nnever purported to interpret [the new provision]; because\n[the new provision]\u2019s \u2018omits from gross income\u2019 text is at\nleast ambiguous, if not best read to include overstate-\nments of basis; and because neither the section\u2019s structure\nnor its [history and context] removes this ambiguity\u201d).\n   The Department\u2019s clarification of an ambiguous statute,\napplicable to these taxpayers, did not upset legitimate\nsettled expectations. Given the statutory changes de-\nscribed above, taxpayers had reason to question whether\nColony\u2019s holding extended to the revised \u00a76501(e)(1). See,\ne.g., CC & F Western Operations L. P. v. Commissioner,\n273 F. 3d 402, 406, n. 2 (CA1 2001) (\u201cWhether Colony\u2019s\nmain holding carries over to section 6501(e)(1) is at least\ndoubtful\u201d). Having worked no change in the law, and\ninstead having interpreted a statutory provision without\nan established meaning, the Department\u2019s regulation does\nnot have an impermissible retroactive effect. Cf. Smiley v.\nCitibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 741, 744,\nn. 3 (1996) (rejecting retroactivity argument); Manhattan\nGen. Equipment Co. v. Commissioner, 297 U. S. 129, 135\n(1936) (same). It controls in this case.\n                         *    *     * \n\n    For these reasons, and with respect, I dissent. \n\n</pre>",
