ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 11\u2013159.      Argued March 19, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012\nEighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, re-\n  spondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in\n  vitro fertilization using her husband\u2019s frozen sperm. Karen applied\n  for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins. The Social Secu-\n  rity Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District\n  Court affirmed. In accord with the SSA\u2019s construction of the Social\n  Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify\n  for benefits only if, as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could\n  inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.\n  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his\n  death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children\n  do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession. The\n  Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under \u00a7416(e), which de-\n  fines child to mean, inter alia, \u201cthe child or legally adopted child of an\n  [insured] individual,\u201d the undisputed biological children of an insured\n  and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state\n  intestacy law.\nHeld: The SSA\u2019s reading is better attuned to the statute\u2019s text and its\n design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage\n earner in his or her lifetime. Moreover, even if the SSA\u2019s longstand-\n ing interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a per-\n missible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.\n Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Pp. 4\u2013\n 16.\n    (a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant\n here, \u201c[e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title)\u201d of a de-\n2                           ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ceased insured individual \u201cshall be entitled to a child\u2019s insurance\n    benefit.\u201d \u00a7402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines \u201cchild\u201d to mean:\n    \u201c(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild\n    [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or\n    stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain condi-\n    tions].\u201d Unlike \u00a7\u00a7416(e)(2) and (3), \u00a7416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of\n    the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section\n    416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term \u201cchild,\u201d providing:\n    \u201cIn determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]\n    insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner\n    of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured indi-\n    vidual\u2019s domiciliary State].\u201d An applicant who does not meet\n    \u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for\n    benefits under other criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but\n    respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Reg-\n    ulations promulgated by the SSA closely track \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2) and (3) in\n    defining \u201c[w]ho is the insured\u2019s natural child,\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7404.355. As\n    the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h) governs the meaning of\n    \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all appli-\n    cants for insurance benefits as a \u201cchild\u201d must pass. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) While the SSA regards \u00a7416(h) as completing \u00a7416(e)\u2019s sparse\n    definition of \u201cchild,\u201d the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,\n    that \u00a7416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married cou-\n    ple\u2019s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Cir-\n    cuit\u2019s and respondent\u2019s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive\n    interpretation. Pp. 7\u201315.\n         (1) Nothing in \u00a7416(e)\u2019s tautological definition suggests that\n    Congress understood the word \u201cchild\u201d to refer only to the children of\n    married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent\n    are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress ex-\n    pressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a mari-\n    tal union, see \u00a7402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly\n    distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term \u201cchild.\u201d\n    Nor does \u00a7416(e) indicate that Congress intended \u201cbiological\u201d parent-\n    age to be prerequisite to \u201cchild\u201d status. A biological parent is not al-\n    ways a child\u2019s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not\n    necessarily make a child\u2019s parentage certain, nor does the absence of\n    marriage necessarily make a child\u2019s parentage uncertain. Finally, it\n    is far from obvious that respondent\u2019s proposed definition would cover\n    her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage\n    ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in \u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s opening in-\n    struction: \u201cIn determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of\n    [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,\u201d the Commis-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence\nof any cross-reference in \u00a7416(e) to \u00a7416(h), but she overlooks that\n\u00a7416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intes-\ntacy law to determine child status not just for \u00a7416(h) purposes, but\n\u201cfor purposes of this subchapter,\u201d which includes both \u00a7\u00a7402(d) and\n416(e). Having explicitly complemented \u00a7416(e) by the definitional\nprovisions contained in \u00a7416(h), Congress had no need to place a re-\ndundant cross-reference in \u00a7416(e).\n   The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,\nincluding an applicant\u2019s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widow-\ner. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-of-\nrelationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777\u2013\n782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord\ninheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast,\nno time constraint attends the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling in this case, un-\nder which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survi-\nvors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father\u2019s death\nand the child\u2019s conception and birth.\n   Because a child who may take from a father\u2019s estate is more likely\nto \u201cbe dependent during the parent\u2019s life and at his death,\u201d Mathews\nv. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to deter-\nmine who is a \u201cchild\u201d serves the Act\u2019s driving objective, which is to\n\u201cprovide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner\u2019s] family with pro-\ntection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured\u2019s]\nearnings,\u201d Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and\nregulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,\nstepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows,\nas respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated\nmore advantageously than are children who must meet a \u00a7416(h) cri-\nterion. Respondent charges that the SSA\u2019s construction of the Act\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis re-\nview, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress\neasily passes inspection. Pp. 10\u201315.\n   (c) Because the SSA\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions, is\nat least reasonable, the agency\u2019s reading is entitled to this Court\u2019s\ndeference under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appro-\npriate \u201cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the\nagency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the ex-\nercise of that authority.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218,\n226\u2013227. Here, the SSA\u2019s longstanding interpretation, set forth in\nregulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is nei-\nther \u201carbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary\n4                         ASTRUE v.

Robert died\nof cancer less than three years later. With the help of in\nvitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months\nafter her husband\u2019s death. Karen\u2019s application for Social\nSecurity survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this lit-\nigation. The technology that made the twins\u2019 conception\nand birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated\nby Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social\nSecurity Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to\nread as they now do (1965).\n  Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act\u2019s\ninitial definition of \u201cchild\u201d in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(e): \u201c \u2018[C]hild\u2019\nmeans . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured]\nindividual.\u201d Robert was an insured individual, and the\ntwins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of\nKaren and Robert. That satisfies the Act\u2019s terms, and no\nfurther inquiry is in order, Karen maintains. The SSA,\nhowever, identifies subsequent provisions, \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2) and\n2                    ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological\nchildren to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance\nfrom the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one\nof the statutory alternatives to that requirement.\n   We conclude that the SSA\u2019s reading is better attuned to\nthe statute\u2019s text and its design to benefit primarily those\nsupported by the deceased wage earner in his or her life-\ntime. And even if the SSA\u2019s longstanding interpretation is\nnot the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible\nconstruction that garners the Court\u2019s respect under Chev-\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                              I\n   Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999.\nShortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal\ncancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required\nmight render him sterile. Because the couple wanted\nchildren, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, depos-\nited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and\nstored. Despite Robert\u2019s aggressive treatment regime,\nKaren conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in\nAugust 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to\nhave a sibling.\n   Robert\u2019s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in\nFlorida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.\nHis will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the\nson born of his marriage to Karen and two children from\na previous marriage. The will made no provision for chil-\ndren conceived after Robert\u2019s death, although the Capatos\nhad told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be\nplaced on a par with existing children. Shortly after Rob-\nert\u2019s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her\nhusband\u2019s frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003\nand gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months\nafter Robert\u2019s death.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  Karen Capato claimed survivors insurance benefits on\nbehalf of the twins. The SSA denied her application, and\nthe U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey\naffirmed the agency\u2019s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at\n15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute, the District Court determined\nthat the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as\n\u00a7416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the de-\nceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert\nCapato died domiciled in Florida, the court found. Under\nthat State\u2019s law, the court noted, a child born posthu-\nmously may inherit through intestate succession only if\nconceived during the decedent\u2019s lifetime. Id., at 27a\u201328a.1\n  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.\nUnder \u00a7416(e), the appellate court concluded, \u201cthe undis-\nputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and\nhis widow\u201d qualify for survivors benefits without regard to\nstate intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011).2 Courts of\nAppeals have divided on the statutory interpretation\nquestion this case presents. Compare ibid. and Gillett-\nNetting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596\u2013597 (CA9 2004)\n(biological but posthumously conceived child of insured\nwage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits), with\nBeeler v. Astrue, 651 F. 3d 954, 960\u2013964 (CA8 2011), and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The District Court observed that Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7732.106 (West\n\n2010) defines \u201c \u2018afterborn heirs\u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018heirs of the decedent conceived\nbefore his or her death, but born thereafter.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n27a (emphasis added by District Court). The court also referred to\n\u00a7742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child \u201c \u2018shall\nnot be eligible for a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate unless the child\nhas been provided for by the decedent\u2019s will.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 28a.\n  2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived chil-\n\ndren qualify for survivors benefits as a matter of federal law, it did not\ndefinitively determine \u201cwhere [Robert] Capato was domiciled at his\ndeath or . . . delve into the law of intestacy of that state.\u201d 631 F. 3d, at\n632, n. 6. These issues, if preserved, may be considered on remand.\n4                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSchafer v. Astrue, 641 F. 3d 49, 54\u201363 (CA4 2011) (post-\nhumously conceived child\u2019s qualification for benefits de-\npends on intestacy law of State in which wage earner was\ndomiciled). To resolve the conflict, we granted the Com-\nmissioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n   Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to\nprovide a monthly benefit for designated surviving fam-\nily members of a deceased insured wage earner. \u201cChild\u2019s\ninsurance benefits\u201d are among the Act\u2019s family-protective\nmeasures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7402(d).\nAn applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the\nAct\u2019s definition of \u201cchild,\u201d is unmarried, is below specified\nage limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began\nprior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the\ntime of the insured\u2019s death. \u00a7402(d)(1).3\n   To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato\ntwins rank as \u201cchild[ren]\u201d under the Act\u2019s definitional\nprovisions. Section 402(d) provides that \u201c[e]very child (as\ndefined in section 416(e) of this title)\u201d of a deceased in-\nsured individual \u201cshall be entitled to a child\u2019s insurance\nbenefit.\u201d Section 416(e), in turn, states: \u201cThe term \u2018child\u2019\nmeans (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be\n\n\u201cdeemed dependent\u201d when the Act so provides. For example, a \u201clegiti-\nmate\u201d child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from\nher parent, is ordinarily \u201cdeemed dependent\u201d on that parent. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7402(d)(3). Further, applicants \u201cdeemed\u201d the child of an insured\nindividual under \u00a7416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also \u201cdeemed legitimate,\u201d\nhence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from\nthe parent. \u00a7402(d)(3).

Compare \u00a7416(e)(1)\n(referring simply to \u201cthe child . . . of an individual\u201d) with,\ne.g., \u00a7416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at\nleast nine months before the insured individual\u2019s death).\n    A subsequent definitional provision further addresses\nthe term \u201cchild.\u201d Under the heading \u201cDetermination of\nfamily status,\u201d \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) provides: \u201cIn determining\nwhether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured\nindividual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commis-\nsioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of\nthe insured individual\u2019s domiciliary State].\u201d4\n    An applicant for child benefits who does not meet\n\u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless\nqualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the\nAct prescribes. First, an applicant who \u201cis a son or daugh-\nter\u201d of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a\n\u201cchild\u201d under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of\n\nthe insured\u2019s domicile, \u201cwould have the same status relative to taking\nintestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.\u201d\nAsked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it\nwould apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139, 54; see\n20 CFR \u00a7404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for\nbenefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under\nstate law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of\nthe adopting parent).\n6                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nranks as a \u201cchild\u201d if the insured and the other parent went\nthrough a marriage ceremony that would have been valid\nbut for certain legal impediments. \u00a7416(h)(2)(B). Further,\nan applicant is deemed a \u201cchild\u201d if, before death, the in-\nsured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or\nher son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by\na court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had\nbeen ordered to pay child support. \u00a7416(h)(3)(C)(i). In\naddition, an applicant may gain \u201cchild\u201d status upon\nproof that the insured individual was the applicant\u2019s pa-\nrent and \u201cwas living with or contributing to the support\nof the applicant\u201d when the insured individual died.\n\u00a7416(h)(3)(C)(ii).5\n  The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations\nadopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The\nregulations state that an applicant may be entitled to\nbenefits \u201cas a natural child, legally adopted child, step-\nchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or equitably adopted\nchild.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7404.354. Defining \u201c[w]ho is the insured\u2019s\nnatural child,\u201d \u00a7404.355, the regulations closely track\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2) and (h)(3). They state that an\napplicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a \u201cnatural\nchild\u201d by meeting any of four conditions: (1) the applicant\n\u201ccould inherit the insured\u2019s personal property as his or her\nnatural child under State inheritance laws\u201d; (2) the appli-\ncant is \u201cthe insured\u2019s natural child and [his or her parents]\nwent through a ceremony which would have resulted in\na valid marriage between them except for a legal impedi-\nment\u201d; (3) before death, the insured acknowledged in\nwriting his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed\nby a court to be the applicant\u2019s parent, or was ordered by a\ncourt to contribute to the applicant\u2019s support; or (4) other\nevidence shows that the insured is the applicant\u2019s \u201cnatural\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis\n\nfor the twins\u2019 \u201cchild\u201d status.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. \u00a7416(h) gov-\nerns the meaning of \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7416(e)(1). In other words,\n\u00a7416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for in-\nsurance benefits as a \u201cchild\u201d must pass. See Beeler, 651\nF. 3d, at 960 (\u201cThe regulations make clear that the SSA\ninterprets the Act to mean that the provisions of \u00a7416(h)\nare the exclusive means by which an applicant can estab-\nlish \u2018child\u2019 status under \u00a7416(e) as a natural child.\u201d).6\n                               III\n  Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that\n\u00a7416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrele-\nvant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals deter-\nmined, \u00a7416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631\nF. 3d, at 630\u2013631. Under \u00a7416(e), \u201cchild\u201d means \u201cchild of\nan [insured] individual,\u201d and the Capato twins, the Third\nCircuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are un-\ndeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage\nearner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)\ncomes into play, the court reasoned, only when \u201ca claim-\nant\u2019s status as a deceased wage-earner\u2019s child is in doubt.\u201d\nId., at 631. That limitation, the court suggested, is evi-\ndent from \u00a7416(h)\u2019s caption: \u201cDetermination of family\nstatus.\u201d Here, \u201cthere is no family status to determine,\u201d the\ncourt said, id., at 630, so \u00a7416(h) has no role to play.\n  In short, while the SSA regards \u00a7416(h) as completing\n\u00a7416(e)\u2019s sparse definition of \u201cchild,\u201d the Third Circuit\nconsidered each subsection to control different situations:\n\u00a7416(h) governs when a child\u2019s family status needs to be\ndetermined; \u00a7416(e), when it does not.

The answer\nthat the Third Circuit found plain: whenever the claimant\nis \u201cthe biological child of a married couple.\u201d Id., at 630.7\n   We point out, first, some conspicuous flaws in the Third\nCircuit\u2019s and respondent Karen Capato\u2019s reading of the\nAct\u2019s provisions, and then explain why we find the SSA\u2019s\ninterpretation persuasive.\n                               A\n  Nothing in \u00a7416(e)\u2019s tautological definition (\u201c \u2018child\u2019\nmeans . . . the child . . . of an individual\u201d) suggests that\nCongress understood the word \u201cchild\u201d to refer only to the\nchildren of married parents. The dictionary definitions\noffered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining\n\u201cchild\u201d as, inter alia, \u201c[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,\nsometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegiti-\nmate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,\nas the intention may appear\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Colle-\ngiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (\u201cchild\u201d means \u201cson or\ndaughter,\u201d or \u201cdescendant\u201d). See also Restatement (Third)\nof Property \u00a72.5(1) (1998) (\u201c[a]n individual is the child of\nhis or her genetic parents,\u201d and that may be so \u201cwhether\nor not [the parents] are married to each other\u201d). More-\nover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited\nthe category of children covered to offspring of a marital\nunion. See \u00a7402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the \u201clegitimate . . .\nchild\u201d of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes\nsimilarly differentiate child of a marriage (\u201clegitimate\nchild\u201d) from the unmodified term \u201cchild.\u201d See, e.g., Ser-\nvicemen\u2019s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unam-\n\nbiguous, it had no occasion to \u201cdetermine whether the [SSA\u2019s] interpre-\ntation is a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d 631 F. 3d, at 631,\nn. 5 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013843 (1984)).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

As the SSA points out, \u201c[i]n 1939,\nthere was no such thing as a scientifically proven biologi-\ncal relationship between a child and a father, which is . . .\npart of the reason that the word \u2018biological\u2019 appears no-\nwhere in the Act.\u201d Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological\nparent is not necessarily a child\u2019s parent under law.\nOrdinarily, \u201ca parent-child relationship does not exist\nbetween an adoptee and the adoptee\u2019s genetic parents.\u201d\nUniform Probate Code \u00a72\u2013119(a), 8 U. L. A. 55 (Supp.\n2011) (amended 2008). Moreover, laws directly addressing\nuse of today\u2019s assisted reproduction technology do not\nmake biological parentage a universally determinative\ncriterion. See, e.g., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a77613(b) (West\nSupp. 2012) (\u201cThe donor of semen . . . for use in artificial\ninsemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other\nthan the donor\u2019s wife is treated in law as if he were not the\nnatural father of a child thereby conceived, unless other-\nwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the\nwoman prior to the conception of the child.\u201d); Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 46, \u00a74B (West 2010) (\u201cAny child born to a mar-\nried woman as a result of artificial insemination with the\nconsent of her husband, shall be considered the legitimate\nchild of the mother and such husband.\u201d).\n   We note, in addition, that marriage does not ever and\nalways make the parentage of a child certain, nor does the\nabsence of marriage necessarily mean that a child\u2019s par-\nentage is uncertain. An unmarried couple can agree that\na child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during\na marriage may be uncertain.

Under Florida law, a marriage\nends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price, 114\nFla. 233, 235, 153 So. 904, 905 (1934). If that law applies,\nrather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the\nCapato twins, conceived after the death of their father,\nwould not qualify as \u201cmarital\u201d children.8\n                            B\n   Resisting the importation of words not found in\n\u00a7416(e)\u2014\u201cchild\u201d means \u201cthe biological child of married\nparents,\u201d Brief for Respondent 9\u2014the SSA finds a key\ntextual cue in \u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s opening instruction: \u201cIn\ndetermining whether an applicant is the child . . . of [an]\ninsured individual for purposes of this subchapter,\u201d the\nCommissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondent notes the absence of any cross-\nreference in \u00a7416(e) to \u00a7416(h). Brief for Respondent 18.\nShe overlooks, however, that \u00a7416(h) provides the crucial\nlink. The \u201csubchapter\u201d to which \u00a7416(h) refers is Sub-\nchapter II of the Act, which spans \u00a7\u00a7401 through 434.\nSection 416(h)\u2019s reference to \u201cthis subchapter\u201d thus in-\ncludes both \u00a7\u00a7402(d) and 416(e). Having explicitly com-\nplemented \u00a7416(e) by the definitional provisions contained\nin \u00a7416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant\ncross-reference in \u00a7416(e). See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benefits to the\n\nCapato twins when, under \u00a7416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained\nbenefits had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that\nwould have been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respond-\nent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 5\u20136. Whether the Capatos\u2019 marriage cere-\nmony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was\nextant when the twins were conceived.

It provided that, \u201c[i]n determining whether an\napplicant is the . . . child . . . of [an] insured individual for\npurposes of sections 401\u2013409 of this title, the Board shall\napply [state intestacy law].\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7409(m) (1940 ed.)\n(emphasis added). Sections 401\u2013409 embraced \u00a7\u00a7402(c)\nand 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.\n   Reference to state law to determine an applicant\u2019s sta-\ntus as a \u201cchild\u201d is anything but anomalous. Quite the\nopposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters\nof family status. For example, the Act initially defines\n\u201cwife\u201d as \u201cthe wife of an [insured] individual,\u201d if certain\nconditions are satisfied. \u00a7416(b). Like \u00a7416(e), \u00a7416(b)\nis, at least in part, tautological (\u201c \u2018wife\u2019 means the [in-\nsured\u2019s] wife\u201d). One must read on, although there is no ex-\npress cross-reference, to \u00a7416(h) (rules on \u201c[d]etermination\nof family status\u201d) to complete the definition. Section\n\u00a7416(h)(1)(A) directs that, \u201cfor purposes of this subchap-\nter,\u201d the law of the insured\u2019s domicile determines whether\n\u201c[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly\nmarried,\u201d and if they were not, whether the applicant\nwould nevertheless have \u201cthe same status\u201d as a wife under\nthe State\u2019s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act\nsimilarly defines the terms \u201cwidow,\u201d \u201chusband,\u201d and \u201cwid-\nower.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a7416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).\n   Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision man-\ndated the use of state intestacy law for \u201cdetermining\nwhether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of\n[an] insured individual.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7409(m) (1940 ed.).\nAll wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to\nsatisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-\n12                   ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning their parents\u2019 marriage would have readily qualified\nunder the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility\nto inherit under state law. But requiring all \u201cchild\u201d ap-\nplicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a\nsimple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly\nwithin the legislators\u2019 contemplation, while avoiding con-\ngressional entanglement in the traditional state-law\nrealm of family relations.\n   Just as the Act generally refers to state law to deter-\nmine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,\nhusband, widower, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child\nor parent, \u00a7416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (\u00a7\u00a7416(b),\n(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship\nlimitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.

The aim\nwas not to create a program \u201cgenerally benefiting needy\npersons\u201d; it was, more particularly, to \u201cprovide . . . de-\npendent members of [a wage earner\u2019s] family with protec-\ntion against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the\ninsured\u2019s] earnings.\u201d Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52\n(1977). We have recognized that \u201cwhere state intestacy\nlaw provides that a child may take personal property from\na father\u2019s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the\nchild will more likely be dependent during the parent\u2019s life\nand at his death.\u201d Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514\n(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who\nis a \u201cchild\u201d thus serves the Act\u2019s driving objective. True,\nthe intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children\noutside the Act\u2019s central concern. Intestacy laws in a\nnumber of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance\nby posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and\nunder federal law, a child conceived shortly before her\nfather\u2019s death may be eligible for benefits even though she\nnever actually received her father\u2019s support. It was none-\ntheless Congress\u2019 prerogative to legislate for the generality\nof cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 But see N. Y. Est., Powers & Trusts Law Ann. \u00a74\u20131.1(c) (West 1998)\n\n(\u201cDistributees of the decedent, conceived before his or her death but\nborn alive thereafter, take as if they were born in his or her lifetime.\u201d).\nSimilar provisions are contained in Ga. Code Ann. \u00a753\u20132\u20131(b)(1) (2011),\nIdaho Code \u00a715\u20132\u2013108 (Lexis 2009), Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7524.2\u2013120(10)\n(West Supp. 2012), S. C.

CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder state intestacy law as a workable substitute for bur-\ndensome case-by-case determinations whether the child\nwas, in fact, dependent on her father\u2019s earnings.\n   Respondent argues that on the SSA\u2019s reading, natural\nchildren alone must pass through a \u00a7416(h) gateway.\nAdopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-\ngrandchildren, it is true, are defined in \u00a7416(e), and are\nnot further defined in \u00a7416(h). Respondent overlooks,\nhowever, that although not touched by \u00a7416(h), beneficiar-\nies described in \u00a7\u00a7416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other\nstatutorily prescribed criteria. In short, the Act and regu-\nlations set different eligibility requirements for adopted\nchildren, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchil-\ndren, see 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.356\u2013404.358, but it hardly follows\nthat applicants in those categories are treated more ad-\nvantageously than are children who must meet a \u00a7416(h)\ncriterion.\n   The SSA\u2019s construction of the Act, respondent charges,\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro-\ntection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for\nRespondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.\n636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: \u201cUnder the govern-\nment\u2019s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived chil-\ndren are treated as an inferior subset of natural children\nwho are ineligible for government benefits simply because\nof their date of birth and method of conception.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 42\u201343.\n   Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the\nreading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this\nargument. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff\nv. Astrue, 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have\napplied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws \u201cbur-\nden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the\nillicit relations of their parents, because \u2018visiting this\ncondemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and\nunjust.\u2019 \u201d Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (quoting\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nWeber v.

No showing has been made that posthumously\nconceived children share the characteristics that prompted\nour skepticism of classifications disadvantaging children\nof unwed parents. We therefore need not decide whether\nheightened scrutiny would be appropriate were that the\ncase.10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress\nadopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit\nheld, that regime is \u201creasonably related to the govern-\nment\u2019s twin interests in [reserving] benefits [for] those\nchildren who have lost a parent\u2019s support, and in using\nreasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative\nburden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nVernoff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at\n509).\n                              IV\n  As we have explained, \u00a7416(e)(1)\u2019s statement, \u201c[t]he\nterm \u2018child\u2019 means . . . the child . . . of an individual,\u201d is a\ndefinition of scant utility without aid from neighboring\nprovisions. See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is\nsupplied by \u00a7416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition\nof \u201cchild\u201d \u201cfor purposes of th[e] subchapter\u201d that includes\n\u00a7416(e)(1). Under the completed definition, which the SSA\nemploys, \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the\nstatus of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to with-\nout deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the\nagency\u2019s reading is therefore entitled to this Court\u2019s defer-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the \u201cillogical and unjust\u201d\n\ndiscrimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v.\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175\u2013176 (1972), respond-\nent asks us to differentiate between children whose parents were\nmarried and children whose parents\u2019 liaisons were not blessed by clergy\nor the State.

ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 11\u2013159.      Argued March 19, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012\nEighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, re-\n  spondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in\n  vitro fertilization using her husband\u2019s frozen sperm. Karen applied\n  for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins. The Social Secu-\n  rity Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District\n  Court affirmed. In accord with the SSA\u2019s construction of the Social\n  Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify\n  for benefits only if, as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could\n  inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.\n  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his\n  death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children\n  do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession. The\n  Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under \u00a7416(e), which de-\n  fines child to mean, inter alia, \u201cthe child or legally adopted child of an\n  [insured] individual,\u201d the undisputed biological children of an insured\n  and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state\n  intestacy law.\nHeld: The SSA\u2019s reading is better attuned to the statute\u2019s text and its\n design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage\n earner in his or her lifetime. Moreover, even if the SSA\u2019s longstand-\n ing interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a per-\n missible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.\n Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Pp. 4\u2013\n 16.\n    (a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant\n here, \u201c[e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title)\u201d of a de-\n2                           ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ceased insured individual \u201cshall be entitled to a child\u2019s insurance\n    benefit.\u201d \u00a7402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines \u201cchild\u201d to mean:\n    \u201c(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild\n    [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or\n    stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain condi-\n    tions].\u201d Unlike \u00a7\u00a7416(e)(2) and (3), \u00a7416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of\n    the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section\n    416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term \u201cchild,\u201d providing:\n    \u201cIn determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]\n    insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner\n    of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured indi-\n    vidual\u2019s domiciliary State].\u201d An applicant who does not meet\n    \u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for\n    benefits under other criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but\n    respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Reg-\n    ulations promulgated by the SSA closely track \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2) and (3) in\n    defining \u201c[w]ho is the insured\u2019s natural child,\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7404.355. As\n    the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h) governs the meaning of\n    \u201cchild\u201d in \u00a7416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all appli-\n    cants for insurance benefits as a \u201cchild\u201d must pass. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) While the SSA regards \u00a7416(h) as completing \u00a7416(e)\u2019s sparse\n    definition of \u201cchild,\u201d the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,\n    that \u00a7416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married cou-\n    ple\u2019s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Cir-\n    cuit\u2019s and respondent\u2019s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive\n    interpretation. Pp. 7\u201315.\n         (1) Nothing in \u00a7416(e)\u2019s tautological definition suggests that\n    Congress understood the word \u201cchild\u201d to refer only to the children of\n    married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent\n    are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress ex-\n    pressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a mari-\n    tal union, see \u00a7402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly\n    distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term \u201cchild.\u201d\n    Nor does \u00a7416(e) indicate that Congress intended \u201cbiological\u201d parent-\n    age to be prerequisite to \u201cchild\u201d status. A biological parent is not al-\n    ways a child\u2019s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not\n    necessarily make a child\u2019s parentage certain, nor does the absence of\n    marriage necessarily make a child\u2019s parentage uncertain. Finally, it\n    is far from obvious that respondent\u2019s proposed definition would cover\n    her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage\n    ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in \u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s opening in-\n    struction: \u201cIn determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of\n    [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,\u201d the Commis-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence\nof any cross-reference in \u00a7416(e) to \u00a7416(h), but she overlooks that\n\u00a7416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intes-\ntacy law to determine child status not just for \u00a7416(h) purposes, but\n\u201cfor purposes of this subchapter,\u201d which includes both \u00a7\u00a7402(d) and\n416(e). Having explicitly complemented \u00a7416(e) by the definitional\nprovisions contained in \u00a7416(h), Congress had no need to place a re-\ndundant cross-reference in \u00a7416(e).\n   The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,\nincluding an applicant\u2019s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widow-\ner. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-of-\nrelationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777\u2013\n782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord\ninheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast,\nno time constraint attends the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling in this case, un-\nder which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survi-\nvors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father\u2019s death\nand the child\u2019s conception and birth.\n   Because a child who may take from a father\u2019s estate is more likely\nto \u201cbe dependent during the parent\u2019s life and at his death,\u201d Mathews\nv. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to deter-\nmine who is a \u201cchild\u201d serves the Act\u2019s driving objective, which is to\n\u201cprovide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner\u2019s] family with pro-\ntection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured\u2019s]\nearnings,\u201d Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and\nregulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,\nstepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows,\nas respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated\nmore advantageously than are children who must meet a \u00a7416(h) cri-\nterion. Respondent charges that the SSA\u2019s construction of the Act\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis re-\nview, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress\neasily passes inspection. Pp. 10\u201315.\n   (c) Because the SSA\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions, is\nat least reasonable, the agency\u2019s reading is entitled to this Court\u2019s\ndeference under Chevron, 467 U.

Robert died\nof cancer less than three years later. With the help of in\nvitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months\nafter her husband\u2019s death. Karen\u2019s application for Social\nSecurity survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this lit-\nigation. The technology that made the twins\u2019 conception\nand birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated\nby Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social\nSecurity Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to\nread as they now do (1965).\n  Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act\u2019s\ninitial definition of \u201cchild\u201d in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(e): \u201c \u2018[C]hild\u2019\nmeans . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured]\nindividual.\u201d Robert was an insured individual, and the\ntwins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of\nKaren and Robert. That satisfies the Act\u2019s terms, and no\nfurther inquiry is in order, Karen maintains. The SSA,\nhowever, identifies subsequent provisions, \u00a7\u00a7416(h)(2) and\n2                    ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological\nchildren to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance\nfrom the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one\nof the statutory alternatives to that requirement.\n   We conclude that the SSA\u2019s reading is better attuned to\nthe statute\u2019s text and its design to benefit primarily those\nsupported by the deceased wage earner in his or her life-\ntime. And even if the SSA\u2019s longstanding interpretation is\nnot the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible\nconstruction that garners the Court\u2019s respect under Chev-\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                              I\n   Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999.\nShortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal\ncancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required\nmight render him sterile. Because the couple wanted\nchildren, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, depos-\nited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and\nstored. Despite Robert\u2019s aggressive treatment regime,\nKaren conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in\nAugust 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to\nhave a sibling.\n   Robert\u2019s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in\nFlorida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.\nHis will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the\nson born of his marriage to Karen and two children from\na previous marriage. The will made no provision for chil-\ndren conceived after Robert\u2019s death, although the Capatos\nhad told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be\nplaced on a par with existing children. Shortly after Rob-\nert\u2019s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her\nhusband\u2019s frozen sperm.

The SSA denied her application, and\nthe U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey\naffirmed the agency\u2019s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at\n15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute, the District Court determined\nthat the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as\n\u00a7416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the de-\nceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert\nCapato died domiciled in Florida, the court found. Under\nthat State\u2019s law, the court noted, a child born posthu-\nmously may inherit through intestate succession only if\nconceived during the decedent\u2019s lifetime. Id., at 27a\u201328a.1\n  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.\nUnder \u00a7416(e), the appellate court concluded, \u201cthe undis-\nputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and\nhis widow\u201d qualify for survivors benefits without regard to\nstate intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011).2 Courts of\nAppeals have divided on the statutory interpretation\nquestion this case presents. Compare ibid. and Gillett-\nNetting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596\u2013597 (CA9 2004)\n(biological but posthumously conceived child of insured\nwage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits), with\nBeeler v.

The court also referred to\n\u00a7742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child \u201c \u2018shall\nnot be eligible for a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate unless the child\nhas been provided for by the decedent\u2019s will.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 28a.\n  2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived chil-\n\ndren qualify for survivors benefits as a matter of federal law, it did not\ndefinitively determine \u201cwhere [Robert] Capato was domiciled at his\ndeath or . . . delve into the law of intestacy of that state.\u201d 631 F. 3d, at\n632, n. 6.

S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n   Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to\nprovide a monthly benefit for designated surviving fam-\nily members of a deceased insured wage earner. \u201cChild\u2019s\ninsurance benefits\u201d are among the Act\u2019s family-protective\nmeasures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7402(d).\nAn applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the\nAct\u2019s definition of \u201cchild,\u201d is unmarried, is below specified\nage limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began\nprior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the\ntime of the insured\u2019s death. \u00a7402(d)(1).3\n   To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato\ntwins rank as \u201cchild[ren]\u201d under the Act\u2019s definitional\nprovisions. Section 402(d) provides that \u201c[e]very child (as\ndefined in section 416(e) of this title)\u201d of a deceased in-\nsured individual \u201cshall be entitled to a child\u2019s insurance\nbenefit.\u201d Section 416(e), in turn, states: \u201cThe term \u2018child\u2019\nmeans (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be\n\n\u201cdeemed dependent\u201d when the Act so provides. For example, a \u201clegiti-\nmate\u201d child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from\nher parent, is ordinarily \u201cdeemed dependent\u201d on that parent. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7402(d)(3). Further, applicants \u201cdeemed\u201d the child of an insured\nindividual under \u00a7416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also \u201cdeemed legitimate,\u201d\nhence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from\nthe parent. \u00a7402(d)(3).

Unlike\n\u00a7\u00a7416(e)(2) and (3), which specify the circumstances under\nwhich stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,\n\u00a7416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare \u00a7416(e)(1)\n(referring simply to \u201cthe child . . . of an individual\u201d) with,\ne.g., \u00a7416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at\nleast nine months before the insured individual\u2019s death).\n    A subsequent definitional provision further addresses\nthe term \u201cchild.\u201d Under the heading \u201cDetermination of\nfamily status,\u201d \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) provides: \u201cIn determining\nwhether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured\nindividual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commis-\nsioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of\nthe insured individual\u2019s domiciliary State].\u201d4\n    An applicant for child benefits who does not meet\n\u00a7416(h)(2)(A)\u2019s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless\nqualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the\nAct prescribes. First, an applicant who \u201cis a son or daugh-\nter\u201d of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a\n\u201cchild\u201d under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of\n\nthe insured\u2019s domicile, \u201cwould have the same status relative to taking\nintestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.\u201d\nAsked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it\nwould apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139, 54; see\n20 CFR \u00a7404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for\nbenefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under\nstate law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of\nthe adopting parent).\n6                        ASTRUE v.

Further,\nan applicant is deemed a \u201cchild\u201d if, before death, the in-\nsured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or\nher son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by\na court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had\nbeen ordered to pay child support. \u00a7416(h)(3)(C)(i). In\naddition, an applicant may gain \u201cchild\u201d status upon\nproof that the insured individual was the applicant\u2019s pa-\nrent and \u201cwas living with or contributing to the support\nof the applicant\u201d when the insured individual died.\n\u00a7416(h)(3)(C)(ii).5\n  The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations\nadopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The\nregulations state that an applicant may be entitled to\nbenefits \u201cas a natural child, legally adopted child, step-\nchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or equitably adopted\nchild.\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7404.354.

They state that an\napplicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a \u201cnatural\nchild\u201d by meeting any of four conditions: (1) the applicant\n\u201ccould inherit the insured\u2019s personal property as his or her\nnatural child under State inheritance laws\u201d; (2) the appli-\ncant is \u201cthe insured\u2019s natural child and [his or her parents]\nwent through a ceremony which would have resulted in\na valid marriage between them except for a legal impedi-\nment\u201d; (3) before death, the insured acknowledged in\nwriting his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed\nby a court to be the applicant\u2019s parent, or was ordered by a\ncourt to contribute to the applicant\u2019s support; or (4) other\nevidence shows that the insured is the applicant\u2019s \u201cnatural\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis\n\nfor the twins\u2019 \u201cchild\u201d status.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

In other words,\n\u00a7416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for in-\nsurance benefits as a \u201cchild\u201d must pass. See Beeler, 651\nF. 3d, at 960 (\u201cThe regulations make clear that the SSA\ninterprets the Act to mean that the provisions of \u00a7416(h)\nare the exclusive means by which an applicant can estab-\nlish \u2018child\u2019 status under \u00a7416(e) as a natural child.\u201d).6\n                               III\n  Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that\n\u00a7416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrele-\nvant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals deter-\nmined, \u00a7416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631\nF. 3d, at 630\u2013631. Under \u00a7416(e), \u201cchild\u201d means \u201cchild of\nan [insured] individual,\u201d and the Capato twins, the Third\nCircuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are un-\ndeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage\nearner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)\ncomes into play, the court reasoned, only when \u201ca claim-\nant\u2019s status as a deceased wage-earner\u2019s child is in doubt.\u201d\nId., at 631.

The dictionary definitions\noffered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining\n\u201cchild\u201d as, inter alia, \u201c[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,\nsometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegiti-\nmate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,\nas the intention may appear\u201d); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Colle-\ngiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (\u201cchild\u201d means \u201cson or\ndaughter,\u201d or \u201cdescendant\u201d). See also Restatement (Third)\nof Property \u00a72.5(1) (1998) (\u201c[a]n individual is the child of\nhis or her genetic parents,\u201d and that may be so \u201cwhether\nor not [the parents] are married to each other\u201d). More-\nover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited\nthe category of children covered to offspring of a marital\nunion. See \u00a7402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the \u201clegitimate . . .\nchild\u201d of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes\nsimilarly differentiate child of a marriage (\u201clegitimate\nchild\u201d) from the unmodified term \u201cchild.\u201d See, e.g., Ser-\nvicemen\u2019s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unam-\n\nbiguous, it had no occasion to \u201cdetermine whether the [SSA\u2019s] interpre-\ntation is a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d 631 F. 3d, at 631,\nn. 5 (citing Chevron U.

As the SSA points out, \u201c[i]n 1939,\nthere was no such thing as a scientifically proven biologi-\ncal relationship between a child and a father, which is . . .\npart of the reason that the word \u2018biological\u2019 appears no-\nwhere in the Act.\u201d Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological\nparent is not necessarily a child\u2019s parent under law.\nOrdinarily, \u201ca parent-child relationship does not exist\nbetween an adoptee and the adoptee\u2019s genetic parents.\u201d\nUniform Probate Code \u00a72\u2013119(a), 8 U.

An unmarried couple can agree that\na child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during\na marriage may be uncertain.

S. C. \u00a7409(m) (1940 ed.)\n(emphasis added). Sections 401\u2013409 embraced \u00a7\u00a7402(c)\nand 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.\n   Reference to state law to determine an applicant\u2019s sta-\ntus as a \u201cchild\u201d is anything but anomalous. Quite the\nopposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters\nof family status. For example, the Act initially defines\n\u201cwife\u201d as \u201cthe wife of an [insured] individual,\u201d if certain\nconditions are satisfied. \u00a7416(b). Like \u00a7416(e), \u00a7416(b)\nis, at least in part, tautological (\u201c \u2018wife\u2019 means the [in-\nsured\u2019s] wife\u201d). One must read on, although there is no ex-\npress cross-reference, to \u00a7416(h) (rules on \u201c[d]etermination\nof family status\u201d) to complete the definition. Section\n\u00a7416(h)(1)(A) directs that, \u201cfor purposes of this subchap-\nter,\u201d the law of the insured\u2019s domicile determines whether\n\u201c[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly\nmarried,\u201d and if they were not, whether the applicant\nwould nevertheless have \u201cthe same status\u201d as a wife under\nthe State\u2019s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act\nsimilarly defines the terms \u201cwidow,\u201d \u201chusband,\u201d and \u201cwid-\nower.\u201d See \u00a7\u00a7416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).\n   Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision man-\ndated the use of state intestacy law for \u201cdetermining\nwhether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of\n[an] insured individual.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7409(m) (1940 ed.).\nAll wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to\nsatisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-\n12                   ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning their parents\u2019 marriage would have readily qualified\nunder the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility\nto inherit under state law. But requiring all \u201cchild\u201d ap-\nplicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a\nsimple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly\nwithin the legislators\u2019 contemplation, while avoiding con-\ngressional entanglement in the traditional state-law\nrealm of family relations.\n   Just as the Act generally refers to state law to deter-\nmine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,\nhusband, widower, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child\nor parent, \u00a7416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (\u00a7\u00a7416(b),\n(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship\nlimitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777\u2013\n782 (1975) (discussing \u00a7416(e)(2)\u2019s requirement that, as\na check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild\nrelationship must exist \u201cnot less than nine months imme-\ndiately preceding [insured\u2019s death]\u201d). Time limits also\nqualify the statutes of several States that accord inher-\nitance rights to posthumously conceived children. See Cal.\nProb. Code Ann. \u00a7249.5(c) (West Supp. 2012) (allowing\ninheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent\u2019s\ndeath); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a715\u201311\u2013120(11) (2011) (child\nin utero within three years or born within 45 months);\nIowa Code Ann. \u00a7633.220A(1) (West Supp. 2012) (child\nborn within two years); La. Rev.

A. 58 (Supp.\n2011) (treating a posthumously conceived child as \u201cin\ngestation at the individual\u2019s death,\u201d but only if specified\ntime limits are met). No time constraints attend the Third\nCircuit\u2019s ruling in this case, under which the biological\nchild of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,\nno matter the length of time between the father\u2019s death\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand the child\u2019s conception and birth. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n36\u201337 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that,\nunder the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the\nThird Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her\nfather\u2019s death would be eligible for benefits).\n   The paths to receipt of benefits laid out in the Act and\nregulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress\u2019\nperception of the core purpose of the legislation. The aim\nwas not to create a program \u201cgenerally benefiting needy\npersons\u201d; it was, more particularly, to \u201cprovide . . . de-\npendent members of [a wage earner\u2019s] family with protec-\ntion against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the\ninsured\u2019s] earnings.\u201d Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52\n(1977). We have recognized that \u201cwhere state intestacy\nlaw provides that a child may take personal property from\na father\u2019s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the\nchild will more likely be dependent during the parent\u2019s life\nand at his death.\u201d Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514\n(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who\nis a \u201cchild\u201d thus serves the Act\u2019s driving objective. True,\nthe intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children\noutside the Act\u2019s central concern. Intestacy laws in a\nnumber of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance\nby posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and\nunder federal law, a child conceived shortly before her\nfather\u2019s death may be eligible for benefits even though she\nnever actually received her father\u2019s support. It was none-\ntheless Congress\u2019 prerogative to legislate for the generality\nof cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 But see N. Y. Est., Powers & Trusts Law Ann. \u00a74\u20131.1(c) (West 1998)\n\n(\u201cDistributees of the decedent, conceived before his or her death but\nborn alive thereafter, take as if they were born in his or her lifetime.\u201d).\nSimilar provisions are contained in Ga. Code Ann. \u00a753\u20132\u20131(b)(1) (2011),\nIdaho Code \u00a715\u20132\u2013108 (Lexis 2009), Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7524.2\u2013120(10)\n(West Supp. 2012), S. C.

CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder state intestacy law as a workable substitute for bur-\ndensome case-by-case determinations whether the child\nwas, in fact, dependent on her father\u2019s earnings.\n   Respondent argues that on the SSA\u2019s reading, natural\nchildren alone must pass through a \u00a7416(h) gateway.\nAdopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-\ngrandchildren, it is true, are defined in \u00a7416(e), and are\nnot further defined in \u00a7416(h). Respondent overlooks,\nhowever, that although not touched by \u00a7416(h), beneficiar-\nies described in \u00a7\u00a7416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other\nstatutorily prescribed criteria. In short, the Act and regu-\nlations set different eligibility requirements for adopted\nchildren, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchil-\ndren, see 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.356\u2013404.358, but it hardly follows\nthat applicants in those categories are treated more ad-\nvantageously than are children who must meet a \u00a7416(h)\ncriterion.\n   The SSA\u2019s construction of the Act, respondent charges,\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro-\ntection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for\nRespondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.\n636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: \u201cUnder the govern-\nment\u2019s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived chil-\ndren are treated as an inferior subset of natural children\nwho are ineligible for government benefits simply because\nof their date of birth and method of conception.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 42\u201343.\n   Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the\nreading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this\nargument. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff\nv. Astrue, 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have\napplied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws \u201cbur-\nden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the\nillicit relations of their parents, because \u2018visiting this\ncondemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and\nunjust.\u2019 \u201d Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (quoting\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nWeber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175\n(1972)). No showing has been made that posthumously\nconceived children share the characteristics that prompted\nour skepticism of classifications disadvantaging children\nof unwed parents. We therefore need not decide whether\nheightened scrutiny would be appropriate were that the\ncase.10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress\nadopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit\nheld, that regime is \u201creasonably related to the govern-\nment\u2019s twin interests in [reserving] benefits [for] those\nchildren who have lost a parent\u2019s support, and in using\nreasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative\nburden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nVernoff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at\n509).\n                              IV\n  As we have explained, \u00a7416(e)(1)\u2019s statement, \u201c[t]he\nterm \u2018child\u2019 means . . . the child . . . of an individual,\u201d is a\ndefinition of scant utility without aid from neighboring\nprovisions. See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is\nsupplied by \u00a7416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition\nof \u201cchild\u201d \u201cfor purposes of th[e] subchapter\u201d that includes\n\u00a7416(e)(1). Under the completed definition, which the SSA\nemploys, \u00a7416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the\nstatus of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to with-\nout deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the\nagency\u2019s reading is therefore entitled to this Court\u2019s defer-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the \u201cillogical and unjust\u201d\n\ndiscrimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v.\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175\u2013176 (1972), respond-\nent asks us to differentiate between children whose parents were\nmarried and children whose parents\u2019 liaisons were not blessed by clergy\nor the State. She would eliminate the intestacy test only for biological\nchildren of married parents.\n16                   ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nence under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837.\n   Chevron deference is appropriate \u201cwhen it appears that\nCongress delegated authority to the agency generally to\nmake rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency\ninterpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the\nexercise of that authority.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218, 226\u2013227 (2001). Here, as already noted, the\nSSA\u2019s longstanding interpretation is set forth in regu-\nlations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking.\nSee supra, at 6\u20137. Congress gave the Commissioner au-\nthority to promulgate rules \u201cnecessary or appropriate to\ncarry out\u201d the Commissioner\u2019s functions and the relevant\nstatutory provisions. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7405(a), 902(a)(5).\nThe Commissioner\u2019s regulations are neither \u201carbitrary or\ncapricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary to the\nstatute.\u201d Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research\nv.
