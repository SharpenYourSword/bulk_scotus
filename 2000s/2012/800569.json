Argued February 21, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012\nTitle 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, in-\n  cludes \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d among the costs that may be\n  awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. \u00a71920(6). In\n  this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the pre-\n  vailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award in-\n  cluded the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain doc-\n  uments that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed, concluding that \u00a71920(6) covers the cost of translat-\n  ing documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.\nHeld: Because the ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d is someone who\n translates orally from one language to another, the category \u201ccom-\n pensation of interpreters\u201d in \u00a71920(6) does not include the cost of\n document translation. Pp. 3\u221215.\n    (a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified\n for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court. That pro-\n vision defines the term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to pre-\n vailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S.\n 437, 441. As originally configured, \u00a71920 contained five categories of\n taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters\n Act, which added a sixth category that includes \u201ccompensation of in-\n terpreters.\u201d \u00a71920(6). Pp. 3\u22125.\n    (b) Because the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d is not defined in the Court In-\n terpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be\n given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n 179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries\n defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as one who translates spoken, as opposed to\n2             TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    written, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined\n    \u201cinterpreter\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d in terms of oral translation. Respondent\n    relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster\u2019s Third New Inter-\n    national Dictionary that defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201cone that translates;\n    esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different\n    tongues.\u201d Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\n    that the most common meaning of the term is one \u201cwho translates\n    orally,\u201d that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition\n    \u201cone that translates.\u201d That a definition is broad enough to encompass\n    one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is or-\n    dinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist.\n    Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all\n    relevant dictionaries defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d at the time of the statute\u2019s\n    enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful\n    defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written\n    materials. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most\n    authoritative, recognized that \u201cinterpreter\u201d can mean one who trans-\n    lates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.\n    Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is\n    deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.\n    Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of\n    \u201cinterpreter\u201d does not include those who translate writings. Nothing\n    in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a71920 hints that Congress intend-\n    ed to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory\n    context suggests that \u201cinterpreter\u201d includes only those who translate\n    orally. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71827. Moreover, Congress\u2019 use of technical\n    terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature\n    between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and trans-\n    lators, who are used for written communications. Pp. 5\u221211.\n      (c) No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordi-\n    nary meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d This Court has never held that Rule\n    54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading\n    of the costs enumerated in \u00a71920. To the contrary, the Court has\n    made clear that the \u201cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power\n    to evade\u201d the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Craw-\n    ford Fitting, supra, at 442, but \u201cis solely a power to decline to tax, as\n    costs, the items enumerated in \u00a71920,\u201d ibid. This Court\u2019s conclusion\n    is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are\n    limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent\u2019s extratextual\n    arguments\u2015that documentary evidence is no less important than tes-\n    timonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely\n    oral or entirely written\u2015are more properly directed at Congress. In\n    any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must\n    have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

KAN PACIFIC\n SAIPAN, LTD., DBA MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [May 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in\nlawsuits brought in federal court are set forth in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71920. The Court Interpreters Act amended\nthat statute to include \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d\n\u00a71920(6); see also \u00a77, 92 Stat. 2044. The question pre-\nsented in this case is whether \u201ccompensation of interpret-\ners\u201d covers the cost of translating documents. Because the\nordinary meaning of the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d is a person\nwho translates orally from one language to another, we\nhold that \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d is limited to the\ncost of oral translation and does not include the cost of\ndocument translation.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a personal injury action brought\nby petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball\nplayer in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Is-\nlands. Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through\na wooden deck during a tour of respondent\u2019s resort prop-\nerty. Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent\nthat he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments\nfrom the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he\nclaimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income\nfrom contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery\nconcluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.\nThe United States District Court for the Northern Ma-\nriana Islands granted respondent\u2019s motion on the ground\nthat petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew\nof the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise rea-\nsonable care.\n   In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have vari-\nous documents translated from Japanese to English. After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment in respond-\nent\u2019s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.\nOver petitioner\u2019s objection, the District Court awarded\nthe costs to respondent as \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d\nunder \u00a71920(6). Explaining that interpreter services \u201ccan-\nnot be separated into \u2018translation\u2019 and \u2018interpretation,\u2019 \u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs\nfor document translation \u201cfal[l] within the meaning of\n\u2018compensation of an interpreter,\u2019 \u201d ibid. Finding that it\nwas necessary for respondent to have the documents\ntranslated in order to depose petitioner, the court con-\ncluded that the translation services were properly taxed\nas costs.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit affirmed both the District Court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment and its award of costs. The court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s argument that the cost of document translation\nservices is not recoverable as \u201ccompensation of interpret-\ners.\u201d The court explained that \u201cthe word \u2018interpreter\u2019 can\nreasonably encompass a \u2018translator,\u2019 both according to the\ndictionary definition and common usage of these terms,\nwhich does not always draw precise distinctions between\nforeign language interpretations involving live speech\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The court thus concluded that \u201cthe prevailing party\nshould be awarded costs for services required to interpret\neither live speech or written documents into a familiar\nlanguage, so long as interpretation of the items is neces-\nsary to the litigation.\u201d Id., at 1221\u20131222.\n  Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on\nthis issue,1 we granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  Although the taxation of costs was not allowed at com-\nmon law, it was the practice of federal courts in the early\nyears to award costs in the same manner as the courts\nof the relevant forum State. Alyeska Pipeline Service\nCo. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247\u2013248 (1975).\nIn 1793, Congress enacted a statute that authorized the\nawarding of certain costs to prevailing parties based on\nstate law:\n     \u201cThat there be allowed and taxed in the supreme, cir-\n     cuit and district courts of the United States, in favour\n     of the parties obtaining judgments therein, such com-\n     pensation for their travel and attendance, and for at-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Compare BDT Products, Inc. v.

KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    tornies and counsellors\u2019 fees . . . as are allowed in the\n    supreme or superior courts of the respective states.\u201d\n    Act of Mar. 1, 1793, \u00a74, 1 Stat. 333.\nAlthough twice reenacted, this provision expired in 1799.\nAlyeska Pipeline, supra, at 248, n. 19; Crawford Fitting\nCo. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet\neven in the absence of express legislative authorization,\nthe practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of\ncosts persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.\n   Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying\nthe costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The\nimpetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the conse-\nquence of two developments. First, a \u201cgreat diversity in\npractice among the courts\u201d had emerged. Ibid. Second,\n\u201closing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbi-\ntant fees for the victor\u2019s attorney.\u201d Ibid. Against this\nbackdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we\nhave described as a \u201cfar-reaching Act specifying in detail\nthe nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the\nfederal courts.\u201d Id., at 251\u2013252. The substance of this Act\nwas transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874\nand the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of\n1948, where it was codified, \u201cwithout any apparent intent to\nchange the controlling rules,\u201d as 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920. 421\nU. S., at 255.\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the\ndiscretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule\nprovides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a federal statute, these\nrules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other\nthan attorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.\u201d Rule 54(d)(1). We have held that \u201c\u00a71920 defines\nthe term \u2018costs\u2019 as used in Rule 54(d).\u201d Crawford Fitting,\n482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that\n\u201cthe discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source\nof power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71920.\u201d Ibid.\n   As originally configured, \u00a71920 contained five categories\nof taxable costs: (1) \u201c[f]ees of the clerk and marshal\u201d; (2)\n\u201c[f ]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the steno-\ngraphic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the\ncase\u201d; (3) \u201c[f]ees and disbursements for printing and wit-\nnesses\u201d; (4) \u201c[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers\nnecessarily obtained for use in the case\u201d; and (5) \u201c[d]ocket\nfees under section 1923 of this title.\u201d 62 Stat. 955. In\n1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which\namended \u00a71920 to add a sixth category: \u201cCompensation of\ncourt appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation\nservices under section 1828 of this title.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920(6); see also \u00a77, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned\nhere with this sixth category, specifically the item of tax-\nable costs identified as \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d\n                             B\n  To determine whether the item \u201ccompensation of inter-\npreters\u201d includes costs for document translation, we must\nlook to the meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d That term is not\ndefined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other\nrelevant statutory provision. When a term goes undefined\nin a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. As\u00ad\ngrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\nThe question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d?\n  Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the\nCourt Interpreters Act in 1978 defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as one\nwho translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined\nthe term as \u201c[o]ne who translates orally from one language\ninto another.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).\nThe Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the\nrelated word \u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate orally.\u201d Scribner-\n6          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the\nRandom House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of\n\u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate what is said in a foreign lan-\nguage.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the\nOxford English Dictionary defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[o]ne\nwho translates languages,\u201d but then divided that defini-\ntion into two senses: \u201ca. [a] translator of books or writ-\nings,\u201d which it designated as obsolete, and \u201cb. [o]ne who\ntranslates the communications of persons speaking differ-\nent languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in\nthe presence of the persons; a dragoman.\u201d 5 Oxford Eng-\nlish Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dic-\ntionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (\u201cOne who\ninterprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of\npersons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their\npresence\u201d); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686\n(1973) (\u201cone who translates orally for the benefit of two or\nmore parties speaking different languages: . . . a transla-\ntor (obs.)\u201d).\n   Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the\nwords \u201cinterpreter\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d in terms of oral trans-\nlation. The then-current edition of Black\u2019s Law Diction-\nary, for example, defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[a] person\nsworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .\nto the court,\u201d and it defined \u201cinterpret\u201d in relevant part as\n\u201cto translate orally from one tongue to another.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also\nW.

The version of that\ndictionary in print when Congress enacted the Court\nInterpreters Act defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201cone that trans-\nlates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties con-\nversing in different tongues.\u201d       Webster\u2019s Third 1182\n(1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\nthat the most common meaning of the term is one \u201cwho\ntranslates orally,\u201d but that meaning is subsumed within\nthe more general definition \u201cone that translates.\u201d See\n12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster\u2019s Third 15a\n(1986) (explaining that esp \u201cis used to introduce the most\ncommon meaning included in the more general preceding\ndefinition\u201d). For respondent, the general definition suf-\nfices to establish that the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d ordinarily\nincludes persons who translate the written word. Explain-\ning that \u201cthe word \u2018interpreter\u2019 can reasonably encompass\na \u2018translator,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Appeals reached the same\nconclusion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree.\n   That a definition is broad enough to encompass one\nsense of a word does not establish that the word is ordi\u00ad\nnarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v.

KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n296, 301 (1989) (relying on the \u201cmost common meaning\u201d\nand the \u201cordinary and natural signification\u201d of the word\n\u201crequest,\u201d even though it may sometimes \u201cdouble for \u2018de-\nmand\u2019 or \u2018command\u2019 \u201d). The fact that the definition of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third has a sense divider denot-\ning the most common usage suggests that other usages,\nalthough acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It\nis telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment as\nincluding persons who translate orally, but only a handful\ndefined the word broadly enough to encompass translators\nof written material. See supra, at 5\u20137. Although the\nOxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative\non the English language, recognized that \u201cinterpreter\u201d can\nmean one who translates writings, it expressly designated\nthat meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the\nmeaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d that respondent advocates truly\ncommon or ordinary, we would expect to see more support\nfor that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it\ndesignated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nAny definition of a word that is absent from many diction-\naries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common\nor ordinary meaning.\n  Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we\nconclude that the ordinary or common meaning of \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d does not include those who translate writings.\nInstead, we find that an interpreter is normally under-\nstood as one who translates orally from one language to\nanother. This sense of the word is far more natural. As\nthe Seventh Circuit put it: \u201cRobert Fagles made famous\ntranslations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the\nAeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-\nlanguage \u2018interpreter\u2019 of these works.\u201d Extra Equipamen\u00ad\ntos E Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda. v.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a71920,\nhowever, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond\nthe ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d and to embrace the\nbroadest possible meaning that the definition of the word\ncan bear.\n   If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:\nthat the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d applies only to those who\ntranslate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress en-\nacted \u00a71920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.\nThe main provision of that Act is \u00a72(a), codified in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040\u20132042. Par-\nticularly relevant here is \u00a71827. As it now reads, that\nstatute provides for the establishment of \u201ca program to\nfacilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified inter-\npreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United\nStates.\u201d \u00a71827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an\ninterpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the\nUnited States if a party or witness \u201cspeaks only or primar-\nily a language other than the English language\u201d or \u201csuffers\nfrom a hearing impairment\u201d \u201cso as to inhibit such party\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings or communication with\ncounsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit\nsuch witness\u2019 comprehension of questions and the presen-\ntation of such testimony.\u201d \u00a71827(d)(1).3 As originally\nenacted, subsection (k) mandated that the \u201cinterpretation\nprovided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the con-\nsecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .\nmay authorize a simultaneous or summary interpreta-\ntion.\u201d \u00a71827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when\n\nfirst enacted. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also\n92 Stat. 2040.\n10           TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nIn its current form, subsection (k) provides that interpre-\ntation \u201cshall be in the simultaneous mode for any party . . .\nand in the consecutive mode for witnesses,\u201d unless the\ncourt directs otherwise. The simultaneous, consecutive,\nand summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation\nand have nothing to do with the translation of writings.4\nTaken together, these provisions are a strong contextual\nclue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation\nin the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to use\nthe term \u201cinterpreter\u201d throughout the Act in its ordinary\nsense as someone who translates the spoken word. As we\nhave said before, it is a \u201c \u2018normal rule of statutory con-\nstruction\u2019 that \u2018identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.\u2019 \u201d\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 570 (1995) (quoting\nDepartment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510\nU.

R. Rep. No. 95\u20131687, p. 8 (1978). The consecutive\nmode requires the speaker whose communication is being translated to\npause so that the interpreter can \u201cconvey the testimony given.\u201d Ibid.\nAnd the summary mode \u201callow[s] the interpreter to condense and distill\nthe speech of the speaker.\u201d Ibid.; see generally Zazueta, Attorneys\nGuide to the Use of Court Interpreters, 8 U. C. D. L. Rev. 471, 477\u2013478\n(1975).\n   5 The dissent agrees that context should help guide our analysis, but\n\ninstead of looking to the Court Interpreters Act, it looks to \u201cthe practice\nof federal courts both before and after \u00a71920(6)\u2019s enactment.\u201d Post, at 4\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The practice of federal courts after the Act\u2019s\nenactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of\nenactment. And federal court practice before the Act under other\nprovisions of \u00a71920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress\nintended when it added subsection (6). We think the statutory context\nin which the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d appears is a more reliable guide to its\nmeaning.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

That Congress specified \u201cinterpreters\u201d but\nnot \u201ctranslators\u201d is yet another signal that it intended to\nlimit \u00a71920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written,\ntranslation.6\n   In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of\n\u201cinterpreter,\u201d as well as the statutory context in which the\nword is found, lead to the conclusion that \u00a71920(6) does\nnot apply to translators of written materials.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Some   provisions within the United States Code use both \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d and \u201ctranslator\u201d together, thus implying that Congress under-\nstands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above.

But we have\nnever held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statu-\ntory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading\nof the costs enumerated in \u00a71920. To the contrary, we\nhave made clear that the \u201cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d)\nis not a power to evade\u201d the specific categories of costs set\nforth by Congress. Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442.\n\u201cRather,\u201d we have said, \u201cit is solely a power to decline to\ntax, as costs, the items enumerated in \u00a71920.\u201d Ibid. Rule\n54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the\nordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in\nthe costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter.\u201d\n   Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of\ntaxable costs. \u201cAlthough \u2018costs\u2019 has an everyday meaning\nsynonymous with \u2018expenses,\u2019 the concept of taxable costs\nunder Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those\nexpenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court\nwill assess against a litigant.\u201d 10 C.

Because\ntaxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in\nscope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary\nmeaning of the cost items Congress authorized in \u00a71920.\n   As for respondent\u2019s extratextual arguments, they are\nmore properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends\nthat documentary evidence is no less important than\ntestimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to\nrequire the losing party to cover translation costs for\nspoken words but not for written words.

One task, called \u201c \u2018sight translation,\u2019 \u201d involves the\noral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task\ninvolves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a\nthird task, called \u201c \u2018document comparison,\u2019 \u201d involves com-\nparing documents in the source and target language to\nverify that the two are identical. Id., at 21\u201322. Respond-\nent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for\nthese variations and that a bright-line definition of \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d as someone who translates spoken and written\nwords would avoid complication and provide a simple,\nadministrable rule for district courts.\n   Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress\nmust have intended to dispense with the ordinary mean-\n14          TANIGUCHI v.

First, Congress might\nhave distinguished between oral and written translation\nout of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear\nthe potentially sizable costs of translating discovery docu-\nments, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral tes-\ntimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,\nespecially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718\n(1967) (noting the argument \u201cthat since litigation is at\nbest uncertain one should not be penalized for merely\ndefending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor\nmight be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to\nvindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the\nfees of their opponents\u2019 counsel\u201d). Congress might also\nhave concluded that a document translator is more akin to\nan expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher\ndocumentary evidence\u2014like, for instance, a forensic ac-\ncountant\u2014than to an interpreter whose real-time oral\ntranslation services are necessary for communication\nbetween litigants, witnesses, and the court.8\n  Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hy-\nbrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points\nactually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the\nproblem of drawing the line between taxable and nontax-\nable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It cer-\ntainly has not shown that any such problems will be more\ntroublesome than the task of sifting through translated\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral\n\ntranslation, is essential \u201cto equip the parties to present their case\nclearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.\u201d Post, at 5. But\na document translator is no more important than an expert or consult-\nant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary\nevidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not\ntaxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair\na litigant\u2019s case, but document translation is not indispensable, in the\nway oral translation is, to the parties\u2019 ability to communicate with each\nother, with witnesses, and with the court.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Before the Court Inter\u00ad\npreters Act added \u00a71920(6) to the taxation of costs statute\nin 1978, district courts awarded costs for document trans\u00ad\nlation under \u00a71920(4), which allowed taxation of \u201c[f ]ees for\nexemplification and copies of papers,\u201d 28 U.

See, e.g., Kaiser\nIndustries Corp. v. McLouth Steel Corp., 50 F. R. D. 5, 11\n(ED Mich. 1970). Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act, a\nmeasure intended to expand access to interpretation\nservices, indicates a design to eliminate the availability of\ncosts awards for document translation.

Post-1978, rulings awarding document transla\u00ad\ntion costs under \u00a71920(6) indicate the courts\u2019 understand\u00ad\ning both that the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d can readily encompass\noral and written translation, and that Congress did not\notherwise instruct.2 I agree that context should guide the\ndetermination whether \u00a71920(b) is most sensibly read to\nencompass persons who translate documents. See ante, at\n8\u20139. But the context key for me is the practice of federal\ncourts both before and after \u00a71920(6)\u2019s enactment.\n   The purpose of translation, after all, is to make relevant\nforeign-language communication accessible to the litigants\nand the court.

Documen\u00ad\ntary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral\nstatements, must be translated to equip the parties to\npresent their case clearly and the court to decide the\nmerits intelligently. See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera,\n816 F.

But if the interpreter\nthen reads the prepared written translation aloud in\ncourt, that task, in Taniguchi\u2019s view, can be charged as\n\u201cinterpretation,\u201d id., at 11, even though the reading in\u00ad\nvolves no translation of foreign-language expression\u2014\nwritten or oral\u2014at all.\n   Similarly hard to categorize is the common court\u00ad\ninterpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign\nlanguage, transcribing it, then translating it into Eng-\nlish. See Gonz\u00e1lez 439. Although this task involves oral\nforeign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi\ncontends, qualify as \u201cinterpretation,\u201d because it involves\n\u201cthe luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the\nleisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.\u201d Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nsight translation\u2014which Taniguchi concedes may be\ncharged as \u201cinterpretation\u201d\u2014may sometimes involve sim\u00ad\nilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document\nin advance of a court proceeding.

Argued February 21, 2012\u2014Decided May 21, 2012\nTitle 28 U. S.

In\n  this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the pre-\n  vailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award in-\n  cluded the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain doc-\n  uments that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed, concluding that \u00a71920(6) covers the cost of translat-\n  ing documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.\nHeld: Because the ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d is someone who\n translates orally from one language to another, the category \u201ccom-\n pensation of interpreters\u201d in \u00a71920(6) does not include the cost of\n document translation. Pp. 3\u221215.\n    (a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified\n for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court. That pro-\n vision defines the term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to pre-\n vailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S.\n 437, 441. As originally configured, \u00a71920 contained five categories of\n taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters\n Act, which added a sixth category that includes \u201ccompensation of in-\n terpreters.\u201d \u00a71920(6). Pp. 3\u22125.\n    (b) Because the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d is not defined in the Court In-\n terpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be\n given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n 179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries\n defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as one who translates spoken, as opposed to\n2             TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    written, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined\n    \u201cinterpreter\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d in terms of oral translation. Respondent\n    relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster\u2019s Third New Inter-\n    national Dictionary that defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201cone that translates;\n    esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different\n    tongues.\u201d Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\n    that the most common meaning of the term is one \u201cwho translates\n    orally,\u201d that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition\n    \u201cone that translates.\u201d That a definition is broad enough to encompass\n    one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is or-\n    dinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist.\n    Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all\n    relevant dictionaries defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d at the time of the statute\u2019s\n    enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful\n    defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written\n    materials. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most\n    authoritative, recognized that \u201cinterpreter\u201d can mean one who trans-\n    lates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.\n    Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is\n    deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.\n    Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of\n    \u201cinterpreter\u201d does not include those who translate writings. Nothing\n    in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a71920 hints that Congress intend-\n    ed to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory\n    context suggests that \u201cinterpreter\u201d includes only those who translate\n    orally. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71827. Moreover, Congress\u2019 use of technical\n    terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature\n    between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and trans-\n    lators, who are used for written communications. Pp. 5\u221211.\n      (c) No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordi-\n    nary meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d This Court has never held that Rule\n    54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading\n    of the costs enumerated in \u00a71920. To the contrary, the Court has\n    made clear that the \u201cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power\n    to evade\u201d the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Craw-\n    ford Fitting, supra, at 442, but \u201cis solely a power to decline to tax, as\n    costs, the items enumerated in \u00a71920,\u201d ibid. This Court\u2019s conclusion\n    is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are\n    limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent\u2019s extratextual\n    arguments\u2015that documentary evidence is no less important than tes-\n    timonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely\n    oral or entirely written\u2015are more properly directed at Congress.

KAN PACIFIC\n SAIPAN, LTD., DBA MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [May 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in\nlawsuits brought in federal court are set forth in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71920. The Court Interpreters Act amended\nthat statute to include \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d\n\u00a71920(6); see also \u00a77, 92 Stat. 2044. The question pre-\nsented in this case is whether \u201ccompensation of interpret-\ners\u201d covers the cost of translating documents. Because the\nordinary meaning of the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d is a person\nwho translates orally from one language to another, we\nhold that \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d is limited to the\ncost of oral translation and does not include the cost of\ndocument translation.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a personal injury action brought\nby petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball\nplayer in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Is-\nlands. Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through\na wooden deck during a tour of respondent\u2019s resort prop-\nerty. Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent\nthat he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments\nfrom the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he\nclaimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income\nfrom contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery\nconcluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.\nThe United States District Court for the Northern Ma-\nriana Islands granted respondent\u2019s motion on the ground\nthat petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew\nof the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise rea-\nsonable care.\n   In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have vari-\nous documents translated from Japanese to English. After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment in respond-\nent\u2019s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.\nOver petitioner\u2019s objection, the District Court awarded\nthe costs to respondent as \u201ccompensation of interpreters\u201d\nunder \u00a71920(6). Explaining that interpreter services \u201ccan-\nnot be separated into \u2018translation\u2019 and \u2018interpretation,\u2019 \u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs\nfor document translation \u201cfal[l] within the meaning of\n\u2018compensation of an interpreter,\u2019 \u201d ibid. Finding that it\nwas necessary for respondent to have the documents\ntranslated in order to depose petitioner, the court con-\ncluded that the translation services were properly taxed\nas costs.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit affirmed both the District Court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment and its award of costs. The court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s argument that the cost of document translation\nservices is not recoverable as \u201ccompensation of interpret-\ners.\u201d The court explained that \u201cthe word \u2018interpreter\u2019 can\nreasonably encompass a \u2018translator,\u2019 both according to the\ndictionary definition and common usage of these terms,\nwhich does not always draw precise distinctions between\nforeign language interpretations involving live speech\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The court thus concluded that \u201cthe prevailing party\nshould be awarded costs for services required to interpret\neither live speech or written documents into a familiar\nlanguage, so long as interpretation of the items is neces-\nsary to the litigation.\u201d Id., at 1221\u20131222.\n  Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on\nthis issue,1 we granted certiorari. 564 U.

J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet\neven in the absence of express legislative authorization,\nthe practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of\ncosts persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.\n   Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying\nthe costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The\nimpetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the conse-\nquence of two developments. First, a \u201cgreat diversity in\npractice among the courts\u201d had emerged. Ibid. Second,\n\u201closing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbi-\ntant fees for the victor\u2019s attorney.\u201d Ibid. Against this\nbackdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we\nhave described as a \u201cfar-reaching Act specifying in detail\nthe nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the\nfederal courts.\u201d Id., at 251\u2013252. The substance of this Act\nwas transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874\nand the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of\n1948, where it was codified, \u201cwithout any apparent intent to\nchange the controlling rules,\u201d as 28 U. S. C. \u00a71920. 421\nU. S., at 255.\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the\ndiscretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule\nprovides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a federal statute, these\nrules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other\nthan attorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.\u201d Rule 54(d)(1).

In\n1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which\namended \u00a71920 to add a sixth category: \u201cCompensation of\ncourt appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation\nservices under section 1828 of this title.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71920(6); see also \u00a77, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned\nhere with this sixth category, specifically the item of tax-\nable costs identified as \u201ccompensation of interpreters.\u201d\n                             B\n  To determine whether the item \u201ccompensation of inter-\npreters\u201d includes costs for document translation, we must\nlook to the meaning of \u201cinterpreter.\u201d That term is not\ndefined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other\nrelevant statutory provision. When a term goes undefined\nin a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. As\u00ad\ngrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\nThe question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d?\n  Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the\nCourt Interpreters Act in 1978 defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as one\nwho translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined\nthe term as \u201c[o]ne who translates orally from one language\ninto another.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).\nThe Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the\nrelated word \u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate orally.\u201d Scribner-\n6          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the\nRandom House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of\n\u201cinterpret\u201d as \u201cto translate what is said in a foreign lan-\nguage.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the\nOxford English Dictionary defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[o]ne\nwho translates languages,\u201d but then divided that defini-\ntion into two senses: \u201ca. [a] translator of books or writ-\nings,\u201d which it designated as obsolete, and \u201cb. [o]ne who\ntranslates the communications of persons speaking differ-\nent languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in\nthe presence of the persons; a dragoman.\u201d 5 Oxford Eng-\nlish Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dic-\ntionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (\u201cOne who\ninterprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of\npersons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their\npresence\u201d); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686\n(1973) (\u201cone who translates orally for the benefit of two or\nmore parties speaking different languages: . . . a transla-\ntor (obs.)\u201d).\n   Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the\nwords \u201cinterpreter\u201d and \u201cinterpret\u201d in terms of oral trans-\nlation. The then-current edition of Black\u2019s Law Diction-\nary, for example, defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201c[a] person\nsworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .\nto the court,\u201d and it defined \u201cinterpret\u201d in relevant part as\n\u201cto translate orally from one tongue to another.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also\nW.

But see Ballentine\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (defining \u201cinter-\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

The version of that\ndictionary in print when Congress enacted the Court\nInterpreters Act defined \u201cinterpreter\u201d as \u201cone that trans-\nlates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties con-\nversing in different tongues.\u201d       Webster\u2019s Third 1182\n(1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\nthat the most common meaning of the term is one \u201cwho\ntranslates orally,\u201d but that meaning is subsumed within\nthe more general definition \u201cone that translates.\u201d See\n12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster\u2019s Third 15a\n(1986) (explaining that esp \u201cis used to introduce the most\ncommon meaning included in the more general preceding\ndefinition\u201d). For respondent, the general definition suf-\nfices to establish that the term \u201cinterpreter\u201d ordinarily\nincludes persons who translate the written word. Explain-\ning that \u201cthe word \u2018interpreter\u2019 can reasonably encompass\na \u2018translator,\u2019 \u201d the Court of Appeals reached the same\nconclusion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree.\n   That a definition is broad enough to encompass one\nsense of a word does not establish that the word is ordi\u00ad\nnarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United\nStates Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 A handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar\n\nformulation. See Funk & Wagnalls New Comprehensive International\nDictionary of the English Language 665 (1977) (\u201cOne who interprets or\ntranslates; specifically, one who serves as oral translator between\npeople speaking different languages\u201d); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103\n(C. Barnhart & R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (\u201ca person whose business is\ntranslating, especially orally, from a foreign language\u201d); Cassell\u2019s\nEnglish Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (\u201cOne who interprets, esp. one\nemployed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language\u201d).\n8         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n296, 301 (1989) (relying on the \u201cmost common meaning\u201d\nand the \u201cordinary and natural signification\u201d of the word\n\u201crequest,\u201d even though it may sometimes \u201cdouble for \u2018de-\nmand\u2019 or \u2018command\u2019 \u201d). The fact that the definition of\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third has a sense divider denot-\ning the most common usage suggests that other usages,\nalthough acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It\nis telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined\n\u201cinterpreter\u201d at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment as\nincluding persons who translate orally, but only a handful\ndefined the word broadly enough to encompass translators\nof written material. See supra, at 5\u20137. Although the\nOxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative\non the English language, recognized that \u201cinterpreter\u201d can\nmean one who translates writings, it expressly designated\nthat meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the\nmeaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d that respondent advocates truly\ncommon or ordinary, we would expect to see more support\nfor that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it\ndesignated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nAny definition of a word that is absent from many diction-\naries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common\nor ordinary meaning.\n  Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we\nconclude that the ordinary or common meaning of \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d does not include those who translate writings.\nInstead, we find that an interpreter is normally under-\nstood as one who translates orally from one language to\nanother. This sense of the word is far more natural. As\nthe Seventh Circuit put it: \u201cRobert Fagles made famous\ntranslations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the\nAeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-\nlanguage \u2018interpreter\u2019 of these works.\u201d Extra Equipamen\u00ad\ntos E Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o Ltda. v.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in \u00a71920,\nhowever, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond\nthe ordinary meaning of \u201cinterpreter\u201d and to embrace the\nbroadest possible meaning that the definition of the word\ncan bear.\n   If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:\nthat the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d applies only to those who\ntranslate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress en-\nacted \u00a71920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.\nThe main provision of that Act is \u00a72(a), codified in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040\u20132042. Par-\nticularly relevant here is \u00a71827. As it now reads, that\nstatute provides for the establishment of \u201ca program to\nfacilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified inter-\npreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United\nStates.\u201d \u00a71827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an\ninterpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the\nUnited States if a party or witness \u201cspeaks only or primar-\nily a language other than the English language\u201d or \u201csuffers\nfrom a hearing impairment\u201d \u201cso as to inhibit such party\u2019s\ncomprehension of the proceedings or communication with\ncounsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit\nsuch witness\u2019 comprehension of questions and the presen-\ntation of such testimony.\u201d \u00a71827(d)(1).3 As originally\nenacted, subsection (k) mandated that the \u201cinterpretation\nprovided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the con-\nsecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .\nmay authorize a simultaneous or summary interpreta-\ntion.\u201d \u00a71827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when\n\nfirst enacted. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also\n92 Stat. 2040.\n10           TANIGUCHI v.

The simultaneous, consecutive,\nand summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation\nand have nothing to do with the translation of writings.4\nTaken together, these provisions are a strong contextual\nclue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation\nin the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to use\nthe term \u201cinterpreter\u201d throughout the Act in its ordinary\nsense as someone who translates the spoken word. As we\nhave said before, it is a \u201c \u2018normal rule of statutory con-\nstruction\u2019 that \u2018identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.\u2019 \u201d\nGustafson v.

The practice of federal courts after the Act\u2019s\nenactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of\nenactment. And federal court practice before the Act under other\nprovisions of \u00a71920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress\nintended when it added subsection (6). We think the statutory context\nin which the word \u201cinterpreter\u201d appears is a more reliable guide to its\nmeaning.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

That Congress specified \u201cinterpreters\u201d but\nnot \u201ctranslators\u201d is yet another signal that it intended to\nlimit \u00a71920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written,\ntranslation.6\n   In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of\n\u201cinterpreter,\u201d as well as the statutory context in which the\nword is found, lead to the conclusion that \u00a71920(6) does\nnot apply to translators of written materials.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Some   provisions within the United States Code use both \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d and \u201ctranslator\u201d together, thus implying that Congress under-\nstands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above. See,\ne.g., 8 U. S.

But we have\nnever held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statu-\ntory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading\nof the costs enumerated in \u00a71920. To the contrary, we\nhave made clear that the \u201cdiscretion granted by Rule 54(d)\nis not a power to evade\u201d the specific categories of costs set\nforth by Congress. Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442.\n\u201cRather,\u201d we have said, \u201cit is solely a power to decline to\ntax, as costs, the items enumerated in \u00a71920.\u201d Ibid. Rule\n54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the\nordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in\nthe costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cinterpreter.\u201d\n   Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of\ntaxable costs. \u201cAlthough \u2018costs\u2019 has an everyday meaning\nsynonymous with \u2018expenses,\u2019 the concept of taxable costs\nunder Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those\nexpenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court\nwill assess against a litigant.\u201d 10 C.

Kefalas, 664 F. 2d 652, 656 (CA7\n1981). Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable\nexpenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consult-\nants, and investigators.

Because\ntaxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in\nscope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary\nmeaning of the cost items Congress authorized in \u00a71920.\n   As for respondent\u2019s extratextual arguments, they are\nmore properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends\nthat documentary evidence is no less important than\ntestimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to\nrequire the losing party to cover translation costs for\nspoken words but not for written words. Brief for Re-\nspondent 20. Respondent also observes that some transla-\ntion tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written. Id., at\n20\u201324. One task, called \u201c \u2018sight translation,\u2019 \u201d involves the\noral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task\ninvolves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a\nthird task, called \u201c \u2018document comparison,\u2019 \u201d involves com-\nparing documents in the source and target language to\nverify that the two are identical. Id., at 21\u201322. Respond-\nent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for\nthese variations and that a bright-line definition of \u201cinter-\npreter\u201d as someone who translates spoken and written\nwords would avoid complication and provide a simple,\nadministrable rule for district courts.\n   Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress\nmust have intended to dispense with the ordinary mean-\n14          TANIGUCHI v.

First, Congress might\nhave distinguished between oral and written translation\nout of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear\nthe potentially sizable costs of translating discovery docu-\nments, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral tes-\ntimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,\nespecially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718\n(1967) (noting the argument \u201cthat since litigation is at\nbest uncertain one should not be penalized for merely\ndefending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor\nmight be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to\nvindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the\nfees of their opponents\u2019 counsel\u201d). Congress might also\nhave concluded that a document translator is more akin to\nan expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher\ndocumentary evidence\u2014like, for instance, a forensic ac-\ncountant\u2014than to an interpreter whose real-time oral\ntranslation services are necessary for communication\nbetween litigants, witnesses, and the court.8\n  Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hy-\nbrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points\nactually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the\nproblem of drawing the line between taxable and nontax-\nable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It cer-\ntainly has not shown that any such problems will be more\ntroublesome than the task of sifting through translated\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral\n\ntranslation, is essential \u201cto equip the parties to present their case\nclearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.\u201d Post, at 5. But\na document translator is no more important than an expert or consult-\nant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary\nevidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not\ntaxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair\na litigant\u2019s case, but document translation is not indispensable, in the\nway oral translation is, to the parties\u2019 ability to communicate with each\nother, with witnesses, and with the court.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Documen\u00ad\ntary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral\nstatements, must be translated to equip the parties to\npresent their case clearly and the court to decide the\nmerits intelligently.

An interpreter, for example, may be called upon\nto \u201csight translate\u201d a written document, i.e., to convey a\nwritten foreign-language document\u2019s content orally in\nEnglish. R. Gonz\u00e1lez, V. V\u00e1squez, & H. Mikkelson, Fun\u00ad\ndamentals of Court Interpretation: Theory, Policy and\nPractice 401 (1991) (hereinafter Gonz\u00e1lez).

But if the interpreter\nthen reads the prepared written translation aloud in\ncourt, that task, in Taniguchi\u2019s view, can be charged as\n\u201cinterpretation,\u201d id., at 11, even though the reading in\u00ad\nvolves no translation of foreign-language expression\u2014\nwritten or oral\u2014at all.\n   Similarly hard to categorize is the common court\u00ad\ninterpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign\nlanguage, transcribing it, then translating it into Eng-\nlish. See Gonz\u00e1lez 439. Although this task involves oral\nforeign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi\ncontends, qualify as \u201cinterpretation,\u201d because it involves\n\u201cthe luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the\nleisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.\u201d Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nsight translation\u2014which Taniguchi concedes may be\ncharged as \u201cinterpretation\u201d\u2014may sometimes involve sim\u00ad\nilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document\nin advance of a court proceeding.
