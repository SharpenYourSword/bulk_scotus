ARKANSAS\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS\n\n    No. 10\u20131320. Argued February 22, 2012\u2014Decided May 24, 2012\nThe State of Arkansas charged petitioner Alex Blueford with capital\n  murder for the death of a one-year-old child. That charge included\n  the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negli-\n  gent homicide. Before the start of deliberations, the trial court in-\n  structed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: \u201cIf you have a\n  reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of capital\n  murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. . . .\n  If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge\n  of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of\n  manslaughter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s\n  guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the\n  charge of negligent homicide.\u201d The court also presented the jury with\n  a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict\n  Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of\n  them. Acquitting on some but not others was not an option.\n     After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could\n  not reach a verdict. The court inquired about the jury\u2019s progress on\n  each offense. The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous\n  against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree mur-\n  der, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negli-\n  gent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The\n  jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a\n  mistrial. When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he\n  moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder charges on dou-\n  ble jeopardy grounds. The trial court denied the motion, and the Su-\n  preme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on\n charges of capital murder and first-degree murder. Pp. 5\u221210.\n    (a) The jury did not acquit Blueford of capital or first-degree mur-\n2                       BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    der. Blueford contends that the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury was\n    unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a reso-\n    lution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.\n    But the report was not a final resolution of anything. When the fore-\n    person told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\u2019s\n    deliberations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back to\n    the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the court\u2019s in-\n    structions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital\n    and first-degree murder as deliberations continued. The foreperson\u2019s\n    report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality\n    necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses. That same\n    lack of finality undermines Blueford\u2019s reliance on Green v. United\n    States, 355 U. S. 184, and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323. In both of\n    those cases, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the re-\n    port of the foreperson was not. Pp. 5\u22128.\n       (b) The trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial was not improper. A\n    trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the\n    same offense when \u201cparticular circumstances manifest a necessity\u201d to\n    declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 690. Blueford con-\n    tends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-\n    degree murder, given the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury had voted\n    unanimously against guilt on those charges. According to Blueford,\n    the court at that time should have taken some action, whether\n    through new partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to\n    give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to\n    the remaining charges. Blueford acknowledges, however, that the\n    trial court\u2019s reason for declaring a mistrial here\u2014that the jury was\n    unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been considered the \u201cclassic ba-\n    sis\u201d establishing necessity for doing so. Arizona v. Washington, 434\n    U. S. 497, 509. And this Court has never required a trial court, be-\n    fore declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any par-\n    ticular means of breaking the impasse\u2015let alone to consider giving\n    the jury new options for a verdict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___,\n    ___. As permitted under Arkansas law, the jury\u2019s options in this case\n    were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on\n    all. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add an-\n    other option\u2014that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.\n    Pp. 9\u221210.\n2011 Ark. 8, ___ S.

ARKANSAS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      ARKANSAS\n\n                                 [May 24, 2012] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against being\ntried twice for the same offense. The Clause does not,\nhowever, bar a second trial if the first ended in a mistrial.\nBefore the jury concluded deliberations in this case, it re-\nported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of\ncapital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked\non manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homi-\ncide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.\nThe jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the\ncourt declared a mistrial. All agree that the defendant\nmay be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent\nhomicide. The question is whether he may also be retried\non charges of capital and first-degree murder.\n                            I\n  One-year-old Matthew McFadden, Jr., suffered a severe\nhead injury on November 28, 2007, while home with his\nmother\u2019s boyfriend, Alex Blueford. Despite treatment at a\nhospital, McFadden died a few days later.\n  The State of Arkansas charged Blueford with capital\nmurder, but waived the death penalty. The State\u2019s theory\n2                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat trial was that Blueford had injured McFadden inten-\ntionally, causing the boy\u2019s death \u201c[u]nder circumstances\nmanifesting extreme indifference to the value of human\nlife.\u201d Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u201310\u2013101(a)(9)(A) (Supp. 2011).\nThe defense, in contrast, portrayed the death as the re-\nsult of Blueford accidentally knocking McFadden onto the\nground.\n   The trial court instructed the jury that the charge of\ncapital murder included three lesser offenses: first-degree\nmurder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. In addi-\ntion to describing these offenses, the court addressed the\norder in which the jury was to consider them: \u201cIf you have\na reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge\nof capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder\nin the first degree. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of\nthe defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of murder in the first\ndegree, you will then consider the charge of manslaugh-\nter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s\nguilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then con-\nsider the charge of negligent homicide.\u201d App. 51\u201352.\n   The prosecution commented on these instructions in its\nclosing argument. It told the jury, for example, that \u201cbe-\nfore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder,\nyou must first, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of\ncapital murder.\u201d Id., at 55. The prosecution explained\nthat this was \u201cnot a situation where you just lay every-\nthing out here and say, well, we have four choices. Which\none does it fit the most?\u201d Id., at 59. Rather, the prose-\ncution emphasized, \u201cunless all 12 of you agree that this\nman\u2019s actions were not consistent with capital murder,\nthen and only then would you go down to murder in the\nfirst degree.\u201d Ibid.\n   After the parties concluded their arguments, the court\npresented the jury with a set of five verdict forms, each\nrepresenting a possible verdict. There were four separate\nforms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses: capital murder, first-degree murder, manslaugh-\nter, and negligent homicide. A fifth form allowed the jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford\nnot guilty of any offense. There was no form allowing the\njury to acquit on some offenses but not others. As stated\nin the court\u2019s instructions, the jury could either \u201cfind the\ndefendant guilty of one of these offenses\u201d or \u201cacquit him\noutright.\u201d Id., at 51. Any verdict\u2014whether to convict on\none or to acquit on all\u2014had to be unanimous.\n  A few hours after beginning its deliberations, the jury\nsent the court a note asking \u201cwhat happens if we cannot\nagree on a charge at all.\u201d Id., at 62. The court called the\njury back into the courtroom and issued a so-called \u201cAllen\ninstruction,\u201d emphasizing the importance of reaching a ver-\ndict. See Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492, 501\u2013502\n(1896). The jury then deliberated for a half hour more\nbefore sending out a second note, stating that it \u201ccannot\nagree on any one charge in this case.\u201d App. 64. When the\ncourt summoned the jury again, the jury foreperson re-\nported that the jury was \u201chopelessly\u201d deadlocked. Ibid.\nThe court asked the foreperson to disclose the jury\u2019s votes\non each offense:\n      \u201cTHE COURT: All right. If you have your numbers\n    together, and I don\u2019t want names, but if you have your\n    numbers I would like to know what your count was on\n    capital murder.\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous\n    against that. No.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay, on murder in the first degree?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous\n    against that.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Manslaughter?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: Nine for, three against.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And negligent homicide?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: We did not vote on that,\n4                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    sir.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Did not vote on that.\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: No, sir. We couldn\u2019t get\n    past the manslaughter. Were we supposed to go past\n    that? I thought we were supposed to go one at a\n    time.\u201d Id., at 64\u201365.\n   Following this exchange, the court gave another Allen\ninstruction and sent the jurors back to the jury room.\nAfter deliberations resumed, Blueford\u2019s counsel asked the\ncourt to submit new verdict forms to the jurors, to be\ncompleted \u201cfor those counts that they have reached a\nverdict on.\u201d Id., at 67. The prosecution objected on the\ngrounds that the jury was \u201cstill deliberating\u201d and that a\nverdict of acquittal had to be \u201call or nothing.\u201d Id., at 68.\nThe court denied Blueford\u2019s request. To allow for a partial\nverdict, the court explained, would be \u201clike changing\nhorses in the middle of the stream,\u201d given that the jury\nhad already received instructions and verdict forms. Ibid.\nThe court informed counsel that it would declare a mis-\ntrial \u201cif the jury doesn\u2019t make a decision.\u201d Id., at 69.\n   When the jury returned a half hour later, the foreperson\nstated that they had not reached a verdict. The court\ndeclared a mistrial and discharged the jury.\n   The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford. He\nmoved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder\ncharges on double jeopardy grounds, citing the foreper-\nson\u2019s report that the jurors had voted unanimously against\nguilt on those offenses. The trial court denied the motion,\nand the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocu-\ntory appeal. According to the State Supreme Court, the\nforeperson\u2019s report had no effect on the State\u2019s ability to\nretry Blueford, because the foreperson \u201cwas not making a\nformal announcement of acquittal\u201d when she disclosed the\njury\u2019s votes. 2011 Ark. 8, p. 9, ___ S. W. 3d ___, ___. This\nwas not a case, the court observed, \u201cwhere a formal verdict\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas announced or entered of record.\u201d Ibid. The court\nadded that the trial court did not err in denying Blueford\u2019s\nrequest for new verdict forms that would have allowed the\njury to render a partial verdict on the charges of capital\nand first-degree murder.\n  Blueford sought review in this Court, and we granted\ncertiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person\nshall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in\njeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The\nClause \u201cguarantees that the State shall not be permitted\nto make repeated attempts to convict the accused, thereby\nsubjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and\ncompelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and\ninsecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d United States v.\nMartin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 569 (1977) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   Blueford contends that the foreperson\u2019s report means\nthat he cannot be tried again on charges of capital and\nfirst-degree murder. According to Blueford, the Double\nJeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial on those charges,\nfor two reasons.\n                             A\n  Blueford\u2019s primary submission is that he cannot be\nretried for capital and first-degree murder because the\njury actually acquitted him of those offenses. See Green v.\nUnited States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957). The Arkansas\nSupreme Court noted\u2014and Blueford acknowledges\u2014that\nno formal judgment of acquittal was entered in his case.\nBut none was necessary, Blueford maintains, because an\nacquittal is a matter of substance, not form. Quoting from\nour decision in Martin Linen, supra, at 571, Blueford\n6                  BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontends that despite the absence of a formal verdict, a\njury\u2019s announcement constitutes an acquittal if it \u201c \u2018actu-\nally represents a resolution . . . of some or all of the factual\nelements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 21.\nHere, according to Blueford, the foreperson\u2019s announce-\nment of the jury\u2019s unanimous votes on capital and first-\ndegree murder represented just that: a resolution of some\nor all of the elements of those offenses in Blueford\u2019s favor.\n   We disagree. The foreperson\u2019s report was not a final\nresolution of anything. When the foreperson told the court\nhow the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\u2019s deliber-\nations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back\nto the jury room to deliberate further, even after the fore-\nperson had delivered her report. When they emerged a\nhalf hour later, the foreperson stated only that they were\nunable to reach a verdict. She gave no indication whether\nit was still the case that all 12 jurors believed Blueford\nwas not guilty of capital or first-degree murder, that 9 of\nthem believed he was guilty of manslaughter, or that a\nvote had not been taken on negligent homicide. The fact\nthat deliberations continued after the report deprives that\nreport of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal\non the murder offenses.\n   Blueford maintains, however, that any possibility that\nthe jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by\nthe instructions given to the jury. Those instructions, he\ncontends, not only required the jury to consider the of-\nfenses in order, from greater to lesser, but also prevented\nit from transitioning from one offense to the next with-\nout unanimously\u2014and definitively\u2014resolving the greater\noffense in his favor. \u201cA jury is presumed to follow its\ninstructions.\u201d Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234\n(2000). So, Blueford says, the foreperson\u2019s report that the\njury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily estab-\nlishes that the jury had acquitted Blueford of the greater\noffenses of capital and first-degree murder.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   But even if we assume that the instructions required a\nunanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser\noffense\u2014as the State assumes for purposes of this case,\nsee Brief for Respondent 25, n. 3\u2014nothing in the instruc-\ntions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote.\nThe instructions said simply, \u201cIf you have a reasonable\ndoubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of [the greater\noffense], you will [then] consider the charge of [the lesser\noffense].\u201d App. 51\u201352. The jurors were never told that\nonce they had a reasonable doubt, they could not rethink\nthe issue. The jury was free to reconsider a greater of-\nfense, even after considering a lesser one.1\n   A simple example illustrates the point. A jury enters\nthe jury room, having just been given these instructions.\nThe foreperson decides that it would make sense to deter-\nmine the extent of the jurors\u2019 agreement before discus-\nsions begin. Accordingly, she conducts a vote on capital\nmurder, and everyone votes against guilt. She does the\nsame for first-degree murder, and again, everyone votes\nagainst guilt. She then calls for a vote on manslaughter,\nand there is disagreement. Only then do the jurors en-\ngage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime.\nWhile considering the arguments of the other jurors on\nhow the death was caused, one of the jurors starts rethink-\ning his own stance on a greater offense. After reflecting on\nthe evidence, he comes to believe that the defendant did\nknowingly cause the death\u2014satisfying the definition of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In reaching a contrary conclusion, post, at 6 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\n\nJ.), the dissent construes the jury instructions to \u201crequire a jury to\ncomplete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a\nlesser,\u201d post, at 3 (emphasis added). But no such requirement can be\nfound in the text of the instructions themselves. And the dissent\u2019s\nattempt to glean such a requirement from the Arkansas Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Hughes v. State, 347 Ark. 696, 66 S. W. 3d 645\n(2002), is unavailing, for that decision nowhere addresses the issue\nhere\u2014whether a jury can reconsider a greater offense after considering\na lesser one.\n8                  BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst-degree murder. At that point, nothing in the instruc-\ntions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do:\nrevisit a prior vote. \u201cThe very object of the jury system,\u201d\nafter all, \u201cis to secure unanimity by a comparison of views,\nand by arguments among the jurors themselves.\u201d Allen,\n164 U. S., at 501. A single juror\u2019s change of mind is all it\ntakes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense.\n   It was therefore possible for Blueford\u2019s jury to revisit the\noffenses of capital and first-degree murder, notwithstand-\ning its earlier votes. And because of that possibility, the\nforeperson\u2019s report prior to the end of deliberations lacked\nthe finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those\noffenses, quite apart from any requirement that a formal\nverdict be returned or judgment entered.\n   That same lack of finality undermines Blueford\u2019s reli-\nance on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and\nPrice v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970). In those cases, we\nheld that the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when\na defendant, tried for a greater offense and convicted of\na lesser included offense, is later retried for the greater\noffense. See Green, supra, at 190; Price, supra, at 329.\nBlueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case\nfrom Green and Price is that his case involves a deadlock\non the lesser included offense, as opposed to a conviction.\nIn his view, that distinction only favors him, because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause should, if anything, afford greater\nprotection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the\nlesser included offense.\n   Blueford\u2019s argument assumes, however, that the votes\nreported by the foreperson did not change, even though\nthe jury deliberated further after that report. That as-\nsumption is unjustified, because the reported votes were,\nfor the reasons noted, not final. Blueford thus overlooks\nthe real distinction between the cases: In Green and Price,\nthe verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report\nof the foreperson was not.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Blueford acknowledges that a trial\ncan be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for\nthe same offense when \u201cparticular circumstances manifest\na necessity\u201d to declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336\nU. S. 684, 690 (1949); see also United States v. Perez, 9\nWheat. 579, 580 (1824). He also acknowledges that the\ntrial court\u2019s reason for declaring a mistrial here\u2014that\nthe jury was unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been con-\nsidered the \u201cclassic basis\u201d establishing such a necessity.\nArizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 509 (1978).\nBlueford therefore accepts that a second trial on man-\nslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double\njeopardy problem. He contends, however, that there was\nno necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree\nmurder, given the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury had\nvoted unanimously against guilt on those charges. Accord-\ning to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken\n\u201csome action,\u201d whether through partial verdict forms or\nother means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes,\nand then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining\ncharges. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11, n. 8.\n   We reject that suggestion. We have never required a\ntrial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung\njury, to consider any particular means of breaking the\nimpasse\u2014let alone to consider giving the jury new options\nfor a verdict.

But Renico\u2019s\n10                    BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njury\u2019s options in this case were limited to two: either con-\nvict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all. The instruc-\ntions explained those options in plain terms, and the\nverdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome.\nThere were separate forms to convict on each of the possi-\nble offenses, but there was only one form to acquit, and it\nwas to acquit on all of them. When the foreperson dis-\nclosed the jury\u2019s votes on capital and first-degree murder,\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to\nadd another option\u2014that of acquitting on some offenses\nbut not others. That, however, is precisely the relief\nBlueford seeks\u2014relief the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot afford him.\n                         *    *     *\n  The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any\noffense, but it did not acquit him of any either. When the\njury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court prop-\nerly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a\nconsequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand\nin the way of a second trial on the same offenses.\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is\n\n                                                             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndiscussion of the applicable legal principles concerns just that, and the \n\ndissent in any event does not dispute that we have never required a \n\ntrial court to consider any particular means of breaking a jury impasse.\n\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Washing-\nton, 434 U. S. 497, 503 (1978). To implement this rule, our\ncases have articulated two principles. First, an acquittal\noccurs if a jury\u2019s decision, \u201cwhatever its label, actually rep-\nresents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the\nfactual elements of the offense charged.\u201d United States v.\nMartin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571 (1977). Sec-\nond, a trial judge may not defeat a defendant\u2019s entitlement\nto \u201cthe verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favora-\nbly disposed to his fate\u201d by declaring a mistrial before\ndeliberations end, absent a defendant\u2019s consent or a\n\u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d to do so. United States v. Jorn, 400\nU. S. 470, 486, 481 (1971) (plurality opinion) (quoting\nUnited States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824)).\n   Today\u2019s decision misapplies these longstanding prin-\nciples. The Court holds that petitioner Alex Blueford\nwas not acquitted of capital or first-degree murder, even\nthough the forewoman of the Arkansas jury empaneled to\ntry him announced in open court that the jury was \u201cunan-\nimous against\u201d convicting Blueford of those crimes. Nor,\nthe Court concludes, did the Double Jeopardy Clause\noblige the trial judge to take any action to give effect to the\njury\u2019s unambiguous decision before declaring a mistrial as\n2                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nto those offenses. The Court thus grants the State what\nthe Constitution withholds: \u201cthe proverbial \u2018second bite at\nthe apple.\u2019 \u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 17 (1978).\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The bar on retrials following acquittals is \u201cthe most\nfundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy juris-\nprudence.\u201d Martin Linen, 430 U.

This prohibition stops the State, \u201cwith all its\nresources and power,\u201d from mounting abusive, harassing\nreprosecutions, Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187\n(1957), which subject a defendant to \u201cembarrassment,\nexpense, anxiety, and insecurity, and the possibility that\nhe may be found guilty even though innocent,\u201d United\nStates v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 136 (1980).\n   In ascertaining whether an acquittal has occurred,\n\u201cform is not to be exalted over substance.\u201d Sanabria v.\nUnited States, 437 U.

S. 462, 468 (2005). Ju-\nrisdictions have different procedures respecting the an-\nnouncement of verdicts and the entry of judgments, but\nthat diversity has no constitutional significance.

S., at 468; an\nappellate reversal of a conviction for insufficiency of the\nevidence, Burks, 437 U.

S., at\n671.\n  A straightforward application of that principle suffices\nto decide this case. Arkansas is a classic \u201cacquittal-first\u201d\nor \u201chard-transition\u201d jurisdiction. See generally People v.\nRichardson, 184 P. 3d 755, 764, n. 7 (Colo. 2008). Arkan-\nsas\u2019 model jury instructions require a jury to complete its\ndeliberations on a greater offense before it may consider\na lesser. 1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d\ned. 1994). As a matter of Arkansas law, \u201c[b]efore it may\nconsider any lesser-included offense, the jury must first\ndetermine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the\ngreater offense. Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit\nthe defendant of the greater offense before considering his\nor her guilt on the lesser-included offense.\u201d Hughes v.\nState, 347 Ark. 696, 706\u2013707, 66 S. W. 3d 645, 651 (2002).1\n  Here, the trial judge instructed Blueford\u2019s jury to con-\nsider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of\ncapital murder to the lesser included offenses of first-\ndegree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.\nThe judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only\nupon a unanimous finding of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to\nthat offense\u2014that is, upon an acquittal. See In re Win-\nship, 397 U. S. 358, 363 (1970). The State\u2019s closing argu-\nments repeated this directive: \u201c[B]efore you can consider a\nlesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12,\nvote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\u201d App.\n55. And the forewoman\u2019s colloquy with the judge leaves no\ndoubt that the jury understood the instructions to man-\ndate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a pre-\nrequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  State has taken the same position. See Brief for Appellee in\nBoyd v. State, No. CR 06\u2013973 (Ark.), p. 13 (\u201c[U]nanimity is the essence\nof a jury verdict as it pertains to acquitting a defendant of the charged\noffense and the subsequent consideration of lesser-included offenses\u201d).\n4                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide\nbecause the jurors \u201ccouldn\u2019t get past the manslaughter\u201d\ncount on which they were deadlocked. Id., at 65.\n  In this context, the forewoman\u2019s announcement in open\ncourt that the jury was \u201cunanimous against\u201d conviction on\ncapital and first-degree murder, id., at 64\u201365, was an\nacquittal for double jeopardy purposes.2 Per Arkansas\nlaw, the jury\u2019s determination of reasonable doubt as to\nthose offenses was an acquittal \u201cin essence.\u201d Hughes, 347\nArk., at 707, 66 S. W. 3d, at 651. By deciding that the\nState \u201chad failed to come forward with sufficient proof,\u201d\nthe jury resolved the charges of capital and first-degree\nmurder adversely to the State. Burks, 437 U. S., at 10.\nThat acquittal cannot be reconsidered without putting\nBlueford twice in jeopardy.\n  Green and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970), bolster\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The jury\u2019s acquittals on the murder counts were unsurprising in\n\nlight of the deficiencies in the State\u2019s case. For example, Dr. Adam\nCraig\u2014the medical examiner who autopsied the victim, Matthew\nMcFadden, Jr., and whose testimony was essential to the State\u2019s theory\nof the crime\u2014was not board certified in anatomical pathology, hav-\ning failed the certification examination five times. Dr. Craig took only\n2 slides of Matthew\u2019s brain, not the 10 to 20 called for by prevail-\ning professional standards. He dismissed Blueford\u2019s explanation for\nMatthew\u2019s death\u2014that Blueford accidentally knocked Matthew to the\nfloor\u2014on the basis of an outdated paper on child head injuries, ac-\nknowledging that he was only \u201cvaguely aware\u201d of a more recent, semi-\nnal paper that supported Blueford\u2019s account. Record 390; see Gold-\nsmith & Plunkett, A Biomechanical Analysis of the Causes of\nTraumatic Brain Injury in Infants and Children, 25 Am. J. Forensic\nMed. & Pathology 89 (2004). Blueford\u2019s expert pathologist, Dr. Robert\nBux, testified that Dr. Craig\u2019s autopsy was inadequate to establish\nwhether Matthew\u2019s death was accidental or intentional. And Blue-\nford\u2019s expert pediatrician, Dr. John Galaznik, testified that the State\u2019s\ntheory\u2014that Blueford slammed Matthew into a mattress on the floor\u2014\nwas \u201cnot a likely cause\u201d of the boy\u2019s injuries when assessed in view of\ncurrent medical literature. Record 766. Even the trial judge observed\nthat the State\u2019s proof was \u201ccircumstantial at best,\u201d and that this was\n\u201cprobably . . . a lesser included offense case.\u201d Id., at 610.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat conclusion. In Green, the jury convicted the defend-\nant on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder\nwithout returning a verdict on the charged offense of first-\ndegree murder. This Court concluded that this result was\nan \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d on the greater offense of first-\ndegree murder, barring retrial. 355 U. S., at 190. The\ndefendant \u201cwas forced to run the gantlet once on that\ncharge and the jury refused to convict him. When given\nthe choice between finding him guilty of either first or\nsecond degree murder it chose the latter.\u201d Ibid.; see also\nPrice, 398 U. S., at 329 (\u201c[T]his Court has consistently\nrefused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after\nan acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied\nby a conviction on a lesser included offense when the\njury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on\nthe greater charge\u201d (footnote omitted)). Notably, Green\nacknowledged that its finding of an \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d\nwas an \u201cassumption,\u201d because the jury had made no ex-\npress statement with respect to the greater offense. 355\nU. S., at 190\u2013191.\n  Blueford\u2019s position is even stronger because his jury was\nnot silent on the murder counts, but announced that it\nwas \u201cunanimous against\u201d conviction. And the trial judge\nspecifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter\nonly after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts.\nCourts in several acquittal-first jurisdictions have held\nthat a jury\u2019s deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies\nthe assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater\noffenses. See State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 283\u2013285, 773\nA. 2d. 308, 323\u2013324 (2001); Stone v. Superior Ct. of San\nDiego Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 503, 511\u2013512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d 809,\n815, n. 5 (1982). That assumption is not even necessary\nhere because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.\n                            B\n  The majority holds that the forewoman\u2019s announcement\n6                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwas not an acquittal because it \u201cwas not a final resolution\nof anything.\u201d Ante, at 6. In the majority\u2019s view, the jury\nmight have revisited its decisions on the murder counts\nduring the 31 minutes of deliberations that followed the\nforewoman\u2019s announcement. We cannot know whether\nthe jury did so, the majority reasons, because the jury was\ndischarged without confirming that it remained \u201cunani-\nmous against\u201d convicting Blueford of capital and first-\ndegree murder. Ante, at 6\u20138.3\n   Putting to one side the lack of record evidence to support\nthis speculation\u2014by far the more plausible inference is\nthat the jurors spent those 31 minutes attempting to\nresolve their deadlock on manslaughter\u2014I do not agree\nthat the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when\nits deliberations resumed. \u201cA verdict of acquittal on the\nissue of guilt or innocence is, of course, absolutely final.\u201d\nBullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430, 445 (1981). The\njury heard instructions and argument that it was required\nunanimously to acquit on capital and first-degree murder\nbefore it could reach manslaughter. And as the forewom-\nan\u2019s colloquy makes plain, the jury followed those instruc-\ntions scrupulously. There is no reason to believe that the\njury\u2019s vote was anything other than a verdict in sub-\nstance\u2014that is, a \u201cfinal collective decision . . . reached\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This Court granted certiorari to decide \u201c[w]hether, if a jury dead-\n\nlocks on a lesser-included offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nreprosecution of a greater offense after a jury announces that it has\nvoted against guilt on the greater offense.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. The major-\nity resolves the question presented by determining that the forewoman\u2019s\nannouncements were not final, such that Blueford\u2019s jury did not neces-\nsarily deadlock on the lesser included offense of manslaughter. See\nante, at 8\u20139, n. 2. In light of that determination, I do not read today\u2019s\nopinion to express any view with respect to the requirements of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause where a jury does deadlock on a lesser in-\ncluded offense. Cf., e.g., State v. Tate, 256 Conn. 262, 284\u2013285, 773\nA. 2d 308, 324\u2013325 (2001); Whiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274\n(Alaska App. 1991).\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

Gillespie, 640\nF. 3d 888, 906 (CA9 2011) (en banc). And when that deci-\nsion was announced in open court, it became entitled to\nfull double jeopardy protection. See, e.g., Commonwealth\nv.

Mills, 19 Ark. 476 (1858) (\u201cThe ver-\ndict was of no validity until delivered, by the jury, in\nCourt\u201d).\n   The majority\u2019s example of a jury that takes a prelimi-\nnary vote on greater offenses, advances to the considera-\ntion of a lesser, and then returns to a greater, is inapposite.\nSee ante, at 7. In the majority\u2019s example, the jury has\nnot announced its vote in open court. Moreover, the\ninstructions in this case did not contemplate that the\njury\u2019s deliberations could take the course that the majority\nimagines. Arkansas\u2019 model instruction requires acquittal\nas a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to final-\nity. Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-first instruction is\nto ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater\noffense. See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340, 346\n(CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-first instruction avoids\n\u201cthe danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its\nduties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will\nmove too quickly to the lesser\u201d). True, Arkansas\u2019 instruc-\n8                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does\nnot expressly permit reconsideration either. In any event,\nnothing indicates that the jury\u2019s announced decisions were\ntentative, compromises, or mere steps en route to a final\nverdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that\nambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant. See\nDownum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 738 (1963).\n   The fact that the jury was not given the express option\nof acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant. See ante,\nat 3, 9. Arkansas law ascribes no significance to the pres-\nence of such options on a verdict form. See Rowland v.\nState, 263 Ark. 77, 85, 562 S. W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (\u201cThe\njury may prepare and present its own form of verdict\u201d).\nThe lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a\njudgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of\nan acquittal for constitutional purposes. See Hudson v.\nLouisiana, 450 U. S. 40, 41, n. 1 (1981).\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s distinction of Green and Price is\nunavailing. The majority observes that Green and Price,\nunlike this case, involved final decisions. Ante, at 8. As I\nhave explained, I view the forewoman\u2019s announcements of\nacquittal in this case as similarly final. In any event,\nGreen clarified that the defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim of former jeop-\nardy\u201d was \u201cnot based on his previous conviction for second\ndegree murder but instead on the original jury\u2019s refusal to\nconvict him of first degree murder.\u201d 355 U. S., at 190,\nn. 11; accord, id., at 194, n. 14. That is, the jury\u2019s silence\non the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to\njustify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 191; see also Price, 398 U. S.,\nat 329. In light of the forewoman\u2019s announcement, this is\nan a fortiori case.\n   In short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an in-\nquiry into the substance of the jury\u2019s actions. Blueford\u2019s\njury had the option to convict him of capital and first-\ndegree murder, but expressly declined to do so. That\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

It \u201chas been long estab-\nlished as an integral part of double jeopardy jurispru-\ndence\u201d that \u201ca defendant could be put in jeopardy even in\na prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an\nacquittal.\u201d Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 34 (1978). This\nrule evolved in response to the \u201cabhorrent\u201d practice under\nthe Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and\nthereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that\nthe Crown\u2019s proof might be insufficient. Washington, 434\nU. S., at 507; see, e.g., Ireland\u2019s Case, 7 How. St. Tr. 79,\n120 (1678). Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is dis-\ncharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant\nconsents or there is a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the dis-\ncharge. Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins,\n90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698).\n   In Perez, this Court explained that \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d\nis a high bar: \u201c[T]he power ought to be used with the\ngreatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very\nplain and obvious causes.\u201d 9 Wheat., at 580. Since Perez,\nthis Court has not relaxed the showing required. See, e.g.,\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 506 (requiring a \u201c \u2018high degree\u2019 \u201d\nof necessity); Downum, 372 U. S., at 736 (\u201cimperious\nnecessity\u201d); see also, e.g., United States v. Coolidge, 25\nF. Cas. 622, 623 (No. 14,858) (CC Mass. 1815) (Story, J.)\n(\u201cextraordinary and striking circumstances\u201d). Before de-\nclaring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh\nheavily a \u201cdefendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial com-\npleted by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v. Hunter, 336\nU. S. 684, 689 (1949). And in light of the historical abuses\n10                BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nagainst which the Double Jeopardy Clause guards, a trial\njudge must tread with special care where a mistrial would\n\u201chelp the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going\nbadly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity\nto convict the accused.\u201d Gori v. United States, 367 U. S.\n364, 369 (1961); see Green, 355 U. S., at 188.\n   A jury\u2019s genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes\nmanifest necessity. But in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, a\njury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included\noffense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a de-\nfendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on a greater\u2014it has acquit-\nted on the greater. Under Green, that is unquestionably\ntrue if the jury convicts on the lesser. See id., at 189. It\nwould be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered\nless protection to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked\non the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all. See\nStone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511\u2013512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d, at 815, n. 5.\n   I would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nrequires a trial judge, in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, to\nhonor a defendant\u2019s request for a partial verdict before\ndeclaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock.\nCourts in acquittal-first jurisdictions have so held. See,\ne.g., Tate, 256 Conn., at 285\u2013287, 773 A. 2d, at 324\u2013325;\nWhiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991);\nStone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P. 2d, at 820; State v.\nPugliese, 120 N. H. 728, 730, 422 A. 2d 1319, 1321 (1980)\n(per curiam); State v. Castrillo, 90 N. M. 608, 611, 566\nP. 2d 1146, 1149 (1977); see also N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law\nAnn. \u00a7310.70 (West 2002). Requiring a partial verdict in\nan acquittal-first jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction\ntakes the bitter with the sweet. In general, an acquittal-\nfirst instruction increases the likelihood of conviction on a\ngreater offense. See People v. Boettcher, 69 N. Y. 2d 174,\n182, 505 N. E. 2d 594, 597 (1987). True, such an instruc-\ntion may also result in deadlock on a greater, preventing a\nState \u201cfrom obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus\nrequire the expense of a retrial.\u201d Tsanas, 572 F. 2d, at\n346. But a State willing to incur that expense loses noth-\ning by overcharging in an acquittal-first regime. At worst,\nthe State enjoys a second opportunity to convict, \u201cwith the\npossibility that the earlier \u2018trial run\u2019 will strengthen the\nprosecution\u2019s case.\u201d Crist, 437 U. S., at 52 (Powell, J.,\ndissenting). If a State wants the benefits of requiring a\njury to acquit before compromising, it should not be per-\nmitted to deprive a defendant of the corresponding bene-\nfits of having been acquitted. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nexpressly prohibits that outcome.\n   The majority observes that we \u201chave never required a\ntrial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung\njury, to consider any particular means of breaking the\nimpasse\u2014let alone to consider giving the jury new options\nfor a verdict.\u201d Ante, at 10 (citing Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)). That hands-off approach\ndilutes Perez beyond recognition. This Court has never\nexcused a trial judge from exercising \u201cscrupulous\u201d care\nbefore discharging a jury. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plural-\nity opinion). Rather, we have insisted that a trial judge\nmay not act \u201cirrationally,\u201d \u201cirresponsibly,\u201d or \u201cprecipi-\ntately.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at 514\u2013515. Nor have we\nretreated from the rule that \u201creviewing courts have an\nobligation to ensure themselves that . . . the trial judge\nexercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d Id., at\n514 (quoting Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority\u2019s reliance on Renico, a habeas corpus case decided\nunder the deferential standard of review prescribed by the Antiterror-\nism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), is perplexing.\nAs Renico made clear, the question there was \u201cnot whether the trial\njudge should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it was an\nabuse of discretion for her to have done so\u2014the applicable standard on\ndirect review. The question under AEDPA is instead whether the\ndetermination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse\n12                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   Even if the Double Jeopardy Clause did not compel that\nbroader rule, the facts of this case confirm that there was\nno necessity, let alone manifest necessity, for a mistrial.\nThere was no reason for the judge not to have asked the\njury, prior to discharge, whether it remained \u201cunanimous\nagainst\u201d conviction on capital and first-degree murder.\nThere would have been no intrusion on the jury\u2019s delibera-\ntive process. The judge was not required to issue new\ninstructions or verdict forms, allow new arguments, direct\nfurther deliberations, or take any other action that might\nhave threatened to coerce the jury. Merely repeating his\nearlier question would have sufficed. Because the judge\nfailed to take even this modest step\u2014or indeed, to explore\nany alternatives to a mistrial, or even to make an on-the-\nrecord finding of manifest necessity\u2014I conclude that there\nwas an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., id., at 486; see also\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 525 (Marshall, J., dissenting)\n(manifest necessity requires showing \u201cthat there were no\nmeaningful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or\nthat the trial court scrupulously considered available alter-\nnatives and found all wanting but a termination of the\nproceedings\u201d).\n   Indeed, the only reason I can divine for the judge\u2019s\nfailure to take this modest step is his misperception of\nArkansas law with respect to the transitional instruction.\nAfter the colloquy with the forewoman, the judge com-\nmented at sidebar that the jurors \u201chaven\u2019t even taken a\nvote on [negligent homicide]. . . . I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve\ncompleted their deliberation. . . . I mean, under any rea-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof discretion was \u2018an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law.\u2019 \u201d 559 U.

Renico\nthus has little to say about a trial judge\u2019s responsibilities, or this\nCourt\u2019s, on direct review. Cf. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.

And after the jury\nretired for the last half-hour of deliberations, the judge\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t think they have an understanding of really\nthat they don\u2019t have to get past every charge unanimously\nbefore they can move to the next charge.\u201d Id., at 69. That\nmisstated Arkansas law as well as the judge\u2019s own in-\nstructions. The jury was required to reach a unanimous\ndecision on a greater offense before considering a lesser.\nSee supra, at 2\u20133. In discharging the jury, the judge said,\n\u201cMadam Foreman, there seems to be a lot of confusion on\nthe part . . . of the jury about some of the instructions.\nAnd because of the confusion and because of the timeliness\nand the amount of hours that has gone by without being\nable to reach a verdict, the Court is going to declare a\nmistrial.\u201d App. 69\u201370.\n   If, as these comments suggest, the judge wrongly be-\nlieved that the jury was not required to reach unanimity\non a greater offense before considering a lesser, then he\naccorded insufficient finality and weight to the forewom-\nan\u2019s earlier announcement of acquittal on capital and first-\ndegree murder. That mistake of law negates the deference\ndue the judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial. The judge\nexplained that the jury was being discharged in part based\non its \u201cconfusion\u201d with respect to the instructions, when in\nfact, the confusion was the judge\u2019s. Ibid.; see, e.g., Wash-\nington, 434 U. S., at 510, n. 28 (\u201cIf the record reveals that\nthe trial judge has failed to exercise the \u2018sound discretion\u2019\nentrusted to him, the reason for . . . deference by an appel-\nlate court disappears\u201d); Illinois v.

ARKANSAS\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS\n\n    No. 10\u20131320. Argued February 22, 2012\u2014Decided May 24, 2012\nThe State of Arkansas charged petitioner Alex Blueford with capital\n  murder for the death of a one-year-old child. That charge included\n  the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negli-\n  gent homicide. Before the start of deliberations, the trial court in-\n  structed the jury to consider the offenses as follows: \u201cIf you have a\n  reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of capital\n  murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. . . .\n  If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge\n  of murder in the first degree, you will then consider the charge of\n  manslaughter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s\n  guilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then consider the\n  charge of negligent homicide.\u201d The court also presented the jury with\n  a set of verdict forms, which allowed the jury either to convict\n  Blueford of one of the charged offenses, or to acquit him of all of\n  them. Acquitting on some but not others was not an option.\n     After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could\n  not reach a verdict. The court inquired about the jury\u2019s progress on\n  each offense. The foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous\n  against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree mur-\n  der, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negli-\n  gent homicide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate. The\n  jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the court declared a\n  mistrial. When the State subsequently sought to retry Blueford, he\n  moved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder charges on dou-\n  ble jeopardy grounds. The trial court denied the motion, and the Su-\n  preme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrying Blueford on\n charges of capital murder and first-degree murder. Pp. 5\u221210.\n    (a) The jury did not acquit Blueford of capital or first-degree mur-\n2                       BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    der. Blueford contends that the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury was\n    unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a reso-\n    lution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.\n    But the report was not a final resolution of anything. When the fore-\n    person told the court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\u2019s\n    deliberations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back to\n    the jury room to deliberate further, and nothing in the court\u2019s in-\n    structions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital\n    and first-degree murder as deliberations continued. The foreperson\u2019s\n    report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality\n    necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses. That same\n    lack of finality undermines Blueford\u2019s reliance on Green v. United\n    States, 355 U. S. 184, and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323. In both of\n    those cases, the verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the re-\n    port of the foreperson was not. Pp. 5\u22128.\n       (b) The trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial was not improper. A\n    trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the\n    same offense when \u201cparticular circumstances manifest a necessity\u201d to\n    declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 690. Blueford con-\n    tends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-\n    degree murder, given the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury had voted\n    unanimously against guilt on those charges. According to Blueford,\n    the court at that time should have taken some action, whether\n    through new partial verdict forms or other means, to allow the jury to\n    give effect to those votes, and then considered a mistrial only as to\n    the remaining charges. Blueford acknowledges, however, that the\n    trial court\u2019s reason for declaring a mistrial here\u2014that the jury was\n    unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been considered the \u201cclassic ba-\n    sis\u201d establishing necessity for doing so. Arizona v. Washington, 434\n    U. S. 497, 509. And this Court has never required a trial court, be-\n    fore declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury, to consider any par-\n    ticular means of breaking the impasse\u2015let alone to consider giving\n    the jury new options for a verdict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___,\n    ___. As permitted under Arkansas law, the jury\u2019s options in this case\n    were limited to two: either convict on one of the offenses, or acquit on\n    all. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add an-\n    other option\u2014that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.\n    Pp. 9\u221210.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ___ S.

The Clause does not,\nhowever, bar a second trial if the first ended in a mistrial.\nBefore the jury concluded deliberations in this case, it re-\nported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of\ncapital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked\non manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homi-\ncide. The court told the jury to continue to deliberate.\nThe jury did so but still could not reach a verdict, and the\ncourt declared a mistrial. All agree that the defendant\nmay be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent\nhomicide. The question is whether he may also be retried\non charges of capital and first-degree murder.\n                            I\n  One-year-old Matthew McFadden, Jr., suffered a severe\nhead injury on November 28, 2007, while home with his\nmother\u2019s boyfriend, Alex Blueford. Despite treatment at a\nhospital, McFadden died a few days later.\n  The State of Arkansas charged Blueford with capital\nmurder, but waived the death penalty.

ARKANSAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat trial was that Blueford had injured McFadden inten-\ntionally, causing the boy\u2019s death \u201c[u]nder circumstances\nmanifesting extreme indifference to the value of human\nlife.\u201d Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u201310\u2013101(a)(9)(A) (Supp. 2011).\nThe defense, in contrast, portrayed the death as the re-\nsult of Blueford accidentally knocking McFadden onto the\nground.\n   The trial court instructed the jury that the charge of\ncapital murder included three lesser offenses: first-degree\nmurder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide. In addi-\ntion to describing these offenses, the court addressed the\norder in which the jury was to consider them: \u201cIf you have\na reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge\nof capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder\nin the first degree. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of\nthe defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of murder in the first\ndegree, you will then consider the charge of manslaugh-\nter. . . . If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s\nguilt on the charge of manslaughter, you will then con-\nsider the charge of negligent homicide.\u201d App. 51\u201352.\n   The prosecution commented on these instructions in its\nclosing argument. It told the jury, for example, that \u201cbe-\nfore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder,\nyou must first, all 12, vote that this man is not guilty of\ncapital murder.\u201d Id., at 55. The prosecution explained\nthat this was \u201cnot a situation where you just lay every-\nthing out here and say, well, we have four choices. Which\none does it fit the most?\u201d Id., at 59. Rather, the prose-\ncution emphasized, \u201cunless all 12 of you agree that this\nman\u2019s actions were not consistent with capital murder,\nthen and only then would you go down to murder in the\nfirst degree.\u201d Ibid.\n   After the parties concluded their arguments, the court\npresented the jury with a set of five verdict forms, each\nrepresenting a possible verdict. There were four separate\nforms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses: capital murder, first-degree murder, manslaugh-\nter, and negligent homicide. A fifth form allowed the jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, if the jury found Blueford\nnot guilty of any offense. There was no form allowing the\njury to acquit on some offenses but not others. As stated\nin the court\u2019s instructions, the jury could either \u201cfind the\ndefendant guilty of one of these offenses\u201d or \u201cacquit him\noutright.\u201d Id., at 51. Any verdict\u2014whether to convict on\none or to acquit on all\u2014had to be unanimous.\n  A few hours after beginning its deliberations, the jury\nsent the court a note asking \u201cwhat happens if we cannot\nagree on a charge at all.\u201d Id., at 62. The court called the\njury back into the courtroom and issued a so-called \u201cAllen\ninstruction,\u201d emphasizing the importance of reaching a ver-\ndict. See Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492, 501\u2013502\n(1896). The jury then deliberated for a half hour more\nbefore sending out a second note, stating that it \u201ccannot\nagree on any one charge in this case.\u201d App. 64. When the\ncourt summoned the jury again, the jury foreperson re-\nported that the jury was \u201chopelessly\u201d deadlocked. Ibid.\nThe court asked the foreperson to disclose the jury\u2019s votes\non each offense:\n      \u201cTHE COURT: All right. If you have your numbers\n    together, and I don\u2019t want names, but if you have your\n    numbers I would like to know what your count was on\n    capital murder.\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous\n    against that. No.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay, on murder in the first degree?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: That was unanimous\n    against that.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Manslaughter?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: Nine for, three against.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And negligent homicide?\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: We did not vote on that,\n4                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    sir.\n      \u201cTHE COURT: Did not vote on that.\n      \u201cJUROR NUMBER ONE: No, sir. We couldn\u2019t get\n    past the manslaughter. Were we supposed to go past\n    that? I thought we were supposed to go one at a\n    time.\u201d Id., at 64\u201365.\n   Following this exchange, the court gave another Allen\ninstruction and sent the jurors back to the jury room.\nAfter deliberations resumed, Blueford\u2019s counsel asked the\ncourt to submit new verdict forms to the jurors, to be\ncompleted \u201cfor those counts that they have reached a\nverdict on.\u201d Id., at 67. The prosecution objected on the\ngrounds that the jury was \u201cstill deliberating\u201d and that a\nverdict of acquittal had to be \u201call or nothing.\u201d Id., at 68.\nThe court denied Blueford\u2019s request. To allow for a partial\nverdict, the court explained, would be \u201clike changing\nhorses in the middle of the stream,\u201d given that the jury\nhad already received instructions and verdict forms. Ibid.\nThe court informed counsel that it would declare a mis-\ntrial \u201cif the jury doesn\u2019t make a decision.\u201d Id., at 69.\n   When the jury returned a half hour later, the foreperson\nstated that they had not reached a verdict. The court\ndeclared a mistrial and discharged the jury.\n   The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford. He\nmoved to dismiss the capital and first-degree murder\ncharges on double jeopardy grounds, citing the foreper-\nson\u2019s report that the jurors had voted unanimously against\nguilt on those offenses. The trial court denied the motion,\nand the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed on interlocu-\ntory appeal. According to the State Supreme Court, the\nforeperson\u2019s report had no effect on the State\u2019s ability to\nretry Blueford, because the foreperson \u201cwas not making a\nformal announcement of acquittal\u201d when she disclosed the\njury\u2019s votes. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, p. 9, ___ S.

The\nClause \u201cguarantees that the State shall not be permitted\nto make repeated attempts to convict the accused, thereby\nsubjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and\ncompelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and\ninsecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d United States v.\nMartin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 569 (1977) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   Blueford contends that the foreperson\u2019s report means\nthat he cannot be tried again on charges of capital and\nfirst-degree murder. According to Blueford, the Double\nJeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial on those charges,\nfor two reasons.\n                             A\n  Blueford\u2019s primary submission is that he cannot be\nretried for capital and first-degree murder because the\njury actually acquitted him of those offenses. See Green v.\nUnited States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957). The Arkansas\nSupreme Court noted\u2014and Blueford acknowledges\u2014that\nno formal judgment of acquittal was entered in his case.\nBut none was necessary, Blueford maintains, because an\nacquittal is a matter of substance, not form. Quoting from\nour decision in Martin Linen, supra, at 571, Blueford\n6                  BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncontends that despite the absence of a formal verdict, a\njury\u2019s announcement constitutes an acquittal if it \u201c \u2018actu-\nally represents a resolution . . . of some or all of the factual\nelements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 21.\nHere, according to Blueford, the foreperson\u2019s announce-\nment of the jury\u2019s unanimous votes on capital and first-\ndegree murder represented just that: a resolution of some\nor all of the elements of those offenses in Blueford\u2019s favor.\n   We disagree. The foreperson\u2019s report was not a final\nresolution of anything. When the foreperson told the court\nhow the jury had voted on each offense, the jury\u2019s deliber-\nations had not yet concluded. The jurors in fact went back\nto the jury room to deliberate further, even after the fore-\nperson had delivered her report. When they emerged a\nhalf hour later, the foreperson stated only that they were\nunable to reach a verdict. She gave no indication whether\nit was still the case that all 12 jurors believed Blueford\nwas not guilty of capital or first-degree murder, that 9 of\nthem believed he was guilty of manslaughter, or that a\nvote had not been taken on negligent homicide. The fact\nthat deliberations continued after the report deprives that\nreport of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal\non the murder offenses.\n   Blueford maintains, however, that any possibility that\nthe jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by\nthe instructions given to the jury. Those instructions, he\ncontends, not only required the jury to consider the of-\nfenses in order, from greater to lesser, but also prevented\nit from transitioning from one offense to the next with-\nout unanimously\u2014and definitively\u2014resolving the greater\noffense in his favor. \u201cA jury is presumed to follow its\ninstructions.\u201d Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234\n(2000). So, Blueford says, the foreperson\u2019s report that the\njury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily estab-\nlishes that the jury had acquitted Blueford of the greater\noffenses of capital and first-degree murder.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   But even if we assume that the instructions required a\nunanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser\noffense\u2014as the State assumes for purposes of this case,\nsee Brief for Respondent 25, n. 3\u2014nothing in the instruc-\ntions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote.\nThe instructions said simply, \u201cIf you have a reasonable\ndoubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the charge of [the greater\noffense], you will [then] consider the charge of [the lesser\noffense].\u201d App. 51\u201352. The jurors were never told that\nonce they had a reasonable doubt, they could not rethink\nthe issue. The jury was free to reconsider a greater of-\nfense, even after considering a lesser one.1\n   A simple example illustrates the point. A jury enters\nthe jury room, having just been given these instructions.\nThe foreperson decides that it would make sense to deter-\nmine the extent of the jurors\u2019 agreement before discus-\nsions begin. Accordingly, she conducts a vote on capital\nmurder, and everyone votes against guilt. She does the\nsame for first-degree murder, and again, everyone votes\nagainst guilt. She then calls for a vote on manslaughter,\nand there is disagreement. Only then do the jurors en-\ngage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime.\nWhile considering the arguments of the other jurors on\nhow the death was caused, one of the jurors starts rethink-\ning his own stance on a greater offense. After reflecting on\nthe evidence, he comes to believe that the defendant did\nknowingly cause the death\u2014satisfying the definition of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 In reaching a contrary conclusion, post, at 6 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\n\nJ.), the dissent construes the jury instructions to \u201crequire a jury to\ncomplete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a\nlesser,\u201d post, at 3 (emphasis added). But no such requirement can be\nfound in the text of the instructions themselves. And the dissent\u2019s\nattempt to glean such a requirement from the Arkansas Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Hughes v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ark/91cW/hughes-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 S. W. 3d 645\n(2002), is unavailing, for that decision nowhere addresses the issue\nhere\u2014whether a jury can reconsider a greater offense after considering\na lesser one.\n8                  BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst-degree murder. At that point, nothing in the instruc-\ntions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do:\nrevisit a prior vote. \u201cThe very object of the jury system,\u201d\nafter all, \u201cis to secure unanimity by a comparison of views,\nand by arguments among the jurors themselves.\u201d Allen,\n164 U. S., at 501. A single juror\u2019s change of mind is all it\ntakes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense.\n   It was therefore possible for Blueford\u2019s jury to revisit the\noffenses of capital and first-degree murder, notwithstand-\ning its earlier votes. And because of that possibility, the\nforeperson\u2019s report prior to the end of deliberations lacked\nthe finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those\noffenses, quite apart from any requirement that a formal\nverdict be returned or judgment entered.\n   That same lack of finality undermines Blueford\u2019s reli-\nance on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and\nPrice v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970). In those cases, we\nheld that the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when\na defendant, tried for a greater offense and convicted of\na lesser included offense, is later retried for the greater\noffense. See Green, supra, at 190; Price, supra, at 329.\nBlueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case\nfrom Green and Price is that his case involves a deadlock\non the lesser included offense, as opposed to a conviction.\nIn his view, that distinction only favors him, because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause should, if anything, afford greater\nprotection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the\nlesser included offense.\n   Blueford\u2019s argument assumes, however, that the votes\nreported by the foreperson did not change, even though\nthe jury deliberated further after that report. That as-\nsumption is unjustified, because the reported votes were,\nfor the reasons noted, not final. Blueford thus overlooks\nthe real distinction between the cases: In Green and Price,\nthe verdict of the jury was a final decision; here, the report\nof the foreperson was not.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             B\n   Blueford maintains that even if the jury did not acquit\nhim of capital and first-degree murder, a second trial on\nthose offenses would nonetheless violate the Double Jeop-\nardy Clause, because the trial court\u2019s declaration of a\nmistrial was improper. Blueford acknowledges that a trial\ncan be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for\nthe same offense when \u201cparticular circumstances manifest\na necessity\u201d to declare a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336\nU. S. 684, 690 (1949); see also United States v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/rp7/united-states-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1824). He also acknowledges that the\ntrial court\u2019s reason for declaring a mistrial here\u2014that\nthe jury was unable to reach a verdict\u2014has long been con-\nsidered the \u201cclassic basis\u201d establishing such a necessity.\nArizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 509 (1978).\nBlueford therefore accepts that a second trial on man-\nslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double\njeopardy problem. He contends, however, that there was\nno necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree\nmurder, given the foreperson\u2019s report that the jury had\nvoted unanimously against guilt on those charges. Accord-\ning to Blueford, the court at that time should have taken\n\u201csome action,\u201d whether through partial verdict forms or\nother means, to allow the jury to give effect to those votes,\nand then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining\ncharges. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11, n. 8.\n   We reject that suggestion. We have never required a\ntrial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung\njury, to consider any particular means of breaking the\nimpasse\u2014let alone to consider giving the jury new options\nfor a verdict. See Renico v. Lett, 559 U.

But Renico\u2019s\n10                    BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njury\u2019s options in this case were limited to two: either con-\nvict on one of the offenses, or acquit on all. The instruc-\ntions explained those options in plain terms, and the\nverdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome.\nThere were separate forms to convict on each of the possi-\nble offenses, but there was only one form to acquit, and it\nwas to acquit on all of them. When the foreperson dis-\nclosed the jury\u2019s votes on capital and first-degree murder,\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to\nadd another option\u2014that of acquitting on some offenses\nbut not others. That, however, is precisely the relief\nBlueford seeks\u2014relief the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot afford him.\n                         *    *     *\n  The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any\noffense, but it did not acquit him of any either. When the\njury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court prop-\nerly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury. As a\nconsequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand\nin the way of a second trial on the same offenses.\n  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is\n\n                                                             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndiscussion of the applicable legal principles concerns just that, and the \n\ndissent in any event does not dispute that we have never required a \n\ntrial court to consider any particular means of breaking a jury impasse.\n\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

See generally People v.\nRichardson, 184 P. 3d 755, 764, n. 7 (Colo. 2008). Arkan-\nsas\u2019 model jury instructions require a jury to complete its\ndeliberations on a greater offense before it may consider\na lesser. 1 Ark. Model Jury Instr., Crim., No. 302 (2d\ned. 1994). As a matter of Arkansas law, \u201c[b]efore it may\nconsider any lesser-included offense, the jury must first\ndetermine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the\ngreater offense. Thus, the jury must, in essence, acquit\nthe defendant of the greater offense before considering his\nor her guilt on the lesser-included offense.\u201d Hughes v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ark/91cW/hughes-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706\u2013707, 66 S. W. 3d 645, 651 (2002).1\n  Here, the trial judge instructed Blueford\u2019s jury to con-\nsider the offenses in order, from the charged offense of\ncapital murder to the lesser included offenses of first-\ndegree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.\nThe judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only\nupon a unanimous finding of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to\nthat offense\u2014that is, upon an acquittal. See In re Win-\nship, 397 U. S. 358, 363 (1970). The State\u2019s closing argu-\nments repeated this directive: \u201c[B]efore you can consider a\nlesser included of capital murder, you must first, all 12,\nvote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.\u201d App.\n55. And the forewoman\u2019s colloquy with the judge leaves no\ndoubt that the jury understood the instructions to man-\ndate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a pre-\nrequisite to consideration of a lesser: The forewoman\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  State has taken the same position. See Brief for Appellee in\nBoyd v. State, No. CR 06\u2013973 (Ark.), p. 13 (\u201c[U]nanimity is the essence\nof a jury verdict as it pertains to acquitting a defendant of the charged\noffense and the subsequent consideration of lesser-included offenses\u201d).\n4                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nreported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide\nbecause the jurors \u201ccouldn\u2019t get past the manslaughter\u201d\ncount on which they were deadlocked. Id., at 65.\n  In this context, the forewoman\u2019s announcement in open\ncourt that the jury was \u201cunanimous against\u201d conviction on\ncapital and first-degree murder, id., at 64\u201365, was an\nacquittal for double jeopardy purposes.2 Per Arkansas\nlaw, the jury\u2019s determination of reasonable doubt as to\nthose offenses was an acquittal \u201cin essence.\u201d Hughes, 347\nArk., at 707, 66 S. W. 3d, at 651. By deciding that the\nState \u201chad failed to come forward with sufficient proof,\u201d\nthe jury resolved the charges of capital and first-degree\nmurder adversely to the State. Burks, 437 U. S., at 10.\nThat acquittal cannot be reconsidered without putting\nBlueford twice in jeopardy.\n  Green and Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323 (1970), bolster\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The jury\u2019s acquittals on the murder counts were unsurprising in\n\nlight of the deficiencies in the State\u2019s case. For example, Dr. Adam\nCraig\u2014the medical examiner who autopsied the victim, Matthew\nMcFadden, Jr., and whose testimony was essential to the State\u2019s theory\nof the crime\u2014was not board certified in anatomical pathology, hav-\ning failed the certification examination five times. Dr. Craig took only\n2 slides of Matthew\u2019s brain, not the 10 to 20 called for by prevail-\ning professional standards. He dismissed Blueford\u2019s explanation for\nMatthew\u2019s death\u2014that Blueford accidentally knocked Matthew to the\nfloor\u2014on the basis of an outdated paper on child head injuries, ac-\nknowledging that he was only \u201cvaguely aware\u201d of a more recent, semi-\nnal paper that supported Blueford\u2019s account. Record 390; see Gold-\nsmith & Plunkett, A Biomechanical Analysis of the Causes of\nTraumatic Brain Injury in Infants and Children, 25 Am. J. Forensic\nMed. & Pathology 89 (2004). Blueford\u2019s expert pathologist, Dr. Robert\nBux, testified that Dr. Craig\u2019s autopsy was inadequate to establish\nwhether Matthew\u2019s death was accidental or intentional. And Blue-\nford\u2019s expert pediatrician, Dr. John Galaznik, testified that the State\u2019s\ntheory\u2014that Blueford slammed Matthew into a mattress on the floor\u2014\nwas \u201cnot a likely cause\u201d of the boy\u2019s injuries when assessed in view of\ncurrent medical literature. Record 766. Even the trial judge observed\nthat the State\u2019s proof was \u201ccircumstantial at best,\u201d and that this was\n\u201cprobably . . . a lesser included offense case.\u201d Id., at 610.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat conclusion. In Green, the jury convicted the defend-\nant on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder\nwithout returning a verdict on the charged offense of first-\ndegree murder. This Court concluded that this result was\nan \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d on the greater offense of first-\ndegree murder, barring retrial. 355 U. S., at 190. The\ndefendant \u201cwas forced to run the gantlet once on that\ncharge and the jury refused to convict him. When given\nthe choice between finding him guilty of either first or\nsecond degree murder it chose the latter.\u201d Ibid.; see also\nPrice, 398 U. S., at 329 (\u201c[T]his Court has consistently\nrefused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after\nan acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied\nby a conviction on a lesser included offense when the\njury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on\nthe greater charge\u201d (footnote omitted)). Notably, Green\nacknowledged that its finding of an \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d\nwas an \u201cassumption,\u201d because the jury had made no ex-\npress statement with respect to the greater offense. 355\nU. S., at 190\u2013191.\n  Blueford\u2019s position is even stronger because his jury was\nnot silent on the murder counts, but announced that it\nwas \u201cunanimous against\u201d conviction. And the trial judge\nspecifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter\nonly after acquitting Blueford of the murder counts.\nCourts in several acquittal-first jurisdictions have held\nthat a jury\u2019s deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies\nthe assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater\noffenses.

Tate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283\u2013285, 773\nA. 2d. 308, 323\u2013324 (2001); Stone v.

That assumption is not even necessary\nhere because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.\n                            B\n  The majority holds that the forewoman\u2019s announcement\n6                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwas not an acquittal because it \u201cwas not a final resolution\nof anything.\u201d Ante, at 6. In the majority\u2019s view, the jury\nmight have revisited its decisions on the murder counts\nduring the 31 minutes of deliberations that followed the\nforewoman\u2019s announcement. We cannot know whether\nthe jury did so, the majority reasons, because the jury was\ndischarged without confirming that it remained \u201cunani-\nmous against\u201d convicting Blueford of capital and first-\ndegree murder. Ante, at 6\u20138.3\n   Putting to one side the lack of record evidence to support\nthis speculation\u2014by far the more plausible inference is\nthat the jurors spent those 31 minutes attempting to\nresolve their deadlock on manslaughter\u2014I do not agree\nthat the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when\nits deliberations resumed. \u201cA verdict of acquittal on the\nissue of guilt or innocence is, of course, absolutely final.\u201d\nBullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430, 445 (1981). The\njury heard instructions and argument that it was required\nunanimously to acquit on capital and first-degree murder\nbefore it could reach manslaughter. And as the forewom-\nan\u2019s colloquy makes plain, the jury followed those instruc-\ntions scrupulously. There is no reason to believe that the\njury\u2019s vote was anything other than a verdict in sub-\nstance\u2014that is, a \u201cfinal collective decision . . . reached\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This Court granted certiorari to decide \u201c[w]hether, if a jury dead-\n\nlocks on a lesser-included offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nreprosecution of a greater offense after a jury announces that it has\nvoted against guilt on the greater offense.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. The major-\nity resolves the question presented by determining that the forewoman\u2019s\nannouncements were not final, such that Blueford\u2019s jury did not neces-\nsarily deadlock on the lesser included offense of manslaughter. See\nante, at 8\u20139, n. 2. In light of that determination, I do not read today\u2019s\nopinion to express any view with respect to the requirements of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause where a jury does deadlock on a lesser in-\ncluded offense.

In the majority\u2019s example, the jury has\nnot announced its vote in open court. Moreover, the\ninstructions in this case did not contemplate that the\njury\u2019s deliberations could take the course that the majority\nimagines. Arkansas\u2019 model instruction requires acquittal\nas a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense, and\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause entitles an acquittal to final-\nity. Indeed, the purpose of an acquittal-first instruction is\nto ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater\noffense. See United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340, 346\n(CA2 1978) (Friendly, J.) (acquittal-first instruction avoids\n\u201cthe danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its\nduties with respect to the greater offense, and instead will\nmove too quickly to the lesser\u201d). True, Arkansas\u2019 instruc-\n8                 BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion does not expressly forbid reconsideration, but it does\nnot expressly permit reconsideration either. In any event,\nnothing indicates that the jury\u2019s announced decisions were\ntentative, compromises, or mere steps en route to a final\nverdict, and the Double Jeopardy Clause demands that\nambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant. See\nDownum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 738 (1963).\n   The fact that the jury was not given the express option\nof acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant. See ante,\nat 3, 9. Arkansas law ascribes no significance to the pres-\nence of such options on a verdict form. See Rowland v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ark/9kXE/rowland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85, 562 S. W. 2d 590, 594 (1978) (\u201cThe\njury may prepare and present its own form of verdict\u201d).\nThe lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a\njudgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of\nan acquittal for constitutional purposes. See Hudson v.\nLouisiana, 450 U. S. 40, 41, n. 1 (1981).\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s distinction of Green and Price is\nunavailing. The majority observes that Green and Price,\nunlike this case, involved final decisions. Ante, at 8. As I\nhave explained, I view the forewoman\u2019s announcements of\nacquittal in this case as similarly final. In any event,\nGreen clarified that the defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim of former jeop-\nardy\u201d was \u201cnot based on his previous conviction for second\ndegree murder but instead on the original jury\u2019s refusal to\nconvict him of first degree murder.\u201d 355 U. S., at 190,\nn. 11; accord, id., at 194, n. 14. That is, the jury\u2019s silence\non the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to\njustify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 191; see also Price, 398 U. S.,\nat 329. In light of the forewoman\u2019s announcement, this is\nan a fortiori case.\n   In short, the Double Jeopardy Clause demands an in-\nquiry into the substance of the jury\u2019s actions. Blueford\u2019s\njury had the option to convict him of capital and first-\ndegree murder, but expressly declined to do so. That\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

It \u201chas been long estab-\nlished as an integral part of double jeopardy jurispru-\ndence\u201d that \u201ca defendant could be put in jeopardy even in\na prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an\nacquittal.\u201d Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 34 (1978). This\nrule evolved in response to the \u201cabhorrent\u201d practice under\nthe Stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions, and\nthereby evading the bar on retrials, when it appeared that\nthe Crown\u2019s proof might be insufficient. Washington, 434\nU. S., at 507; see, e.g., Ireland\u2019s Case, 7 How. St. Tr. 79,\n120 (1678). Accordingly, retrial is barred if a jury is dis-\ncharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant\nconsents or there is a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the dis-\ncharge. Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580; see also King v. Perkins,\n90 Eng. Rep. 1122 (K. B. 1698).\n   In Perez, this Court explained that \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d\nis a high bar: \u201c[T]he power ought to be used with the\ngreatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very\nplain and obvious causes.\u201d 9 Wheat., at 580. Since Perez,\nthis Court has not relaxed the showing required. See, e.g.,\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 506 (requiring a \u201c \u2018high degree\u2019 \u201d\nof necessity); Downum, 372 U.

Before de-\nclaring a mistrial, therefore, a trial judge must weigh\nheavily a \u201cdefendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial com-\npleted by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v. Hunter, 336\nU. S. 684, 689 (1949). And in light of the historical abuses\n10                BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nagainst which the Double Jeopardy Clause guards, a trial\njudge must tread with special care where a mistrial would\n\u201chelp the prosecution, at a trial in which its case is going\nbadly, by affording it another, more favorable opportunity\nto convict the accused.\u201d Gori v. United States, 367 U. S.\n364, 369 (1961); see Green, 355 U. S., at 188.\n   A jury\u2019s genuine inability to reach a verdict constitutes\nmanifest necessity. But in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, a\njury that advances to the consideration of a lesser included\noffense has not demonstrated an inability to decide a de-\nfendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on a greater\u2014it has acquit-\nted on the greater. Under Green, that is unquestionably\ntrue if the jury convicts on the lesser. See id., at 189. It\nwould be anomalous if the Double Jeopardy Clause offered\nless protection to a defendant whose jury has deadlocked\non the lesser and thus convicted of nothing at all. See\nStone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 511\u2013512, n. 5, 646 P. 2d, at 815, n. 5.\n   I would therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nrequires a trial judge, in an acquittal-first jurisdiction, to\nhonor a defendant\u2019s request for a partial verdict before\ndeclaring a mistrial on the ground of jury deadlock.\nCourts in acquittal-first jurisdictions have so held. See,\ne.g., Tate, 256 Conn., at 285\u2013287, 773 A. 2d, at 324\u2013325;\nWhiteaker v. State, 808 P. 2d 270, 274 (Alaska App. 1991);\nStone, 31 Cal. 3d, at 519, 646 P. 2d, at 820; State v.\nPugliese, 120 N. H. 728, 730, 422 A. 2d 1319, 1321 (1980)\n(per curiam); State v.

Requiring a partial verdict in\nan acquittal-first jurisdiction ensures that the jurisdiction\ntakes the bitter with the sweet. In general, an acquittal-\nfirst instruction increases the likelihood of conviction on a\ngreater offense. See People v. Boettcher, 69 N. Y. 2d 174,\n182, 505 N. E. 2d 594, 597 (1987). True, such an instruc-\ntion may also result in deadlock on a greater, preventing a\nState \u201cfrom obtaining a conviction on the lesser charge\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat would otherwise have been forthcoming and thus\nrequire the expense of a retrial.\u201d Tsanas, 572 F. 2d, at\n346. But a State willing to incur that expense loses noth-\ning by overcharging in an acquittal-first regime. At worst,\nthe State enjoys a second opportunity to convict, \u201cwith the\npossibility that the earlier \u2018trial run\u2019 will strengthen the\nprosecution\u2019s case.\u201d Crist, 437 U. S., at 52 (Powell, J.,\ndissenting). If a State wants the benefits of requiring a\njury to acquit before compromising, it should not be per-\nmitted to deprive a defendant of the corresponding bene-\nfits of having been acquitted. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nexpressly prohibits that outcome.\n   The majority observes that we \u201chave never required a\ntrial court, before declaring a mistrial because of a hung\njury, to consider any particular means of breaking the\nimpasse\u2014let alone to consider giving the jury new options\nfor a verdict.\u201d Ante, at 10 (citing Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)). That hands-off approach\ndilutes Perez beyond recognition. This Court has never\nexcused a trial judge from exercising \u201cscrupulous\u201d care\nbefore discharging a jury. Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plural-\nity opinion). Rather, we have insisted that a trial judge\nmay not act \u201cirrationally,\u201d \u201cirresponsibly,\u201d or \u201cprecipi-\ntately.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at 514\u2013515. Nor have we\nretreated from the rule that \u201creviewing courts have an\nobligation to ensure themselves that . . . the trial judge\nexercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d Id., at\n514 (quoting Perez, 9 Wheat., at 580).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority\u2019s reliance on Renico, a habeas corpus case decided\nunder the deferential standard of review prescribed by the Antiterror-\nism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), is perplexing.\nAs Renico made clear, the question there was \u201cnot whether the trial\njudge should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it was an\nabuse of discretion for her to have done so\u2014the applicable standard on\ndirect review. The question under AEDPA is instead whether the\ndetermination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse\n12                     BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   Even if the Double Jeopardy Clause did not compel that\nbroader rule, the facts of this case confirm that there was\nno necessity, let alone manifest necessity, for a mistrial.\nThere was no reason for the judge not to have asked the\njury, prior to discharge, whether it remained \u201cunanimous\nagainst\u201d conviction on capital and first-degree murder.\nThere would have been no intrusion on the jury\u2019s delibera-\ntive process. The judge was not required to issue new\ninstructions or verdict forms, allow new arguments, direct\nfurther deliberations, or take any other action that might\nhave threatened to coerce the jury. Merely repeating his\nearlier question would have sufficed. Because the judge\nfailed to take even this modest step\u2014or indeed, to explore\nany alternatives to a mistrial, or even to make an on-the-\nrecord finding of manifest necessity\u2014I conclude that there\nwas an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., id., at 486; see also\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 525 (Marshall, J., dissenting)\n(manifest necessity requires showing \u201cthat there were no\nmeaningful and practical alternatives to a mistrial, or\nthat the trial court scrupulously considered available alter-\nnatives and found all wanting but a termination of the\nproceedings\u201d).\n   Indeed, the only reason I can divine for the judge\u2019s\nfailure to take this modest step is his misperception of\nArkansas law with respect to the transitional instruction.\nAfter the colloquy with the forewoman, the judge com-\nmented at sidebar that the jurors \u201chaven\u2019t even taken a\nvote on [negligent homicide]. . . . I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve\ncompleted their deliberation. . . . I mean, under any rea-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof discretion was \u2018an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law.\u2019 \u201d 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1)); accord, 559 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 11, n. 3). Renico\nthus has little to say about a trial judge\u2019s responsibilities, or this\nCourt\u2019s, on direct review. Cf. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 30\u201331).\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsonable circumstances, they would at least take a vote\non negligent homicide.\u201d App. 65\u201366. And after the jury\nretired for the last half-hour of deliberations, the judge\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t think they have an understanding of really\nthat they don\u2019t have to get past every charge unanimously\nbefore they can move to the next charge.\u201d Id., at 69. That\nmisstated Arkansas law as well as the judge\u2019s own in-\nstructions. The jury was required to reach a unanimous\ndecision on a greater offense before considering a lesser.\nSee supra, at 2\u20133. In discharging the jury, the judge said,\n\u201cMadam Foreman, there seems to be a lot of confusion on\nthe part . . . of the jury about some of the instructions.\nAnd because of the confusion and because of the timeliness\nand the amount of hours that has gone by without being\nable to reach a verdict, the Court is going to declare a\nmistrial.\u201d App. 69\u201370.\n   If, as these comments suggest, the judge wrongly be-\nlieved that the jury was not required to reach unanimity\non a greater offense before considering a lesser, then he\naccorded insufficient finality and weight to the forewom-\nan\u2019s earlier announcement of acquittal on capital and first-\ndegree murder. That mistake of law negates the deference\ndue the judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial. The judge\nexplained that the jury was being discharged in part based\non its \u201cconfusion\u201d with respect to the instructions, when in\nfact, the confusion was the judge\u2019s. Ibid.; see, e.g., Wash-\nington, 434 U. S., at 510, n. 28 (\u201cIf the record reveals that\nthe trial judge has failed to exercise the \u2018sound discretion\u2019\nentrusted to him, the reason for . . . deference by an appel-\nlate court disappears\u201d); Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S.\n458, 469 (1973) (critiquing \u201cerratic\u201d mistrial inquiry); Gori,\n367 U. S., at 371, n. 3 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (noting that\n\u201c[i]n state cases, a second prosecution has been barred\nwhere the jury was discharged through the trial judge\u2019s\nmisconstruction of the law,\u201d and collecting cases). And a\ntrial court \u201cby definition abuses its discretion when it\n14                BLUEFORD v. ARKANSAS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nmakes an error of law.\u201d Koon v.

S.\n81, 100 (1996).\n                           * *    *\n    At its core, the Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the\nwisdom of the founding generation, familiar to \u201c \u2018every\nperson acquainted with the history of governments,\u2019 \u201d that\n\u201c \u2018state trials have been employed as a formidable engine\nin the hands of a dominant administration. . . .
