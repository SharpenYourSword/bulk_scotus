LORENZO JOHNSON\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 11\u20131053. Decided May 29, 2012\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an ac-\ncomplice and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Wil-\nliams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in\nthe early morning hours of December 15, 1995, in Har-\nrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his conviction was affirmed\nin state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and\nsought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court\npursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penal-\nty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District\nCourt denied habeas relief but the U. S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence\nat trial was insufficient to support Johnson\u2019s conviction\nunder the standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU. S. 307 (1979).\n   We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar\nin federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to\ntwo layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, \u201cit\nis the responsibility of the jury\u2014not the court\u2014to decide\nwhat conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted\nat trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury\u2019s verdict\non the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational\ntrier of fact could have agreed with the jury.\u201d Cavazos v.\nSmith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).\nAnd second, on habeas review, \u201ca federal court may not\noverturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of\nthe evidence challenge simply because the federal court\n2                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndisagrees with the state court. The federal court instead\nmay do so only if the state court decision was \u2018objectively\nunreasonable.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5)).\n  Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect\nto the role of the jury and the state courts of Pennsylvania,\nwe now grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.\n                         *    *     *\n   The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed\nby Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of first-\ndegree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of\nthe crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was\ncharged as an accomplice and co-conspirator. See 18 Pa.\nCons. Stat. \u00a72502 (2008) (defining first-degree murder\nas \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated\u201d killing); \u00a7306(c)\n(imposing accomplice liability for anyone who, \u201cwith the\nintent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the\noffense . . . aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other\nperson in planning or committing it\u201d); Commonwealth v.\nMontalvo, 598 Pa. 263, 274, 956 A. 2d 926, 932 (2008)\n(criminal conspiracy liability for anyone who takes an\novert act in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or\ncommit).\n   At trial, the Commonwealth called Victoria Doubs, who\ntestified that she, Johnson, and Walker were \u201cclose\nfriends\u201d who \u201cran the streets together.\u201d Tr. 213. On the\nmorning of December 14, the three of them awoke at the\nsame residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a\nKentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encoun-\ntered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to\n\u201choller at\u201d Williams about a debt Williams owed. Id., at\n217. According to Doubs, Walker and Williams \u201cwere\ntalking about the money that [Williams] had owed us,\u201d\nwith Walker \u201casking [Williams], confronting him, about\nhis money and what\u2019s up with the money and why is it\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ntaking you so long to give us the money.\u201d Id., at 217\u2013218.\nWilliams was \u201ccussing [Walker] out, telling him he\u2019d\ngive it to him when he felt like it and he ain\u2019t scared of\n[Walker].\u201d Id., at 218. A fight ensued, which ended\nwhen Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front\nof the crowd of people that had gathered.\n   After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker \u201cwas mad, be-\ncause he got beat by a crackhead. . . . He was saying, yo,\nthat crackhead beat me. I\u2019m going to kill that crackhead.\nI\u2019m going to kill that kid. . . . He was hot. He was heated.\u201d\nId., at 220\u2013221. Johnson was present when Walker made\nthese statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted\nthe beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Walker\n\u201crepeated it for a while that I\u2019m going to kill that kid.\nThat kid must think I\u2019m some type of joke. I\u2019m going to\nkill that kid. Who he think he is[?]\u201d Id., at 222. Once\nagain, Johnson was present for these statements.\n   Another witness was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim,\nwho testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar\non the night of December 14\u201315, where she saw Walker,\nJohnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument.\nAlthough she could not hear what they were saying, she\ncould tell they were arguing because they were making \u201ca\nlot of arm movements.\u201d Id., at 104. The bouncer soon told\nthem to leave, and Brown followed them into the street\nbecause she \u201cwanted to know what was going on.\u201d Ibid.\nBrown observed the three men walking in a single-file\nline, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and\nJohnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather\ncoat, walking as if he had something concealed under-\nneath it. Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at\nwhich point Williams recognized Brown and told her to \u201cgo\nahead\u201d and pass. Id., at 107. Walker then entered the\nalleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained\nstanding at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley,\nshe heard a loud \u201cboom,\u201d causing her to run away. Id., at\n4                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n143. On cross-examination, Brown stated: \u201cThey walked\n[Williams] in that alley. He stood inside the alley. He\nwalked him in the alley. I heard a boom.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testi-\nfied that he was in a building bordering the alleyway at\n12:45 a.m. on the morning of December 15. He heard a\nloud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from\nhis second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes\nfleeing.\n   After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey,\nwho had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at\nthe time of the murder. He testified that he saw Williams\nwalking toward an alleyway with two males and a female,\nand he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered\nthe alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated:\n\u201cI would say that [Williams] was forced in that alley.\u201d Id.,\nat 189.\n   The jury also heard testimony from police who searched\nthe alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun\nwith the barrel missing. A medical examiner who exam-\nined Williams\u2019 body testified that the cause of death was a\nshotgun wound to the chest.\n   After the jury convicted Johnson, he filed a post-trial\nmotion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sup-\nport his conviction. The court denied his motion, and\nthe Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the conviction\non direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 726\nA. 2d 1079 (1998). After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ndenied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully\nsought state postconviction relief. He then filed a habeas\npetition in Federal District Court, which denied his\nclaims. See Johnson v. Mechling, 541 F. Supp. 2d 651\n(MD Pa. 2008). Finally, Johnson appealed to the Third\nCircuit, which reversed the District Court and ordered his\nconviction overturned.\n   Under Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a con-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nviction if, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime be-\nyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U. S., at 319.\n   In light of the testimony at Johnson\u2019s trial, the Court of\nAppeals acknowledged that \u201c[a] trier of fact could reason-\nably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common\nintent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.\u201d Johnson\nv. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for\nthe notion that \u201cJohnson shared Walker\u2019s intent to kill\nWilliams,\u201d however, the court concluded that was \u201cmere\nspeculation\u201d that no rational factfinder could accept as\ntrue. Ibid. The court stated that \u201ca reasonable inference\nis one where the fact inferred is \u2018more likely than not to\nflow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 539\u2013540 (quoting Commonwealth v. McFarland,\n452 Pa. 435, 439, 308 A. 2d 592, 594 (1973)). In order for a\njury\u2019s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned,\nthey must \u201c \u2018flow from facts and circumstances proven in\nthe record\u2019 \u201d that are \u201c \u2018of such volume and quality as to\novercome the presumption of innocence.\u2019 \u201d 446 Fed. Appx.,\nat 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A. 2d 543,\n560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).\n   At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of\nAppeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what\ndistinguishes a reasoned inference from \u201cmere specula-\ntion.\u201d Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state\nlaw for \u201cthe substantive elements of the criminal offense,\u201d\n443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evi-\ndence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the\noffense is purely a matter of federal law.\n   Under the deferential federal standard, the approach\ntaken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un-\nduly impinged on the jury\u2019s role as factfinder. Jackson\nleaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences\nto draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring\n6                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nonly that jurors \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic\nfacts to ultimate facts.\u201d Id., at 319. This deferential\nstandard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual\nparsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For ex-\nample, in addressing Brown and Ramsey\u2019s testimony that\nWilliams was \u201cwalked\u201d and \u201cforced\u201d into the alleyway, the\ncourt objected that the witnesses did not describe any\n\u201cphysical action\u201d supporting the conclusion that force was\nused. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testi-\nmony that \u201cJohnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or\notherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented\nhim from leaving it,\u201d ibid., the court could see no reason-\nable basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion that Johnson had a\nspecific intent to help kill Williams.\n   That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coer-\ncive nature of Johnson and Walker\u2019s behavior could be\ninferred from other circumstances not involving the direct\nuse of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon,\nand he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams\nafter a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson\nand Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file\nline on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the\nentrance while the other two entered, suggesting that\nJohnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams\nfrom fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not co-\nerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded\nthat Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the\nmurder.\n   Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the\ntrial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker \u201cran\nthe streets together,\u201d and had attempted to collect a debt\nfrom Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams\nresisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in\nthe process by giving him a public thrashing with a\nbroomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he\nrepeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npresence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while\nWalker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his\ntrenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley,\nwhere Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled\nout a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.\n   On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer\nthat Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shot-\ngun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped\nusher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The\njury in this case was convinced, and the only question\nunder Jackson is whether that finding was so insupporta-\nble as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The\nstate court of last review did not think so, and that deter-\nmination in turn is entitled to considerable deference\nunder AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d).\n   Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the\nstate courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson\u2019s\ntrial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due pro-\ncess challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient\nto convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator\nin the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth\u2019s\npetition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma\npauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

S., at 319.\n   In light of the testimony at Johnson\u2019s trial, the Court of\nAppeals acknowledged that \u201c[a] trier of fact could reason-\nably infer . . . that Johnson and Walker shared a common\nintent to confront, threaten or harass Williams.\u201d Johnson\nv. Mechling, 446 Fed. Appx. 531, 540 (CA3 2011). As for\nthe notion that \u201cJohnson shared Walker\u2019s intent to kill\nWilliams,\u201d however, the court concluded that was \u201cmere\nspeculation\u201d that no rational factfinder could accept as\ntrue. Ibid. The court stated that \u201ca reasonable inference\nis one where the fact inferred is \u2018more likely than not to\nflow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 539\u2013540 (quoting Commonwealth v.

In order for a\njury\u2019s inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned,\nthey must \u201c \u2018flow from facts and circumstances proven in\nthe record\u2019 \u201d that are \u201c \u2018of such volume and quality as to\novercome the presumption of innocence.\u2019 \u201d 446 Fed. Appx.,\nat 539 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bostick, 958 A. 2d 543,\n560 (Pa. Super. 2008)).\n   At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of\nAppeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what\ndistinguishes a reasoned inference from \u201cmere specula-\ntion.\u201d Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state\nlaw for \u201cthe substantive elements of the criminal offense,\u201d\n443 U. S., at 324, n. 16, but the minimum amount of evi-\ndence that the Due Process Clause requires to prove the\noffense is purely a matter of federal law.\n   Under the deferential federal standard, the approach\ntaken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it un-\nduly impinged on the jury\u2019s role as factfinder. Jackson\nleaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences\nto draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring\n6                  COLEMAN v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nonly that jurors \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic\nfacts to ultimate facts.\u201d Id., at 319. This deferential\nstandard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual\nparsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For ex-\nample, in addressing Brown and Ramsey\u2019s testimony that\nWilliams was \u201cwalked\u201d and \u201cforced\u201d into the alleyway, the\ncourt objected that the witnesses did not describe any\n\u201cphysical action\u201d supporting the conclusion that force was\nused. 446 Fed. Appx., at 541. Absent some specific testi-\nmony that \u201cJohnson actively pushed, shoved, ordered or\notherwise forced the victim into the alley, or prevented\nhim from leaving it,\u201d ibid., the court could see no reason-\nable basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion that Johnson had a\nspecific intent to help kill Williams.\n   That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coer-\ncive nature of Johnson and Walker\u2019s behavior could be\ninferred from other circumstances not involving the direct\nuse of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon,\nand he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams\nafter a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson\nand Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file\nline on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the\nentrance while the other two entered, suggesting that\nJohnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams\nfrom fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not co-\nerced into the alley, the jury still could have concluded\nthat Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the\nmurder.\n   Taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the\ntrial testimony revealed that Johnson and Walker \u201cran\nthe streets together,\u201d and had attempted to collect a debt\nfrom Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams\nresisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in\nthe process by giving him a public thrashing with a\nbroomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he\nrepeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npresence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while\nWalker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his\ntrenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley,\nwhere Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled\nout a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest.\n   On the basis of these facts, a rational jury could infer\nthat Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shot-\ngun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped\nusher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The\njury in this case was convinced, and the only question\nunder Jackson is whether that finding was so insupporta-\nble as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The\nstate court of last review did not think so, and that deter-\nmination in turn is entitled to considerable deference\nunder AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d).\n   Affording due respect to the role of the jury and the\nstate courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson\u2019s\ntrial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due pro-\ncess challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient\nto convict Johnson as an accomplice and a co-conspirator\nin the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth\u2019s\npetition for certiorari and the motion to proceed in forma\npauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Ap-\npeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
