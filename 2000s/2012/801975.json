DAVID EUGENE\n\n                  MATTHEWS\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 11–845.    Decided June 11, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  In this habeas case, the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Sixth Circuit set aside two 29-year-old mur-\nder convictions based on the flimsiest of rationales. The\ncourt’s decision is a textbook example of what the Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)\nproscribes: “using federal habeas corpus review as a vehi-\ncle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state\ncourts.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 12). We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and\nreverse.\n                             I\n  Between 1 and 2 a.m. on the morning of June 29, 1981,\nrespondent David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louis-\nville home he had until recently shared with his estranged\nwife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene). At the time,\nMatthews’ mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying\nat the home with her daughter. Matthews found Cruse in\nbed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a\ngun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before.\nMatthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went\ninto the next room, where he found his wife. He had\nsexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her\nuntil about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her.\nCruse would die from her wound later that day.\n  Matthews was apprehended that morning at his moth-\ner’s house, where he had already begun to wash the\n2                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nclothes he wore during the crime. Later in the day, police\nofficers found the murder weapon secreted below the\nfloorboards of a backyard shed on the property. At the\npolice station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement\nto a police detective in which he denied responsibility for\nthe murders.\n   A grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders\nand for burglary. At trial, he did not contest that he killed\nthe two victims. Instead, he sought to show that he had\nacted under “extreme emotional disturbance,” which under\nKentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would\notherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter. Ky.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §§507.020(1)(a), 507.030(1)(b) (West 2006).\nAs support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the trou-\nbled history of his marriage with Marlene. Matthews and\nhis wife had been frequently separated from one another,\nand their periods of separation were marked by extreme\nhostility. Marlene would regularly procure criminal war-\nrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders\nshe obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of\nMarlene’s 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Mat-\nthews’ spending roughly three weeks in jail. Witnesses\nalso testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews\nwhen they were together and would yell at him from\nacross the street when they were separated; and Mat-\nthews’ mother recounted that Marlene would leave the\ncouple’s young child crying in the street late at night\noutside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order\nto antagonize him.\n   Matthews also introduced the testimony of a psychia-\ntrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews. Dr.\nChutkow related what Matthews had told him about the\nmurders, including that Matthews had been drinking heav-\nily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug. Dr. Chut-\nkow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suf-\nfering from an adjustment disorder, which he described\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nas a “temporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in\nindividuals who are subject to a variety of stresses,” that\nwould temporarily impair a person’s judgment and cause\nsymptoms such as “anxiety, nervousness, depression, even\nsuicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.” 6\nRecord 558. Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that\nMatthews was acting under the influence of extreme\nemotional disturbance at the time of the murders—in\nparticular, that he experienced “extreme tension, irritabil-\nity, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife,” id., at 567,\nwhom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated\nhim.\n   The jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews’\n37 claims of error. Matthews v. Commonwealth, 709 S. W.\n2d 414, 417 (1985). In response to Matthews’ argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had\nacted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the\ncourt concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews’\n“conduct before, during and after the offense was more\nthan sufficient to support the jury’s findings of capital\nmurder.” Id., at 421. A claim that the prosecutor had\ncommitted misconduct during his closing argument was\nrejected on the merits, but without discussion.\n   Following an unsuccessful state postconviction proceed-\ning, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Kentucky. Matthews\ncontended, among other things, that the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court had contravened clearly established federal\nlaw in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insuffi-\ncient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of\nextreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim\nof prosecutorial misconduct. The District Court dismissed\nthe petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit re-\n4                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nversed with instructions to grant relief.    651 F. 3d 489\n(2011).\n                               II\n  Under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to\nissue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State\ncourt proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). The Sixth Circuit\ngave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was\nentitled to relief under this “difficult to meet . . . and\nhighly deferential standard,” Cullen v. Pinholster, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither is valid.\n                              A\n  First, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden\nof proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the\nCommonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme\nemotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. The\nSixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews com-\nmitted his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on\nextreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth,\n607 S. W. 2d 97, 108 (1980), which placed the burden of\nproducing evidence on the defendant, but left the bur-\nden of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturb-\nance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the\ndefendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt on the issue. According to the Sixth\nCircuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed\nfrom that understanding in Matthews’ case and placed the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nburden of proving extreme emotional disturbance “entirely\non the defendant,” 651 F. 3d, at 500.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s interpretation is supported by cer-\ntain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion in\nMatthews’ case. For example, the state court indicated\nthat Matthews had “present[ed] extensive evidence” of his\nextreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence\nhe had presented “far from overwhelming,” rather than by\nstating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Mat-\nthews, 709 S. W. 2d, at 420–421. The state court also\nobserved that it had recently clarified in Wellman v. Com-\nmonwealth, 694 S. W. 2d 696 (1985), that “absence of\nextreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the\ncrime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirma-\ntively prove.” Matthews, supra, at 421. In the Sixth Cir-\ncuit’s view, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s reliance on this\nWellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in\nresolving Matthews’ appeal violated the Due Process\nClause, as construed by this Court in Bouie v. City of\nColumbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354 (1964), because it involved\nthe retroactive application of an “ ‘unexpected and indefen-\nsible’ ” judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s initial assessment of\nthe evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant\nif they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews’\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. It is not clear, however,\nthat they did. The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that\n“[t]he trial court’s instructions in regard to extreme emo-\ntional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported\nthe jury’s findings of intentional murder.” 709 S. W. 2d,\nat 421. Those jury instructions required the jury to find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted\n“under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for\nwhich there was a reasonable justification or excuse under\nthe circumstances as he believed them to be.” 6 Record\n6                      PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n625, 628–629. The case had been submitted to the jury\nwith the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury\nhad found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that\nfinding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews’\nclaim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a\nground of questionable validity. See Wetzel v. Lambert,\n565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at\n4–5).1\n   The Sixth Circuit’s opinion also challenges the conclu-\nsion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme\nemotional disturbance. We have said that “it is the\nresponsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what\n\n——————\n  1 An ambiguously worded footnote in the Sixth Circuit’s opinion, see\n\n651 F. 3d 489, 504, n. 5 (2011), suggests that the court may have found\nan additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement\nin the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth\n607 S. W. 2d 97, 109 (1980), that “[u]nless the evidence raising the\nissue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that\notherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an\nacquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required\nto come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of\nproof.” Relying on its own opinion in Gall’s federal habeas proceeding,\nGall v. Parker, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000) (Gall II), the Sixth Circuit\nsuggested that the quoted statement “require[d] a defendant to bear the\nheavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt,” 651 F. 3d, at 504, n. 5, in violation of this Court’s decision in\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975). That is not so. The state-\nment explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the\nprosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is\nassigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution’s burden of\nproof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the\ndefendant’s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as\na matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See 2 J. Strong, McCor-\nmick on Evidence §338, pp. 419–420 (5th ed. 1999). Our opinion in\nMullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was\nshifted to the defendant, see 421 U. S., at 702, and n. 31; it does not\nremotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s truism contravened\nclearly established federal law.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nconclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at\ntrial,” Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 1). The evidence is sufficient to support a\nconviction whenever, “after viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia,\n443 U. S. 307, 319 (1979). And a state-court decision\nrejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on\nfederal habeas unless the “decision was ‘objectively unrea-\nsonable.’ ” Cavazos, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n   In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abun-\ndantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection\nof Matthews’ sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal\nhabeas proceeding. The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr.\nChutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under\nthe influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time\nof the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on\ncross-examination. But there was ample evidence point-\ning in the other direction as well. As the Kentucky\nSupreme Court observed, Matthews’ claim of extreme emo-\ntional disturbance was belied by “the circumstances of the\ncrime,” 709 S. W. 2d, at 421—including the facts that he\nborrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day\nof the murders, that he waited several hours after buying\nthe gun before starting for his wife’s home, and that he\ndelayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law\nand killing his wife. The claim was also belied by his\nbehavior after the murders, including his “[taking] steps to\nhide the gun and clean his clothes,” and later “giv[ing]\na false statement to the police.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit\ndiscounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified\nthat Matthews’ deliberateness and consciousness of\nwrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of\nextreme emotional disturbance. 651 F. 3d., at 504, n. 4.\nBut expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive pre-\n8                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable\nto conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the\ntension between Dr. Chutkow’s testimony and their own\ncommon-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.\nIn resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow’s testi-\nmony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its\nauthority. See Jackson, supra, at 326.\n   More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to\nconsider the possibility that the jury could have found the\nsymptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to estab-\nlish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter\nunder Kentucky law: that Matthews “acted under the\ninfluence of extreme emotional disturbance for which\nthere was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reason-\nableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint\nof a person in the defendant’s situation under the circum-\nstances as the defendant believed them to be.” Ky. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §507.020(1)(a). Dr. Chutkow himself agreed\nthat many people face tension and anxiety—two symptoms\nhe attributed to Matthews. 6 Record 579–580. And he\nagreed that many people suffer from adjustment disor-\nders. Id., at 592. But of course very few people commit\nmurders. In light of these points, which bear on the\nproper characterization of Matthews’ mental condition and\nthe reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt made no objectively unreasonable error in conclud-\ning that the question of extreme emotional disturbance\nwas properly committed to the jury for resolution.\n                            B\n  As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit\nheld that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during\nhis closing argument constituted a denial of due process.\nThis claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky\nSupreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore\nreceives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                       9\n\n                                Per Curiam\n\nSee Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 8). The “clearly established Federal law” relevant\nhere is our decision in Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\n168 (1986), which explained that a prosecutor’s improper\ncomments will be held to violate the Constitution only if\nthey “ ‘so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the\nresulting conviction a denial of due process.’ ” Id., at 181\n(quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 643\n(1974)).\n  According to the Sixth Circuit, the prosecutor violated\nDarden by suggesting that Matthews had colluded with\nhis lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manu-\nfacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense. But\nalthough the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the\nprosecutor’s closing argument which could be understood\nas raising a charge of collusion,2 the court did not address\n——————\n  2 The  full text of the section the Sixth Circuit found objectionable is as\nfollows:\n“He’s arraigned, he meets with his attorney and either he tells his at-\ntorney, I did it or I didn’t do it. One or the other. But, the attorney\nknows what the evidence is. By the way, the defendant knows what the\nevidence is, because while he’s giving this statement, it’s sitting right in\nfront of him at the Homicide Office. Here’s the gun. Here’s the shoes,\nDavid. ‘Nah, nah, I never saw it before. I never borrowed a gun. I\nnever borrowed any money. I wasn’t there. I was at home in bed\nasleep.’ He’s denying it there.\n   “And what does his attorney think? His attorney sees all this evi-\ndence, and he’s going through his mind, what kind of legal excuse can\nI have? What is this man’s defense? Self protection? No, there’s no\nproof of a gun found at that house on 310 North 24th Street. No proof\nof that. Protection of another? The defendant’s mother is at home on\nLytle Street. He isn’t protecting her over there on North 24th Street.\nIntoxication? Yeah, well, he was drinking that night. Maybe that will\nmean something.\n   “But that isn’t enough, Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. Busse has to\ncontact a psychiatrist to see his client, and he comes in and sees his\nclient one month after the day of his arrest, one month to the day, and\nby that time, Mr. David Eugene Matthews sees his defense in the form\nof Doctor Chutkow, and do you think this guy is aware of what’s going\n10                      PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nthe prosecutor’s statement that immediately followed the\nquoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of\ncollusion:\n     “And that’s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.\n     Not at all. He is entitled to the best defense he can\n     get, but that’s the only defense he has, what the doc-\n     tor has to say, and that’s not to say that the doctor\n     gets on the stand and perjures himself. He’s telling\n     you the truth. He wouldn’t perjure himself for any-\n     thing. He’s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentle-\n     men.” 7 Record 674.\nWith the prosecutor’s immediate clarification that he was\nnot alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that this feature of the closing argument clearly\nviolated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the pros-\necutor’s suggestion that Matthews had “enhance[d] his\nstory to Doctor Chutkow,” ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth\nCircuit’s grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement\nis clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews\nhad a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in\nhis meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted\nstatement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhe-\ntorical questions:\n     “Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about\n     his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things\n——————\non? He’s competent. He can work with his attorney, and he enhances\nhis story to Doctor Chutkow. Yeah, I was drinking. I was drinking a\nlot. I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I\nwas taking.\n   “Don’t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the\npsychiatrist? Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his\nwife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other\npeople might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would over-\nstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist? It’s the defense\nof last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct,\nbut that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 673–674.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n    about what other people might be doing to his mother?\n    Don’t you think he would overstate the extent of his\n    intoxication to his psychiatrist?” Ibid.\nThe Sixth Circuit cited no precedent of this Court in sup-\nport of its conclusion that due process prohibits a prosecu-\ntor from emphasizing a criminal defendant’s motive to\nexaggerate exculpatory facts.\n   The Sixth Circuit also suggested that the prosecutor\n“denigrated the [extreme emotional disturbance] defense\nitself,” 651 F. 3d, at 506, by stating that “[i]t’s the defense\nof last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for\nhis conduct, but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 674.\nBut the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood\nthis comment too as having been directed at Matthews’\nmotive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance—i.e., as\nemphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense\nraised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional\ndisturbance.\n   Moreover, even if the comment is understood as direct-\ning the jury’s attention to inappropriate considerations,\nthat would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of the Darden prosecutorial misconduct\nclaim “was so lacking in justification that there was an\nerror well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”\nHarrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Indeed,\nDarden itself held that a closing argument considerably\nmore inflammatory than the one at issue here did not\nwarrant habeas relief. See 477 U. S., at 180, n. 11 (prose-\ncutor referred to the defendant as an “ ‘animal’ ”); id., at\n180, n. 12 (“ ‘I wish I could see [the defendant] with no\nface, blown away by a shotgun’ ”). Particularly because the\nDarden standard is a very general one, leaving courts\n“more leeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\ndeterminations,” Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,\n12                 PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n664 (2004)), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside\nthe Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion.\n   The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own prec-\nedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the\nreasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision.\nAfter quoting the governing standard from our decision in\nDarden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would “engag[e] in\na two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial\nmisconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality. ‘To\nsatisfy the standard . . . , the conduct must be both im-\nproper and flagrant.’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 505 (quoting Broom v.\nMitchell, 441 F. 3d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)). It went on to\nevaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four\nfactors derived from its own precedent: “ ‘(1) the likelihood\nthat the remarks . . . tended to mislead the jury or preju-\ndice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated\nor extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or\naccidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evi-\ndence against [Matthews].’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 506 (quoting\nBroom, supra, at 412). And it stated that “the prosecutor’s\ncomments in this case were sufficiently similar to” certain\ncomments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in\nGall II, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000), “that they rise to the\nlevel of impropriety.” 651 F. 3d, at 506.\n   As we explained in correcting an identical error by the\nSixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12), circuit precedent does not constitute\n“clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).

Decided June 11, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  In this habeas case, the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Sixth Circuit set aside two 29-year-old mur-\nder convictions based on the flimsiest of rationales. The\ncourt’s decision is a textbook example of what the Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)\nproscribes: “using federal habeas corpus review as a vehi-\ncle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state\ncourts.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 12). We therefore grant the petition for certiorari and\nreverse.\n                             I\n  Between 1 and 2 a.m. on the morning of June 29, 1981,\nrespondent David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louis-\nville home he had until recently shared with his estranged\nwife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene). At the time,\nMatthews’ mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying\nat the home with her daughter. Matthews found Cruse in\nbed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a\ngun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before.\nMatthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went\ninto the next room, where he found his wife. He had\nsexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her\nuntil about 6 a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her.\nCruse would die from her wound later that day.\n  Matthews was apprehended that morning at his moth-\ner’s house, where he had already begun to wash the\n2                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nclothes he wore during the crime. Later in the day, police\nofficers found the murder weapon secreted below the\nfloorboards of a backyard shed on the property. At the\npolice station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement\nto a police detective in which he denied responsibility for\nthe murders.\n   A grand jury indicted Matthews for the two murders\nand for burglary. At trial, he did not contest that he killed\nthe two victims. Instead, he sought to show that he had\nacted under “extreme emotional disturbance,” which under\nKentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would\notherwise be murder to first-degree manslaughter. Ky.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §§507.020(1)(a), 507.030(1)(b) (West 2006).\nAs support for that claim, Matthews pointed to the trou-\nbled history of his marriage with Marlene. Matthews and\nhis wife had been frequently separated from one another,\nand their periods of separation were marked by extreme\nhostility. Marlene would regularly procure criminal war-\nrants against Matthews; several weeks before the murders\nshe obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of\nMarlene’s 6-year-old daughter, which had led to Mat-\nthews’ spending roughly three weeks in jail. Witnesses\nalso testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews\nwhen they were together and would yell at him from\nacross the street when they were separated; and Mat-\nthews’ mother recounted that Marlene would leave the\ncouple’s young child crying in the street late at night\noutside the house where Matthews was sleeping in order\nto antagonize him.\n   Matthews also introduced the testimony of a psychia-\ntrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews. Dr.\nChutkow related what Matthews had told him about the\nmurders, including that Matthews had been drinking heav-\nily and taking Valium and a stimulant drug. Dr. Chut-\nkow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suf-\nfering from an adjustment disorder, which he described\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nas a “temporary emotional and behavioral disturbance in\nindividuals who are subject to a variety of stresses,” that\nwould temporarily impair a person’s judgment and cause\nsymptoms such as “anxiety, nervousness, depression, even\nsuicide attempts or attempts to hurt other people.” 6\nRecord 558. Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that\nMatthews was acting under the influence of extreme\nemotional disturbance at the time of the murders—in\nparticular, that he experienced “extreme tension, irritabil-\nity, and almost a kind of fear of his late wife,” id., at 567,\nwhom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated\nhim.\n   The jury convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was\nsentenced to death. The Kentucky Supreme Court af-\nfirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Matthews’\n37 claims of error. Matthews v. Commonwealth, 709 S. W.\n2d 414, 417 (1985). In response to Matthews’ argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had\nacted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the\ncourt concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews’\n“conduct before, during and after the offense was more\nthan sufficient to support the jury’s findings of capital\nmurder.” Id., at 421. A claim that the prosecutor had\ncommitted misconduct during his closing argument was\nrejected on the merits, but without discussion.\n   Following an unsuccessful state postconviction proceed-\ning, Matthews filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Kentucky. Matthews\ncontended, among other things, that the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court had contravened clearly established federal\nlaw in rejecting his claim that the evidence was insuffi-\ncient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of\nextreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his claim\nof prosecutorial misconduct. The District Court dismissed\nthe petition, but a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit re-\n4                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nversed with instructions to grant relief.    651 F. 3d 489\n(2011).\n                               II\n  Under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit had no authority to\nissue the writ of habeas corpus unless the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates,” or “was based on an unreasonable determination\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State\ncourt proceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). The Sixth Circuit\ngave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was\nentitled to relief under this “difficult to meet . . . and\nhighly deferential standard,” Cullen v. Pinholster, 563\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither is valid.\n                              A\n  First, the Sixth Circuit held that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden\nof proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the\nCommonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme\nemotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. The\nSixth Circuit reasoned that, at the time Matthews com-\nmitted his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on\nextreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth,\n607 S. W. 2d 97, 108 (1980), which placed the burden of\nproducing evidence on the defendant, but left the bur-\nden of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturb-\nance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the\ndefendant had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt on the issue. According to the Sixth\nCircuit, however, the Kentucky Supreme Court departed\nfrom that understanding in Matthews’ case and placed the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nburden of proving extreme emotional disturbance “entirely\non the defendant,” 651 F. 3d, at 500.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s interpretation is supported by cer-\ntain aspects of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s opinion in\nMatthews’ case. For example, the state court indicated\nthat Matthews had “present[ed] extensive evidence” of his\nextreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by finding the evidence\nhe had presented “far from overwhelming,” rather than by\nstating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt. Mat-\nthews, 709 S. W. 2d, at 420–421. The state court also\nobserved that it had recently clarified in Wellman v. Com-\nmonwealth, 694 S. W. 2d 696 (1985), that “absence of\nextreme emotional disturbance is not an element of the\ncrime of murder which the Commonwealth must affirma-\ntively prove.” Matthews, supra, at 421. In the Sixth Cir-\ncuit’s view, the Kentucky Supreme Court’s reliance on this\nWellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in\nresolving Matthews’ appeal violated the Due Process\nClause, as construed by this Court in Bouie v. City of\nColumbia, 378 U. S. 347, 354 (1964), because it involved\nthe retroactive application of an “ ‘unexpected and indefen-\nsible’ ” judicial revision of the Kentucky murder statute.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court’s initial assessment of\nthe evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant\nif they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews’\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. It is not clear, however,\nthat they did. The Kentucky Supreme Court explained that\n“[t]he trial court’s instructions in regard to extreme emo-\ntional disturbance were adequate, and the proof supported\nthe jury’s findings of intentional murder.” 709 S. W. 2d,\nat 421. Those jury instructions required the jury to find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted\n“under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for\nwhich there was a reasonable justification or excuse under\nthe circumstances as he believed them to be.” 6 Record\n6                      PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n625, 628–629. The case had been submitted to the jury\nwith the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the jury\nhad found that burden carried, and the Kentucky Su-\npreme Court found the evidence adequate to sustain that\nfinding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews’\nclaim, so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a\nground of questionable validity. See Wetzel v. Lambert,\n565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at\n4–5).1\n   The Sixth Circuit’s opinion also challenges the conclu-\nsion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme\nemotional disturbance. We have said that “it is the\nresponsibility of the jury—not the court—to decide what\n\n——————\n  1 An ambiguously worded footnote in the Sixth Circuit’s opinion, see\n\n651 F. 3d 489, 504, n. 5 (2011), suggests that the court may have found\nan additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement\nin the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision in Gall v. Commonwealth\n607 S. W. 2d 97, 109 (1980), that “[u]nless the evidence raising the\nissue [of extreme emotional disturbance] is of such probative force that\notherwise the defendant would be entitled as a matter of law to an\nacquittal on the higher charge (murder), the prosecution is not required\nto come forth with negating evidence in order to sustain its burden of\nproof.” Relying on its own opinion in Gall’s federal habeas proceeding,\nGall v. Parker, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000) (Gall II), the Sixth Circuit\nsuggested that the quoted statement “require[d] a defendant to bear the\nheavy burden of disproving an element of a crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt,” 651 F. 3d, at 504, n. 5, in violation of this Court’s decision in\nMullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975). That is not so. The state-\nment explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the\nprosecution, but merely asserts that when the burden of production is\nassigned to the defendant the jury may find the prosecution’s burden of\nproof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the\ndefendant’s evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as\na matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See 2 J. Strong, McCor-\nmick on Evidence §338, pp. 419–420 (5th ed. 1999). Our opinion in\nMullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was\nshifted to the defendant, see 421 U. S., at 702, and n. 31; it does not\nremotely show that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s truism contravened\nclearly established federal law.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nconclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at\ntrial,” Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 1). The evidence is sufficient to support a\nconviction whenever, “after viewing the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia,\n443 U. S. 307, 319 (1979). And a state-court decision\nrejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on\nfederal habeas unless the “decision was ‘objectively unrea-\nsonable.’ ” Cavazos, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n   In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abun-\ndantly clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court’s rejection\nof Matthews’ sufficiency claim is controlling in this federal\nhabeas proceeding. The Sixth Circuit noted that Dr.\nChutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under\nthe influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time\nof the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on\ncross-examination. But there was ample evidence point-\ning in the other direction as well. As the Kentucky\nSupreme Court observed, Matthews’ claim of extreme emo-\ntional disturbance was belied by “the circumstances of the\ncrime,” 709 S. W. 2d, at 421—including the facts that he\nborrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day\nof the murders, that he waited several hours after buying\nthe gun before starting for his wife’s home, and that he\ndelayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law\nand killing his wife. The claim was also belied by his\nbehavior after the murders, including his “[taking] steps to\nhide the gun and clean his clothes,” and later “giv[ing]\na false statement to the police.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit\ndiscounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified\nthat Matthews’ deliberateness and consciousness of\nwrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of\nextreme emotional disturbance. 651 F. 3d., at 504, n. 4.\nBut expert testimony does not trigger a conclusive pre-\n8                  PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nsumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable\nto conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the\ntension between Dr. Chutkow’s testimony and their own\ncommon-sense understanding of emotional disturbance.\nIn resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow’s testi-\nmony, the Sixth Circuit overstepped the proper limits of its\nauthority. See Jackson, supra, at 326.\n   More fundamentally, the Sixth Circuit did not appear to\nconsider the possibility that the jury could have found the\nsymptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to estab-\nlish what is required to reduce murder to manslaughter\nunder Kentucky law: that Matthews “acted under the\ninfluence of extreme emotional disturbance for which\nthere was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reason-\nableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint\nof a person in the defendant’s situation under the circum-\nstances as the defendant believed them to be.” Ky. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §507.020(1)(a). Dr. Chutkow himself agreed\nthat many people face tension and anxiety—two symptoms\nhe attributed to Matthews. 6 Record 579–580. And he\nagreed that many people suffer from adjustment disor-\nders. Id., at 592. But of course very few people commit\nmurders. In light of these points, which bear on the\nproper characterization of Matthews’ mental condition and\nthe reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt made no objectively unreasonable error in conclud-\ning that the question of extreme emotional disturbance\nwas properly committed to the jury for resolution.\n                            B\n  As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth Circuit\nheld that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during\nhis closing argument constituted a denial of due process.\nThis claim was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky\nSupreme Court (albeit without analysis) and therefore\nreceives deferential review under the AEDPA standard.\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                       9\n\n                                Per Curiam\n\nSee Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 8). The “clearly established Federal law” relevant\nhere is our decision in Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\n168 (1986), which explained that a prosecutor’s improper\ncomments will be held to violate the Constitution only if\nthey “ ‘so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the\nresulting conviction a denial of due process.’ ” Id., at 181\n(quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 643\n(1974)).\n  According to the Sixth Circuit, the prosecutor violated\nDarden by suggesting that Matthews had colluded with\nhis lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manu-\nfacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense. But\nalthough the Sixth Circuit quoted a lengthy section of the\nprosecutor’s closing argument which could be understood\nas raising a charge of collusion,2 the court did not address\n——————\n  2 The  full text of the section the Sixth Circuit found objectionable is as\nfollows:\n“He’s arraigned, he meets with his attorney and either he tells his at-\ntorney, I did it or I didn’t do it. One or the other. But, the attorney\nknows what the evidence is. By the way, the defendant knows what the\nevidence is, because while he’s giving this statement, it’s sitting right in\nfront of him at the Homicide Office. Here’s the gun. Here’s the shoes,\nDavid. ‘Nah, nah, I never saw it before. I never borrowed a gun. I\nnever borrowed any money. I wasn’t there. I was at home in bed\nasleep.’ He’s denying it there.\n   “And what does his attorney think? His attorney sees all this evi-\ndence, and he’s going through his mind, what kind of legal excuse can\nI have? What is this man’s defense? Self protection? No, there’s no\nproof of a gun found at that house on 310 North 24th Street. No proof\nof that. Protection of another? The defendant’s mother is at home on\nLytle Street. He isn’t protecting her over there on North 24th Street.\nIntoxication? Yeah, well, he was drinking that night. Maybe that will\nmean something.\n   “But that isn’t enough, Ladies and Gentlemen. Mr. Busse has to\ncontact a psychiatrist to see his client, and he comes in and sees his\nclient one month after the day of his arrest, one month to the day, and\nby that time, Mr. David Eugene Matthews sees his defense in the form\nof Doctor Chutkow, and do you think this guy is aware of what’s going\n10                      PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nthe prosecutor’s statement that immediately followed the\nquoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of\ncollusion:\n     “And that’s not to say that Mr. Busse is unethical.\n     Not at all. He is entitled to the best defense he can\n     get, but that’s the only defense he has, what the doc-\n     tor has to say, and that’s not to say that the doctor\n     gets on the stand and perjures himself. He’s telling\n     you the truth. He wouldn’t perjure himself for any-\n     thing. He’s telling you the truth, Ladies and Gentle-\n     men.” 7 Record 674.\nWith the prosecutor’s immediate clarification that he was\nnot alleging collusion in view, the Sixth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that this feature of the closing argument clearly\nviolated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the pros-\necutor’s suggestion that Matthews had “enhance[d] his\nstory to Doctor Chutkow,” ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth\nCircuit’s grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement\nis clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews\nhad a motive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in\nhis meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted\nstatement, the prosecutor continued with a series of rhe-\ntorical questions:\n     “Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about\n     his wife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things\n——————\non? He’s competent. He can work with his attorney, and he enhances\nhis story to Doctor Chutkow. Yeah, I was drinking. I was drinking a\nlot. I was taking a lot of pills, too, and let me tell you about the pills I\nwas taking.\n   “Don’t you think he has a purpose in enhancing his story to the\npsychiatrist? Don’t you think he would exaggerate his fears about his\nwife, his mother-in-law, and all these other things about what other\npeople might be doing to his mother? Don’t you think he would over-\nstate the extent of his intoxication to his psychiatrist? It’s the defense\nof last resort, Ladies and Gentlemen. He has no excuse for his conduct,\nbut that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 673–674.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

He has no excuse for\nhis conduct, but that’s his only way out.” 7 Record 674.\nBut the Kentucky Supreme Court could have understood\nthis comment too as having been directed at Matthews’\nmotive to exaggerate his emotional disturbance—i.e., as\nemphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense\nraised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional\ndisturbance.\n   Moreover, even if the comment is understood as direct-\ning the jury’s attention to inappropriate considerations,\nthat would not establish that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of the Darden prosecutorial misconduct\nclaim “was so lacking in justification that there was an\nerror well understood and comprehended in existing law\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.”\nHarrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Indeed,\nDarden itself held that a closing argument considerably\nmore inflammatory than the one at issue here did not\nwarrant habeas relief. See 477 U. S., at 180, n. 11 (prose-\ncutor referred to the defendant as an “ ‘animal’ ”); id., at\n180, n. 12 (“ ‘I wish I could see [the defendant] with no\nface, blown away by a shotgun’ ”). Particularly because the\nDarden standard is a very general one, leaving courts\n“more leeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\ndeterminations,” Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652,\n12                 PARKER v. MATTHEWS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n664 (2004)), the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to set aside\nthe Kentucky Supreme Court’s conclusion.\n   The Sixth Circuit also erred by consulting its own prec-\nedents, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the\nreasonableness of the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision.\nAfter quoting the governing standard from our decision in\nDarden, the Sixth Circuit added that it would “engag[e] in\na two step inquiry to determine whether the prosecutorial\nmisconduct rises to the level of unconstitutionality. ‘To\nsatisfy the standard . . . , the conduct must be both im-\nproper and flagrant.’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 505 (quoting Broom v.\nMitchell, 441 F. 3d 392, 412 (CA6 2006)). It went on to\nevaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four\nfactors derived from its own precedent: “ ‘(1) the likelihood\nthat the remarks . . . tended to mislead the jury or preju-\ndice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated\nor extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or\naccidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evi-\ndence against [Matthews].’ ” 651 F. 3d, at 506 (quoting\nBroom, supra, at 412). And it stated that “the prosecutor’s\ncomments in this case were sufficiently similar to” certain\ncomments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in\nGall II, 231 F. 3d 265 (CA6 2000), “that they rise to the\nlevel of impropriety.” 651 F. 3d, at 506.\n   As we explained in correcting an identical error by the\nSixth Circuit two Terms ago, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 11–12), circuit precedent does not constitute\n“clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). It therefore\ncannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA. Nor\ncan the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on its own precedents be\ndefended in this case on the ground that they merely\nreflect what has been “clearly established” by our cases.\nThe highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of\nprosecutorial misconduct set forth in Darden bears scant\nresemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

To make matters worse, the Sixth\nCircuit decided Gall II under pre-AEDPA law, see 231\nF. 3d, at 283, n. 2, so that case did not even purport to\nreflect clearly established law as set out in this Court’s\nholdings. It was plain and repetitive error for the Sixth\nCircuit to rely on its own precedents in granting Matthews\nhabeas relief.\n                        *     *  *\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/801975/", "sha1": "a50ca2a4ae78b999f4bfddd923fea29a407d8ae9", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-06-11T07:24:36"}
