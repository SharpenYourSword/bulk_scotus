Argued February 27, 2012\u2014Decided June 11, 2012\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) \u201cestablished a compre-\n  hensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal\n  employees,\u201d United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455, including\n  removals, 5 U. S. C. \u00a77512. A qualifying employee has the right to a\n  hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB),\n  \u00a7\u00a77513(d), 7701(a)(1)\u2013(2), which is authorized to order reinstatement,\n  backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees, \u00a7\u00a71204(a)(2), 7701(g). An employee who\n  is dissatisfied with the MSPB\u2019s decision is entitled to judicial review\n  in the Federal Circuit. \u00a7\u00a77703(a)(1), (b)(1).\n     Petitioners were federal employees discharged pursuant to 5\n  U. S. C. \u00a73328, which bars from Executive agency employment any-\n  one who has knowingly and willfully failed to register for the Selec-\n  tive Service as required by the Military Selective Service Act, 50\n  U. S. C. App. \u00a7453. Petitioner Elgin challenged his removal before\n  the MSPB, claiming that \u00a73328 is an unconstitutional bill of attain-\n  der and unconstitutionally discriminates based on sex when com-\n  bined with the Military Selective Service Act\u2019s male-only registration\n  requirement. The MSPB referred the case to an Administrative Law\n  Judge (ALJ), who dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, con-\n  cluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB review of agency\n  action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The\n  ALJ also concluded that the MSPB lacked authority to determine the\n  constitutionality of a federal statute. Rather than seeking further\n  MSPB review or appealing to the Federal Circuit, Elgin joined other\n  petitioners raising the same constitutional challenges to their remov-\n  als in a suit in Federal District Court. The District Court found that\n  it had jurisdiction and denied petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims on the\n2               ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    merits. The First Circuit vacated and remanded with instructions to\n    dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The First Circuit held that petition-\n    ers were employees entitled to MSPB review despite the statutory\n    bar to their employment. The court further concluded that challeng-\n    es to a removal are not exempt from the CSRA review scheme simply\n    because an employee challenges the constitutionality of the statute\n    authorizing the removal.\nHeld: The CSRA precludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019\n claims because it is fairly discernible that Congress intended the\n statute\u2019s review scheme to provide the exclusive avenue to judicial\n review for covered employees who challenge covered adverse em-\n ployment actions, even when those employees argue that a federal\n statute is unconstitutional. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) Relying on Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603, petitioners claim\n that 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s general grant of federal-question jurisdiction\n to district courts remains undisturbed unless Congress explicitly di-\n rects otherwise. But Webster\u2019s \u201cheightened showing\u201d applies only\n when a statute purports to \u201cdeny any judicial forum for a colorable\n constitutional claim,\u201d 486 U. S., at 603, not when Congress channels\n judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court, see\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200. Here, where the\n claims can be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the\u201d Federal Circuit, id., at\n 215, the proper inquiry is whether Congress\u2019 intent to preclude dis-\n trict court jurisdiction was \u201c \u2018fairly discernible in the statutory\n scheme,\u2019 \u201d id., at 207. Pp. 5\u20136.\n    (b) It is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from the CSRA\u2019s text, structure, and\n purpose that Congress precluded district court jurisdiction over peti-\n tioners\u2019 claims. Pp. 6\u201312.\n      (1) Just as the CSRA\u2019s \u201celaborate\u201d framework demonstrated\n Congress\u2019 intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to\n whom the CSRA denies statutory review in Fausto, 484 U. S., at 443,\n the CSRA indicates that extrastatutory review is not available to\n those employees to whom the CSRA grants administrative and judi-\n cial review. It \u201cprescribes in great detail the protections and reme-\n dies applicable to\u201d adverse personnel actions against federal employ-\n ees, ibid., specifically enumerating the major adverse actions and\n employee classifications to which the CSRA\u2019s procedural protections\n and review provisions apply, \u00a7\u00a77511, 7512, setting out the procedures\n due an employee prior to final agency action, \u00a77513, and exhaustively\n detailing the system of review before the MSPB and the Federal Cir-\n cuit, \u00a7\u00a77701, 7703. Petitioners and the Government do not dispute\n that petitioners are removed employees to whom CSRA review is\n provided, but petitioners claim that there is an exception to the\n CSRA review scheme for employees who bring constitutional chal-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nlenges to federal statutes; this claim finds no support in the CSRA\u2019s\ntext and structure. The availability of administrative and judicial\nreview under the CSRA generally turns on the type of civil service\nemployee and adverse employment action at issue. Nothing in the\nCSRA\u2019s text suggests that its exclusive review scheme is inapplicable\nsimply because a covered employee raises a constitutional challenge.\nAnd \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2014which expressly exempts from Federal Circuit re-\nview challenges alleging that a covered action was based on discrimi-\nnation prohibited by enumerated federal employment laws\u2014\ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums\nfor judicial review based on the nature of an employee\u2019s claim. Pp. 6\u2013\n10.\n      (2) The CSRA\u2019s purpose also supports the conclusion that the\nstatutory review scheme is exclusive, even for constitutional chal-\nlenges. The CSRA\u2019s objective of creating an integrated review\nscheme to replace inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative judi-\ncial review would be seriously undermined if a covered employee\ncould challenge a covered employment action first in a district court,\nand then again in a court of appeals, simply by challenging the con-\nstitutionality of the statutory authorization for the action. Claim-\nsplitting and preclusion doctrines would not necessarily eliminate the\npossibility of parallel proceedings before the MSPB and the district\ncourt, and petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to support the no-\ntion that Congress intended to allow employees to pursue constitu-\ntional claims in district court at the expense of forgoing other, poten-\ntially meritorious claims before the MSPB. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   (c) Petitioners invoke the \u201cpresum[ption] that Congress does not in-\ntend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if \u2018a finding of preclusion\ncould foreclose all meaningful judicial review\u2019; if the suit is \u2018wholly\ncollateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u2019; and if the claims are \u2018out-\nside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com-\npany Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. But none of those\ncharacteristics is present here. Pp. 12\u201320.\n      (1) Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims can receive meaningful re-\nview within the CSRA scheme even if the MSPB, as it claims, is not\nauthorized to decide a federal law\u2019s constitutionality. Their claims\ncan be \u201cmeaningfully addressed\u201d in the Federal Circuit, which has\nheld that it can determine the constitutionality of a statute upon\nwhich an employee\u2019s removal was based, notwithstanding the\nMSPB\u2019s professed lack of authority to decide the question. The CSRA\nreview scheme also fully accommodates the potential need for a fac-\ntual record. Even without factfinding capabilities, the Federal Cir-\ncuit may take judicial notice of facts relevant to the constitutional\nquestion. If further development is necessary, the CSRA empowers\n4               ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the MSPB to take evidence and find facts for Federal Circuit review.\n    See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71204(b)(1)\u2013(2). Petitioners err in arguing that the\n    MSPB will invariably dismiss a case without ever reaching the fact-\n    finding stage in an appeal such as theirs. The MSPB may determine\n    that it lacks authority to decide the issue; but absent another infirmi-\n    ty in the adverse action, it will affirm the employing agency\u2019s deci-\n    sion. The Federal Circuit can then review the decision, including any\n    factual record developed by the MSPB. Petitioners\u2019 argument is not\n    illustrated by Elgin\u2019s case, which was dismissed on the threshold\n    ground that he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d with a right to appeal because\n    his employment was absolutely barred by statute. Pp. 12\u201318.\n         (2) Petitioners\u2019 claims are also not \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the\n    CSRA scheme. Their constitutional claims are the vehicle by which\n    they seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal em-\n    ployment, and to receive lost compensation. A challenge to removal\n    is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the\n    MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme, and rein-\n    statement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees are precisely the kinds of re-\n    lief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and the Federal Circuit to\n    provide. Pp. 18\u201319.\n         (3) Finally, in arguing that their constitutional claims are not the\n    sort that Congress intended to channel through the MSPB because\n    they are beyond the MSPB\u2019s expertise, petitioners overlook the many\n    threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and\n    to which the MSPB can apply its expertise, e.g., whether a resigna-\n    tion, as in petitioner Tucker\u2019s case, amounts to a constructive dis-\n    charge.

S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., certain federal employees may\nobtain administrative and judicial review of specified ad-\nverse employment actions. The question before us is\nwhether the CSRA provides the exclusive avenue to judi-\ncial review when a qualifying employee challenges an\nadverse employment action by arguing that a federal sta-\ntute is unconstitutional. We hold that it does.\n                              I\n   The CSRA \u201cestablished a comprehensive system for\nreviewing personnel action taken against federal employ-\nees.\u201d United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455 (1988).\nAs relevant here, Subchapter II of Chapter 75 governs\nreview of major adverse actions taken against employees\n\u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of the ser-\nvice.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77503(a), 7513(a). Employees entitled to\nreview are those in the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d and \u201cexcepted\nservice\u201d who meet certain requirements regarding proba-\n2             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntionary periods and years of service.1 \u00a77511(a)(1). The re-\nviewable agency actions are removal, suspension for more\nthan 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30\ndays or less. \u00a77512.\n   When an employing agency proposes a covered action\nagainst a covered employee, the CSRA gives the employee\nthe right to notice, representation by counsel, an oppor-\ntunity to respond, and a written, reasoned decision from\nthe agency. \u00a77513(b). If the agency takes final adverse\naction against the employee, the CSRA gives the employee\nthe right to a hearing and to be represented by an attor-\nney or other representative before the Merit Systems Pro-\ntection Board (MSPB). \u00a7\u00a77513(d), 7701(a)(1)\u2013(2). The\nMSPB is authorized to order relief to prevailing employ-\nees, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\u00a7\u00a71204(a)(2), 7701(g).\n   An employee who is dissatisfied with the MSPB\u2019s deci-\nsion is entitled to judicial review in the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court \u201cshall\nreview the record and hold unlawful and set aside any\nagency action, findings, or conclusions\u201d that are \u201carbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\naccordance with law,\u201d \u201cobtained without procedures re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 TheCSRA divides civil service employees into three main catego-\nries.

The competitive service\nalso includes employees in other branches of the Federal Govern-\nment and in the District of Columbia government who are specifically\nincluded by statute. \u00a7\u00a72102(a)(2)\u2013(3). Finally, \u201cexcepted service\u201d\nemployees are employees who are not in the Senior Executive Service\nor in the competitive service. \u00a72103.\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

The Federal Circuit has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over\nappeals from a final decision of the MSPB. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71295(a)(9); see also 5 U. S. C. \u00a77703(b)(1) (judicial review\nof an MSPB decision \u201cshall be\u201d in the Federal Circuit).\n                              II\n   Petitioners are former federal competitive service em-\nployees who failed to comply with the Military Selective\nService Act, 50 U. S. C. App. \u00a7453. That Act requires\nmale citizens and permanent-resident aliens of the United\nStates between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the\nSelective Service. Another federal statute, 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a73328 (hereinafter Section 3328), bars from employment\nby an Executive agency anyone who has knowingly and\nwillfully failed to register. Pursuant to Section 3328, pe-\ntitioners were discharged (or allegedly constructively\ndischarged) by respondents, their employing agencies.\n   Among petitioners, only Michael Elgin appealed his\nremoval to the MSPB. Elgin argued that Section 3328 is\nan unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitution-\nally discriminates on the basis of sex when combined with\nthe registration requirement of the Military Selective\nService Act. The MSPB referred Elgin\u2019s appeal to an ad-\nministrative law judge (ALJ) for an initial decision.2\nThe ALJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,\nconcluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB\nreview of agency action that is based on an absolute statu-\ntory bar to employment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a\u2013101a.\nThe ALJ also held that Elgin\u2019s constitutional claims could\nnot \u201cconfer jurisdiction\u201d on the MSPB because it \u201clacks\nauthority to determine the constitutionality of a statute.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See \u00a77701(b)(1) (authorizing referral of MSPB appeals to an ALJ); 5\n\nCFR \u00a7\u00a71201.111\u20131201.114 (2011) (detailing procedures for an initial\ndecision by an ALJ and review by the MSPB).\n4           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 101a.\n   Elgin neither petitioned for review by the full MSPB\nnor appealed to the Federal Circuit. Instead, he joined the\nother petitioners in filing suit in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts, raising the same\nconstitutional challenges to Section 3328 and the Military\nSelective Service Act. App. 4, 26\u201328, 29. Petitioners\nsought equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judg-\nment that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional, an\ninjunction prohibiting enforcement of Section 3328, rein-\nstatement to their former positions, backpay, benefits, and\nattorney\u2019s fees. Id., at 29\u201330.\n   The District Court rejected respondents\u2019 argument that\nit lacked jurisdiction and denied petitioners\u2019 constitutional\nclaims on the merits. See Elgin v. United States, 697\nF. Supp. 2d 187 (Mass. 2010). The District Court held\nthat the CSRA did not preclude it from hearing petition-\ners\u2019 claims, because the MSPB had no authority to deter-\nmine the constitutionality of a federal statute. Id., at 193.\nHence, the District Court concluded that it retained juris-\ndiction under the general grant of federal-question juris-\ndiction in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. 697 F. Supp. 2d, at 194.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\nvacated the judgment and remanded with instructions to\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction. See 641 F. 3d 6 (2011).\nThe Court of Appeals held that challenges to a removal\nare not exempted from the CSRA review scheme simply\nbecause the employee argues that the statute authorizing\nthe removal is unconstitutional. Id., at 11\u201312. According\nto the Court of Appeals, the CSRA provides a forum\u2014the\nFederal Circuit\u2014that may adjudicate the constitutionality\nof a federal statute, and petitioners \u201cwere obliged to use\nit.\u201d Id., at 12\u201313.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the CSRA pre-\ncludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claims\neven though they are constitutional claims for equitable\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelief. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). We conclude that it does,\nand we therefore affirm.\n                             III\n   We begin with the appropriate standard for determining\nwhether a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial\nreview provides the exclusive means of review for consti-\ntutional claims. Petitioners argue that even if they may\nobtain judicial review of their constitutional claims before\nthe Federal Circuit, they are not precluded from pursuing\ntheir claims in federal district court. According to peti-\ntioners, the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction\nin 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331, which gives district courts authority\nover constitutional claims, remains undisturbed unless\nCongress explicitly directs otherwise. In support of this\nargument, petitioners rely on Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S.\n592, 603 (1988), which held that \u201cwhere Congress intends\nto preclude judicial review of constitutional claims[,] its\nintent to do so must be clear.\u201d The Webster Court noted\nthat this \u201cheightened showing\u201d was required \u201cto avoid the\n\u2018serious constitutional question\u2019 that would arise if a fed-\neral statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for\na colorable constitutional claim.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.\nMichigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667,\n681, n. 12 (1986)). Petitioners contend that the CSRA\ndoes not meet this standard because it does not expressly\nbar suits in district court.\n   Petitioners\u2019 argument overlooks a necessary predicate to\nthe application of Webster\u2019s heightened standard: a statute\nthat purports to \u201cdeny any judicial forum for a colorable\nconstitutional claim.\u201d 486 U. S., at 603. Webster\u2019s stand-\nard does not apply where Congress simply channels judi-\ncial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court.\nWe held as much in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510\nU. S. 200 (1994). In that case, we considered whether a\nstatutory scheme of administrative review followed by\n6            ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial review in a federal appellate court precluded\ndistrict court jurisdiction over a plaintiff \u2019s statutory and\nconstitutional claims. Id., at 206. We noted that the\nplaintiff \u2019s claims could be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the\nCourt of Appeals\u201d and that the case therefore did \u201cnot\npresent the \u2018serious constitutional question\u2019 that would\narise if an agency statute were construed to preclude all\njudicial review of a constitutional claim.\u201d Id., at 215, and\nn. 20 (quoting Bowen, supra, at 681, n. 12). Accordingly,\nwe did not require Webster\u2019s \u201cheightened showing,\u201d but\ninstead asked only whether Congress\u2019 intent to preclude\ndistrict court jurisdiction was \u201c \u2018fairly discernible in the\nstatutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d 510 U. S., at 207 (quoting Block v.\nCommunity Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 351 (1984)).\n  Like the statute in Thunder Basin, the CSRA does not\nforeclose all judicial review of petitioners\u2019 constitutional\nclaims, but merely directs that judicial review shall occur\nin the Federal Circuit. Moreover, as we explain below, the\nFederal Circuit is fully capable of providing meaningful\nreview of petitioners\u2019 claims. See infra, at 12\u201317. Accord-\ningly, the appropriate inquiry is whether it is \u201cfairly dis-\ncernible\u201d from the CSRA that Congress intended covered\nemployees appealing covered agency actions to proceed\nexclusively through the statutory review scheme, even in\ncases in which the employees raise constitutional chal-\nlenges to federal statutes.\n                           IV\n   To determine whether it is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that\nCongress precluded district court jurisdiction over peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims, we examine the CSRA\u2019s text, structure,\nand purpose. See Thunder Basin, supra, at 207; Fausto,\n484 U. S., at 443.\n                               A\n    This is not the first time we have addressed the impact\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof the CSRA\u2019s text and structure on the availability of\njudicial review of a federal employee\u2019s challenge to an\nemployment decision. In Fausto, we considered whether\na so-called \u201cnonpreference excepted service employe[e]\u201d\ncould challenge his suspension in the United States\nClaims Court, even though the CSRA did not then afford\nhim a right to review in the MSPB or the Federal Circuit.3\nId., at 440\u2013441, 448. Citing \u201c[t]he comprehensive nature\nof the CSRA, the attention that it gives throughout to the\nrights of nonpreference excepted service employees, and\nthe fact that it does not include them in provisions for\nadministrative and judicial review contained in Chapter\n75,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cthe absence of provision\nfor these employees to obtain judicial review\u201d was a \u201ccon-\nsidered congressional judgment.\u201d Id., at 448. The Court\nthus found it \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that Congress intended to\npreclude all judicial review of Fausto\u2019s statutory claims.4\nId., at 452 (citing Block, supra, at 349).\n  Just as the CSRA\u2019s \u201celaborate\u201d framework, 484 U. S.,\nat 443, demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to entirely foreclose\njudicial review to employees to whom the CSRA denies\nstatutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory\nreview is not available to those employees to whom the\nCSRA grants administrative and judicial review. Indeed,\nin Fausto we expressly assumed that \u201ccompetitive service\nemployees, who are given review rights by Chapter 75,\ncannot expand these rights by resort to\u201d judicial review\noutside of the CSRA scheme. See id., at 450, n. 3. As\nFausto explained, the CSRA \u201cprescribes in great detail the\nprotections and remedies applicable to\u201d adverse personnel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Certain veterans and their close relatives are considered \u201cpreference\n\neligible\u201d civil service employees. Fausto, 484 U. S., at 441, n. 1.\n   4 Although Fausto interpreted the CSRA to entirely foreclose judicial\n\nreview, the Court had no need to apply a heightened standard like that\napplied in Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988), because Fausto did not\npress any constitutional claims.\n8           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactions against federal employees. Id., at 443. For exam-\nple, Subchapter II of Chapter 75, the portion of the CSRA\nrelevant to petitioners, specifically enumerates the major\nadverse actions and employee classifications to which the\nCSRA\u2019s procedural protections and review provisions\napply. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77511, 7512. The subchapter then sets\nout the procedures due an employee prior to final agency\naction. \u00a77513. And, Chapter 77 of the CSRA exhaustively\ndetails the system of review before the MSPB and the\nFederal Circuit. \u00a7\u00a77701, 7703; see also Fausto, supra, at\n449 (emphasizing that the CSRA\u2019s structure evinces \u201cthe\nprimacy\u201d of review by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit).\nGiven the painstaking detail with which the CSRA sets\nout the method for covered employees to obtain review of\nadverse employment actions, it is fairly discernible that\nCongress intended to deny such employees an additional\navenue of review in district court.\n  Petitioners do not dispute that they are employees who\nsuffered adverse actions covered by the foregoing provi-\nsions of the CSRA. Nor do they contest that the CSRA\u2019s\ntext and structure support implied preclusion of district\ncourt jurisdiction, at least as a general matter. Petitioners\neven acknowledge that the MSPB routinely adjudicates\nsome constitutional claims, such as claims that an agency\ntook adverse employment action in violation of an em-\nployee\u2019s First or Fourth Amendment rights, and that these\nclaims must be brought within the CSRA scheme. See\nBrief for Petitioners 33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u201311, 15, 21; see\nalso, e.g., Smith v. Department of Transp., 106 MSPR 59,\n78\u201379 (2007) (applying Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Town-\nship High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968),\nto an employee\u2019s claim that he was suspended in retal-\niation for the exercise of his First Amendment rights);\nGarrison v. Department of Justice, 67 MSPR 154 (1995)\n(considering whether an order directing an employee to\nsubmit to a drug test was reasonable under the Fourth\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment). Nevertheless, petitioners seek to carve out\nan exception to CSRA exclusivity for facial or as-applied\nconstitutional challenges to federal statutes.\n   The text and structure of the CSRA, however, provide\nno support for such an exception. The availability of ad-\nministrative and judicial review under the CSRA gen-\nerally turns on the type of civil service employee and\nadverse employment action at issue. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77511(a)(1) (defining \u201cemployee\u201d), 7512 (defining \u201c[a]c-\ntions covered\u201d), 7513(d) (providing that \u201c[a]n employee\nagainst whom an action is taken under this section is\nentitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board\u201d),\n7703(a)(1) (providing that \u201c[a]ny employee . . . adversely\naffected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the\nMerit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial re-\nview of the order or decision\u201d in the Federal Circuit).\nNothing in the CSRA\u2019s text suggests that its exclusive\nreview scheme is inapplicable simply because a covered\nemployee challenges a covered action on the ground that\nthe statute authorizing that action is unconstitutional. As\nthe Government correctly notes, \u201c[t]he plain language of\n[the CSRA\u2019s] provisions applies to an employee who chal-\nlenges his removal on the ground that the statute requir-\ning it is unconstitutional no less than it applies to an\nemployee who challenges his removal on any other\nground.\u201d Brief for Respondents 33\u201334.\n   In only one situation does the CSRA expressly exempt a\ncovered employee\u2019s appeal of a covered action from Federal\nCircuit review based on the type of claim at issue. When a\ncovered employee \u201calleges that a basis for the action was\ndiscrimination\u201d prohibited by enumerated federal em-\nployment laws, 5 U. S. C. \u00a77702(a)(1)(B), the CSRA allows\nthe employee to obtain judicial review of an unfavorable\nMSPB decision by filing a civil action as provided by the\napplicable employment law. See \u00a77703(b)(2). Each of the\ncross-referenced employment laws authorizes an action\n10          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin federal district court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(f); 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7633a(c); \u00a7216(b). Title 5 U. S. C. \u00a77703(b)(2)\ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alterna-\ntive forums for judicial review based on the nature of an\nemployee\u2019s claim. That Congress declined to include an\nexemption from Federal Circuit review for challenges to\na statute\u2019s constitutionality indicates that Congress in-\ntended no such exception.\n                              B\n  The purpose of the CSRA also supports our conclusion\nthat the statutory review scheme is exclusive, even for\nemployees who bring constitutional challenges to federal\nstatutes. As we have previously explained, the CSRA\u2019s\n\u201cintegrated scheme of administrative and judicial review\u201d\nfor aggrieved federal employees was designed to replace\nan \u201c \u2018outdated patchwork of statutes and rules\u2019 \u201d that af-\nforded employees the right to challenge employing agency\nactions in district courts across the country. Fausto, 484\nU. S., at 444\u2013445. Such widespread judicial review, which\nincluded appeals in all of the Federal Courts of Appeals\nproduced \u201cwide variations in the kinds of decisions . . .\nissued on the same or similar matters\u201d and a double layer\nof judicial review that was \u201cwasteful and irrational.\u201d Id.,\nat 445 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The CSRA\u2019s objective of creating an integrated scheme\nof review would be seriously undermined if, as petitioners\nwould have it, a covered employee could challenge a cov-\nered employment action first in a district court, and then\nagain in one of the courts of appeals, simply by alleging\nthat the statutory authorization for such action is uncon-\nstitutional. Such suits would reintroduce the very po-\ntential for inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative\njudicial review that the CSRA was designed to avoid.\nMoreover, petitioners\u2019 position would create the possibility\nof parallel litigation regarding the same agency action\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the MSPB and a district court. An employee could\nchallenge the constitutionality of the statute authorizing\nan agency\u2019s action in district court, but the MSPB would\nremain the exclusive forum for other types of challenges to\nthe agency\u2019s decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20137, 9, 15\u201316.\n   Petitioners counter that doctrines regarding claim split-\nting and preclusion would bar parallel suits before the\nMSPB and the district court. But such doctrines would\nnot invariably eliminate the possibility of simultaneous\nproceedings, for a tribunal generally has discretion to\ndecide whether to dismiss a suit when a similar suit is\npending elsewhere. See 18 C. Wright et al., Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a74406 (2d ed. 2002 and Supp. 2011). In\nany event, petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to\nsupport the odd notion that Congress intended to allow\nemployees to pursue constitutional claims in district court\nat the cost of forgoing other, potentially meritorious claims\nbefore the MSPB.\n   Finally, we note that a jurisdictional rule based on the\nnature of an employee\u2019s constitutional claim would deprive\nthe aggrieved employee, the MSPB, and the district court\nof clear guidance about the proper forum for the employ-\nee\u2019s claims at the outset of the case. For example, peti-\ntioners contend that facial and as-applied constitutional\nchallenges to statutes may be brought in district court,\nwhile other constitutional challenges must be heard by the\nMSPB. See supra, at 8\u20139; infra, at 13, n. 5. But, as we\nexplain below, that line is hazy at best and incoherent at\nworst. See ibid. The dissent\u2019s approach fares no better.\nThe dissent carves out for district court adjudication only\nfacial constitutional challenges to statutes, but we have\npreviously stated that \u201cthe distinction between facial and\nas-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has\nsome automatic effect or that it must always control the\npleadings and disposition in every case involving a consti-\ntutional challenge.\u201d Citizens United v. Federal Election\n12          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nComm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14). By\ncontrast, a jurisdictional rule based on the type of em-\nployee and adverse agency action at issue does not involve\nsuch amorphous distinctions. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the better interpretation of the CSRA is that its\nexclusivity does not turn on the constitutional nature of an\nemployee\u2019s claim, but rather on the type of the employee\nand the challenged employment action.\n                               V\n  Petitioners raise three additional factors in arguing that\ntheir claims are not the type that Congress intended to be\nreviewed within the CSRA scheme. Specifically, petition-\ners invoke our \u201cpresum[ption] that Congress does not\nintend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if \u2018a finding\nof preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial re-\nview\u2019; if the suit is \u2018wholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review\nprovisions\u2019; and if the claims are \u2018outside the agency\u2019s\nexpertise.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 8) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212\u2013213).\nContrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, none of those charac-\nteristics are present here.\n                               A\n  First, petitioners argue that the CSRA review scheme\nprovides no meaningful review of their claims because the\nMSPB lacks authority to declare a federal statute un-\nconstitutional. Petitioners are correct that the MSPB\nhas repeatedly refused to pass upon the constitutionality of\nlegislation. See, e.g., Malone v. Department of Justice, 13\nM. S. P. B. 81, 83 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that adminis-\ntrative agencies are without authority to determine the\nconstitutionality of statutes\u201d). This Court has also stated\nthat \u201cadjudication of the constitutionality of congressional\nenactments has generally been thought beyond the juris-\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction of administrative agencies.\u201d Thunder Basin, 510\nU. S., at 215 (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted).5\n   We need not, and do not, decide whether the MSPB\u2019s\nview of its power is correct, or whether the oft-stated\nprinciple that agencies cannot declare a statute unconsti-\ntutional is truly a matter of jurisdiction. See ibid. (de-\nscribing this rule as \u201cnot mandatory\u201d). In Thunder Basin,\nwe held that Congress\u2019 intent to preclude district court\njurisdiction was fairly discernible in the statutory scheme\n\u201c[e]ven if \u201d the administrative body could not decide the\nconstitutionality of a federal law. Ibid. That issue, we\nreasoned, could be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the Court\nof Appeals\u201d that Congress had authorized to conduct\njudicial review. Ibid.6 Likewise, the CSRA provides re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 According to petitioners, the MSPB can decide claims that an\n\nagency violated an employee\u2019s First or Fourth Amendment rights (and\nthose claims consequently must be brought within the CSRA scheme),\nsupra, at 8\u20139, because such claims allege only that an agency \u201cacted in\nan unconstitutional manner\u201d and do not challenge the constitutionality\nof a federal statute either facially or as applied. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10,\n21. That distinction is dubious at best. Agencies are created by and act\npursuant to statutes. Thus, unless an action is beyond the scope of\nthe agency\u2019s statutory authority, an employee\u2019s claim that the agency\n\u201cacted in an unconstitutional manner\u201d will generally be a claim that the\nstatute authorizing the agency action was unconstitutionally applied to\nhim. See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School\nDist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 565 (1968) (holding that the statute\nauthorizing a government employee\u2019s termination was unconstitutional\nas applied under the First and Fourteenth Amendments where the\nemployee was fired because of his speech). In any event, the curious\nline that petitioners draw only highlights the weakness of their posi-\ntion, for it certainly is not \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from the CSRA\u2019s text,\nstructure, or purpose that the statutory review scheme is exclusive for\nso-called \u201cunconstitutional manner\u201d claims but not for facial or as-\napplied constitutional challenges to statutes. See supra, at 7\u201311.\n   6 The dissent misreads Thunder Basin. The dissent contends that the\n\n\u201cheart of the preclusion analysis\u201d in Thunder Basin involved statutory\nclaims reviewable by the administrative body and that the \u201conly consti-\n14             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nview in the Federal Circuit, an Article III court fully com-\npetent to adjudicate petitioners\u2019 claims that Section 3328\nand the Military Selective Service Act\u2019s registration re-\nquirement are unconstitutional.\n   Petitioners insist, however, that the Federal Circuit\ncannot decide their constitutional claims either. Empha-\nsizing the Federal Circuit\u2019s holdings that its jurisdiction\nover employee appeals is coextensive with the MSPB\u2019s\njurisdiction, petitioners argue that the Federal Circuit\nlikewise lacks jurisdiction to decide their challenge to\nthe constitutionality of a federal statute. Petitioners are\nincorrect.\n   As we have explained, the CSRA makes MSPB jurisdic-\ntion over an appeal dependent only on the nature of the\nemployee and the employment action at issue. See supra,\nat 1\u20132, 8\u20139; see also 5 CFR \u00a71201.3(a) (stating that \u201c[t]he\nBoard has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions\u201d\nand enumerating covered actions); Todd v. Merit Systems\nProtection Bd., 55 F. 3d 1574, 1576 (CA Fed. 1995) (ex-\nplaining that the employee \u201chas the burden of establishing\nthat she and the action she seeks to appeal [are] within\nthe [MSPB\u2019s] jurisdiction\u201d). Accordingly, as the cases cited\nby petitioners demonstrate, the Federal Circuit has ques-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntutional issue\u201d was decided by this Court \u201c \u2018not on preclusion grounds\nbut on the merits.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 10 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (quoting 510 U. S.,\nat 219 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). To\nbe sure, the Thunder Basin Court did decide the merits of the petition-\ner\u2019s \u201csecond constitutional challenge,\u201d namely whether the Court\u2019s\nfinding of preclusion was itself unconstitutional. See i.d., at 219\u2013221,\nand n. (same); see also id., at 216 (describing this \u201calternative\u201d argu-\nment). But the petitioner\u2019s suit also included another constitutional\nclaim: a due process challenge to a statute that permitted a regulatory\nagency, before a hearing, to immediately fine the petitioner for non-\ncompliance with the statute. See Brief for Petitioner in Thunder Basin\nCoal Co. v. Reich, O. T. 1993, No. 92\u2013896, p. 13. The Court expressly\nfound that the statutory review scheme precluded district court juris-\ndiction over that constitutional claim. See 510 U. S., at 214\u2012216.\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

To the contrary, in\nBriggs v. MSPB, 331 F. 3d 1307, 1312\u20131313 (2003), the\nFederal Circuit concluded that it could determine the\nconstitutionality of a statute upon which an employee\u2019s\nremoval was based, notwithstanding the MSPB\u2019s pro-\nfessed lack of authority to decide the question.8\n   Petitioners next contend that even if the Federal Circuit\ncould consider their claims in the first instance, resolution\nof the claims requires a factual record that neither the\nMSPB (because it lacks authority to decide the legal ques-\ntion) nor the Federal Circuit (because it is an appellate\ncourt) can create. To the contrary, we think the CSRA\nreview scheme fully accommodates an employee\u2019s poten-\ntial need to establish facts relevant to his constitutional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Schmittling v.

Department of Defense, 545\nF. 3d 1023, 1045\u20131046 (CA Fed. 2008) (judicially noticing\nfacts relevant to equal protection challenge). And, if reso-\nlution of a constitutional claim requires the development\nof facts beyond those that the Federal Circuit may judi-\ncially notice, the CSRA empowers the MSPB to take evi-\ndence and find facts for Federal Circuit review. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71204(b)(1)\u2013(2) (providing that the MSPB may\nadminister oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions,\nissue interrogatories, subpoena testimony and documents,\nand otherwise receive evidence when a covered employee\nappeals a covered adverse employment action). Unlike\npetitioners, we see nothing extraordinary in a statutory\nscheme that vests reviewable factfinding authority in a\nnon-Article III entity that has jurisdiction over an action\nbut cannot finally decide the legal question to which the\nfacts pertain. Congress has authorized magistrate judges,\nfor example, to conduct evidentiary hearings and make\nfindings of fact relevant to dispositive pretrial motions,\nalthough they are powerless to issue a final ruling on such\nmotions. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7636(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B); United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, 673 (1980).9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The dissent argues that the MSPB may struggle to determine what\n\nfacts are relevant to the constitutional question, given that it will not\ndecide the claim. See post, at 11. But the MSPB\u2019s professed lack of\nauthority to declare a statute unconstitutional does not mean that the\nMSPB cannot identify the legal principles that govern the constitu-\ntional analysis and thus the scope of necessary development of the fac-\ntual record. The MSPB routinely identifies the relevant constitutional\nframework from federal court decisions when deciding other constitu-\ntional claims. See supra, at 8\u20139 (citing First and Fourth Amendment\ncases); see also, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense, 80 MSPR 1,\n14\u201315 (1998) (analyzing a claim under the Due Process Clauses of the\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments). We therefore see little reason to\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners nonetheless insist that the MSPB will never\nreach the factfinding stage in an appeal challenging the\nconstitutionality of a federal statute, pointing to the ALJ\u2019s\ndismissal for lack of jurisdiction in petitioner Elgin\u2019s case.\nAgain, petitioners are incorrect. When a covered employee\nappeals a covered adverse action, the CSRA grants the\nMSPB jurisdiction over the appeal. See supra, at 14. If\nthe employee attacks the adverse action on the ground\nthat a statute is unconstitutional, the MSPB may deter-\nmine that it lacks authority to decide that particular issue;\nbut absent another infirmity in the adverse action, the\nMSPB will affirm the employing agency\u2019s decision rather\nthan dismiss the appeal. See, e.g., Briggs, supra, at 1311.\nThe Federal Circuit can then review the MSPB decision,\nincluding any factual record developed by the MSPB in the\ncourse of its decision on the merits.\n   Contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, Elgin\u2019s case does not\nillustrate that the MSPB will invariably dismiss an appeal\nchallenging the constitutionality of a federal statute before\nreaching the factfinding stage. The ALJ dismissed Elgin\u2019s\ncase on the threshold jurisdictional ground that he was\nnot an \u201cemployee\u201d with a right to appeal to the MSPB\nbecause his employment was absolutely barred by statute.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a\u2013101a. The Government\nconceded before the First Circuit that this jurisdictional\nargument was incorrect, see Brief for United States 10,\nand the Court of Appeals agreed, see 641 F. 3d, at 10\u201311.\nThe parties do not raise that issue here, and we do not\naddress it. What matters for present purposes is that the\nparticular circumstances of Elgin\u2019s case do not demon-\nstrate that the MSPB will dismiss an appeal that is oth-\nerwise within its jurisdiction merely because it lacks the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncredit the dissent\u2019s prediction that our holding will result in a compli-\ncated back and forth between a befuddled MSPB and the Federal\n\nCircuit. \n\n18             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nauthority to decide a particular claim.10\n   In sum, the CSRA grants the MSPB and the Federal\nCircuit jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 appeal because they\nare covered employees challenging a covered adverse\nemployment action. Within the CSRA review scheme, the\nFederal Circuit has authority to consider and decide peti-\ntioners\u2019 constitutional claims. To the extent such chal-\nlenges require factual development, the CSRA equips the\nMSPB with tools to create the necessary record. Thus,\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional claims can receive meaningful\nreview within the CSRA scheme.11\n                               B\n   Petitioners next contend that the CSRA does not pre-\nclude district court jurisdiction over their claims because\nthey are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the CSRA scheme. Accord-\ning to petitioners, their bill-of-attainder and sex discrimi-\nnation claims \u201chave nothing to do with the types of day-to-\nday personnel actions adjudicated by the MSPB,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 29, and petitioners \u201care not seeking the\nCSRA\u2019s \u2018protections and remedies.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief for Peti-\ntioners 3. We disagree. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n   10 Before this Court, the Government again conceded the error of its\n\nargument that Elgin is not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the MSPB\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion and indicated that it would support a motion by Elgin to reopen his\ncase before the MSPB. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.\n   11 The dissent cites McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.\n\n479 (1991), for the \u201cbasic principle,\u201d post, at 8, that preclusion cannot be\ninferred when \u201c \u2018the administrative appeals process does not address\nthe kind of . . . constitutional claims\u2019 at issue.\u201d See post, at 7\u20138 (quoting\nMcNary, 498 U. S., at 493). But that statement from McNary was not a\nreference to an administrative body\u2019s inability to decide a constitutional\nclaim. Rather, McNary was addressing a statutory review scheme that\nprovided no opportunity for the plaintiffs to develop a factual record\nrelevant to their constitutional claims before the administrative body\nand then restricted judicial review to the administrative record created\nin the first instance. Ibid. As we have explained, the CSRA review\nprocess is not similarly limited. See supra, at 15.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  As evidenced by their district court complaint, petition-\ners\u2019 constitutional claims are the vehicle by which they\nseek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal\nemployment, and to receive the compensation they would\nhave earned but for the adverse employment action. See\nApp. 29\u201330. A challenge to removal is precisely the type of\npersonnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and\nthe Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme. Likewise,\nreinstatement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees are precisely\nthe kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and\nthe Federal Circuit to provide. See supra, at 2; see also\nHeckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 614 (1984) (holding that\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims were not wholly collateral to a statutory\nscheme of administrative and judicial review of Medicare\npayment decisions, where plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and\nstatutory challenge to an agency\u2019s procedure for reaching\npayment decisions was \u201cat bottom\u201d an attempt to reverse\nthe agency\u2019s decision to deny payment). Far from a suit\nwholly collateral to the CSRA scheme, the case before us is\na challenge to CSRA-covered employment action brought\nby CSRA-covered employees requesting relief that the\nCSRA routinely affords.\n                             C\n  Relatedly, petitioners argue that their constitutional\nclaims are not the sort that Congress intended to channel\nthrough the MSPB because they are outside the MSPB\u2019s\nexpertise. But petitioners overlook the many threshold\nquestions that may accompany a constitutional claim and\nto which the MSPB can apply its expertise. Of particular\nrelevance here, preliminary questions unique to the em-\nployment context may obviate the need to address the\nconstitutional challenge. For example, petitioner Henry\nTucker asserts that his resignation amounted to a con-\nstructive discharge. That issue falls squarely within the\nMSPB\u2019s expertise, and its resolution against Tucker would\n20          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\navoid the need to reach his constitutional claims. In addi-\ntion, the challenged statute may be one that the MSPB\nregularly construes, and its statutory interpretation could\nalleviate constitutional concerns. Or, an employee\u2019s ap-\npeal may involve other statutory or constitutional claims\nthat the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a consti-\ntutional challenge to a federal statute. The MSPB\u2019s reso-\nlution of those claims in the employee\u2019s favor might fully\ndispose of the case. Thus, because the MSPB\u2019s expertise\ncan otherwise be \u201cbrought to bear\u201d on employee appeals\nthat challenge the constitutionality of a statute, we see no\nreason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt such\nclaims from exclusive review before the MSPB and the\nFederal Circuit. See Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 214\u2013\n215 (concluding that, where administrative Commission\u2019s\nexpertise \u201ccould be brought to bear\u201d on appeal, Commis-\nsion\u2019s exclusive review of alleged statutory violation was\nappropriate despite its lack of expertise in interpreting a\nparticular statute (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n                         *    *     *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it is fairly\ndiscernible that the CSRA review scheme was intended to\npreclude district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claims.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S. C. \u00a73328. They filed a putative\nclass-action suit in Federal District Court, arguing that\nthe registration requirement is facially unconstitutional\nbecause it discriminates on the basis of gender and oper-\nates as a bill of attainder. Their complaint sought back-\npay as well as declaratory and injunctive relief reinstating\ntheir employment and preventing the Government from\nenforcing \u00a73328 against them.\n   The Court affirms the dismissal of petitioners\u2019 suit on\nthe ground that the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA)\nprovides an exclusive administrative remedy for claims of\nwrongful termination brought by covered federal employ-\nees. Because the CSRA provides an avenue for employees\nto pursue their grievances through the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, the majority concludes, Congress must\nhave intended to remove petitioners\u2019 claims from the\nordinary ambit of the federal courts.\n   The problem with the majority\u2019s reasoning is that peti-\ntioners\u2019 constitutional claims are a far cry from the type of\nclaim that Congress intended to channel through the\nBoard. The Board\u2019s mission is to adjudicate fact-specific\n2           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nemployment disputes within the existing statutory frame-\nwork. By contrast, petitioners argue that one key provi-\nsion of that framework is facially unconstitutional. Not\nonly does the Board lack authority to adjudicate facial\nconstitutional challenges, but such challenges are wholly\ncollateral to the type of claims that the Board is author-\nized to hear.\n   The majority attempts to defend its holding by noting\nthat, although the Board cannot consider petitioners\u2019\nclaims, petitioners may appeal from the Board to the\nFederal Circuit, which does have authority to address\nfacial constitutional claims. But that does not cure the\noddity of requiring such claims to be filed initially before\nthe Board, which can do nothing but pass them along\nunaddressed, leaving the Federal Circuit to act as a court\nof first review, but with little capacity for factfinding.\n   Because I doubt that Congress intended to channel\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional claims into an administrative\ntribunal that is powerless to decide them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   As a general matter, federal district courts have \u201corigi-\nnal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Con-\nstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331. Under this provision, it has long been\n\u201cestablished practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdic-\ntion of federal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights\nsafeguarded by the Constitution.\u201d Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 684 (1946). In light of \u00a71331, the question is not\nwhether Congress has specifically conferred jurisdiction,\nbut whether it has taken it away. See Whitman v. De-\npartment of Transportation, 547 U. S. 512, 514 (2006)\n(per curiam).\n   Congress may remove certain claims from the general\njurisdiction of the federal courts in order to channel these\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529\nU. S. 1 (2000), we considered a clause providing that \u201cno\naction . . . to recover on any claim\u201d arising under the Medi-\ncare laws \u201cshall be brought under section 1331 . . . of title\n28,\u201d id., at 5 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(h) (brackets omit-\nted)). When dealing with an express preclusion clause like\nthis, we determine the scope of preclusion simply by inter-\npreting the words Congress has chosen.\n  We have also recognized that preclusion can be implied.\nWhen Congress creates an administrative process to han-\ndle certain types of claims, it impliedly removes those\nclaims from the ordinary jurisdiction of the federal courts.\nUnder these circumstances, the test is whether \u201cthe \u2018statu-\ntory scheme\u2019 displays a \u2018fairly discernible\u2019 intent to limit jur-\nisdiction and the claims at issue \u2018are of the type Congress\nintended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.\u2019 \u201d\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)\n(quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200,\n207, 212 (1994); alteration in Free Enterprise). In making\nthis determination, we look to \u201cthe statute\u2019s language,\nstructure, and purpose, its legislative history, and whether\nthe claims can be afforded meaningful review\u201d through\nthe alternative administrative process that Congress\nhas established. Thunder Basin, supra, at 207 (citation\nomitted).\n  We have emphasized two important factors for deter-\nmining whether Congress intended an agency to have\nexclusive original jurisdiction over a claim. The first is\nwhether the claim falls within the agency\u2019s area of ex-\npertise, which would give the agency a comparative ad-\nvantage over the courts in resolving the claim. \u201cGenerally,\nwhen Congress creates procedures \u2018designed to permit\nagency expertise to be brought to bear on particular prob-\nlems,\u2019 those procedures \u2018are to be exclusive.\u2019 \u201d Free Enter-\n4           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nprise Fund, supra, at ___(slip op., at 8) (quoting Whitney\nNat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans &\nTrust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420 (1965)).\n   Second, even if a claim would not benefit from agency\nexpertise, we nonetheless consider whether the claim is le-\ngally or factually related to the type of dispute the agency\nis authorized to hear. If so, the claim may be channeled\nthrough the administrative process to guard against\nclaim-splitting, which could involve redundant analysis of\noverlapping issues of law and fact. But for claims that fall\noutside the agency\u2019s expertise and are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d\nto the type of dispute the agency is authorized to hear, the\ninterest in requiring unified administrative review is\nconsiderably reduced. Thunder Basin, supra, at 212 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Free Enterprise\nFund, supra, at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 8\u201310).\n                             II\n   The CSRA was enacted to \u201cprovide the people of the\nUnited States with a competent, honest, and productive\nFederal work force reflective of the Nation\u2019s diversity, and\nto improve the quality of public service.\u201d \u00a73(1), 92 Stat.\n1112. To that end, the Act created an \u201cintegrated scheme\nof administrative and judicial review [of personnel ac-\ntions], designed to balance the legitimate interests of the\nvarious categories of federal employees with the needs of\nsound and efficient administration.\u201d United States v.\nFausto, 484 U.

Fol-\nlowing these internal agency procedures, an aggrieved\nemployee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection\nBoard. \u00a77513(d).\n  The Board\u2019s mission is \u201cto ensure that Federal employ-\nees are protected against abuses by agency management,\nthat Executive branch agencies make employment deci-\nsions in accordance with the merit system principles, and\nthat Federal merit systems are kept free of prohibited\npersonnel practices.\u201d Merit Systems Protection Board, An\nIntroduction to the Merit Systems Protection Board 5\n(1999). The Board adjudicates employment disputes in\naccordance with applicable federal laws and regulations,\nincluding the \u201c[m]erit system principles\u201d and \u201c[p]rohibited\npersonnel principles\u201d identified in \u00a7\u00a72301, 2302. After\nthe Board renders a decision, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction\non appeal. See \u00a7\u00a77703(a)(1), (b)(1); 28 U. S. C. \u00a71295(a)(9).\n  The parties agree that petitioners are covered employees\nwho may file an appeal to the Board protesting their re-\nmoval from federal employment. The parties also agree,\nhowever, that the Board lacks authority to adjudicate\nclaims like those asserted by petitioners, which attack the\nvalidity of a federal statute as a facial matter. As this\nCourt has noted, \u201c[a]djudication of the constitutionality\nof congressional enactments has generally been thought\nbeyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d Thun-\nder Basin, supra, at 214 (alteration in original; inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). The Board itself has\nconsistently taken the position that it lacks \u201cauthority to\ndetermine the constitutionality of statutes.\u201d Malone v.\nDepartment of Justice, 14 MSPR 403, 406 (1983) (citing\nMontana Ch. of Assn. of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v.\nYoung, 514 F. 2d 1165, 1167 (CA9 1975)). Thus, the\nBoard\u2019s own self-described role in the administrative\nprocess is simply to apply the relevant statutes as written,\n6           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwithout addressing any facial challenges to the validity of\nthose statutes.\n                              III\n   There is no basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioners must file their constitutional challenges be-\nfore the Board instead of a federal district court. Congress\nhas not expressly curtailed the jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts to consider facial constitutional claims relating to\nfederal employment, and no such limitation can be fairly\ndiscerned from the CSRA. Not only are petitioners\u2019 claims\n\u201cwholly collateral to [the CSRA\u2019s] review provisions and\noutside the agency\u2019s expertise,\u201d Thunder Basin, 510 U. S.,\nat 212 (internal quotation marks omitted), but the Board\nitself admits that it is completely powerless to consider the\nmerits of petitioners\u2019 arguments. In short, neither effi-\nciency nor agency expertise can explain why Congress\nwould want the Board to have exclusive jurisdiction over\nclaims like these. To the contrary, imposing a scheme of\nexclusive administrative review in this context breeds\ninefficiency and creates a procedural framework that is\nneedlessly vexing.\n                             A\n  Petitioners argue that registration for the military\ndraft violates the Equal Protection and Bill of Attainder\nClauses. These facial constitutional arguments are entirely\noutside the Board\u2019s power to decide, and they do not re-\nmotely implicate the Board\u2019s administrative expertise.\nThey have nothing to do with the statutory rules of federal\nemployment, and nothing to do with any application of the\n\u201cmerit system principles\u201d or the \u201cprohibited personnel\npractices\u201d that the Board administers.\n  Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims also have no relation\nto any of the facts that might be relevant to a proceeding\nbefore the Board. The Board typically addresses factual\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nissues pertaining to the specific circumstances in which\nemployee grievances arise. For example: Why was a\nparticular employee removed from federal employment?\nDoes the employer have a sound, nonprohibited basis for\nthe employment action in question? See, e.g., Davis v.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 106 MSPR 654, 657\u2013658\n(2007).\n   By contrast, petitioners\u2019 claims involve general factual\nissues pertaining to the facial constitutionality of the\nmilitary draft. The equal protection question is whether\nmen and women are sufficiently different to justify dispar-\nate treatment under the Selective Service Act. Rostker v.\nGoldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 78 (1981). The factual record that\npetitioners wish to develop would address issues of gender\ndifference that might be considered relevant to military\nservice. See Brief for Petitioners 48 (alleging that \u201cwom-\nen\u2019s role in the military has changed dramatically in the\npast thirty years\u201d). Likewise, under the Bill of Attainder\nClause, the key question is whether requiring draft regis-\ntration as a condition of federal employment amounts to\nthe singling out of a particular person or group for pun-\nishment without trial. See Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 468\u2013469. Whatever the\nrelevant facts may be on either claim, it is clear that they\ncan have no conceivable bearing on any matter the Board\nis authorized to address.\n                              B\n  Administrative agencies typically do not adjudicate\nfacial constitutional challenges to the laws that they ad-\nminister. Such challenges not only lie outside the realm of\nspecial agency expertise, but they are also wholly collat-\neral to other types of claims that the agency is empowered\nto consider. When \u201cthe administrative appeals process\ndoes not address the kind of . . . constitutional claims\u201d at\nissue, we cannot infer that Congress intended to \u201climit[t]\n8           ELGIN v.

In Free\nEnterprise Fund, for example, the plaintiffs were not\nrequired to pursue their constitutional claims through the\nPublic Accounting Company Oversight Board, because\nthey were challenging the very existence of the Board it-\nself. 561 U. S., at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 8\u201310). Likewise,\nin Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 373\u2013374 (1974).\nWhere petitioners brought claims \u201cchallenging the consti-\ntutionality of laws providing benefits,\u201d the Court held that\nthese claims were not precluded by a statute creating\nexclusive administrative review over how those benefits\nwere administered. And in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S.\n319, 327\u2013332 (1976), we held that although a party chal-\nlenging the denial of statutory benefits was generally\nrequired to proceed through the statutory process of ad-\nministrative review, a constitutional challenge to the ad-\nministrative process itself could still be brought directly\nin federal court.\n   The present case follows the same pattern: Petitioners\nare challenging the facial validity of a law that the Board\nis bound to apply to them, and so it makes little sense for\nthem to seek review before the Board.\n   The wholly collateral nature of petitioners\u2019 claims\nmakes them readily distinguishable from claims that this\nCourt has held to be impliedly excluded from the original\njurisdiction of the federal courts. In Fausto, for example,\nwe held that the CSRA precluded a statutory Back Pay\nAct claim involving a dispute over whether an employee\nhad engaged in unauthorized use of a Government vehicle.\n484 U. S., at 455. The plaintiff in that case did not chal-\nlenge the constitutional validity of the applicable legal\nframework, but argued instead that the framework had\nbeen improperly applied to him. He argued that he had\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbeen wrongfully suspended from work, and that he was\nentitled to backpay as a result. Id., at 440. For that type\nof fact-specific personnel dispute, we determined, Con-\ngress had intended for the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive admin-\nistrative scheme to provide the exclusive avenue of relief.\nId., at 455.\n   Similarly, in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367 (1983), we\ndeclined to allow a claim under Bivens v. Six Unknown\nFed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), brought by an\nemployee seeking money damages for an alleged \u201cretalia-\ntory demotion or discharge because he ha[d] exercised his\nFirst Amendment rights.\u201d 462 U. S., at 381. Although\nthe claim was constitutional in nature, we noted that it\n\u201car[o]se out of an employment relationship that is gov-\nerned by comprehensive procedural and substantive provi-\nsions\u201d that had been enacted by Congress. Id., at 368.\nThe employee was pursuing an as-applied challenge that\ndepended on the case-specific facts of why he had been\nfired. The gravamen of the employee\u2019s claim was that he\nhad been \u201cunfairly disciplined for making critical com-\nments about [his agency].\u201d Id., at 386. Under the statu-\ntory scheme that Congress had created, the employee could\nhave pursued a very similar statutory claim for wrongful\nremoval within the administrative process. Id., at 386\u2013\n388. Under these circumstances, we found that Congress\ndid not intend to allow a duplicative nonstatutory claim\nfor damages based on the same set of underlying facts.\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s reliance on Thunder Basin is\nentirely misplaced. See ante, at 13. In that case, we\nfound that a statutory scheme impliedly precluded a\npre-enforcement challenge brought by a mining company\nseeking to enjoin an order issued by the Mine Safety and\nHealth Administration. 510 U. S., at 205. Importantly,\nthe plaintiff company was seeking review of purely statu-\ntory claims that were reviewable in the first instance by\nthe administrative commission that Congress had estab-\n10            ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlished. The only constitutional issue was a matter of\ntiming: The company argued that it had a due process\nright to immediate judicial review of its statutory claims,\nbecause it would suffer irreparable harm if it were forced\nto wait until after the agency initiated an enforcement\naction. Ibid. The Court disagreed, holding that the statu-\ntory scheme was \u201cconsistent with due process\u201d even\nthough it provided for only postenforcement review. Id.,\nat 218. Thus, the Court rejected the company\u2019s constitu-\ntional claim \u201cnot on preclusion grounds but on the merits.\u201d\nId., at 219 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). The heart of the preclusion analysis was\nthat the company could not use a preenforcement chal-\nlenge to obtain judicial review of statutory claims that\nCongress had clearly intended to channel into administra-\ntive review.*\n                          C\n  By requiring facial constitutional claims to be filed\nbefore the Board, the majority\u2019s holding sets up an odd\nsequence of procedural hoops for petitioners to jump\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The majority contends that the petitioner in Thunder Basin really\nhad two distinct constitutional claims. The primary constitutional\nclaim was a \u201cdue process challenge to a statute that permitted a regula-\ntory agency, before a hearing, to immediately fine the petitioner for\nnoncompliance with the statute.\u201d Ante, at 14, n. 6. On top of this,\naccording to the majority, the petitioner also had a separate constitu-\ntional claim, which asserted that precluding initial judicial review of\nthe first constitutional claim would violate due process. In the major-\nity\u2019s view, only the latter claim was rejected on the merits. But this\nhairsplitting makes no difference. The entire thrust of the petitioner\u2019s\nconstitutional argument was simply that proceeding through the stat-\nutory scheme would make meaningful judicial review impossible.\nThe Court rejected that argument, effectively disposing of any constitu-\ntional infirmity that the petitioner alleged. Unlike in the present case,\nthere was no freestanding constitutional claim attacking the validity\nof the statutory framework on substantive rather than procedural\ngrounds.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthrough. As the Government concedes, the Board is pow-\nerless to adjudicate facial constitutional claims, and so\nthese claims cannot be addressed on the merits until they\nreach the Federal Circuit on appeal. As a result, the\nFederal Circuit will be forced to address the claims in the\nfirst instance, without the benefit of any relevant factfind-\ning at the administrative level. This is a strange result,\nbecause \u201cstatutes that provide for only a single level of\njudicial review in the courts of appeals are traditionally\nviewed as warranted only in circumstances where district\ncourt factfinding would unnecessarily duplicate an ade-\nquate administrative record.\u201d McNary, 498 U. S., at 497\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Government admits that the absence of first-tier\nfactfinding might very well result in \u201cthe initial record\u201d\nbeing \u201cinsufficient to permit meaningful consideration of\na constitutional claim,\u201d but suggests that the court could\nalways \u201cremand the case to the [Board] for further factual\ndevelopment.\u201d Brief for Respondents 41. The majority\naccepts this solution, ante, at 15, but it is hard to see how\nit will work in practice. Without any authority to decide\nmerits issues, the Board may find it difficult to adjudicate\ndisputes about the relevancy of evidence sought in discov-\nery. Nor will the Board find it easy to figure out which\nfacts it must find before sending the case back to the\nFederal Circuit.\n   Even if these problems can be overcome, that will not\nresolve the needless complexity of the majority\u2019s approach.\nAccording to the majority, petitioners should file their\nclaims with the Board, which must then kick the claims\nup to the Federal Circuit, which must then remand the\nclaims back to the Board, which must then develop the\nrecord and send the case back to the Federal Circuit,\nwhich can only then consider the constitutional issues.\n   To be sure, this might be sufficient to afford \u201cmeaningful\nreview\u201d of petitioners\u2019 claims, ante, at 16\u201317, but that is\n12          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nnot the only consideration. The question is whether it\nis \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that Congress intended to impose\nthese pinball procedural requirements instead of permitting\npetitioners\u2019 claims to be decided in a regular lawsuit in\nfederal district court. And why would it? As already\nnoted, the benefits of preventing claim-splitting are con-\nsiderably reduced with respect to facial constitutional\nclaims that are wholly collateral to an administrative\nproceeding. Because collateral constitutional claims have\nno overlap with the issues of law and fact that will pertain\nto the administrative proceeding, allowing the constitu-\ntional claims to be adjudicated separately before a district\ncourt does not invite wasteful or duplicative review. It\nsimply allows the district court to develop the factual\nrecord and then provide a first-tier legal analysis, thereby\nenhancing both the quality and efficiency of appellate\nreview.\n   To the extent that there is some need to prevent claim-\nsplitting, that purpose is already served by ordinary prin-\nciples of claim preclusion. Plaintiffs generally must bring\nall claims arising out of a common set of facts in a single\nlawsuit, and federal district courts have discretion to\nenforce that requirement as necessary \u201cto avoid duplica-\ntive litigation.\u201d Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.\nv. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817 (1976); Stone v. De-\npartment of Aviation, 453 F. 3d 1271, 1278 (CA10 2006)\n(\u201cA plaintiff \u2019s obligation to bring all related claims together\nin the same action arises under the common-law rule of\nclaim preclusion prohibiting the splitting of actions\u201d). See\nalso 18 C.

Thus, if an\naggrieved employee goes to a district court with claims\nthat would duplicate the factfinding or legal analysis of a\nseparate Board proceeding, the district court would be free\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto dismiss the case.\n   The majority suggests that its approach will allow the\nBoard to resolve some cases on nonconstitutional grounds,\nthus avoiding needless adjudication of constitutional is-\nsues. See ante, at 18. But achieving that goal does not\nrequire the blunt instrument of jurisdictional preclusion.\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to manage their\ndockets, including the power to refrain from reviewing a\nconstitutional claim pending adjudication of a nonconsti-\ntutional claim that might moot the case. See Kerotest Mfg.\nCo. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U. S. 180, 183\n(1952) (acknowledging the equitable discretion of courts,\nin furtherance of \u201c[w]ise judicial administration\u201d and\n\u201cconservation of judicial resources,\u201d to stay proceedings to\nprevent \u201ctwo litigations where one will suffice\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). In short, the district courts\nare well equipped to guard against piecemeal litigation\nwithout any help from the majority\u2019s holding.\n   Finally, the majority contends that channeling facial\nconstitutional claims through the Board is necessary to\nprovide \u201cclear guidance about the proper forum for the\nemployee\u2019s claims at the outset of the case.\u201d Ante, at 11.\nBecause it can be hard to tell the difference between facial\nand as-applied challenges, the majority argues, it is less\nconfusing simply to require that all claims must be\nbrought before the Board. This is a red herring. Labels\naside, the most sensible rule would be to allow initial\njudicial review of constitutional claims that attack the\nvalidity of a statute based on its inherent characteristics,\nnot as a result of how the statute has been applied. That\nline is bright enough, and the distinction is already one\nthat the Board must draw based on its own determination\nthat it can hear some as-applied challenges but lacks\n\u201cauthority to determine the constitutionality of statutes.\u201d\nMalone, 14 MSPR, at 406.\n14          ELGIN v.

In this case,\nhowever, the majority relies on a very weak set of infer-\nences to strip the courts of their original jurisdiction over\npetitioners\u2019 claims. Because I believe Congress would\nhave been very surprised to learn that it implied this\nresult when it passed the CSRA, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued February 27, 2012\u2014Decided June 11, 2012\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) \u201cestablished a compre-\n  hensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal\n  employees,\u201d United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455, including\n  removals, 5 U. S. C. \u00a77512. A qualifying employee has the right to a\n  hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB),\n  \u00a7\u00a77513(d), 7701(a)(1)\u2013(2), which is authorized to order reinstatement,\n  backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees, \u00a7\u00a71204(a)(2), 7701(g). An employee who\n  is dissatisfied with the MSPB\u2019s decision is entitled to judicial review\n  in the Federal Circuit. \u00a7\u00a77703(a)(1), (b)(1).\n     Petitioners were federal employees discharged pursuant to 5\n  U. S. C. \u00a73328, which bars from Executive agency employment any-\n  one who has knowingly and willfully failed to register for the Selec-\n  tive Service as required by the Military Selective Service Act, 50\n  U. S. C. App. \u00a7453. Petitioner Elgin challenged his removal before\n  the MSPB, claiming that \u00a73328 is an unconstitutional bill of attain-\n  der and unconstitutionally discriminates based on sex when com-\n  bined with the Military Selective Service Act\u2019s male-only registration\n  requirement. The MSPB referred the case to an Administrative Law\n  Judge (ALJ), who dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, con-\n  cluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB review of agency\n  action that is based on an absolute statutory bar to employment. The\n  ALJ also concluded that the MSPB lacked authority to determine the\n  constitutionality of a federal statute. Rather than seeking further\n  MSPB review or appealing to the Federal Circuit, Elgin joined other\n  petitioners raising the same constitutional challenges to their remov-\n  als in a suit in Federal District Court. The District Court found that\n  it had jurisdiction and denied petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims on the\n2               ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    merits. The First Circuit vacated and remanded with instructions to\n    dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The First Circuit held that petition-\n    ers were employees entitled to MSPB review despite the statutory\n    bar to their employment. The court further concluded that challeng-\n    es to a removal are not exempt from the CSRA review scheme simply\n    because an employee challenges the constitutionality of the statute\n    authorizing the removal.\nHeld: The CSRA precludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019\n claims because it is fairly discernible that Congress intended the\n statute\u2019s review scheme to provide the exclusive avenue to judicial\n review for covered employees who challenge covered adverse em-\n ployment actions, even when those employees argue that a federal\n statute is unconstitutional. Pp. 5\u201320.\n    (a) Relying on Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603, petitioners claim\n that 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331\u2019s general grant of federal-question jurisdiction\n to district courts remains undisturbed unless Congress explicitly di-\n rects otherwise. But Webster\u2019s \u201cheightened showing\u201d applies only\n when a statute purports to \u201cdeny any judicial forum for a colorable\n constitutional claim,\u201d 486 U. S., at 603, not when Congress channels\n judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court, see\n Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200. Here, where the\n claims can be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the\u201d Federal Circuit, id., at\n 215, the proper inquiry is whether Congress\u2019 intent to preclude dis-\n trict court jurisdiction was \u201c \u2018fairly discernible in the statutory\n scheme,\u2019 \u201d id., at 207. Pp. 5\u20136.\n    (b) It is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from the CSRA\u2019s text, structure, and\n purpose that Congress precluded district court jurisdiction over peti-\n tioners\u2019 claims. Pp. 6\u201312.\n      (1) Just as the CSRA\u2019s \u201celaborate\u201d framework demonstrated\n Congress\u2019 intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to\n whom the CSRA denies statutory review in Fausto, 484 U. S., at 443,\n the CSRA indicates that extrastatutory review is not available to\n those employees to whom the CSRA grants administrative and judi-\n cial review. It \u201cprescribes in great detail the protections and reme-\n dies applicable to\u201d adverse personnel actions against federal employ-\n ees, ibid., specifically enumerating the major adverse actions and\n employee classifications to which the CSRA\u2019s procedural protections\n and review provisions apply, \u00a7\u00a77511, 7512, setting out the procedures\n due an employee prior to final agency action, \u00a77513, and exhaustively\n detailing the system of review before the MSPB and the Federal Cir-\n cuit, \u00a7\u00a77701, 7703. Petitioners and the Government do not dispute\n that petitioners are removed employees to whom CSRA review is\n provided, but petitioners claim that there is an exception to the\n CSRA review scheme for employees who bring constitutional chal-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nlenges to federal statutes; this claim finds no support in the CSRA\u2019s\ntext and structure. The availability of administrative and judicial\nreview under the CSRA generally turns on the type of civil service\nemployee and adverse employment action at issue. Nothing in the\nCSRA\u2019s text suggests that its exclusive review scheme is inapplicable\nsimply because a covered employee raises a constitutional challenge.\nAnd \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2014which expressly exempts from Federal Circuit re-\nview challenges alleging that a covered action was based on discrimi-\nnation prohibited by enumerated federal employment laws\u2014\ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums\nfor judicial review based on the nature of an employee\u2019s claim. Pp. 6\u2013\n10.\n      (2) The CSRA\u2019s purpose also supports the conclusion that the\nstatutory review scheme is exclusive, even for constitutional chal-\nlenges. The CSRA\u2019s objective of creating an integrated review\nscheme to replace inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative judi-\ncial review would be seriously undermined if a covered employee\ncould challenge a covered employment action first in a district court,\nand then again in a court of appeals, simply by challenging the con-\nstitutionality of the statutory authorization for the action. Claim-\nsplitting and preclusion doctrines would not necessarily eliminate the\npossibility of parallel proceedings before the MSPB and the district\ncourt, and petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to support the no-\ntion that Congress intended to allow employees to pursue constitu-\ntional claims in district court at the expense of forgoing other, poten-\ntially meritorious claims before the MSPB. Pp. 10\u201312.\n   (c) Petitioners invoke the \u201cpresum[ption] that Congress does not in-\ntend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if \u2018a finding of preclusion\ncould foreclose all meaningful judicial review\u2019; if the suit is \u2018wholly\ncollateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u2019; and if the claims are \u2018out-\nside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com-\npany Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. But none of those\ncharacteristics is present here. Pp. 12\u201320.\n      (1) Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims can receive meaningful re-\nview within the CSRA scheme even if the MSPB, as it claims, is not\nauthorized to decide a federal law\u2019s constitutionality. Their claims\ncan be \u201cmeaningfully addressed\u201d in the Federal Circuit, which has\nheld that it can determine the constitutionality of a statute upon\nwhich an employee\u2019s removal was based, notwithstanding the\nMSPB\u2019s professed lack of authority to decide the question. The CSRA\nreview scheme also fully accommodates the potential need for a fac-\ntual record. Even without factfinding capabilities, the Federal Cir-\ncuit may take judicial notice of facts relevant to the constitutional\nquestion. If further development is necessary, the CSRA empowers\n4               ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the MSPB to take evidence and find facts for Federal Circuit review.\n    See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71204(b)(1)\u2013(2). Petitioners err in arguing that the\n    MSPB will invariably dismiss a case without ever reaching the fact-\n    finding stage in an appeal such as theirs. The MSPB may determine\n    that it lacks authority to decide the issue; but absent another infirmi-\n    ty in the adverse action, it will affirm the employing agency\u2019s deci-\n    sion. The Federal Circuit can then review the decision, including any\n    factual record developed by the MSPB. Petitioners\u2019 argument is not\n    illustrated by Elgin\u2019s case, which was dismissed on the threshold\n    ground that he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d with a right to appeal because\n    his employment was absolutely barred by statute. Pp. 12\u201318.\n         (2) Petitioners\u2019 claims are also not \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the\n    CSRA scheme. Their constitutional claims are the vehicle by which\n    they seek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal em-\n    ployment, and to receive lost compensation. A challenge to removal\n    is precisely the type of personnel action regularly adjudicated by the\n    MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme, and rein-\n    statement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees are precisely the kinds of re-\n    lief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and the Federal Circuit to\n    provide. Pp. 18\u201319.\n         (3) Finally, in arguing that their constitutional claims are not the\n    sort that Congress intended to channel through the MSPB because\n    they are beyond the MSPB\u2019s expertise, petitioners overlook the many\n    threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and\n    to which the MSPB can apply its expertise, e.g., whether a resigna-\n    tion, as in petitioner Tucker\u2019s case, amounts to a constructive dis-\n    charge.

DEPART-\n        MENT OF THE TREASURY ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 11, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5\nU. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq., certain federal employees may\nobtain administrative and judicial review of specified ad-\nverse employment actions. The question before us is\nwhether the CSRA provides the exclusive avenue to judi-\ncial review when a qualifying employee challenges an\nadverse employment action by arguing that a federal sta-\ntute is unconstitutional. We hold that it does.\n                              I\n   The CSRA \u201cestablished a comprehensive system for\nreviewing personnel action taken against federal employ-\nees.\u201d United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455 (1988).\nAs relevant here, Subchapter II of Chapter 75 governs\nreview of major adverse actions taken against employees\n\u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of the ser-\nvice.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77503(a), 7513(a). Employees entitled to\nreview are those in the \u201ccompetitive service\u201d and \u201cexcepted\nservice\u201d who meet certain requirements regarding proba-\n2             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntionary periods and years of service.1 \u00a77511(a)(1). The re-\nviewable agency actions are removal, suspension for more\nthan 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30\ndays or less. \u00a77512.\n   When an employing agency proposes a covered action\nagainst a covered employee, the CSRA gives the employee\nthe right to notice, representation by counsel, an oppor-\ntunity to respond, and a written, reasoned decision from\nthe agency. \u00a77513(b). If the agency takes final adverse\naction against the employee, the CSRA gives the employee\nthe right to a hearing and to be represented by an attor-\nney or other representative before the Merit Systems Pro-\ntection Board (MSPB). \u00a7\u00a77513(d), 7701(a)(1)\u2013(2). The\nMSPB is authorized to order relief to prevailing employ-\nees, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\u00a7\u00a71204(a)(2), 7701(g).\n   An employee who is dissatisfied with the MSPB\u2019s deci-\nsion is entitled to judicial review in the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court \u201cshall\nreview the record and hold unlawful and set aside any\nagency action, findings, or conclusions\u201d that are \u201carbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\naccordance with law,\u201d \u201cobtained without procedures re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 TheCSRA divides civil service employees into three main catego-\nries. Fausto, 484 U. S., at 441, n. 1. \u201cSenior Executive Service\u201d em-\nployees occupy high-level positions in the Executive Branch but are not\nrequired to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n5 U. S. C. \u00a73131(2). \u201c[C]ompetitive service\u201d employees\u2014the relevant\ncategory for purposes of this case\u2014are all other Executive Branch\nemployees whose nomination by the President and confirmation by the\nSenate are not required and who are not specifically excepted from the\ncompetitive service by statute. \u00a72102(a)(1). The competitive service\nalso includes employees in other branches of the Federal Govern-\nment and in the District of Columbia government who are specifically\nincluded by statute. \u00a7\u00a72102(a)(2)\u2013(3). Finally, \u201cexcepted service\u201d\nemployees are employees who are not in the Senior Executive Service\nor in the competitive service. \u00a72103.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nquired by law, rule, or regulation having been followed,\u201d\nor \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d \u00a7\u00a77703(a)(1),\n(c). The Federal Circuit has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over\nappeals from a final decision of the MSPB. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71295(a)(9); see also 5 U. S. C. \u00a77703(b)(1) (judicial review\nof an MSPB decision \u201cshall be\u201d in the Federal Circuit).\n                              II\n   Petitioners are former federal competitive service em-\nployees who failed to comply with the Military Selective\nService Act, 50 U. S. C. App. \u00a7453. That Act requires\nmale citizens and permanent-resident aliens of the United\nStates between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the\nSelective Service. Another federal statute, 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a73328 (hereinafter Section 3328), bars from employment\nby an Executive agency anyone who has knowingly and\nwillfully failed to register. Pursuant to Section 3328, pe-\ntitioners were discharged (or allegedly constructively\ndischarged) by respondents, their employing agencies.\n   Among petitioners, only Michael Elgin appealed his\nremoval to the MSPB. Elgin argued that Section 3328 is\nan unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitution-\nally discriminates on the basis of sex when combined with\nthe registration requirement of the Military Selective\nService Act. The MSPB referred Elgin\u2019s appeal to an ad-\nministrative law judge (ALJ) for an initial decision.2\nThe ALJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,\nconcluding that an employee is not entitled to MSPB\nreview of agency action that is based on an absolute statu-\ntory bar to employment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a\u2013101a.\nThe ALJ also held that Elgin\u2019s constitutional claims could\nnot \u201cconfer jurisdiction\u201d on the MSPB because it \u201clacks\nauthority to determine the constitutionality of a statute.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 See \u00a77701(b)(1) (authorizing referral of MSPB appeals to an ALJ); 5\n\nCFR \u00a7\u00a71201.111\u20131201.114 (2011) (detailing procedures for an initial\ndecision by an ALJ and review by the MSPB).\n4           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 101a.\n   Elgin neither petitioned for review by the full MSPB\nnor appealed to the Federal Circuit. Instead, he joined the\nother petitioners in filing suit in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts, raising the same\nconstitutional challenges to Section 3328 and the Military\nSelective Service Act. App. 4, 26\u201328, 29. Petitioners\nsought equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judg-\nment that the challenged statutes are unconstitutional, an\ninjunction prohibiting enforcement of Section 3328, rein-\nstatement to their former positions, backpay, benefits, and\nattorney\u2019s fees. Id., at 29\u201330.\n   The District Court rejected respondents\u2019 argument that\nit lacked jurisdiction and denied petitioners\u2019 constitutional\nclaims on the merits. See Elgin v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2010). The District Court held\nthat the CSRA did not preclude it from hearing petition-\ners\u2019 claims, because the MSPB had no authority to deter-\nmine the constitutionality of a federal statute. Id., at 193.\nHence, the District Court concluded that it retained juris-\ndiction under the general grant of federal-question juris-\ndiction in 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331. 697 F. Supp. 2d, at 194.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\nvacated the judgment and remanded with instructions to\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction. See 641 F. 3d 6 (2011).\nThe Court of Appeals held that challenges to a removal\nare not exempted from the CSRA review scheme simply\nbecause the employee argues that the statute authorizing\nthe removal is unconstitutional. Id., at 11\u201312. According\nto the Court of Appeals, the CSRA provides a forum\u2014the\nFederal Circuit\u2014that may adjudicate the constitutionality\nof a federal statute, and petitioners \u201cwere obliged to use\nit.\u201d Id., at 12\u201313.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether the CSRA pre-\ncludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claims\neven though they are constitutional claims for equitable\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelief. See 565 U. S. ___ (2011). We conclude that it does,\nand we therefore affirm.\n                             III\n   We begin with the appropriate standard for determining\nwhether a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial\nreview provides the exclusive means of review for consti-\ntutional claims. Petitioners argue that even if they may\nobtain judicial review of their constitutional claims before\nthe Federal Circuit, they are not precluded from pursuing\ntheir claims in federal district court. According to peti-\ntioners, the general grant of federal-question jurisdiction\nin 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331, which gives district courts authority\nover constitutional claims, remains undisturbed unless\nCongress explicitly directs otherwise. In support of this\nargument, petitioners rely on Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S.\n592, 603 (1988), which held that \u201cwhere Congress intends\nto preclude judicial review of constitutional claims[,] its\nintent to do so must be clear.\u201d The Webster Court noted\nthat this \u201cheightened showing\u201d was required \u201cto avoid the\n\u2018serious constitutional question\u2019 that would arise if a fed-\neral statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for\na colorable constitutional claim.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Bowen v.\nMichigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667,\n681, n. 12 (1986)). Petitioners contend that the CSRA\ndoes not meet this standard because it does not expressly\nbar suits in district court.\n   Petitioners\u2019 argument overlooks a necessary predicate to\nthe application of Webster\u2019s heightened standard: a statute\nthat purports to \u201cdeny any judicial forum for a colorable\nconstitutional claim.\u201d 486 U. S., at 603. Webster\u2019s stand-\nard does not apply where Congress simply channels judi-\ncial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court.\nWe held as much in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510\nU. S. 200 (1994). In that case, we considered whether a\nstatutory scheme of administrative review followed by\n6            ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial review in a federal appellate court precluded\ndistrict court jurisdiction over a plaintiff \u2019s statutory and\nconstitutional claims. Id., at 206. We noted that the\nplaintiff \u2019s claims could be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the\nCourt of Appeals\u201d and that the case therefore did \u201cnot\npresent the \u2018serious constitutional question\u2019 that would\narise if an agency statute were construed to preclude all\njudicial review of a constitutional claim.\u201d Id., at 215, and\nn. 20 (quoting Bowen, supra, at 681, n. 12). Accordingly,\nwe did not require Webster\u2019s \u201cheightened showing,\u201d but\ninstead asked only whether Congress\u2019 intent to preclude\ndistrict court jurisdiction was \u201c \u2018fairly discernible in the\nstatutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d 510 U. S., at 207 (quoting Block v.\nCommunity Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340, 351 (1984)).\n  Like the statute in Thunder Basin, the CSRA does not\nforeclose all judicial review of petitioners\u2019 constitutional\nclaims, but merely directs that judicial review shall occur\nin the Federal Circuit. Moreover, as we explain below, the\nFederal Circuit is fully capable of providing meaningful\nreview of petitioners\u2019 claims. See infra, at 12\u201317. Accord-\ningly, the appropriate inquiry is whether it is \u201cfairly dis-\ncernible\u201d from the CSRA that Congress intended covered\nemployees appealing covered agency actions to proceed\nexclusively through the statutory review scheme, even in\ncases in which the employees raise constitutional chal-\nlenges to federal statutes.\n                           IV\n   To determine whether it is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that\nCongress precluded district court jurisdiction over peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims, we examine the CSRA\u2019s text, structure,\nand purpose. See Thunder Basin, supra, at 207; Fausto,\n484 U. S., at 443.\n                               A\n    This is not the first time we have addressed the impact\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof the CSRA\u2019s text and structure on the availability of\njudicial review of a federal employee\u2019s challenge to an\nemployment decision. In Fausto, we considered whether\na so-called \u201cnonpreference excepted service employe[e]\u201d\ncould challenge his suspension in the United States\nClaims Court, even though the CSRA did not then afford\nhim a right to review in the MSPB or the Federal Circuit.3\nId., at 440\u2013441, 448. Citing \u201c[t]he comprehensive nature\nof the CSRA, the attention that it gives throughout to the\nrights of nonpreference excepted service employees, and\nthe fact that it does not include them in provisions for\nadministrative and judicial review contained in Chapter\n75,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cthe absence of provision\nfor these employees to obtain judicial review\u201d was a \u201ccon-\nsidered congressional judgment.\u201d Id., at 448. The Court\nthus found it \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that Congress intended to\npreclude all judicial review of Fausto\u2019s statutory claims.4\nId., at 452 (citing Block, supra, at 349).\n  Just as the CSRA\u2019s \u201celaborate\u201d framework, 484 U. S.,\nat 443, demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to entirely foreclose\njudicial review to employees to whom the CSRA denies\nstatutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory\nreview is not available to those employees to whom the\nCSRA grants administrative and judicial review. Indeed,\nin Fausto we expressly assumed that \u201ccompetitive service\nemployees, who are given review rights by Chapter 75,\ncannot expand these rights by resort to\u201d judicial review\noutside of the CSRA scheme. See id., at 450, n. 3. As\nFausto explained, the CSRA \u201cprescribes in great detail the\nprotections and remedies applicable to\u201d adverse personnel\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Certain veterans and their close relatives are considered \u201cpreference\n\neligible\u201d civil service employees. Fausto, 484 U. S., at 441, n. 1.\n   4 Although Fausto interpreted the CSRA to entirely foreclose judicial\n\nreview, the Court had no need to apply a heightened standard like that\napplied in Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988), because Fausto did not\npress any constitutional claims.\n8           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactions against federal employees. Id., at 443. For exam-\nple, Subchapter II of Chapter 75, the portion of the CSRA\nrelevant to petitioners, specifically enumerates the major\nadverse actions and employee classifications to which the\nCSRA\u2019s procedural protections and review provisions\napply. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77511, 7512. The subchapter then sets\nout the procedures due an employee prior to final agency\naction. \u00a77513. And, Chapter 77 of the CSRA exhaustively\ndetails the system of review before the MSPB and the\nFederal Circuit. \u00a7\u00a77701, 7703; see also Fausto, supra, at\n449 (emphasizing that the CSRA\u2019s structure evinces \u201cthe\nprimacy\u201d of review by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit).\nGiven the painstaking detail with which the CSRA sets\nout the method for covered employees to obtain review of\nadverse employment actions, it is fairly discernible that\nCongress intended to deny such employees an additional\navenue of review in district court.\n  Petitioners do not dispute that they are employees who\nsuffered adverse actions covered by the foregoing provi-\nsions of the CSRA. Nor do they contest that the CSRA\u2019s\ntext and structure support implied preclusion of district\ncourt jurisdiction, at least as a general matter. Petitioners\neven acknowledge that the MSPB routinely adjudicates\nsome constitutional claims, such as claims that an agency\ntook adverse employment action in violation of an em-\nployee\u2019s First or Fourth Amendment rights, and that these\nclaims must be brought within the CSRA scheme. See\nBrief for Petitioners 33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u201311, 15, 21; see\nalso, e.g., Smith v. Department of Transp., 106 MSPR 59,\n78\u201379 (2007) (applying Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Town-\nship High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968),\nto an employee\u2019s claim that he was suspended in retal-\niation for the exercise of his First Amendment rights);\nGarrison v. Department of Justice, 67 MSPR 154 (1995)\n(considering whether an order directing an employee to\nsubmit to a drug test was reasonable under the Fourth\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment). Nevertheless, petitioners seek to carve out\nan exception to CSRA exclusivity for facial or as-applied\nconstitutional challenges to federal statutes.\n   The text and structure of the CSRA, however, provide\nno support for such an exception. The availability of ad-\nministrative and judicial review under the CSRA gen-\nerally turns on the type of civil service employee and\nadverse employment action at issue. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77511(a)(1) (defining \u201cemployee\u201d), 7512 (defining \u201c[a]c-\ntions covered\u201d), 7513(d) (providing that \u201c[a]n employee\nagainst whom an action is taken under this section is\nentitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board\u201d),\n7703(a)(1) (providing that \u201c[a]ny employee . . . adversely\naffected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the\nMerit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial re-\nview of the order or decision\u201d in the Federal Circuit).\nNothing in the CSRA\u2019s text suggests that its exclusive\nreview scheme is inapplicable simply because a covered\nemployee challenges a covered action on the ground that\nthe statute authorizing that action is unconstitutional. As\nthe Government correctly notes, \u201c[t]he plain language of\n[the CSRA\u2019s] provisions applies to an employee who chal-\nlenges his removal on the ground that the statute requir-\ning it is unconstitutional no less than it applies to an\nemployee who challenges his removal on any other\nground.\u201d Brief for Respondents 33\u201334.\n   In only one situation does the CSRA expressly exempt a\ncovered employee\u2019s appeal of a covered action from Federal\nCircuit review based on the type of claim at issue. When a\ncovered employee \u201calleges that a basis for the action was\ndiscrimination\u201d prohibited by enumerated federal em-\nployment laws, 5 U. S. C. \u00a77702(a)(1)(B), the CSRA allows\nthe employee to obtain judicial review of an unfavorable\nMSPB decision by filing a civil action as provided by the\napplicable employment law. See \u00a77703(b)(2). Each of the\ncross-referenced employment laws authorizes an action\n10          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin federal district court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20135(f); 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7633a(c); \u00a7216(b). Title 5 U. S. C. \u00a77703(b)(2)\ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alterna-\ntive forums for judicial review based on the nature of an\nemployee\u2019s claim. That Congress declined to include an\nexemption from Federal Circuit review for challenges to\na statute\u2019s constitutionality indicates that Congress in-\ntended no such exception.\n                              B\n  The purpose of the CSRA also supports our conclusion\nthat the statutory review scheme is exclusive, even for\nemployees who bring constitutional challenges to federal\nstatutes. As we have previously explained, the CSRA\u2019s\n\u201cintegrated scheme of administrative and judicial review\u201d\nfor aggrieved federal employees was designed to replace\nan \u201c \u2018outdated patchwork of statutes and rules\u2019 \u201d that af-\nforded employees the right to challenge employing agency\nactions in district courts across the country. Fausto, 484\nU. S., at 444\u2013445. Such widespread judicial review, which\nincluded appeals in all of the Federal Courts of Appeals\nproduced \u201cwide variations in the kinds of decisions . . .\nissued on the same or similar matters\u201d and a double layer\nof judicial review that was \u201cwasteful and irrational.\u201d Id.,\nat 445 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The CSRA\u2019s objective of creating an integrated scheme\nof review would be seriously undermined if, as petitioners\nwould have it, a covered employee could challenge a cov-\nered employment action first in a district court, and then\nagain in one of the courts of appeals, simply by alleging\nthat the statutory authorization for such action is uncon-\nstitutional. Such suits would reintroduce the very po-\ntential for inconsistent decisionmaking and duplicative\njudicial review that the CSRA was designed to avoid.\nMoreover, petitioners\u2019 position would create the possibility\nof parallel litigation regarding the same agency action\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the MSPB and a district court. An employee could\nchallenge the constitutionality of the statute authorizing\nan agency\u2019s action in district court, but the MSPB would\nremain the exclusive forum for other types of challenges to\nthe agency\u2019s decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20137, 9, 15\u201316.\n   Petitioners counter that doctrines regarding claim split-\nting and preclusion would bar parallel suits before the\nMSPB and the district court. But such doctrines would\nnot invariably eliminate the possibility of simultaneous\nproceedings, for a tribunal generally has discretion to\ndecide whether to dismiss a suit when a similar suit is\npending elsewhere. See 18 C. Wright et al., Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a74406 (2d ed. 2002 and Supp. 2011). In\nany event, petitioners point to nothing in the CSRA to\nsupport the odd notion that Congress intended to allow\nemployees to pursue constitutional claims in district court\nat the cost of forgoing other, potentially meritorious claims\nbefore the MSPB.\n   Finally, we note that a jurisdictional rule based on the\nnature of an employee\u2019s constitutional claim would deprive\nthe aggrieved employee, the MSPB, and the district court\nof clear guidance about the proper forum for the employ-\nee\u2019s claims at the outset of the case. For example, peti-\ntioners contend that facial and as-applied constitutional\nchallenges to statutes may be brought in district court,\nwhile other constitutional challenges must be heard by the\nMSPB. See supra, at 8\u20139; infra, at 13, n. 5. But, as we\nexplain below, that line is hazy at best and incoherent at\nworst. See ibid. The dissent\u2019s approach fares no better.\nThe dissent carves out for district court adjudication only\nfacial constitutional challenges to statutes, but we have\npreviously stated that \u201cthe distinction between facial and\nas-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has\nsome automatic effect or that it must always control the\npleadings and disposition in every case involving a consti-\ntutional challenge.\u201d Citizens United v. Federal Election\n12          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nComm\u2019n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14). By\ncontrast, a jurisdictional rule based on the type of em-\nployee and adverse agency action at issue does not involve\nsuch amorphous distinctions. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the better interpretation of the CSRA is that its\nexclusivity does not turn on the constitutional nature of an\nemployee\u2019s claim, but rather on the type of the employee\nand the challenged employment action.\n                               V\n  Petitioners raise three additional factors in arguing that\ntheir claims are not the type that Congress intended to be\nreviewed within the CSRA scheme. Specifically, petition-\ners invoke our \u201cpresum[ption] that Congress does not\nintend to limit [district court] jurisdiction if \u2018a finding\nof preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial re-\nview\u2019; if the suit is \u2018wholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review\nprovisions\u2019; and if the claims are \u2018outside the agency\u2019s\nexpertise.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v.

Petitioners are correct that the MSPB\nhas repeatedly refused to pass upon the constitutionality of\nlegislation. See, e.g., Malone v. Department of Justice, 13\nM. S. P. B. 81, 83 (1983) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that adminis-\ntrative agencies are without authority to determine the\nconstitutionality of statutes\u201d). This Court has also stated\nthat \u201cadjudication of the constitutionality of congressional\nenactments has generally been thought beyond the juris-\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 215 (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted).5\n   We need not, and do not, decide whether the MSPB\u2019s\nview of its power is correct, or whether the oft-stated\nprinciple that agencies cannot declare a statute unconsti-\ntutional is truly a matter of jurisdiction. See ibid. (de-\nscribing this rule as \u201cnot mandatory\u201d). In Thunder Basin,\nwe held that Congress\u2019 intent to preclude district court\njurisdiction was fairly discernible in the statutory scheme\n\u201c[e]ven if \u201d the administrative body could not decide the\nconstitutionality of a federal law. Ibid. That issue, we\nreasoned, could be \u201cmeaningfully addressed in the Court\nof Appeals\u201d that Congress had authorized to conduct\njudicial review. Ibid.6 Likewise, the CSRA provides re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 According to petitioners, the MSPB can decide claims that an\n\nagency violated an employee\u2019s First or Fourth Amendment rights (and\nthose claims consequently must be brought within the CSRA scheme),\nsupra, at 8\u20139, because such claims allege only that an agency \u201cacted in\nan unconstitutional manner\u201d and do not challenge the constitutionality\nof a federal statute either facially or as applied. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 10,\n21. That distinction is dubious at best. Agencies are created by and act\npursuant to statutes. Thus, unless an action is beyond the scope of\nthe agency\u2019s statutory authority, an employee\u2019s claim that the agency\n\u201cacted in an unconstitutional manner\u201d will generally be a claim that the\nstatute authorizing the agency action was unconstitutionally applied to\nhim. See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School\nDist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 565 (1968) (holding that the statute\nauthorizing a government employee\u2019s termination was unconstitutional\nas applied under the First and Fourteenth Amendments where the\nemployee was fired because of his speech). In any event, the curious\nline that petitioners draw only highlights the weakness of their posi-\ntion, for it certainly is not \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from the CSRA\u2019s text,\nstructure, or purpose that the statutory review scheme is exclusive for\nso-called \u201cunconstitutional manner\u201d claims but not for facial or as-\napplied constitutional challenges to statutes. See supra, at 7\u201311.\n   6 The dissent misreads Thunder Basin. The dissent contends that the\n\n\u201cheart of the preclusion analysis\u201d in Thunder Basin involved statutory\nclaims reviewable by the administrative body and that the \u201conly consti-\n14             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nview in the Federal Circuit, an Article III court fully com-\npetent to adjudicate petitioners\u2019 claims that Section 3328\nand the Military Selective Service Act\u2019s registration re-\nquirement are unconstitutional.\n   Petitioners insist, however, that the Federal Circuit\ncannot decide their constitutional claims either. Empha-\nsizing the Federal Circuit\u2019s holdings that its jurisdiction\nover employee appeals is coextensive with the MSPB\u2019s\njurisdiction, petitioners argue that the Federal Circuit\nlikewise lacks jurisdiction to decide their challenge to\nthe constitutionality of a federal statute. Petitioners are\nincorrect.\n   As we have explained, the CSRA makes MSPB jurisdic-\ntion over an appeal dependent only on the nature of the\nemployee and the employment action at issue. See supra,\nat 1\u20132, 8\u20139; see also 5 CFR \u00a71201.3(a) (stating that \u201c[t]he\nBoard has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions\u201d\nand enumerating covered actions); Todd v. Merit Systems\nProtection Bd., 55 F. 3d 1574, 1576 (CA Fed. 1995) (ex-\nplaining that the employee \u201chas the burden of establishing\nthat she and the action she seeks to appeal [are] within\nthe [MSPB\u2019s] jurisdiction\u201d). Accordingly, as the cases cited\nby petitioners demonstrate, the Federal Circuit has ques-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntutional issue\u201d was decided by this Court \u201c \u2018not on preclusion grounds\nbut on the merits.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 10 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (quoting 510 U. S.,\nat 219 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). To\nbe sure, the Thunder Basin Court did decide the merits of the petition-\ner\u2019s \u201csecond constitutional challenge,\u201d namely whether the Court\u2019s\nfinding of preclusion was itself unconstitutional. See i.d., at 219\u2013221,\nand n. (same); see also id., at 216 (describing this \u201calternative\u201d argu-\nment). But the petitioner\u2019s suit also included another constitutional\nclaim: a due process challenge to a statute that permitted a regulatory\nagency, before a hearing, to immediately fine the petitioner for non-\ncompliance with the statute. See Brief for Petitioner in Thunder Basin\nCoal Co. v. Reich, O. T. 1993, No. 92\u2013896, p. 13. The Court expressly\nfound that the statutory review scheme precluded district court juris-\ndiction over that constitutional claim. See 510 U. S., at 214\u2012216.\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

To the contrary, in\nBriggs v. MSPB, 331 F. 3d 1307, 1312\u20131313 (2003), the\nFederal Circuit concluded that it could determine the\nconstitutionality of a statute upon which an employee\u2019s\nremoval was based, notwithstanding the MSPB\u2019s pro-\nfessed lack of authority to decide the question.8\n   Petitioners next contend that even if the Federal Circuit\ncould consider their claims in the first instance, resolution\nof the claims requires a factual record that neither the\nMSPB (because it lacks authority to decide the legal ques-\ntion) nor the Federal Circuit (because it is an appellate\ncourt) can create. To the contrary, we think the CSRA\nreview scheme fully accommodates an employee\u2019s poten-\ntial need to establish facts relevant to his constitutional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Schmittling v. Department of Army, 219 F. 3d 1332, 1336 (CA\n\nFed. 2000) (remanding for MSPB to determine if employee suffered a\nprohibited personnel action within the scope of its jurisdiction); Perez v.\nMSPB, 931 F. 2d 853, 855 (CA Fed. 1991) (action against employee was\nnot suspension within MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction); Manning v.

ICC, 853 F. 2d 145, 148\u2013149 (CA2 1988) (provi-\nsion of the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983), aff \u2019d on\nother grounds, 494 U. S. 1 (1990); Reid v.

INS, 634 F. 2d 408, 411, 413 (CA9 1980) (provision of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act), aff \u2019d, 462 U. S. 919 (1983).\n16            ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nchallenge to a federal statute. Even without factfinding\ncapabilities, the Federal Circuit may take judicial notice of\nfacts relevant to the constitutional question. See, e.g.,\nRothe Development Corp. v. Department of Defense, 545\nF. 3d 1023, 1045\u20131046 (CA Fed. 2008) (judicially noticing\nfacts relevant to equal protection challenge). And, if reso-\nlution of a constitutional claim requires the development\nof facts beyond those that the Federal Circuit may judi-\ncially notice, the CSRA empowers the MSPB to take evi-\ndence and find facts for Federal Circuit review. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71204(b)(1)\u2013(2) (providing that the MSPB may\nadminister oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions,\nissue interrogatories, subpoena testimony and documents,\nand otherwise receive evidence when a covered employee\nappeals a covered adverse employment action). Unlike\npetitioners, we see nothing extraordinary in a statutory\nscheme that vests reviewable factfinding authority in a\nnon-Article III entity that has jurisdiction over an action\nbut cannot finally decide the legal question to which the\nfacts pertain. Congress has authorized magistrate judges,\nfor example, to conduct evidentiary hearings and make\nfindings of fact relevant to dispositive pretrial motions,\nalthough they are powerless to issue a final ruling on such\nmotions. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7636(b)(1)(A)\u2013(B); United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, 673 (1980).9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The dissent argues that the MSPB may struggle to determine what\n\nfacts are relevant to the constitutional question, given that it will not\ndecide the claim. See post, at 11. But the MSPB\u2019s professed lack of\nauthority to declare a statute unconstitutional does not mean that the\nMSPB cannot identify the legal principles that govern the constitu-\ntional analysis and thus the scope of necessary development of the fac-\ntual record. The MSPB routinely identifies the relevant constitutional\nframework from federal court decisions when deciding other constitu-\ntional claims. See supra, at 8\u20139 (citing First and Fourth Amendment\ncases); see also, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense, 80 MSPR 1,\n14\u201315 (1998) (analyzing a claim under the Due Process Clauses of the\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments).

When a covered employee\nappeals a covered adverse action, the CSRA grants the\nMSPB jurisdiction over the appeal. See supra, at 14. If\nthe employee attacks the adverse action on the ground\nthat a statute is unconstitutional, the MSPB may deter-\nmine that it lacks authority to decide that particular issue;\nbut absent another infirmity in the adverse action, the\nMSPB will affirm the employing agency\u2019s decision rather\nthan dismiss the appeal. See, e.g., Briggs, supra, at 1311.\nThe Federal Circuit can then review the MSPB decision,\nincluding any factual record developed by the MSPB in the\ncourse of its decision on the merits.\n   Contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, Elgin\u2019s case does not\nillustrate that the MSPB will invariably dismiss an appeal\nchallenging the constitutionality of a federal statute before\nreaching the factfinding stage. The ALJ dismissed Elgin\u2019s\ncase on the threshold jurisdictional ground that he was\nnot an \u201cemployee\u201d with a right to appeal to the MSPB\nbecause his employment was absolutely barred by statute.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a\u2013101a. The Government\nconceded before the First Circuit that this jurisdictional\nargument was incorrect, see Brief for United States 10,\nand the Court of Appeals agreed, see 641 F. 3d, at 10\u201311.\nThe parties do not raise that issue here, and we do not\naddress it. What matters for present purposes is that the\nparticular circumstances of Elgin\u2019s case do not demon-\nstrate that the MSPB will dismiss an appeal that is oth-\nerwise within its jurisdiction merely because it lacks the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ncredit the dissent\u2019s prediction that our holding will result in a compli-\ncated back and forth between a befuddled MSPB and the Federal\n\nCircuit. \n\n18             ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nauthority to decide a particular claim.10\n   In sum, the CSRA grants the MSPB and the Federal\nCircuit jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 appeal because they\nare covered employees challenging a covered adverse\nemployment action. Within the CSRA review scheme, the\nFederal Circuit has authority to consider and decide peti-\ntioners\u2019 constitutional claims. To the extent such chal-\nlenges require factual development, the CSRA equips the\nMSPB with tools to create the necessary record. Thus,\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional claims can receive meaningful\nreview within the CSRA scheme.11\n                               B\n   Petitioners next contend that the CSRA does not pre-\nclude district court jurisdiction over their claims because\nthey are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the CSRA scheme. Accord-\ning to petitioners, their bill-of-attainder and sex discrimi-\nnation claims \u201chave nothing to do with the types of day-to-\nday personnel actions adjudicated by the MSPB,\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 29, and petitioners \u201care not seeking the\nCSRA\u2019s \u2018protections and remedies.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief for Peti-\ntioners 3. We disagree. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n   10 Before this Court, the Government again conceded the error of its\n\nargument that Elgin is not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the MSPB\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion and indicated that it would support a motion by Elgin to reopen his\ncase before the MSPB. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.\n   11 The dissent cites McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U. S.\n\n479 (1991), for the \u201cbasic principle,\u201d post, at 8, that preclusion cannot be\ninferred when \u201c \u2018the administrative appeals process does not address\nthe kind of . . . constitutional claims\u2019 at issue.\u201d See post, at 7\u20138 (quoting\nMcNary, 498 U. S., at 493). But that statement from McNary was not a\nreference to an administrative body\u2019s inability to decide a constitutional\nclaim. Rather, McNary was addressing a statutory review scheme that\nprovided no opportunity for the plaintiffs to develop a factual record\nrelevant to their constitutional claims before the administrative body\nand then restricted judicial review to the administrative record created\nin the first instance. Ibid. As we have explained, the CSRA review\nprocess is not similarly limited. See supra, at 15.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  As evidenced by their district court complaint, petition-\ners\u2019 constitutional claims are the vehicle by which they\nseek to reverse the removal decisions, to return to federal\nemployment, and to receive the compensation they would\nhave earned but for the adverse employment action. See\nApp. 29\u201330. A challenge to removal is precisely the type of\npersonnel action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and\nthe Federal Circuit within the CSRA scheme. Likewise,\nreinstatement, backpay, and attorney\u2019s fees are precisely\nthe kinds of relief that the CSRA empowers the MSPB and\nthe Federal Circuit to provide. See supra, at 2; see also\nHeckler v. Ringer, 466 U. S. 602, 614 (1984) (holding that\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims were not wholly collateral to a statutory\nscheme of administrative and judicial review of Medicare\npayment decisions, where plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and\nstatutory challenge to an agency\u2019s procedure for reaching\npayment decisions was \u201cat bottom\u201d an attempt to reverse\nthe agency\u2019s decision to deny payment). Far from a suit\nwholly collateral to the CSRA scheme, the case before us is\na challenge to CSRA-covered employment action brought\nby CSRA-covered employees requesting relief that the\nCSRA routinely affords.\n                             C\n  Relatedly, petitioners argue that their constitutional\nclaims are not the sort that Congress intended to channel\nthrough the MSPB because they are outside the MSPB\u2019s\nexpertise. But petitioners overlook the many threshold\nquestions that may accompany a constitutional claim and\nto which the MSPB can apply its expertise. Of particular\nrelevance here, preliminary questions unique to the em-\nployment context may obviate the need to address the\nconstitutional challenge. For example, petitioner Henry\nTucker asserts that his resignation amounted to a con-\nstructive discharge. That issue falls squarely within the\nMSPB\u2019s expertise, and its resolution against Tucker would\n20          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\navoid the need to reach his constitutional claims. In addi-\ntion, the challenged statute may be one that the MSPB\nregularly construes, and its statutory interpretation could\nalleviate constitutional concerns. Or, an employee\u2019s ap-\npeal may involve other statutory or constitutional claims\nthat the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a consti-\ntutional challenge to a federal statute. The MSPB\u2019s reso-\nlution of those claims in the employee\u2019s favor might fully\ndispose of the case. Thus, because the MSPB\u2019s expertise\ncan otherwise be \u201cbrought to bear\u201d on employee appeals\nthat challenge the constitutionality of a statute, we see no\nreason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt such\nclaims from exclusive review before the MSPB and the\nFederal Circuit. See Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 214\u2013\n215 (concluding that, where administrative Commission\u2019s\nexpertise \u201ccould be brought to bear\u201d on appeal, Commis-\nsion\u2019s exclusive review of alleged statutory violation was\nappropriate despite its lack of expertise in interpreting a\nparticular statute (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n                         *    *     *\n  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it is fairly\ndiscernible that the CSRA review scheme was intended to\npreclude district court jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claims.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S. C. \u00a73328. They filed a putative\nclass-action suit in Federal District Court, arguing that\nthe registration requirement is facially unconstitutional\nbecause it discriminates on the basis of gender and oper-\nates as a bill of attainder. Their complaint sought back-\npay as well as declaratory and injunctive relief reinstating\ntheir employment and preventing the Government from\nenforcing \u00a73328 against them.\n   The Court affirms the dismissal of petitioners\u2019 suit on\nthe ground that the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA)\nprovides an exclusive administrative remedy for claims of\nwrongful termination brought by covered federal employ-\nees. Because the CSRA provides an avenue for employees\nto pursue their grievances through the Merit Systems\nProtection Board, the majority concludes, Congress must\nhave intended to remove petitioners\u2019 claims from the\nordinary ambit of the federal courts.\n   The problem with the majority\u2019s reasoning is that peti-\ntioners\u2019 constitutional claims are a far cry from the type of\nclaim that Congress intended to channel through the\nBoard. The Board\u2019s mission is to adjudicate fact-specific\n2           ELGIN v.

By contrast, petitioners argue that one key provi-\nsion of that framework is facially unconstitutional. Not\nonly does the Board lack authority to adjudicate facial\nconstitutional challenges, but such challenges are wholly\ncollateral to the type of claims that the Board is author-\nized to hear.\n   The majority attempts to defend its holding by noting\nthat, although the Board cannot consider petitioners\u2019\nclaims, petitioners may appeal from the Board to the\nFederal Circuit, which does have authority to address\nfacial constitutional claims. But that does not cure the\noddity of requiring such claims to be filed initially before\nthe Board, which can do nothing but pass them along\nunaddressed, leaving the Federal Circuit to act as a court\nof first review, but with little capacity for factfinding.\n   Because I doubt that Congress intended to channel\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional claims into an administrative\ntribunal that is powerless to decide them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   As a general matter, federal district courts have \u201corigi-\nnal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Con-\nstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71331. Under this provision, it has long been\n\u201cestablished practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdic-\ntion of federal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights\nsafeguarded by the Constitution.\u201d Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 684 (1946). In light of \u00a71331, the question is not\nwhether Congress has specifically conferred jurisdiction,\nbut whether it has taken it away. See Whitman v. De-\npartment of Transportation, 547 U. S. 512, 514 (2006)\n(per curiam).\n   Congress may remove certain claims from the general\njurisdiction of the federal courts in order to channel these\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529\nU. S. 1 (2000), we considered a clause providing that \u201cno\naction . . . to recover on any claim\u201d arising under the Medi-\ncare laws \u201cshall be brought under section 1331 . . . of title\n28,\u201d id., at 5 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(h) (brackets omit-\nted)). When dealing with an express preclusion clause like\nthis, we determine the scope of preclusion simply by inter-\npreting the words Congress has chosen.\n  We have also recognized that preclusion can be implied.\nWhen Congress creates an administrative process to han-\ndle certain types of claims, it impliedly removes those\nclaims from the ordinary jurisdiction of the federal courts.\nUnder these circumstances, the test is whether \u201cthe \u2018statu-\ntory scheme\u2019 displays a \u2018fairly discernible\u2019 intent to limit jur-\nisdiction and the claims at issue \u2018are of the type Congress\nintended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.\u2019 \u201d\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting\nOversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8)\n(quoting Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200,\n207, 212 (1994); alteration in Free Enterprise). In making\nthis determination, we look to \u201cthe statute\u2019s language,\nstructure, and purpose, its legislative history, and whether\nthe claims can be afforded meaningful review\u201d through\nthe alternative administrative process that Congress\nhas established. Thunder Basin, supra, at 207 (citation\nomitted).\n  We have emphasized two important factors for deter-\nmining whether Congress intended an agency to have\nexclusive original jurisdiction over a claim. The first is\nwhether the claim falls within the agency\u2019s area of ex-\npertise, which would give the agency a comparative ad-\nvantage over the courts in resolving the claim. \u201cGenerally,\nwhen Congress creates procedures \u2018designed to permit\nagency expertise to be brought to bear on particular prob-\nlems,\u2019 those procedures \u2018are to be exclusive.\u2019 \u201d Free Enter-\n4           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nprise Fund, supra, at ___(slip op., at 8) (quoting Whitney\nNat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans &\nTrust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420 (1965)).\n   Second, even if a claim would not benefit from agency\nexpertise, we nonetheless consider whether the claim is le-\ngally or factually related to the type of dispute the agency\nis authorized to hear. If so, the claim may be channeled\nthrough the administrative process to guard against\nclaim-splitting, which could involve redundant analysis of\noverlapping issues of law and fact. But for claims that fall\noutside the agency\u2019s expertise and are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d\nto the type of dispute the agency is authorized to hear, the\ninterest in requiring unified administrative review is\nconsiderably reduced. Thunder Basin, supra, at 212 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted); see also Free Enterprise\nFund, supra, at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 8\u201310).\n                             II\n   The CSRA was enacted to \u201cprovide the people of the\nUnited States with a competent, honest, and productive\nFederal work force reflective of the Nation\u2019s diversity, and\nto improve the quality of public service.\u201d \u00a73(1), 92 Stat.\n1112. To that end, the Act created an \u201cintegrated scheme\nof administrative and judicial review [of personnel ac-\ntions], designed to balance the legitimate interests of the\nvarious categories of federal employees with the needs of\nsound and efficient administration.\u201d United States v.\nFausto, 484 U. S. 439, 445 (1988).\n   Chapter 75 of Title 5 sets forth detailed procedures for\nadverse actions taken against certain covered employees\n\u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of the ser-\nvice.\u201d 5 U.

When an agency takes such an\naction, it must provide the employee with advance written\nnotice of the action and the specific reasons for it, give the\nemployee an opportunity to respond, allow the employee to\nbe represented by an attorney, and provide the employee\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwith a final written decision. See \u00a7\u00a77513(b)(1)\u2013(4). Fol-\nlowing these internal agency procedures, an aggrieved\nemployee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection\nBoard. \u00a77513(d).\n  The Board\u2019s mission is \u201cto ensure that Federal employ-\nees are protected against abuses by agency management,\nthat Executive branch agencies make employment deci-\nsions in accordance with the merit system principles, and\nthat Federal merit systems are kept free of prohibited\npersonnel practices.\u201d Merit Systems Protection Board, An\nIntroduction to the Merit Systems Protection Board 5\n(1999). The Board adjudicates employment disputes in\naccordance with applicable federal laws and regulations,\nincluding the \u201c[m]erit system principles\u201d and \u201c[p]rohibited\npersonnel principles\u201d identified in \u00a7\u00a72301, 2302. After\nthe Board renders a decision, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction\non appeal. See \u00a7\u00a77703(a)(1), (b)(1); 28 U. S. C. \u00a71295(a)(9).\n  The parties agree that petitioners are covered employees\nwho may file an appeal to the Board protesting their re-\nmoval from federal employment. The parties also agree,\nhowever, that the Board lacks authority to adjudicate\nclaims like those asserted by petitioners, which attack the\nvalidity of a federal statute as a facial matter. As this\nCourt has noted, \u201c[a]djudication of the constitutionality\nof congressional enactments has generally been thought\nbeyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d Thun-\nder Basin, supra, at 214 (alteration in original; inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). The Board itself has\nconsistently taken the position that it lacks \u201cauthority to\ndetermine the constitutionality of statutes.\u201d Malone v.\nDepartment of Justice, 14 MSPR 403, 406 (1983) (citing\nMontana Ch. of Assn. of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v.\nYoung, 514 F. 2d 1165, 1167 (CA9 1975)). Thus, the\nBoard\u2019s own self-described role in the administrative\nprocess is simply to apply the relevant statutes as written,\n6           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwithout addressing any facial challenges to the validity of\nthose statutes.\n                              III\n   There is no basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that\npetitioners must file their constitutional challenges be-\nfore the Board instead of a federal district court. Congress\nhas not expressly curtailed the jurisdiction of the federal\ncourts to consider facial constitutional claims relating to\nfederal employment, and no such limitation can be fairly\ndiscerned from the CSRA. Not only are petitioners\u2019 claims\n\u201cwholly collateral to [the CSRA\u2019s] review provisions and\noutside the agency\u2019s expertise,\u201d Thunder Basin, 510 U. S.,\nat 212 (internal quotation marks omitted), but the Board\nitself admits that it is completely powerless to consider the\nmerits of petitioners\u2019 arguments. In short, neither effi-\nciency nor agency expertise can explain why Congress\nwould want the Board to have exclusive jurisdiction over\nclaims like these. To the contrary, imposing a scheme of\nexclusive administrative review in this context breeds\ninefficiency and creates a procedural framework that is\nneedlessly vexing.\n                             A\n  Petitioners argue that registration for the military\ndraft violates the Equal Protection and Bill of Attainder\nClauses. These facial constitutional arguments are entirely\noutside the Board\u2019s power to decide, and they do not re-\nmotely implicate the Board\u2019s administrative expertise.\nThey have nothing to do with the statutory rules of federal\nemployment, and nothing to do with any application of the\n\u201cmerit system principles\u201d or the \u201cprohibited personnel\npractices\u201d that the Board administers.\n  Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims also have no relation\nto any of the facts that might be relevant to a proceeding\nbefore the Board. The Board typically addresses factual\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nissues pertaining to the specific circumstances in which\nemployee grievances arise. For example: Why was a\nparticular employee removed from federal employment?\nDoes the employer have a sound, nonprohibited basis for\nthe employment action in question? See, e.g., Davis v.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 106 MSPR 654, 657\u2013658\n(2007).\n   By contrast, petitioners\u2019 claims involve general factual\nissues pertaining to the facial constitutionality of the\nmilitary draft. The equal protection question is whether\nmen and women are sufficiently different to justify dispar-\nate treatment under the Selective Service Act. Rostker v.\nGoldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 78 (1981). The factual record that\npetitioners wish to develop would address issues of gender\ndifference that might be considered relevant to military\nservice. See Brief for Petitioners 48 (alleging that \u201cwom-\nen\u2019s role in the military has changed dramatically in the\npast thirty years\u201d). Likewise, under the Bill of Attainder\nClause, the key question is whether requiring draft regis-\ntration as a condition of federal employment amounts to\nthe singling out of a particular person or group for pun-\nishment without trial. See Nixon v. Administrator of\nGeneral Services, 433 U. S. 425, 468\u2013469. Whatever the\nrelevant facts may be on either claim, it is clear that they\ncan have no conceivable bearing on any matter the Board\nis authorized to address.\n                              B\n  Administrative agencies typically do not adjudicate\nfacial constitutional challenges to the laws that they ad-\nminister. Such challenges not only lie outside the realm of\nspecial agency expertise, but they are also wholly collat-\neral to other types of claims that the agency is empowered\nto consider. When \u201cthe administrative appeals process\ndoes not address the kind of . . . constitutional claims\u201d at\nissue, we cannot infer that Congress intended to \u201climit[t]\n8           ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\njudicial review of these claims to the procedures set forth\nin [the statutory scheme].\u201d McNary v. Haitian Refugee\nCenter, Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 493 (1991).\n   Several other cases confirm this basic principle. In Free\nEnterprise Fund, for example, the plaintiffs were not\nrequired to pursue their constitutional claims through the\nPublic Accounting Company Oversight Board, because\nthey were challenging the very existence of the Board it-\nself. 561 U. S., at ___ \u2013 ___ (slip op., at 8\u201310). Likewise,\nin Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 373\u2013374 (1974).\nWhere petitioners brought claims \u201cchallenging the consti-\ntutionality of laws providing benefits,\u201d the Court held that\nthese claims were not precluded by a statute creating\nexclusive administrative review over how those benefits\nwere administered. And in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S.\n319, 327\u2013332 (1976), we held that although a party chal-\nlenging the denial of statutory benefits was generally\nrequired to proceed through the statutory process of ad-\nministrative review, a constitutional challenge to the ad-\nministrative process itself could still be brought directly\nin federal court.\n   The present case follows the same pattern: Petitioners\nare challenging the facial validity of a law that the Board\nis bound to apply to them, and so it makes little sense for\nthem to seek review before the Board.\n   The wholly collateral nature of petitioners\u2019 claims\nmakes them readily distinguishable from claims that this\nCourt has held to be impliedly excluded from the original\njurisdiction of the federal courts. In Fausto, for example,\nwe held that the CSRA precluded a statutory Back Pay\nAct claim involving a dispute over whether an employee\nhad engaged in unauthorized use of a Government vehicle.\n484 U. S., at 455. The plaintiff in that case did not chal-\nlenge the constitutional validity of the applicable legal\nframework, but argued instead that the framework had\nbeen improperly applied to him. He argued that he had\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbeen wrongfully suspended from work, and that he was\nentitled to backpay as a result. Id., at 440. For that type\nof fact-specific personnel dispute, we determined, Con-\ngress had intended for the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive admin-\nistrative scheme to provide the exclusive avenue of relief.\nId., at 455.\n   Similarly, in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367 (1983), we\ndeclined to allow a claim under Bivens v. Six Unknown\nFed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), brought by an\nemployee seeking money damages for an alleged \u201cretalia-\ntory demotion or discharge because he ha[d] exercised his\nFirst Amendment rights.\u201d 462 U. S., at 381. Although\nthe claim was constitutional in nature, we noted that it\n\u201car[o]se out of an employment relationship that is gov-\nerned by comprehensive procedural and substantive provi-\nsions\u201d that had been enacted by Congress. Id., at 368.\nThe employee was pursuing an as-applied challenge that\ndepended on the case-specific facts of why he had been\nfired. The gravamen of the employee\u2019s claim was that he\nhad been \u201cunfairly disciplined for making critical com-\nments about [his agency].\u201d Id., at 386. Under the statu-\ntory scheme that Congress had created, the employee could\nhave pursued a very similar statutory claim for wrongful\nremoval within the administrative process. Id., at 386\u2013\n388. Under these circumstances, we found that Congress\ndid not intend to allow a duplicative nonstatutory claim\nfor damages based on the same set of underlying facts.\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s reliance on Thunder Basin is\nentirely misplaced. See ante, at 13. In that case, we\nfound that a statutory scheme impliedly precluded a\npre-enforcement challenge brought by a mining company\nseeking to enjoin an order issued by the Mine Safety and\nHealth Administration. 510 U. S., at 205. Importantly,\nthe plaintiff company was seeking review of purely statu-\ntory claims that were reviewable in the first instance by\nthe administrative commission that Congress had estab-\n10            ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlished. The only constitutional issue was a matter of\ntiming: The company argued that it had a due process\nright to immediate judicial review of its statutory claims,\nbecause it would suffer irreparable harm if it were forced\nto wait until after the agency initiated an enforcement\naction. Ibid. The Court disagreed, holding that the statu-\ntory scheme was \u201cconsistent with due process\u201d even\nthough it provided for only postenforcement review. Id.,\nat 218. Thus, the Court rejected the company\u2019s constitu-\ntional claim \u201cnot on preclusion grounds but on the merits.\u201d\nId., at 219 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). The heart of the preclusion analysis was\nthat the company could not use a preenforcement chal-\nlenge to obtain judicial review of statutory claims that\nCongress had clearly intended to channel into administra-\ntive review.*\n                          C\n  By requiring facial constitutional claims to be filed\nbefore the Board, the majority\u2019s holding sets up an odd\nsequence of procedural hoops for petitioners to jump\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The majority contends that the petitioner in Thunder Basin really\nhad two distinct constitutional claims. The primary constitutional\nclaim was a \u201cdue process challenge to a statute that permitted a regula-\ntory agency, before a hearing, to immediately fine the petitioner for\nnoncompliance with the statute.\u201d Ante, at 14, n. 6. On top of this,\naccording to the majority, the petitioner also had a separate constitu-\ntional claim, which asserted that precluding initial judicial review of\nthe first constitutional claim would violate due process. In the major-\nity\u2019s view, only the latter claim was rejected on the merits. But this\nhairsplitting makes no difference. The entire thrust of the petitioner\u2019s\nconstitutional argument was simply that proceeding through the stat-\nutory scheme would make meaningful judicial review impossible.\nThe Court rejected that argument, effectively disposing of any constitu-\ntional infirmity that the petitioner alleged. Unlike in the present case,\nthere was no freestanding constitutional claim attacking the validity\nof the statutory framework on substantive rather than procedural\ngrounds.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthrough. As the Government concedes, the Board is pow-\nerless to adjudicate facial constitutional claims, and so\nthese claims cannot be addressed on the merits until they\nreach the Federal Circuit on appeal. As a result, the\nFederal Circuit will be forced to address the claims in the\nfirst instance, without the benefit of any relevant factfind-\ning at the administrative level. This is a strange result,\nbecause \u201cstatutes that provide for only a single level of\njudicial review in the courts of appeals are traditionally\nviewed as warranted only in circumstances where district\ncourt factfinding would unnecessarily duplicate an ade-\nquate administrative record.\u201d McNary, 498 U. S., at 497\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Government admits that the absence of first-tier\nfactfinding might very well result in \u201cthe initial record\u201d\nbeing \u201cinsufficient to permit meaningful consideration of\na constitutional claim,\u201d but suggests that the court could\nalways \u201cremand the case to the [Board] for further factual\ndevelopment.\u201d Brief for Respondents 41. The majority\naccepts this solution, ante, at 15, but it is hard to see how\nit will work in practice. Without any authority to decide\nmerits issues, the Board may find it difficult to adjudicate\ndisputes about the relevancy of evidence sought in discov-\nery. Nor will the Board find it easy to figure out which\nfacts it must find before sending the case back to the\nFederal Circuit.\n   Even if these problems can be overcome, that will not\nresolve the needless complexity of the majority\u2019s approach.\nAccording to the majority, petitioners should file their\nclaims with the Board, which must then kick the claims\nup to the Federal Circuit, which must then remand the\nclaims back to the Board, which must then develop the\nrecord and send the case back to the Federal Circuit,\nwhich can only then consider the constitutional issues.\n   To be sure, this might be sufficient to afford \u201cmeaningful\nreview\u201d of petitioners\u2019 claims, ante, at 16\u201317, but that is\n12          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nnot the only consideration. The question is whether it\nis \u201cfairly discernible\u201d that Congress intended to impose\nthese pinball procedural requirements instead of permitting\npetitioners\u2019 claims to be decided in a regular lawsuit in\nfederal district court. And why would it? As already\nnoted, the benefits of preventing claim-splitting are con-\nsiderably reduced with respect to facial constitutional\nclaims that are wholly collateral to an administrative\nproceeding. Because collateral constitutional claims have\nno overlap with the issues of law and fact that will pertain\nto the administrative proceeding, allowing the constitu-\ntional claims to be adjudicated separately before a district\ncourt does not invite wasteful or duplicative review. It\nsimply allows the district court to develop the factual\nrecord and then provide a first-tier legal analysis, thereby\nenhancing both the quality and efficiency of appellate\nreview.\n   To the extent that there is some need to prevent claim-\nsplitting, that purpose is already served by ordinary prin-\nciples of claim preclusion. Plaintiffs generally must bring\nall claims arising out of a common set of facts in a single\nlawsuit, and federal district courts have discretion to\nenforce that requirement as necessary \u201cto avoid duplica-\ntive litigation.\u201d Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.\nv. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817 (1976); Stone v. De-\npartment of Aviation, 453 F. 3d 1271, 1278 (CA10 2006)\n(\u201cA plaintiff \u2019s obligation to bring all related claims together\nin the same action arises under the common-law rule of\nclaim preclusion prohibiting the splitting of actions\u201d). See\nalso 18 C.

Thus, if an\naggrieved employee goes to a district court with claims\nthat would duplicate the factfinding or legal analysis of a\nseparate Board proceeding, the district court would be free\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto dismiss the case.\n   The majority suggests that its approach will allow the\nBoard to resolve some cases on nonconstitutional grounds,\nthus avoiding needless adjudication of constitutional is-\nsues. See ante, at 18. But achieving that goal does not\nrequire the blunt instrument of jurisdictional preclusion.\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to manage their\ndockets, including the power to refrain from reviewing a\nconstitutional claim pending adjudication of a nonconsti-\ntutional claim that might moot the case. See Kerotest Mfg.\nCo. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U. S. 180, 183\n(1952) (acknowledging the equitable discretion of courts,\nin furtherance of \u201c[w]ise judicial administration\u201d and\n\u201cconservation of judicial resources,\u201d to stay proceedings to\nprevent \u201ctwo litigations where one will suffice\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). In short, the district courts\nare well equipped to guard against piecemeal litigation\nwithout any help from the majority\u2019s holding.\n   Finally, the majority contends that channeling facial\nconstitutional claims through the Board is necessary to\nprovide \u201cclear guidance about the proper forum for the\nemployee\u2019s claims at the outset of the case.\u201d Ante, at 11.\nBecause it can be hard to tell the difference between facial\nand as-applied challenges, the majority argues, it is less\nconfusing simply to require that all claims must be\nbrought before the Board. This is a red herring. Labels\naside, the most sensible rule would be to allow initial\njudicial review of constitutional claims that attack the\nvalidity of a statute based on its inherent characteristics,\nnot as a result of how the statute has been applied. That\nline is bright enough, and the distinction is already one\nthat the Board must draw based on its own determination\nthat it can hear some as-applied challenges but lacks\n\u201cauthority to determine the constitutionality of statutes.\u201d\nMalone, 14 MSPR, at 406.\n14          ELGIN v. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY \n\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                             IV \n\n  The presumptive power of the federal courts to hear\nconstitutional challenges is well established. In this case,\nhowever, the majority relies on a very weak set of infer-\nences to strip the courts of their original jurisdiction over\npetitioners\u2019 claims. Because I believe Congress would\nhave been very surprised to learn that it implied this\nresult when it passed the CSRA, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
