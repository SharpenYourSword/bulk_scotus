TUCKER, SECRETARY, FLORIDA \n\n     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 11\u20137185. Decided June 18, 2012\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Petitioner William Fairey was tried in absentia and\nwithout counsel on state felony charges. Although Fairey\nhad not received actual notice of his trial date, the state\ncourt concluded that he had waived his right to be present\nwhen he failed to appear in court on the scheduled trial\ndate. The State tried Fairey in his absence and, without\nhaving heard any defense, the jury found Fairey guilty.\nThe court sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment and\n$25,000 in restitution. Fairey sought relief on the ground\nthat his trial in absentia violated the Sixth and Four-\nteenth Amendments. After exhausting state remedies, he\nfiled a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus. The\nDistrict Court denied relief. Both the District Court and\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\ndenied a certificate of appealability (COA).\n   I believe a COA should have issued; at the very least,\n\u201cthe issues presented are adequate to deserve encourage-\nment to proceed further.\u201d Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S.\n322, 327 (2003). An accused\u2019s right to be present at his\nown trial is among the most fundamental rights our Con-\nstitution secures. In view of the importance of the right\ninvolved and the obvious error here, I would grant the\npetition for a writ of certiorari and summarily reverse the\njudgment below.\n2                   FAIREY v. TUCKER\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n   In early 1998, South Carolina served Fairey with an\narrest warrant for obtaining goods and moneys under\nfalse pretenses, a state felony. Fairey was released on his\npersonal recognizance and the State dismissed the war-\nrant. Some time later, Fairey moved from South Carolina\nto Sarasota, Florida. In 2001, South Carolina indicted\nFairey for the charge underlying the warrant. Fairey\nproceeded pro se and defended himself actively. He filed\nmotions, sought the discovery of documents, and corre-\nsponded with the court. Twice he traveled from Florida to\nSouth Carolina for proceedings.\n   In the fall of 2002, Fairey informed the state solicitor\n(hereinafter Solicitor) and the trial court of his new ad-\ndress in Castiac, California. Several months later, Fairey\nmoved to quash his indictment. In that submission, he\nlisted both the California and Florida addresses, the lat-\nter now denoted as a \u201ctemporary address.\u201d Record in No.\n4:09\u2013cv\u201301610\u2013RMG (D SC), Doc. 19, p. 160 (Exh. 10).\nFairey explained: \u201cBeginning February 23, I have been\nliving temporarily in Sarasota, Florida, awaiting my next\n[work] assignment and my return to California.\u201d Id., at\n171. He attended the hearing on his motion in March, and\nthere submitted a motion to dismiss and an accompanying\naffidavit. Both listed only his Florida address. The trial\ncourt denied Fairey\u2019s motion to quash and sent notice of\nits ruling to the Florida address alone. The Solicitor\nsubsequently sent at least one letter to that address.\nSome 15 months later, the trial court denied Fairey\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Notice again was sent only to Florida.\n   In June 2004, the Solicitor subpoenaed Fairey to appear\nfor trial in South Carolina the following month. Although\nFairey\u2019s most recent filing had listed only his Florida\naddress, and both the trial court and Solicitor most re-\ncently had sent correspondence to that address alone, the\nSolicitor mailed the subpoena to two different addresses:\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe California address, and a South Carolina address\nlisted on Fairey\u2019s 1998 personal recognizance bond form.\nIt is undisputed that Fairey did not receive the subpoena.\nUnaware of his trial date, he did not appear at trial. The\nState tried him in his absence, and the jury found him\nguilty after less than 30 minutes of deliberation.\n   When it came time to arrest Fairey, the State had no\ntrouble locating him in Florida. After he was incarcerated,\nFairey moved for a new trial. The trial court denied the\nmotion and the South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.\nThe court acknowledged that the Sixth Amendment guar-\nantees the right of an accused to be present at every stage\nof his trial. 374 S. C. 92, 98\u201399, 646 S. E. 2d 445, 448\n(2007). But the court concluded that Fairey had waived\nthis right because (1) notice of his trial date was sent to\nhis California address, which was the \u201cpermanent address\nfor service of notice\u201d in the record; and (2) Fairey had been\nwarned on his 1998 personal recognizance bond form that\ntrial would proceed in his absence if he did not attend. Id.,\nat 99\u2013103, 646 S. E. 2d, at 448\u2013450. After exhausting his\nstate remedies, Fairey petitioned the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of South Carolina for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. The District Court denied relief, largely\nadopting the reasoning of the State Court of Appeals. The\nDistrict Court and United States Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit denied a COA. See 441 Fed. Appx. 160\n(2011). Fairey, proceeding pro se, petitioned for a writ of\ncertiorari.\n                            II\n  It is a basic premise of our justice system that \u201cin a\nprosecution for a felony the defendant has the privilege\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to be present in his\nown person whenever his presence has a relation, reason-\nably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to\ndefend against the charge.\u201d Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291\n4                     FAIREY v. TUCKER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 97, 105\u2013106 (1934). This longstanding right reflects\nthe \u201cnotion that a fair trial [can] take place only if the\njurors me[e]t the defendant face-to-face and only if those\ntestifying against the defendant [do] so in his presence.\u201d\nCrosby v. United States, 506 U. S. 255, 259 (1993); see also\nibid. (\u201c \u2018It is well settled that . . . at common law the per-\nsonal presence of the defendant is essential to a valid trial\nand conviction on a charge of felony.\u2019 \u201d (quoting W. Mikell,\nClark\u2019s Criminal Procedure 492 (2d ed. 1918) (hereinafter\nMikell))); Diaz v. United States, 223 U. S. 442, 455 (1912)\n(right to be present is \u201cscarcely less important to the ac-\ncused than the right of trial itself \u201d). Thus in general, \u201cif\n[the defendant] is absent [from trial], . . . a conviction will\nbe set aside.\u201d Crosby, 506 U. S., at 259 (quoting Mikell\n492).\n   The Court has acknowledged only two exceptions to this\ngeneral rule. First, at least in noncapital trials, a defend-\nant may waive his right to be present \u201c \u2018if, after the trial\nhas begun in his presence, he voluntarily absents him-\nself.\u2019 \u201d Crosby, 506 U. S., at 260 (quoting Diaz, 223 U. S.,\nat 455). Second, \u201ca defendant can lose his right to be\npresent at trial if, after being warned that he will be re-\nmoved if he continues his disruptive behavior, he never-\ntheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so\ndisorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that\nhis trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\u201d\nIllinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 343 (1970). This case, of\ncourse, does not fall within either exception. Rather, the\nstate court conceived an additional exception, one never\nrecognized by this Court: waiver on the basis of a defend-\nant\u2019s actions prior to the start of trial. And the state court\nwent on to conclude that Fairey\u2019s actions established such\nwaiver on the basis of two facts: the Solicitor mailed\na subpoena to Fairey\u2019s California address and Fairey\nacknowledged in his 1998 personal recognizance bond\nform that trial could proceed in his absence if he failed to\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nattend.\n   Whether the Constitution permits the trial in absentia\nof a defendant who is not present at the start of trial is a\nserious question. It is one we expressly left open in Crosby,\nthough not without noting that there are good reasons\nfor distinguishing in this context between a defendant who\nwas present at the start of trial and one who was not\npresent at all. We observed that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s initial\npresence serves to assure that any waiver [of the right to\nbe present] is indeed knowing.\u201d 506 U. S., at 261\u2013262.\nAnd we noted that \u201cthe costs of suspending a proceeding\nalready under way will be greater than the cost of post-\nponing a trial not yet begun,\u201d and so \u201c[i]f a clear line is to\nbe drawn marking the point at which the costs of delay are\nlikely to outweigh the interests of the defendant and\nsociety in having the defendant present, the commence-\nment of trial is at least a plausible place at which to draw\nthat line.\u201d Id., at 261.\n   Even assuming that a waiver of the right to be present\nat trial could ever be found when the defendant was not\ninitially present, the facts here do not remotely demon-\nstrate such a waiver. Our cases clearly establish that\n\u201cwaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment\nof a known right.\u201d United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725,\n733 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). A defend-\nant\u2019s waiver of a fundamental constitutional right is not to\nbe lightly presumed; rather, a court must \u201cindulge every\nreasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental\nconstitutional rights.\u201d Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506,\n514 (1962) (internal quotation marks omitted). It was not\nreasonable for the state court to conclude that Fairey\nintentionally abandoned his right to be present.\n   As a pro se litigant, Fairey represented himself actively\nin pretrial proceedings; he made two interstate trips to do\nso and demonstrated every intention of mounting a vigor-\nous defense at trial. To be sure, he did not appear in court\n6                    FAIREY v. TUCKER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\non his scheduled trial date. And he was informed on his\nbail recognizance form that trial could proceed in his ab-\nsence if he was not present. But the form did not specify\nhis trial date, and Fairey had no knowledge of that date\nas he did not receive the Solicitor\u2019s notice, which was sent\nto California and not to Fairey\u2019s most recent address in\nFlorida. There is no suggestion, moreover, that Fairey\nwas derelict in his duty to monitor the docket or to keep\nthe State informed of his whereabouts. His most recent\nmotion to the court provided only his Florida address. An\naffidavit submitted two weeks earlier stated that he was\npresently living in Florida. And Fairey had been contacted\nat his Florida address by both the Solicitor and court\nafter that date. Until he informed the court that he had\nreturned to California or moved elsewhere, he was justi-\nfied in believing the State would continue to contact him\nat his Florida address. In short, while Fairey failed to\nappear in court on the date of his scheduled trial, his\nfailure to do so was wholly inadvertent. Consequently, his\nabsence does not demonstrate the intent necessary to\nestablish waiver under our established case law.\n   I believe a COA should have issued and that our inter-\nvention is warranted. A trial conducted without actual\nnotice to a defendant and in his absence makes a mockery\nof fair process and the constitutional right to be present at\ntrial. That is particularly true where, as here, the defend-\nant participated actively in his defense and kept the State\ninformed of his whereabouts. I would grant the petition\nand summarily reverse the judgment below.\n",

There is no suggestion, moreover, that Fairey\nwas derelict in his duty to monitor the docket or to keep\nthe State informed of his whereabouts. His most recent\nmotion to the court provided only his Florida address. An\naffidavit submitted two weeks earlier stated that he was\npresently living in Florida. And Fairey had been contacted\nat his Florida address by both the Solicitor and court\nafter that date. Until he informed the court that he had\nreturned to California or moved elsewhere, he was justi-\nfied in believing the State would continue to contact him\nat his Florida address. In short, while Fairey failed to\nappear in court on the date of his scheduled trial, his\nfailure to do so was wholly inadvertent. Consequently, his\nabsence does not demonstrate the intent necessary to\nestablish waiver under our established case law.\n   I believe a COA should have issued and that our inter-\nvention is warranted. A trial conducted without actual\nnotice to a defendant and in his absence makes a mockery\nof fair process and the constitutional right to be present at\ntrial. That is particularly true where, as here, the defend-\nant participated actively in his defense and kept the State\ninformed of his whereabouts. I would grant the petition\nand summarily reverse the judgment below.\n</pre>",
