Argued April 18, 2012\u2014Decided June 18, 2012\nThe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA)\n  directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with will-\n  ing tribes under which they will provide services such as education\n  and law enforcement that the Federal Government otherwise would\n  have provided. It requires the Secretary to contract to pay the \u201cfull\n  amount\u201d of \u201ccontract support costs,\u201d 45 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2), (g),\n  subject to the availability of appropriations, \u00a7450j\u20131(b). In the event\n  of a contractual breach, tribal contractors are entitled to seek money\n  damages under the Contract Disputes Act.\n    In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent Tribes contracted\n  with the Secretary to provide services. During each of those FYs,\n  Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay any individual tribal\n  contractor\u2019s contract support costs in full but did not appropriate\n  enough to pay all tribal contractors collectively. Unable to pay every\n  contractor in full, the Secretary paid the Tribes on a uniform,\n  pro rata basis. Respondents sued under the Contract Disputes Act\n  for breach of contract. The District Court granted the Government\n  summary judgment. The Tenth Circuit reversed, finding the Gov-\n  ernment liable to each contractor for the full contract amount.\nHeld: The Government must pay each Tribe\u2019s contract support costs in\n full. Pp. 5\u221218.\n    (a) In Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 543 U. S. 631, this Court\n considered the Government\u2019s promise to pay contract support costs in\n ISDA self-determination contracts that made the Government\u2019s obli-\n gation \u201csubject to the availability of appropriations,\u201d id., at 634\u2212637.\n The Government contended that Congress appropriated inadequate\n funds to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Tribes, while meeting\n2               SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the agency\u2019s competing fiscal priorities. Because Congress appropri-\n    ated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts, howev-\n    er, the Court held that the Government was obligated to pay those\n    costs in full absent \u201csomething special about the promises,\u201d id., at\n    637\u2013638.\n       That conclusion followed directly from well-established principles\n    of Government contracting law: When a Government contractor is\n    one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation suffi-\n    cient in itself to pay the contractor, the Government is responsible to\n    the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the\n    agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible\n    ends. See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546. That is so\n    \u201ceven if an agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to\n    pay all\u201d of its contracts. Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. This\n    principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors\n    and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States. Contractors\n    need not keep track of agencies\u2019 shifting priorities and competing ob-\n    ligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its\n    contractual promises. And the rule furthers \u201cthe Government\u2019s own\n    long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad\n    workaday transaction of its agencies.\u201d United States v. Winstar\n    Corp., 518 U. S. 839, 883. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris control\n    here. Once \u201cCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted\n    funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot\n    back out of a promise on grounds of \u2018insufficient appropriations,\u2019 even\n    if the contract uses language such as \u2018subject to the availability of\n    appropriations,\u2019 and even if an agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation\n    is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d Chero-\n    kee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. That condition is satisfied here, be-\n    cause Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual\n    contractor in full. Pp. 8\u221210.\n       (c) The Government attempts to distinguish Ferris and Cherokee\n    Nation on the ground that they involved unrestricted, lump-sum ap-\n    propriations, while Congress here appropriated \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a cer-\n    tain amount for contract support costs. The effect of the appropria-\n    tions in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free\n    to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts\n    served the purpose Congress identified. The \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language\n    still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming\n    other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds\n    that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs pro-\n    grams.\n       Section 450j\u20131(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to reduce funding for one tribe\u2019s programs to make funds available to\n  another tribe, does not warrant a different result. Consistent with\n  ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely\n  underscores the Secretary\u2019s discretion to allocate funds among tribes.\n  It does not alter the Government\u2019s legal obligation when the Secre-\n  tary fails to pay.\n     The Government\u2019s remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.\n  First, it suggests that the Secretary could violate the Anti-Deficiency\n  Act, which prevents federal officers from making or authorizing an\n  expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an ap-\n  propriation. That Act applies only to government officials, however,\n  and does not affect the rights of citizens contracting with the Gov-\n  ernment. Second, the Government argues that permitting respond-\n  ents to recover from the Judgment Fund would circumvent Congress\u2019\n  intent to cap total expenditures for contract support costs. But ISDA\n  expressly provides that tribal contractors may sue for \u201cmoney dam-\n  ages\u201d under the Contract Disputes Act, and any ensuing judgments\n  are payable from the Judgment Fund. See Cherokee Nation, 543\n  U. S., at 642. Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts\n  have rejected contractors\u2019 attempts to recover for amounts beyond the\n  maximum appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. See,\n  e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575. However, Sutton in-\n  volved a specific line-item appropriation for an amount beyond which\n  the sole contractor could not recover. This case involves several con-\n  tractors, each of whom contracted within the lump-sum amount Con-\n  gress appropriated for all contractors. Unlike the sole contractor in\n  Sutton, they cannot reasonably be expected to know how much re-\n  mained available of Congress\u2019 lump-sum appropriation. Finally, the\n  Government claims that legislative history suggests that Congress\n  approved of pro rata distribution, but \u201cindicia in committee reports\n  and other legislative history as to how funds should or are expected\n  to be spent do not establish any legal requirement on the agency.\u201d\n  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 192. Pp. 11\u221217.\n     (d) This case is the product of two decisions in some tension: Con-\n  gress required the Secretary to accept every qualifying ISDA con-\n  tract, promising \u201cfull\u201d funding for all contract support costs, but then\n  appropriated insufficient funds to pay in full each tribal contractor.\n  Responsibility for the resolution of that situation, however, is com-\n  mitted to Congress.

SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,\n\n     ET AL., PETITIONERS v. RAMAH NAVAJO \n\n                 CHAPTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 18, 2012] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis-\ntance Act (ISDA), 25 U. S. C. \u00a7450 et seq., directs the\nSecretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with will-\ning tribes, pursuant to which those tribes will provide\nservices such as education and law enforcement that\notherwise would have been provided by the Federal Gov-\nernment. ISDA mandates that the Secretary shall pay\nthe full amount of \u201ccontract support costs\u201d incurred by\ntribes in performing their contracts. At issue in this case\nis whether the Government must pay those costs when\nCongress appropriates sufficient funds to pay in full any\nindividual contractor\u2019s contract support costs, but not\nenough funds to cover the aggregate amount due every\ncontractor. Consistent with longstanding principles of\nGovernment contracting law, we hold that the Govern-\nment must pay each tribe\u2019s contract support costs in full.\n                         I\n                        A\n  Congress enacted ISDA in 1975 in order to achieve\n2             SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cmaximum Indian participation in the direction of educa-\ntional as well as other Federal services to Indian commu-\nnities so as to render such services more responsive to the\nneeds and desires of those communities.\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7450a(a). To that end, the Act directs the Secretary of the\nInterior, \u201cupon the request of any Indian tribe . . . to enter\ninto a self-determination contract . . . to plan, conduct, and\nadminister\u201d health, education, economic, and social pro-\ngrams that the Secretary otherwise would have adminis-\ntered. \u00a7450f(a)(1).\n   As originally enacted, ISDA required the Government to\nprovide contracting tribes with an amount of funds equiv-\nalent to those that the Secretary \u201cwould have other-\nwise provided for his direct operation of the programs.\u201d\n\u00a7106(h), 88 Stat. 2211. It soon became apparent that this\nsecretarial amount failed to account for the full costs to\ntribes of providing services. Because of \u201cconcern with\nGovernment\u2019s past failure adequately to reimburse tribes\u2019\nindirect administrative costs,\u201d Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.\nLeavitt, 543 U. S. 631, 639 (2005), Congress amended\nISDA to require the Secretary to contract to pay the \u201cfull\namount\u201d of \u201ccontract support costs\u201d related to each self-\ndetermination contract, \u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2), (g).1 The Act also\nprovides, however, that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other\nprovision in [ISDA], the provision of funds under [ISDA] is\nsubject to the availability of appropriations.\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(b).\n   Congress included a model contract in ISDA and di-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As defined by ISDA, contract support costs \u201cshall consist of an\n\namount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on\nby a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the\nterms of the contract and prudent management, but which . . . (A)\nnormally are not carried on by the respective Secretary in his direct\noperation of the program; or (B) are provided by the Secretary in\nsupport of the contracted program from resources other than those\nunder contract.\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2). Such costs include overhead adminis-\ntrative costs, as well as expenses such as federally mandated audits\nand liability insurance. See Cherokee Nation of Okla., 543 U. S., at 635.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

That\namount \u201c \u2018shall not be less than the applicable amount\ndetermined pursuant to [\u00a7450j\u20131(a)],\u2019 \u201d which includes\ncontract support costs. Ibid.; \u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2). The contract\nindicates that \u201c \u2018[e]ach provision of [ISDA] and each provi-\nsion of this Contract shall be liberally construed for the\nbenefit of the Contractor . . . .\u2019 \u201d \u00a7450l(c), (model agree-\nment \u00a71(a)(2)). Finally, the Act makes clear that if\nthe Government fails to pay the amount contracted for,\nthen tribal contractors are entitled to pursue \u201cmoney dam-\nages\u201d in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act.\n\u00a7450m\u20131(a).\n                            B\n   During Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent\nTribes contracted with the Secretary of the Interior to\nprovide services such as law enforcement, environmental\nprotection, and agricultural assistance. The Tribes fully\nperformed. During each FY, Congress appropriated a\ntotal amount to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \u201cfor the\noperation of Indian programs.\u201d See, e.g., Department of\nthe Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,\n2000, 113 Stat. 1501A\u2013148. Of that sum, Congress pro-\nvided that \u201cnot to exceed [a particular amount] shall be\navailable for payments to tribes and tribal organiza-\ntions for contract support costs\u201d under ISDA. E.g., ibid.\nThus, in FY 2000, for example, Congress appropriated\n$1,670,444,000 to the BIA, of which \u201cnot to exceed\n$120,229,000\u201d was allocated for contract support costs.\nIbid.\n4           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   During each relevant FY, Congress appropriated suffi-\ncient funds to pay in full any individual tribal contractor\u2019s\ncontract support costs. Congress did not, however, appro-\npriate sufficient funds to cover the contract support costs\ndue all tribal contractors collectively. Between FY 1994\nand 2001, appropriations covered only between 77% and\n92% of tribes\u2019 aggregate contract support costs. The ex-\ntent of the shortfall was not revealed until each fiscal year\nwas well underway, at which point a tribe\u2019s performance\nof its contractual obligations was largely complete. See\n644 F. 3d 1054, 1061 (CA10 2011). Lacking funds to pay\neach contractor in full, the Secretary paid tribes\u2019 contract\nsupport costs on a uniform, pro rata basis. Tribes re-\nsponded to these shortfalls by reducing ISDA services to\ntribal members, diverting tribal resources from non-ISDA\nprograms, and forgoing opportunities to contract in fur-\ntherance of Congress\u2019 self-determination objective. GAO,\nV. Rezendes, Indian Self-Determination Act: Shortfalls in\nIndian Contract Support Costs Need to Be Addressed 3\u20134\n(GAO/RCED\u201399\u2013150, 2009).\n   Respondent Tribes sued for breach of contract pursuant\nto the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7601\u2013613, alleg-\ning that the Government failed to pay the full amount of\ncontract support costs due from FY 1994 through 2001,\nas required by ISDA and their contracts. The United\nStates District Court for the District of New Mexico granted\nsummary judgment for the Government. A divided panel\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir-\ncuit reversed. The court reasoned that Congress made\nsufficient appropriations \u201clegally available\u201d to fund any\nindividual tribal contractor\u2019s contract support costs, and\nthat the Government\u2019s contractual commitment was there-\nfore binding. 644 F. 3d, at 1063\u20131065. In such cases, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the Government is liable to\neach contractor for the full contract amount. Judge Hartz\ndissented, contending that Congress intended to set a\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

We granted certiorari to resolve a split\namong the Courts of Appeals, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), and\nnow affirm.2\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   In evaluating the Government\u2019s obligation to pay tribes\nfor contract support costs, we do not write on a clean slate.\nOnly seven years ago, in Cherokee Nation, we also con-\nsidered the Government\u2019s promise to pay contract sup-\nport costs in ISDA self-determination contracts that made\nthe Government\u2019s obligation \u201csubject to the availability of\nappropriations.\u201d 543 U. S., at 634\u2013637. For each FY at\nissue, Congress had appropriated to the Indian Health\nService (IHS) a lump sum between $1.277 and $1.419\nbillion, \u201cfar more than the [contract support cost]\namounts\u201d due under the Tribes\u2019 individual contracts. Id.,\nat 637; see id., at 636 (Cherokee Nation and Shoshone-\nPaiute Tribes filed claims seeking $3.4 and $3.5 million,\nrespectively). The Government contended, however, that\nCongress had appropriated inadequate funds to enable the\nIHS to pay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in full, while\nmeeting all of the agency\u2019s competing fiscal priorities.\n   As we explained, that did not excuse the Government\u2019s\nresponsibility to pay the Tribes. We stressed that the\nGovernment\u2019s obligation to pay contract support costs\nshould be treated as an ordinary contract promise, noting\nthat ISDA \u201cuses the word \u2018contract\u2019 426 times to describe\nthe nature of the Government\u2019s promise.\u201d Id., at 639. As\neven the Government conceded, \u201cin the case of ordinary\ncontracts . . . \u2018if the amount of an unrestricted appropria-\ntion is sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare 644 F. 3d 1054 (case below), with Arctic Slope Native\n\nAssn., Ltd. v. Sebelius, 629 F. 3d 1296 (CA Fed. 2010) (no liability to\npay total contract support costs beyond cap in appropriations Act).\n6                 SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to payment even if the agency has allocated\nthe funds to another purpose or assumes other obligations\nthat exhaust the funds.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641. It followed, there-\nfore, that absent \u201csomething special about the promises at\nissue,\u201d the Government was obligated to pay the Tribes\u2019\ncontract support costs in full. Id., at 638.\n   We held that the mere fact that ISDA self-determination\ncontracts are made \u201csubject to the availability of appropri-\nations\u201d did not warrant a special rule. Id., at 643 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That commonplace provision,\nwe explained, is ordinarily satisfied so long as Congress\nappropriates adequate legally unrestricted funds to pay\nthe contracts at issue. See ibid. Because Congress made\nsufficient funds legally available to the agency to pay the\nTribes\u2019 contracts, it did not matter that the BIA had allo-\ncated some of those funds to serve other purposes, such\nthat the remainder was insufficient to pay the Tribes in\nfull. Rather, we agreed with the Tribes that \u201cas long as\nCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted\nfunds to pay the contracts at issue,\u201d the Government\u2019s\npromise to pay was binding. Id., at 637\u2013638.\n   Our conclusion in Cherokee Nation followed directly\nfrom well-established principles of Government contract-\ning law. When a Government contractor is one of several\npersons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient\nin itself to pay the contractor, it has long been the rule\nthat the Government is responsible to the contractor for\nthe full amount due under the contract, even if the agency\nexhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible\nends. See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546\n(1892); Dougherty v. United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 496, 503\n(1883); see also 2 GAO, Principles of Federal Appropria-\ntions Law, p. 6\u201317 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter GAO\nRedbook).3 That is so \u201ceven if an agency\u2019s total lump-sum\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 In   Ferris, for instance, Congress appropriated $45,000 for the im-\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 637.\nIn such cases, \u201c[t]he United States are as much bound by\ntheir contracts as are individuals.\u201d Lynch v. United\nStates, 292 U. S. 571, 580 (1934) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Although the agency itself cannot dis-\nburse funds beyond those appropriated to it, the Govern-\nment\u2019s \u201cvalid obligations will remain enforceable in the\ncourts.\u201d GAO Redbook, p. 6\u201317.\n  This principle safeguards both the expectations of Gov-\nernment contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of\nthe United States. For contractors, the Ferris rule reflects\nthat when \u201ca contract is but one activity under a larger\nappropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the contractor\nto know how much of that appropriation remains available\nfor it at any given time.\u201d GAO Redbook, p. 6\u201318. Contrac-\ntors are responsible for knowing the size of the pie, not\nhow the agency elects to slice it. Thus, so long as Con-\ngress appropriates adequate funds to cover a prospective\ncontract, contractors need not keep track of agencies\u2019\nshifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they\nmay trust that the Government will honor its contractual\npromises. Dougherty, 18 Ct. Cl., at 503. In such cases, if\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprovement of the Delaware River below Bridesburg, Pennsylvania. Act\nof Mar. 3, 1879, ch. 181, 20 Stat. 364. The Government contracted with\nFerris for $37,000 to dredge the river. Halfway through Ferris\u2019 perfor-\nmance of his contract, the United States Army Corps of Engineers ran\nout of money to pay Ferris, having used $17,000 of the appropriation to\npay for other improvements. Nonetheless, the Court of Claims found\nthat Ferris could recover for the balance of his contract. As the court\nexplained, the appropriation \u201cmerely impose[d] limitations upon the\nGovernment\u2019s own agents; . . . its insufficiency [did] not pay the Gov-\nernment\u2019s debts, nor cancel its obligations, nor defeat the rights of\nother parties.\u201d 27 Ct. Cl., at 546; see also Dougherty, 18 Ct. Cl., at 503\n(rejecting Government\u2019s argument that a contractor could not recover\nupon similar facts because the \u201cappropriation had, at the time of the\npurchase, been covered by other contracts\u201d).\n8          SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan agency overcommits its funds such that it cannot fulfill\nits contractual commitments, even the Government has\nacknowledged that \u201c[t]he risk of over-obligation may be\nfound to fall on the agency,\u201d not the contractor. Brief for\nFederal Parties in Cherokee Nation v. Leavitt, O. T. 2004,\nNo. 02\u20131472 et al., p. 24 (hereinafter Brief for Federal\nParties).\n   The rule likewise furthers \u201cthe Government\u2019s own long-\nrun interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myr-\niad workaday transaction of its agencies.\u201d United States v.\nWinstar Corp., 518 U. S. 839, 883 (1996) (plurality opin-\nion). If the Government could be trusted to fulfill its\npromise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did\nnot arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily\u2014if\nat all\u2014and only at a premium large enough to account for\nthe risk of nonpayment. See, e.g., Logue, Tax Transitions,\nOpportunistic Retroactivity, and the Benefits of Govern-\nment Precommitment, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1129, 1146 (1996).\nIn short, contracting would become more cumbersome and\nexpensive for the Government, and willing partners more\nscarce.\n                              B\n   The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris\ndictate the result in this case. Once \u201cCongress has appro-\npriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the\ncontracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back\nout of a promise to pay on grounds of \u2018insufficient appro-\npriations,\u2019 even if the contract uses language such as\n\u2018subject to the availability of appropriations,\u2019 and even if\nan agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to\npay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d Cherokee\nNation, 543 U. S., at 637; see also id., at 638 (\u201c[T]he Gov-\nernment denies none of this\u201d).\n   That condition is satisfied here.

S. 182, 193 (1993) (quoting 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7701(a)(2)). Nothing, for instance, prevented the BIA\nfrom paying in full respondent Ramah Navajo Chapter\u2019s\ncontract support costs rather than other tribes\u2019, whether\nbased on its greater need or simply because it sought\npayment first.4 See International Union, United Auto.,\nAerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v.\nDonovan, 746 F. 2d 855, 861 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.) (\u201cA\nlump-sum appropriation leaves it to the recipient agency\n(as a matter of law, at least) to distribute the funds among\nsome or all of the permissible objects as it sees fit\u201d). And if\nthere was any doubt that that general rule applied here,\nISDA\u2019s statutory language itself makes clear that the BIA\nmay allocate funds to one tribe at the expense of another.\nSee \u00a7450j\u20131(b) (\u201c[T]he Secretary is not required to reduce\nfunding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe\nto make funds available to another tribe or tribal or-\nganization under this [Act]\u201d). The upshot is that the\nfunds appropriated by Congress were legally available to\npay any individual tribal contractor in full. See 1 GAO\nRedbook, p. 4\u20136 (3d ed. 2004).\n   The Government\u2019s contractual promise to pay each\ntribal contractor the \u201cfull amount of funds to which the\ncontractor [was] entitled,\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(g), was therefore bind-\ning.

See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, Indian Self-Determination Memorandum\nNo. 92\u20132, p. 4 (Feb. 27, 1992).\n10            SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlump-sum appropriation (though sufficient to cover its\nown contracts) will not prove sufficient to pay all similar\ncontracts.\u201d Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 638. Rather,\nthe tribal contractors were entitled to rely on the Govern-\nment\u2019s promise to pay because they were \u201cnot chargeable\nwith knowledge\u201d of the BIA\u2019s administration of Congress\u2019\nappropriation, \u201cnor [could their] legal rights be affected or\nimpaired by its maladministration or by its diversion.\u201d\nFerris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.\n   As in Cherokee Nation, we decline the Government\u2019s\ninvitation to ascribe \u201cspecial, rather than ordinary\u201d mean-\ning to the fact that ISDA makes contracts \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations.\u201d5 543 U. S., at 644. Under\nour previous interpretation of that language, that condi-\ntion was satisfied here because Congress appropriated\nadequate funds to pay in full any individual contractor. It\nis important to afford that language a \u201cuniform interpreta-\ntion\u201d in this and comparable statutes, \u201clest legal uncer-\ntainty undermine contractors\u2019 confidence that they will be\npaid, and in turn increase the cost to the Government of\npurchasing goods and services.\u201d Ibid. It would be particu-\nlarly anomalous to read the statutory language differently\nhere. Contracts made under ISDA specify that \u201c \u2018[e]ach\nprovision of the [ISDA] and each provision of this Contract\nshall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Contrac-\ntor. . . .\u2019 \u201d \u00a7450l(c), (model agreement \u00a71(a)(2)). The Gov-\nernment, in effect, must demonstrate that its reading is\nclearly required by the statutory language. Accordingly,\nthe Government cannot back out of its contractual promise\nto pay each Tribe\u2019s full contract support costs.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Government\u2019s reliance on this statutory language is particularly\n\ncurious because it suggests it is superfluous. See Brief for Petitioners\n30\u201331 (it is \u201cunnecessary\u201d to specify that contracts are \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nsee also Reply Brief for Petitioners 7 (\u201c[A]ll government contracts are\ncontingent upon the appropriations provided by Congress\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

See Brief for Petitioners 26,\n49. The Government argues, on this basis, that Ferris and\nCherokee Nation involved \u201ccontracts made against the back-\ndrop of unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations,\u201d while this\ncase does not. See Brief for Petitioners 49, 26.\n   That premise, however, is inaccurate. In Ferris, Con-\ngress appropriated \u201c[f]or improving Delaware River below\nBridesburg, Pennsylvania, forty-five thousand dollars.\u201d 20\nStat. 364. As explained in the Government\u2019s own appro-\npriations law handbook, the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language at\nissue in this case has an identical meaning to the quoted\nlanguage in Ferris. See GAO Redbook, p. 6\u20135 (\u201cWords like\n\u2018not to exceed\u2019 are not the only way to establish a maxi-\nmum limitation. If the appropriation includes a specific\namount for a particular object (such as \u2018For Cuban cigars,\n$100\u2019), then the appropriation is a maximum which may\nnot be exceeded\u201d). The appropriation in Cherokee Nation\ntook a similar form. See, e.g., 108 Stat. 2527\u20132528 (\u201cFor\nexpenses necessary to carry out . . . ISDA [and certain\nother enumerated Acts], $1,713,052,000\u201d). There is no ba-\nsis, therefore, for distinguishing the class of appropria-\ntion in those cases from this one. In each case, the agency\nremained free to allocate funds among multiple contrac-\ntors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress\nidentified.\n   This result does not leave the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language\nin Congress\u2019 appropriation without legal effect. To the\ncontrary, it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming\nother funds to pay contract support costs\u2014thereby pro-\ntecting funds that Congress envisioned for other BIA\n12            SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprograms, including tribes that choose not to enter ISDA\ncontracts. But when an agency makes competing contrac-\ntual commitments with legally available funds and then\nfails to pay, it is the Government that must bear the fiscal\nconsequences, not the contractor.\n                              B\n  The dissent attempts to distinguish this case from Cher-\nokee Nation and Ferris on different grounds, relying on\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b)\u2019s proviso that \u201cthe Secretary is not required to\nreduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serv-\ning a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.\u201d In\nthe dissent\u2019s view, that clause establishes that each dol-\nlar allocated by the Secretary reduces the amount of ap-\npropriations legally available to pay other contractors. In\neffect, the dissent understands \u00a7450j\u20131(b) to make the\nlegal availability of appropriations turn on the Secretary\u2019s\nexpenditures rather than the sum allocated by Congress.\n  That interpretation, which is inconsistent with ordinary\nprinciples of Government contracting law, is improbable.\nWe have explained that Congress ordinarily controls the\navailability of appropriations; the agency controls whether\nto make funds from that appropriation available to pay a\ncontractor. See Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 642\u2013643.\nThe agency\u2019s allocation choices do not affect the Govern-\nment\u2019s liability in the event of an underpayment. See id.,\nat 641 (when an \u201c \u2018unrestricted appropriation is sufficient\nto fund the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment\neven if the agency has allocated the funds to another pur-\npose\u2019 \u201d).6 In Cherokee Nation, we found those ordinary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent\u2019s view notwithstanding, it is beyond question that Con-\n\ngress appropriated sufficient unrestricted funds to pay any contractor\nin full. The dissent\u2019s real argument is that \u00a7450j\u20131(b) reverses the\napplicability of the Ferris rule to ISDA, so that the Secretary\u2019s alloca-\ntion of funds to one contractor reduces the legal availability of funds to\nothers. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (\u201cthat the Secretary\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

We also found no evidence that Congress intended\nthat \u201cthe tribe should bear the risk that a total lump-sum\nappropriation (though sufficient to cover its own contracts)\nwill not prove sufficient to pay all similar contracts.\u201d Id.,\nat 638 (citing Brief for Federal Parties 23\u201325). The dis-\nsent\u2019s reading, by contrast, would impose precisely that\nregime. See post, at 4\u20135.\n   The better reading of \u00a7450j\u20131(b) accords with ordinary\nGovernment contracting principles. As we explained, su-\npra, at 9, the clause underscores the Secretary\u2019s discre-\ntion to allocate funds among tribes, but does not alter the\nGovernment\u2019s legal obligation when the agency fails to\npay. That reading gives full effect to the clause\u2019s text,\nwhich addresses the \u201camount of funds provided,\u201d and\nspecifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce fund-\ning for one tribe to make \u201cfunds available\u201d to another.\n450j\u20131(b). Indeed, even the Government acknowledges\nthe clause governs the Secretary\u2019s discretion to distribute\nfunds. See Brief for Petitioners 52 (pursuant to \u00a7450j\u2013\n1(b), the Secretary was not obligated to pay tribes\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntract support costs on a first-come, first-served basis, but\nhad the authority to distribute the available money among\nall tribal contractors in an equitable fashion\u201d).\n   At minimum, the fact that we, the court below, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncould have allocated the funds to [a] tribe is irrelevant. What matters\nis what the Secretary does, and once he allocates the funds to one tribe,\nthey are not available to another\u201d). We are not persuaded that \u00a7450j\u2013\n1(b) was intended to enact that radical departure from ordinary Gov-\nernment contracting principles. Indeed, Congress has spoken clearly\nand directly when limiting the Government\u2019s total contractual liability\nto an amount appropriated in similar schemes; that it did not do so\nhere further counsels against the dissent\u2019s reading. See, e.g., 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72008(j)(2) (\u201c[i]f the total amount of funds necessary to provide\ngrants to tribes . . . for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of funds appro-\npriated . . . , the Secretary shall reduce the amount of each grant\n[pro rata]\u201d).\n14           SALAZAR v.

Because ISDA is con-\nstrued in favor of tribes, that conclusion is fatal to the\ndissent.\n                               C\n   The remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.\nFirst, the Government suggests that today\u2019s holding could\ncause the Secretary to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act,\nwhich prevents federal officers from \u201cmak[ing] or author-\niz[ing] an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount\navailable in an appropriation.\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a71341(a)(1)(A).\nBut a predecessor version of that Act was in place when\nFerris and Dougherty were decided, see GAO Redbook, pp.\n6\u20139 to 6\u201310, and the Government did not prevail there.\nAs Dougherty explained, the Anti-Deficiency Act\u2019s re-\nquirements \u201capply to the official, but they do not affect the\nrights in this court of the citizen honestly contracting with\nthe Government.\u201d 18 Ct. Cl., at 503; see also Ferris, 27 Ct.\nCl., at 546 (\u201cAn appropriation per se merely imposes limi-\ntations upon the Government\u2019s own agents; . . . but its\ninsufficiency does not pay the Government\u2019s debts, nor\ncancel its obligations\u201d).7\n   Second, the Government argues that Congress could not\nhave intended for respondents to recover from the Judg-\nment Fund, 31 U.

But we need not decide the\nquestion, for this case concerns only the contractual rights of tribal\ncontractors, not the consequences of entering into such contracts for\nagency employees.\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

Congress expressly provided in ISDA that\ntribal contractors were entitled to sue for \u201cmoney dam-\nages\u201d under the Contract Disputes Act upon the Govern-\nment\u2019s failure to pay, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7450m\u20131(a), (d), and\njudgments against the Government under that Act are\npayable from the Judgment Fund, 41 U. S. C. \u00a77108(a).9\nIndeed, we cited the Contract Disputes Act, Judgment\nFund, and Anti-Deficiency Act in Cherokee Nation, ex-\nplaining that if the Government commits its appropria-\ntions in a manner that leaves contractual obligations\nunfulfilled, \u201cthe contractor [is] free to pursue appropriate\nlegal remedies arising because the Government broke its\ncontractual promise.\u201d 543 U. S., at 642.\n   Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts\nhave rejected contractors\u2019 attempts to recover for amounts\nbeyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a\nparticular purpose. See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256\nU. S. 575 (1921). In Sutton, for instance, Congress made a\nspecific line-item appropriation of $23,000 for the comple-\ntion of a particular project. Id., at 577. We held that the\nsole contractor engaged to complete that project could not\nrecover more than that amount for his work.\n   The Ferris and Sutton lines of cases are distinguishable,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Judgment Fund is a \u201cpermanent, indefinite appropriation\u201d en-\n\nacted by Congress to pay final judgments against the United States\nwhen, inter alia, \u201c[p]ayment may not legally be made from any other\nsource of funds.\u201d 31 CFR \u00a7256.1 (2011).\n   9 For that reason, the Government\u2019s reliance on Office of Personnel\n\nManagement v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414 (1990), is misplaced. In\nRichmond, we held that the Appropriations Clause does not permit\nplaintiffs to recover money for Government-caused injuries for which\nCongress \u201cappropriated no money.\u201d Id., at 424. Richmond, however,\nindicated that the Appropriations Clause is no bar to recovery in a case\nlike this one, in which \u201cthe express terms of a specific statute\u201d establish\n\u201ca substantive right to compensation\u201d from the Judgment Fund. Id.,\nat 432.\n16             SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever. GAO Redbook, p. 6\u201318. \u201c[I]t is settled that\ncontractors paid from a general appropriation are not\nbarred from recovering for breach of contract even though\nthe appropriation is exhausted,\u201d but that \u201cunder a specific\nline-item appropriation, the answer is different.\u201d Ibid.10\nThe different results \u201cfollo[w] logically from the old maxim\nthat ignorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIf Congress\nappropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular\ncontract, that amount is specified in the appropriation act\nand the contractor is deemed to know it.\u201d Ibid. This case\nis far different. Hundreds of tribes entered into thousands\nof independent contracts, each for amounts well within the\nlump sum appropriated by Congress to pay contract sup-\nport costs. Here, where each Tribe\u2019s \u201ccontract is but one\nactivity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable\nto expect [each] contractor to know how much of that\nappropriation remain[ed] available for it at any given\ntime.\u201d Ibid.; see also Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.\n   Finally, the Government argues that legislative history\nsuggests that Congress approved of the distribution of\navailable funds on a uniform, pro rata basis. But \u201ca fun-\ndamental principle of appropriations law is that where\nCongress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without\nstatutorily restricting what can be done with those funds,\na clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose\nlegally binding restrictions.\u201d Lincoln, 508 U.

For example, an appropriation for\nbuilding two ships \u201ccould be viewed as a line-item appropriation in\nrelation to the broader \u2018Shipbuilding and Conversion\u2019 category, but it\nwas also a lump-sum appropriation in relation to the two specific\nvessels included.\u201d Ibid. So long as a contractor does not seek payment\nbeyond the amount Congress made legally available for a given pur-\npose, \u201c[t]his factual distinction does not affect the legal principle.\u201d Ibid.\nSee also In re Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 55 Comp.\nGen. 812 (1976).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

(internal\nquotation marks omitted). An agency\u2019s discretion to spend\nappropriated funds is cabined only by the \u201ctext of the\nappropriation,\u201d not by Congress\u2019 expectations of how the\nfunds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative\nhistory. Int\u2019l Union, UAW, 746 F. 2d, at 860\u2013861. That\nprinciple also reflects the same ideas underlying Ferris. If\na contractor\u2019s right to payment varied based on a future\ncourt\u2019s uncertain interpretation of legislative history, it\nwould increase the Government\u2019s cost of contracting. Cf.\nCherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 644. That long-run expense\nwould likely far exceed whatever money might be saved in\nany individual case.\n                              IV\n   As the Government points out, the state of affairs re-\nsulting in this case is the product of two congressional\ndecisions which the BIA has found difficult to reconcile.\nOn the one hand, Congress obligated the Secretary to\naccept every qualifying ISDA contract, which includes a\npromise of \u201cfull\u201d funding for all contract support costs. On\nthe other, Congress appropriated insufficient funds to pay\nin full each tribal contractor. The Government\u2019s frustra-\ntion is understandable, but the dilemma\u2019s resolution is the\nresponsibility of Congress.\n   Congress is not short of options. For instance, it could\nreduce the Government\u2019s financial obligation by amending\nISDA to remove the statutory mandate compelling the BIA\nto enter into self-determination contracts, or by giving the\nBIA flexibility to pay less than the full amount of contract\nsupport costs. It could also pass a moratorium on the\nformation of new self-determination contracts, as it has\ndone before. See \u00a7328, 112 Stat. 2681\u2013291 to 292. Or\nCongress could elect to make line-item appropriations,\n18         SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallocating funds to cover tribes\u2019 contract support costs on\na contractor-by-contractor basis. On the other hand, Con-\ngress could appropriate sufficient funds to the BIA to meet\nthe tribes\u2019 total contract support cost needs. Indeed, there\nis some evidence that Congress may do just that. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 112\u2013151, p. 42 (2011) (\u201cThe Committee\nbelieves that the Bureau should pay all contract support\ncosts for which it has contractually agreed and directs the\nBureau to include the full cost of the contract support\nobligations in its fiscal year 2013 budget submission\u201d).\n  The desirability of these options is not for us to say. We\nmake clear only that Congress has ample means at hand\nto resolve the situation underlying the Tribes\u2019 suit. Any\none of the options above could also promote transparency\nabout the Government\u2019s fiscal obligations with respect to\nISDA\u2019s directive that contract support costs be paid in\nfull. For the period in question, however, it is the Govern-\nment\u2014not the Tribes\u2014that must bear the consequences of\nCongress\u2019 decision to mandate that the Government enter\ninto binding contracts for which its appropriation was\nsufficient to pay any individual tribal contractor, but\n\u201cinsufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d\nCherokee Nation, 543 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(b),\n450l(c) (Model Agreement \u00a71(b)(4)); that payment of the\ncosts for all tribes is \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a set amount, e.g., 108\nStat. 2511, an amount that would be exceeded here; and\nthat the Secretary \u201cis not required to reduce funding for\nprograms, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make\nfunds available to another tribe,\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(b). Because the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion cannot be squared with these unambig-\nuous restrictions on the payment of contract support costs,\nI respectfully dissent.\n   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis-\ntance Act provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision\nin [the Act], the provision of funds under this [Act] is\nsubject to the availability of appropriations . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n2           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nThis condition is repeated in the Tribes\u2019 contracts with the\nGovernment. App. 206; see also \u00a7450l(c) (Model Agree-\nment \u00a71(b)(4)). The question in this case is whether ap-\npropriations were \u201cavailable\u201d during fiscal years 1994\nthrough 2001 to pay all the contract support costs incurred\nby the Tribes. Only if appropriations were \u201cavailable\u201d\nmay the Tribes hold the Government liable for the unpaid\namounts.\n   Congress restricted the amount of funds \u201cavailable\u201d to\npay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in two ways. First,\nin each annual appropriations statute for the Depart-\nment of the Interior from fiscal year 1994 to 2001, Con-\ngress provided that spending on contract support costs for\nall tribes was \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain amount. The\nfiscal year 1995 appropriations statute is representative.\nIt provided: \u201cFor operation of Indian programs . . . ,\n$1,526,778,000, . . . of which not to exceed $95,823,000\nshall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for\ncontract support costs . . . .\u201d 108 Stat. 2510\u20132511. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 11\u201312, the phrase \u201cnot to\nexceed\u201d has a settled meaning in federal appropriations\nlaw. By use of the phrase, Congress imposed a cap on the\ntotal funds available for contract support costs in each\nfiscal year. See 2 General Accounting Office, Principles of\nFederal Appropriations Law, p. 6\u20138 (2d ed. 1992) (herein-\nafter GAO Redbook) (\u201c[T]he most effective way to establish\na maximum . . . earmark is by the words \u2018not to exceed\u2019 or\n\u2018not more than\u2019 \u201d).\n   Second, in \u00a7450j\u20131(b) itself\u2014in the very same sentence\nthat conditions funding on the \u201cavailability of appropria-\ntions\u201d\u2014Congress provided that \u201cthe Secretary [of the\nInterior] is not required to reduce funding for programs,\nprojects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds avail-\nable to another tribe or tribal organization under [the Act].\u201d\nAn agency may be required to shift funds from one object\nto another, within statutory limits, when doing so is\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

But the \u201creduction\u201d clause\nin \u00a7450j\u20131(b) expressly provides that the Secretary is \u201cnot\nrequired\u201d to engage in such reprogramming to make one\ntribe\u2019s funds \u201cavailable to another tribe.\u201d It follows that\nappropriations allocated for \u201cprograms, projects, or activi-\nties serving a tribe\u201d are not \u201cavailable\u201d to another tribe,\nunless the Secretary reallocates them. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 13\u201314, the Government shares\nthis view that the \u201creduction\u201d clause \u201cspecifically relieves\nthe Secretary of any obligation to make funds available to\none contractor by reducing payments to others.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 51 (citing Arctic Slope Native Assn., Ltd. v.\nSebelius, 629 F. 3d 1296, 1304 (CA Fed. 2010), cert. pend-\ning, No. 11\u201383 (filed July 18, 2011)).\n   Given these express restrictions established by Con-\ngress\u2014which no one doubts are valid\u2014I cannot agree with\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that appropriations were \u201cavail-\nable\u201d to pay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in full.\nOnce the Secretary had allocated all the funds appropriated\nfor contract support costs, no other funds could be used\nfor that purpose without violating the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d re-\nstrictions in the relevant appropriations statutes. The\nCourt agrees. Ante, at 11\u201312. That leaves only one other\npossible source of funds to pay the disputed costs in this\ncase: funds appropriated for contract support costs, but\nallocated to pay such costs incurred by other tribes. Those\nfunds were not \u201cavailable\u201d either, however, because they\nwere \u201cfunding for programs, projects, or activities serving\na tribe,\u201d and the Secretary was not required to reduce\nsuch funding \u201cto make funds available to another tribe.\u201d\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b).\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court fails to\nappreciate the full significance of the \u201creduction\u201d clause in\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b). As construed by the Court, that clause merely\nconfirms that the Secretary \u201cmay allocate funds to one\n4           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntribe at the expense of another.\u201d Ante, at 9. But as ex-\nplained above, the clause does more than that: It also\nestablishes that when the Secretary does allocate funds to\none tribe at the expense of another, the latter tribe has no\nright to those funds\u2014the funds are not \u201cavailable\u201d to it.\nThe fact that the Secretary could have allocated the funds\nto the other tribe is irrelevant. What matters is what the\nSecretary actually does, and once he allocates the funds to\none tribe, they are not \u201cavailable\u201d to another.\n   The Court rejects this reading of the \u201creduction\u201d clause,\non the ground that it would constitute a \u201cradical departure\nfrom ordinary Government contracting principles.\u201d Ante,\nat 13, n. 6. But the fact that the clause operates as a\nconstraint on the \u201cavailability of appropriations\u201d is evident\nnot only from its text, which speaks in terms of \u201cfunds\navailable,\u201d but also from its placement in the statute,\nimmediately following the \u201csubject to the availability\u201d\nclause. Under the Court\u2019s view, by contrast, the \u201creduc-\ntion\u201d clause merely \u201cunderscores the Secretary\u2019s discretion\nto allocate funds among tribes.\u201d Ante, at 13. There is,\nhowever, no reason to suppose that Congress enacted the\nprovision simply to confirm this \u201cordinary\u201d rule. Ibid. We\ngenerally try to avoid reading statutes to be so \u201cinsig-\nnificant.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court maintains that its holding is compelled by\nour decision in Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 543\nU. S. 631 (2005). Ante, at 8. Like respondents here, the\ntribes in Cherokee Nation sued the Government for unpaid\ncontract support costs under the Act. Congress had ap-\npropriated certain sums to the Indian Health Service \u201c[f]or\nexpenses necessary to carry out\u201d the Act, e.g., 108 Stat.\n2527\u20132528, but\u2014unlike in this case\u2014those appropriations\n\u201ccontained no relevant statutory restriction,\u201d 543 U. S., at\n637. The Government in Cherokee Nation contended that\nit was not obligated to pay the contract support costs as\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\npromised, in light of the \u201creduction\u201d clause in \u00a7450j\u20131(b).\nThe Government argued that the clause \u201cmakes nonbind-\ning a promise to pay one tribe\u2019s costs where doing so would\nrequire funds that the Government would otherwise de-\nvote to \u2018programs, projects, or activities serving . . . an-\nother tribe.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641 (quoting \u00a7450j\u20131(b)).\n   We ruled against the Government, but not because of\nany disagreement with its reading of the \u201creduction\u201d\nclause. The basis for our decision was instead that \u201cthe\nrelevant congressional appropriations contained other\nunrestricted funds, small in amount but sufficient to pay\nthe claims at issue.\u201d 543 U. S., at 641 (emphasis altered).\nThose funds were allocated for \u201c \u2018inherent federal func-\ntions,\u2019 such as the cost of running the Indian Health Ser-\nvice\u2019s central Washington office.\u201d Id., at 641\u2013642. They\nwere not restricted by the \u201creduction\u201d clause, because they\nwere not funds for \u201c \u2018programs, projects, or activities serv-\ning . . . another tribe.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641 (quoting \u00a7450j\u20131(b)).\nNor were they restricted by the pertinent appropriations\nstatutes, which, as noted, contained no relevant limiting\nlanguage. See ibid. We therefore held that those funds\u2014\nwhich we described as \u201cunrestricted\u201d throughout our\nopinion, id., at 641, 642, 643, 647\u2014were available to pay\nthe disputed contract support costs.\n   As even the Tribes concede, Cherokee Nation does not\ncontrol this case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (\u201cI don\u2019t think this\ncase is controlled by Cherokee\u201d (counsel for the Tribes)).\nThe reason is not that the appropriations statutes in this\ncase contained \u201cnot to exceed\u201d caps while those in Chero-\nkee Nation did not. The Court is correct that appropriat-\ning an amount \u201cfor\u201d a particular purpose has the same\neffect as providing that appropriations for that purpose\nare \u201cnot to exceed\u201d that amount. Ante, at 11. What makes\nthis case different is where Congress drew the line. In\nCherokee Nation, the statutes capped funding for \u201cexpenses\nnecessary to carry out\u201d the Act, a category that included\n6           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfunding for both \u201cinherent federal functions\u201d and contract\nsupport costs. Accordingly, funding for one could be used\nfor the other, without violating the cap. Here, by contrast,\nthe statutes capped funding for contract support costs\nspecifically. Thus, once the Secretary exhausted those\nfunds, he could not reprogram other funds\u2014such as\nfunds for \u201cinherent federal functions\u201d\u2014to pay the costs.\nWith the caps in place, moreover, the \u201creduction\u201d clause, as\nexplained above, rendered unavailable the only possible\nsource of funds left: funds already allocated for other\ncontract support costs. Unlike in Cherokee Nation, there-\nfore, there were no unrestricted funds to pay the costs at\nissue in this case. The Court\u2019s quotation from Cherokee\nNation concerning \u201cwhen an \u2018 \u201cunrestricted appropriation\nis sufficient to fund the contract,\u201d \u2019 \u201d ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded) (quoting Cherokee Nation, supra, at 641), is accord-\ningly beside the point.\n   The Court also relies on Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct.\nCl. 542 (1892). That case involved a government contract\nto dredge the Delaware River. When work under the\ncontract stopped because funds from the relevant appro-\npriation had been exhausted, a contractor sued the Gov-\nernment for breach of contract, and the Court of Claims\nheld that he was entitled to recover lost profits. As the\ncourt explained, \u201c[a] contractor who is one of several per-\nsons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable\nwith knowledge of its administration, nor can his legal\nrights be affected or impaired by its maladministration or\nby its diversion, whether legal or illegal, to other objects.\u201d\nId., at 546. That principle, however, cannot \u201cdictate the\nresult in this case.\u201d Ante, at 8. The statute in Ferris\nappropriated an amount \u201c[f]or improving [the] Delaware\nRiver,\u201d which prevented spending for that purpose beyond\nthe specified amount. 20 Stat. 364. But in that case, all\nfunds appropriated for that purpose were equally avail-\nable to all contractors. Here that is not true; \u00a7450j\u20131(b)\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmakes clear that funds allocated to one contractor are not\navailable to another. Thus, the principle in Ferris does not\napply.\n  It is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 10, that each of\nthe Tribes\u2019 contracts provides that the Act and the con-\ntract \u201cshall be liberally construed for the benefit of the\nContractor.\u201d App. 203; see also \u00a7450l(c) (Model Agreement\n\u00a71(a)(2)). But a provision can be construed \u201cliberally\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cstrictly\u201d only when there is some ambiguity to\nconstrue. And here there is none. Congress spoke clearly\nwhen it said that the provision of funds was \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations,\u201d that spending on contract\nsupport costs was \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a specific amount, and\nthat the Secretary was \u201cnot required\u201d to make funds allo-\ncated for one tribe\u2019s costs \u201cavailable\u201d to another. The\nunambiguous meaning of these provisions is that when\nthe Secretary has allocated the maximum amount of funds\nappropriated each fiscal year for contract support costs,\nthere are no other appropriations \u201cavailable\u201d to pay any\nremaining costs.\n  This is hardly a typical government contracts case.\nMany government contracts contain a \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations\u201d clause, and many appropri-\nations statutes contain \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language. But this\ncase involves not only those provisions but a third, reliev-\ning the Secretary of any obligation to make funds \u201cavaila-\nble\u201d to one contractor by reducing payments to others.\nSuch provisions will not always appear together, but when\nthey do, we must give them effect. Doing so here, I would\nhold that the Tribes are not entitled to payment of their\ncontract support costs in full, and I would reverse the\ncontrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit.\n",

That is so\n    \u201ceven if an agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to\n    pay all\u201d of its contracts. Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. This\n    principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors\n    and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States. Contractors\n    need not keep track of agencies\u2019 shifting priorities and competing ob-\n    ligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its\n    contractual promises. And the rule furthers \u201cthe Government\u2019s own\n    long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad\n    workaday transaction of its agencies.\u201d United States v. Winstar\n    Corp., 518 U. S. 839, 883. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris control\n    here. Once \u201cCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted\n    funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot\n    back out of a promise on grounds of \u2018insufficient appropriations,\u2019 even\n    if the contract uses language such as \u2018subject to the availability of\n    appropriations,\u2019 and even if an agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation\n    is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d Chero-\n    kee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. That condition is satisfied here, be-\n    cause Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual\n    contractor in full. Pp. 8\u221210.\n       (c) The Government attempts to distinguish Ferris and Cherokee\n    Nation on the ground that they involved unrestricted, lump-sum ap-\n    propriations, while Congress here appropriated \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a cer-\n    tain amount for contract support costs. The effect of the appropria-\n    tions in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free\n    to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts\n    served the purpose Congress identified. The \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language\n    still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming\n    other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds\n    that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs pro-\n    grams.\n       Section 450j\u20131(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to reduce funding for one tribe\u2019s programs to make funds available to\n  another tribe, does not warrant a different result. Consistent with\n  ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely\n  underscores the Secretary\u2019s discretion to allocate funds among tribes.\n  It does not alter the Government\u2019s legal obligation when the Secre-\n  tary fails to pay.\n     The Government\u2019s remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.\n  First, it suggests that the Secretary could violate the Anti-Deficiency\n  Act, which prevents federal officers from making or authorizing an\n  expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an ap-\n  propriation. That Act applies only to government officials, however,\n  and does not affect the rights of citizens contracting with the Gov-\n  ernment. Second, the Government argues that permitting respond-\n  ents to recover from the Judgment Fund would circumvent Congress\u2019\n  intent to cap total expenditures for contract support costs. But ISDA\n  expressly provides that tribal contractors may sue for \u201cmoney dam-\n  ages\u201d under the Contract Disputes Act, and any ensuing judgments\n  are payable from the Judgment Fund. See Cherokee Nation, 543\n  U. S., at 642. Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts\n  have rejected contractors\u2019 attempts to recover for amounts beyond the\n  maximum appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. See,\n  e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575. However, Sutton in-\n  volved a specific line-item appropriation for an amount beyond which\n  the sole contractor could not recover. This case involves several con-\n  tractors, each of whom contracted within the lump-sum amount Con-\n  gress appropriated for all contractors. Unlike the sole contractor in\n  Sutton, they cannot reasonably be expected to know how much re-\n  mained available of Congress\u2019 lump-sum appropriation. Finally, the\n  Government claims that legislative history suggests that Congress\n  approved of pro rata distribution, but \u201cindicia in committee reports\n  and other legislative history as to how funds should or are expected\n  to be spent do not establish any legal requirement on the agency.\u201d\n  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 192. Pp. 11\u221217.\n     (d) This case is the product of two decisions in some tension: Con-\n  gress required the Secretary to accept every qualifying ISDA con-\n  tract, promising \u201cfull\u201d funding for all contract support costs, but then\n  appropriated insufficient funds to pay in full each tribal contractor.\n  Responsibility for the resolution of that situation, however, is com-\n  mitted to Congress.

RAMAH NAVAJO \n\n                 CHAPTER ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 18, 2012] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis-\ntance Act (ISDA), 25 U. S. C. \u00a7450 et seq., directs the\nSecretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with will-\ning tribes, pursuant to which those tribes will provide\nservices such as education and law enforcement that\notherwise would have been provided by the Federal Gov-\nernment. ISDA mandates that the Secretary shall pay\nthe full amount of \u201ccontract support costs\u201d incurred by\ntribes in performing their contracts. At issue in this case\nis whether the Government must pay those costs when\nCongress appropriates sufficient funds to pay in full any\nindividual contractor\u2019s contract support costs, but not\nenough funds to cover the aggregate amount due every\ncontractor. Consistent with longstanding principles of\nGovernment contracting law, we hold that the Govern-\nment must pay each tribe\u2019s contract support costs in full.\n                         I\n                        A\n  Congress enacted ISDA in 1975 in order to achieve\n2             SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cmaximum Indian participation in the direction of educa-\ntional as well as other Federal services to Indian commu-\nnities so as to render such services more responsive to the\nneeds and desires of those communities.\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7450a(a). To that end, the Act directs the Secretary of the\nInterior, \u201cupon the request of any Indian tribe . . . to enter\ninto a self-determination contract . . . to plan, conduct, and\nadminister\u201d health, education, economic, and social pro-\ngrams that the Secretary otherwise would have adminis-\ntered. \u00a7450f(a)(1).\n   As originally enacted, ISDA required the Government to\nprovide contracting tribes with an amount of funds equiv-\nalent to those that the Secretary \u201cwould have other-\nwise provided for his direct operation of the programs.\u201d\n\u00a7106(h), 88 Stat. 2211. It soon became apparent that this\nsecretarial amount failed to account for the full costs to\ntribes of providing services. Because of \u201cconcern with\nGovernment\u2019s past failure adequately to reimburse tribes\u2019\nindirect administrative costs,\u201d Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.\nLeavitt, 543 U. S. 631, 639 (2005), Congress amended\nISDA to require the Secretary to contract to pay the \u201cfull\namount\u201d of \u201ccontract support costs\u201d related to each self-\ndetermination contract, \u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2), (g).1 The Act also\nprovides, however, that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other\nprovision in [ISDA], the provision of funds under [ISDA] is\nsubject to the availability of appropriations.\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(b).\n   Congress included a model contract in ISDA and di-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As defined by ISDA, contract support costs \u201cshall consist of an\n\namount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on\nby a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the\nterms of the contract and prudent management, but which . . . (A)\nnormally are not carried on by the respective Secretary in his direct\noperation of the program; or (B) are provided by the Secretary in\nsupport of the contracted program from resources other than those\nunder contract.\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(a)(2). Such costs include overhead adminis-\ntrative costs, as well as expenses such as federally mandated audits\nand liability insurance. See Cherokee Nation of Okla., 543 U.

Finally, the Act makes clear that if\nthe Government fails to pay the amount contracted for,\nthen tribal contractors are entitled to pursue \u201cmoney dam-\nages\u201d in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act.\n\u00a7450m\u20131(a).\n                            B\n   During Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent\nTribes contracted with the Secretary of the Interior to\nprovide services such as law enforcement, environmental\nprotection, and agricultural assistance. The Tribes fully\nperformed. During each FY, Congress appropriated a\ntotal amount to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \u201cfor the\noperation of Indian programs.\u201d See, e.g., Department of\nthe Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,\n2000, 113 Stat. 1501A\u2013148. Of that sum, Congress pro-\nvided that \u201cnot to exceed [a particular amount] shall be\navailable for payments to tribes and tribal organiza-\ntions for contract support costs\u201d under ISDA. E.g., ibid.\nThus, in FY 2000, for example, Congress appropriated\n$1,670,444,000 to the BIA, of which \u201cnot to exceed\n$120,229,000\u201d was allocated for contract support costs.\nIbid.\n4           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   During each relevant FY, Congress appropriated suffi-\ncient funds to pay in full any individual tribal contractor\u2019s\ncontract support costs. Congress did not, however, appro-\npriate sufficient funds to cover the contract support costs\ndue all tribal contractors collectively. Between FY 1994\nand 2001, appropriations covered only between 77% and\n92% of tribes\u2019 aggregate contract support costs. The ex-\ntent of the shortfall was not revealed until each fiscal year\nwas well underway, at which point a tribe\u2019s performance\nof its contractual obligations was largely complete. See\n644 F. 3d 1054, 1061 (CA10 2011). Lacking funds to pay\neach contractor in full, the Secretary paid tribes\u2019 contract\nsupport costs on a uniform, pro rata basis. Tribes re-\nsponded to these shortfalls by reducing ISDA services to\ntribal members, diverting tribal resources from non-ISDA\nprograms, and forgoing opportunities to contract in fur-\ntherance of Congress\u2019 self-determination objective. GAO,\nV. Rezendes, Indian Self-Determination Act: Shortfalls in\nIndian Contract Support Costs Need to Be Addressed 3\u20134\n(GAO/RCED\u201399\u2013150, 2009).\n   Respondent Tribes sued for breach of contract pursuant\nto the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7601\u2013613, alleg-\ning that the Government failed to pay the full amount of\ncontract support costs due from FY 1994 through 2001,\nas required by ISDA and their contracts. The United\nStates District Court for the District of New Mexico granted\nsummary judgment for the Government. A divided panel\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir-\ncuit reversed. The court reasoned that Congress made\nsufficient appropriations \u201clegally available\u201d to fund any\nindividual tribal contractor\u2019s contract support costs, and\nthat the Government\u2019s contractual commitment was there-\nfore binding. 644 F. 3d, at 1063\u20131065. In such cases, the\nCourt of Appeals held that the Government is liable to\neach contractor for the full contract amount.

We granted certiorari to resolve a split\namong the Courts of Appeals, 565 U.

S., at 634\u2013637. For each FY at\nissue, Congress had appropriated to the Indian Health\nService (IHS) a lump sum between $1.277 and $1.419\nbillion, \u201cfar more than the [contract support cost]\namounts\u201d due under the Tribes\u2019 individual contracts. Id.,\nat 637; see id., at 636 (Cherokee Nation and Shoshone-\nPaiute Tribes filed claims seeking $3.4 and $3.5 million,\nrespectively). The Government contended, however, that\nCongress had appropriated inadequate funds to enable the\nIHS to pay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in full, while\nmeeting all of the agency\u2019s competing fiscal priorities.\n   As we explained, that did not excuse the Government\u2019s\nresponsibility to pay the Tribes. We stressed that the\nGovernment\u2019s obligation to pay contract support costs\nshould be treated as an ordinary contract promise, noting\nthat ISDA \u201cuses the word \u2018contract\u2019 426 times to describe\nthe nature of the Government\u2019s promise.\u201d Id., at 639. As\neven the Government conceded, \u201cin the case of ordinary\ncontracts . . . \u2018if the amount of an unrestricted appropria-\ntion is sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Compare 644 F. 3d 1054 (case below), with Arctic Slope Native\n\nAssn., Ltd. v. Sebelius, 629 F. 3d 1296 (CA Fed. 2010) (no liability to\npay total contract support costs beyond cap in appropriations Act).\n6                 SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to payment even if the agency has allocated\nthe funds to another purpose or assumes other obligations\nthat exhaust the funds.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641. It followed, there-\nfore, that absent \u201csomething special about the promises at\nissue,\u201d the Government was obligated to pay the Tribes\u2019\ncontract support costs in full. Id., at 638.\n   We held that the mere fact that ISDA self-determination\ncontracts are made \u201csubject to the availability of appropri-\nations\u201d did not warrant a special rule. Id., at 643 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That commonplace provision,\nwe explained, is ordinarily satisfied so long as Congress\nappropriates adequate legally unrestricted funds to pay\nthe contracts at issue. See ibid. Because Congress made\nsufficient funds legally available to the agency to pay the\nTribes\u2019 contracts, it did not matter that the BIA had allo-\ncated some of those funds to serve other purposes, such\nthat the remainder was insufficient to pay the Tribes in\nfull. Rather, we agreed with the Tribes that \u201cas long as\nCongress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted\nfunds to pay the contracts at issue,\u201d the Government\u2019s\npromise to pay was binding. Id., at 637\u2013638.\n   Our conclusion in Cherokee Nation followed directly\nfrom well-established principles of Government contract-\ning law. When a Government contractor is one of several\npersons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient\nin itself to pay the contractor, it has long been the rule\nthat the Government is responsible to the contractor for\nthe full amount due under the contract, even if the agency\nexhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible\nends.

For contractors, the Ferris rule reflects\nthat when \u201ca contract is but one activity under a larger\nappropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the contractor\nto know how much of that appropriation remains available\nfor it at any given time.\u201d GAO Redbook, p. 6\u201318. Contrac-\ntors are responsible for knowing the size of the pie, not\nhow the agency elects to slice it. Thus, so long as Con-\ngress appropriates adequate funds to cover a prospective\ncontract, contractors need not keep track of agencies\u2019\nshifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they\nmay trust that the Government will honor its contractual\npromises.

S. 839, 883 (1996) (plurality opin-\nion). If the Government could be trusted to fulfill its\npromise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did\nnot arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily\u2014if\nat all\u2014and only at a premium large enough to account for\nthe risk of nonpayment. See, e.g., Logue, Tax Transitions,\nOpportunistic Retroactivity, and the Benefits of Govern-\nment Precommitment, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 1129, 1146 (1996).\nIn short, contracting would become more cumbersome and\nexpensive for the Government, and willing partners more\nscarce.\n                              B\n   The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris\ndictate the result in this case. Once \u201cCongress has appro-\npriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the\ncontracts at issue, the Government normally cannot back\nout of a promise to pay on grounds of \u2018insufficient appro-\npriations,\u2019 even if the contract uses language such as\n\u2018subject to the availability of appropriations,\u2019 and even if\nan agency\u2019s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to\npay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d Cherokee\nNation, 543 U. S., at 637; see also id., at 638 (\u201c[T]he Gov-\nernment denies none of this\u201d).\n   That condition is satisfied here.

S. 182, 193 (1993) (quoting 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7701(a)(2)). Nothing, for instance, prevented the BIA\nfrom paying in full respondent Ramah Navajo Chapter\u2019s\ncontract support costs rather than other tribes\u2019, whether\nbased on its greater need or simply because it sought\npayment first.4 See International Union, United Auto.,\nAerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v.\nDonovan, 746 F. 2d 855, 861 (CADC 1984) (Scalia, J.) (\u201cA\nlump-sum appropriation leaves it to the recipient agency\n(as a matter of law, at least) to distribute the funds among\nsome or all of the permissible objects as it sees fit\u201d). And if\nthere was any doubt that that general rule applied here,\nISDA\u2019s statutory language itself makes clear that the BIA\nmay allocate funds to one tribe at the expense of another.\nSee \u00a7450j\u20131(b) (\u201c[T]he Secretary is not required to reduce\nfunding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe\nto make funds available to another tribe or tribal or-\nganization under this [Act]\u201d). The upshot is that the\nfunds appropriated by Congress were legally available to\npay any individual tribal contractor in full. See 1 GAO\nRedbook, p. 4\u20136 (3d ed. 2004).\n   The Government\u2019s contractual promise to pay each\ntribal contractor the \u201cfull amount of funds to which the\ncontractor [was] entitled,\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(g), was therefore bind-\ning.

See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, Indian Self-Determination Memorandum\nNo. 92\u20132, p. 4 (Feb. 27, 1992).\n10            SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlump-sum appropriation (though sufficient to cover its\nown contracts) will not prove sufficient to pay all similar\ncontracts.\u201d Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 638. Rather,\nthe tribal contractors were entitled to rely on the Govern-\nment\u2019s promise to pay because they were \u201cnot chargeable\nwith knowledge\u201d of the BIA\u2019s administration of Congress\u2019\nappropriation, \u201cnor [could their] legal rights be affected or\nimpaired by its maladministration or by its diversion.\u201d\nFerris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.\n   As in Cherokee Nation, we decline the Government\u2019s\ninvitation to ascribe \u201cspecial, rather than ordinary\u201d mean-\ning to the fact that ISDA makes contracts \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations.\u201d5 543 U. S., at 644. Under\nour previous interpretation of that language, that condi-\ntion was satisfied here because Congress appropriated\nadequate funds to pay in full any individual contractor. It\nis important to afford that language a \u201cuniform interpreta-\ntion\u201d in this and comparable statutes, \u201clest legal uncer-\ntainty undermine contractors\u2019 confidence that they will be\npaid, and in turn increase the cost to the Government of\npurchasing goods and services.\u201d Ibid. It would be particu-\nlarly anomalous to read the statutory language differently\nhere. Contracts made under ISDA specify that \u201c \u2018[e]ach\nprovision of the [ISDA] and each provision of this Contract\nshall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Contrac-\ntor. . . .\u2019 \u201d \u00a7450l(c), (model agreement \u00a71(a)(2)). The Gov-\nernment, in effect, must demonstrate that its reading is\nclearly required by the statutory language. Accordingly,\nthe Government cannot back out of its contractual promise\nto pay each Tribe\u2019s full contract support costs.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Government\u2019s reliance on this statutory language is particularly\n\ncurious because it suggests it is superfluous. See Brief for Petitioners\n30\u201331 (it is \u201cunnecessary\u201d to specify that contracts are \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted));\nsee also Reply Brief for Petitioners 7 (\u201c[A]ll government contracts are\ncontingent upon the appropriations provided by Congress\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

See Brief for Petitioners 26,\n49. The Government argues, on this basis, that Ferris and\nCherokee Nation involved \u201ccontracts made against the back-\ndrop of unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations,\u201d while this\ncase does not. See Brief for Petitioners 49, 26.\n   That premise, however, is inaccurate. In Ferris, Con-\ngress appropriated \u201c[f]or improving Delaware River below\nBridesburg, Pennsylvania, forty-five thousand dollars.\u201d 20\nStat. 364. As explained in the Government\u2019s own appro-\npriations law handbook, the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language at\nissue in this case has an identical meaning to the quoted\nlanguage in Ferris. See GAO Redbook, p. 6\u20135 (\u201cWords like\n\u2018not to exceed\u2019 are not the only way to establish a maxi-\nmum limitation. If the appropriation includes a specific\namount for a particular object (such as \u2018For Cuban cigars,\n$100\u2019), then the appropriation is a maximum which may\nnot be exceeded\u201d). The appropriation in Cherokee Nation\ntook a similar form. See, e.g., 108 Stat. 2527\u20132528 (\u201cFor\nexpenses necessary to carry out . . . ISDA [and certain\nother enumerated Acts], $1,713,052,000\u201d). There is no ba-\nsis, therefore, for distinguishing the class of appropria-\ntion in those cases from this one. In each case, the agency\nremained free to allocate funds among multiple contrac-\ntors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress\nidentified.\n   This result does not leave the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language\nin Congress\u2019 appropriation without legal effect. To the\ncontrary, it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming\nother funds to pay contract support costs\u2014thereby pro-\ntecting funds that Congress envisioned for other BIA\n12            SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprograms, including tribes that choose not to enter ISDA\ncontracts. But when an agency makes competing contrac-\ntual commitments with legally available funds and then\nfails to pay, it is the Government that must bear the fiscal\nconsequences, not the contractor.\n                              B\n  The dissent attempts to distinguish this case from Cher-\nokee Nation and Ferris on different grounds, relying on\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b)\u2019s proviso that \u201cthe Secretary is not required to\nreduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serv-\ning a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.\u201d In\nthe dissent\u2019s view, that clause establishes that each dol-\nlar allocated by the Secretary reduces the amount of ap-\npropriations legally available to pay other contractors. In\neffect, the dissent understands \u00a7450j\u20131(b) to make the\nlegal availability of appropriations turn on the Secretary\u2019s\nexpenditures rather than the sum allocated by Congress.\n  That interpretation, which is inconsistent with ordinary\nprinciples of Government contracting law, is improbable.\nWe have explained that Congress ordinarily controls the\navailability of appropriations; the agency controls whether\nto make funds from that appropriation available to pay a\ncontractor. See Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 642\u2013643.\nThe agency\u2019s allocation choices do not affect the Govern-\nment\u2019s liability in the event of an underpayment. See id.,\nat 641 (when an \u201c \u2018unrestricted appropriation is sufficient\nto fund the contract, the contractor is entitled to payment\neven if the agency has allocated the funds to another pur-\npose\u2019 \u201d).6 In Cherokee Nation, we found those ordinary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent\u2019s view notwithstanding, it is beyond question that Con-\n\ngress appropriated sufficient unrestricted funds to pay any contractor\nin full. The dissent\u2019s real argument is that \u00a7450j\u20131(b) reverses the\napplicability of the Ferris rule to ISDA, so that the Secretary\u2019s alloca-\ntion of funds to one contractor reduces the legal availability of funds to\nothers. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (\u201cthat the Secretary\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

We also found no evidence that Congress intended\nthat \u201cthe tribe should bear the risk that a total lump-sum\nappropriation (though sufficient to cover its own contracts)\nwill not prove sufficient to pay all similar contracts.\u201d Id.,\nat 638 (citing Brief for Federal Parties 23\u201325). The dis-\nsent\u2019s reading, by contrast, would impose precisely that\nregime. See post, at 4\u20135.\n   The better reading of \u00a7450j\u20131(b) accords with ordinary\nGovernment contracting principles. As we explained, su-\npra, at 9, the clause underscores the Secretary\u2019s discre-\ntion to allocate funds among tribes, but does not alter the\nGovernment\u2019s legal obligation when the agency fails to\npay. That reading gives full effect to the clause\u2019s text,\nwhich addresses the \u201camount of funds provided,\u201d and\nspecifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce fund-\ning for one tribe to make \u201cfunds available\u201d to another.\n450j\u20131(b). Indeed, even the Government acknowledges\nthe clause governs the Secretary\u2019s discretion to distribute\nfunds. See Brief for Petitioners 52 (pursuant to \u00a7450j\u2013\n1(b), the Secretary was not obligated to pay tribes\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntract support costs on a first-come, first-served basis, but\nhad the authority to distribute the available money among\nall tribal contractors in an equitable fashion\u201d).\n   At minimum, the fact that we, the court below, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncould have allocated the funds to [a] tribe is irrelevant. What matters\nis what the Secretary does, and once he allocates the funds to one tribe,\nthey are not available to another\u201d). We are not persuaded that \u00a7450j\u2013\n1(b) was intended to enact that radical departure from ordinary Gov-\nernment contracting principles. Indeed, Congress has spoken clearly\nand directly when limiting the Government\u2019s total contractual liability\nto an amount appropriated in similar schemes; that it did not do so\nhere further counsels against the dissent\u2019s reading. See, e.g., 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72008(j)(2) (\u201c[i]f the total amount of funds necessary to provide\ngrants to tribes . . . for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of funds appro-\npriated . . . , the Secretary shall reduce the amount of each grant\n[pro rata]\u201d).\n14           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment, and the Tribes do not share the dissent\u2019s\nreading of \u00a7450j\u20131(b) is strong evidence that its inter-\npretation is not, as it claims, \u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d correct.\nPost, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Because ISDA is con-\nstrued in favor of tribes, that conclusion is fatal to the\ndissent.\n                               C\n   The remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.\nFirst, the Government suggests that today\u2019s holding could\ncause the Secretary to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act,\nwhich prevents federal officers from \u201cmak[ing] or author-\niz[ing] an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount\navailable in an appropriation.\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a71341(a)(1)(A).\nBut a predecessor version of that Act was in place when\nFerris and Dougherty were decided, see GAO Redbook, pp.\n6\u20139 to 6\u201310, and the Government did not prevail there.\nAs Dougherty explained, the Anti-Deficiency Act\u2019s re-\nquirements \u201capply to the official, but they do not affect the\nrights in this court of the citizen honestly contracting with\nthe Government.\u201d 18 Ct. Cl., at 503; see also Ferris, 27 Ct.\nCl., at 546 (\u201cAn appropriation per se merely imposes limi-\ntations upon the Government\u2019s own agents; . . . but its\ninsufficiency does not pay the Government\u2019s debts, nor\ncancel its obligations\u201d).7\n   Second, the Government argues that Congress could not\nhave intended for respondents to recover from the Judg-\nment Fund, 31 U. S. C. \u00a71304, because that would allow\nthe Tribes to circumvent Congress\u2019 intent to cap total\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We have some doubt whether a Government employee would violate\n\nthe Anti-Deficiency Act by obeying an express statutory command to\nenter a contract, as was the case here. But we need not decide the\nquestion, for this case concerns only the contractual rights of tribal\ncontractors, not the consequences of entering into such contracts for\nagency employees.\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

Congress expressly provided in ISDA that\ntribal contractors were entitled to sue for \u201cmoney dam-\nages\u201d under the Contract Disputes Act upon the Govern-\nment\u2019s failure to pay, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7450m\u20131(a), (d), and\njudgments against the Government under that Act are\npayable from the Judgment Fund, 41 U. S. C. \u00a77108(a).9\nIndeed, we cited the Contract Disputes Act, Judgment\nFund, and Anti-Deficiency Act in Cherokee Nation, ex-\nplaining that if the Government commits its appropria-\ntions in a manner that leaves contractual obligations\nunfulfilled, \u201cthe contractor [is] free to pursue appropriate\nlegal remedies arising because the Government broke its\ncontractual promise.\u201d 543 U. S., at 642.\n   Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts\nhave rejected contractors\u2019 attempts to recover for amounts\nbeyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a\nparticular purpose. See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256\nU. S. 575 (1921). In Sutton, for instance, Congress made a\nspecific line-item appropriation of $23,000 for the comple-\ntion of a particular project. Id., at 577. We held that the\nsole contractor engaged to complete that project could not\nrecover more than that amount for his work.\n   The Ferris and Sutton lines of cases are distinguishable,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Judgment Fund is a \u201cpermanent, indefinite appropriation\u201d en-\n\nacted by Congress to pay final judgments against the United States\nwhen, inter alia, \u201c[p]ayment may not legally be made from any other\nsource of funds.\u201d 31 CFR \u00a7256.1 (2011).\n   9 For that reason, the Government\u2019s reliance on Office of Personnel\n\nManagement v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414 (1990), is misplaced. In\nRichmond, we held that the Appropriations Clause does not permit\nplaintiffs to recover money for Government-caused injuries for which\nCongress \u201cappropriated no money.\u201d Id., at 424. Richmond, however,\nindicated that the Appropriations Clause is no bar to recovery in a case\nlike this one, in which \u201cthe express terms of a specific statute\u201d establish\n\u201ca substantive right to compensation\u201d from the Judgment Fund. Id.,\nat 432.\n16             SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever. GAO Redbook, p. 6\u201318. \u201c[I]t is settled that\ncontractors paid from a general appropriation are not\nbarred from recovering for breach of contract even though\nthe appropriation is exhausted,\u201d but that \u201cunder a specific\nline-item appropriation, the answer is different.\u201d Ibid.10\nThe different results \u201cfollo[w] logically from the old maxim\nthat ignorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIf Congress\nappropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular\ncontract, that amount is specified in the appropriation act\nand the contractor is deemed to know it.\u201d Ibid. This case\nis far different. Hundreds of tribes entered into thousands\nof independent contracts, each for amounts well within the\nlump sum appropriated by Congress to pay contract sup-\nport costs. Here, where each Tribe\u2019s \u201ccontract is but one\nactivity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable\nto expect [each] contractor to know how much of that\nappropriation remain[ed] available for it at any given\ntime.\u201d Ibid.; see also Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.\n   Finally, the Government argues that legislative history\nsuggests that Congress approved of the distribution of\navailable funds on a uniform, pro rata basis. But \u201ca fun-\ndamental principle of appropriations law is that where\nCongress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without\nstatutorily restricting what can be done with those funds,\na clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose\nlegally binding restrictions.\u201d Lincoln, 508 U. S., at 192\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]ndicia in commit-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Of course, \u201c[t]he terms \u2018lump-sum\u2019 and \u2018line-item\u2019 are relative con-\n\ncepts.\u201d GAO Redbook, p. 6\u2013165. For example, an appropriation for\nbuilding two ships \u201ccould be viewed as a line-item appropriation in\nrelation to the broader \u2018Shipbuilding and Conversion\u2019 category, but it\nwas also a lump-sum appropriation in relation to the two specific\nvessels included.\u201d Ibid. So long as a contractor does not seek payment\nbeyond the amount Congress made legally available for a given pur-\npose, \u201c[t]his factual distinction does not affect the legal principle.\u201d Ibid.\nSee also In re Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 55 Comp.\nGen. 812 (1976).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntee reports and other legislative history as to how the\nfunds should or are expected to be spent do not establish\nany legal requirements on the agency.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). An agency\u2019s discretion to spend\nappropriated funds is cabined only by the \u201ctext of the\nappropriation,\u201d not by Congress\u2019 expectations of how the\nfunds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative\nhistory. Int\u2019l Union, UAW, 746 F. 2d, at 860\u2013861. That\nprinciple also reflects the same ideas underlying Ferris. If\na contractor\u2019s right to payment varied based on a future\ncourt\u2019s uncertain interpretation of legislative history, it\nwould increase the Government\u2019s cost of contracting. Cf.\nCherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 644. That long-run expense\nwould likely far exceed whatever money might be saved in\nany individual case.\n                              IV\n   As the Government points out, the state of affairs re-\nsulting in this case is the product of two congressional\ndecisions which the BIA has found difficult to reconcile.\nOn the one hand, Congress obligated the Secretary to\naccept every qualifying ISDA contract, which includes a\npromise of \u201cfull\u201d funding for all contract support costs. On\nthe other, Congress appropriated insufficient funds to pay\nin full each tribal contractor. The Government\u2019s frustra-\ntion is understandable, but the dilemma\u2019s resolution is the\nresponsibility of Congress.\n   Congress is not short of options. For instance, it could\nreduce the Government\u2019s financial obligation by amending\nISDA to remove the statutory mandate compelling the BIA\nto enter into self-determination contracts, or by giving the\nBIA flexibility to pay less than the full amount of contract\nsupport costs. It could also pass a moratorium on the\nformation of new self-determination contracts, as it has\ndone before. See \u00a7328, 112 Stat. 2681\u2013291 to 292. Or\nCongress could elect to make line-item appropriations,\n18         SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallocating funds to cover tribes\u2019 contract support costs on\na contractor-by-contractor basis. On the other hand, Con-\ngress could appropriate sufficient funds to the BIA to meet\nthe tribes\u2019 total contract support cost needs. Indeed, there\nis some evidence that Congress may do just that. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 112\u2013151, p. 42 (2011) (\u201cThe Committee\nbelieves that the Bureau should pay all contract support\ncosts for which it has contractually agreed and directs the\nBureau to include the full cost of the contract support\nobligations in its fiscal year 2013 budget submission\u201d).\n  The desirability of these options is not for us to say. We\nmake clear only that Congress has ample means at hand\nto resolve the situation underlying the Tribes\u2019 suit. Any\none of the options above could also promote transparency\nabout the Government\u2019s fiscal obligations with respect to\nISDA\u2019s directive that contract support costs be paid in\nfull. For the period in question, however, it is the Govern-\nment\u2014not the Tribes\u2014that must bear the consequences of\nCongress\u2019 decision to mandate that the Government enter\ninto binding contracts for which its appropriation was\nsufficient to pay any individual tribal contractor, but\n\u201cinsufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.\u201d\nCherokee Nation, 543 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7450j\u20131(b),\n450l(c) (Model Agreement \u00a71(b)(4)); that payment of the\ncosts for all tribes is \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a set amount, e.g., 108\nStat. 2511, an amount that would be exceeded here; and\nthat the Secretary \u201cis not required to reduce funding for\nprograms, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make\nfunds available to another tribe,\u201d \u00a7450j\u20131(b). Because the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion cannot be squared with these unambig-\nuous restrictions on the payment of contract support costs,\nI respectfully dissent.\n   The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assis-\ntance Act provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision\nin [the Act], the provision of funds under this [Act] is\nsubject to the availability of appropriations . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n2           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nThis condition is repeated in the Tribes\u2019 contracts with the\nGovernment. App. 206; see also \u00a7450l(c) (Model Agree-\nment \u00a71(b)(4)). The question in this case is whether ap-\npropriations were \u201cavailable\u201d during fiscal years 1994\nthrough 2001 to pay all the contract support costs incurred\nby the Tribes. Only if appropriations were \u201cavailable\u201d\nmay the Tribes hold the Government liable for the unpaid\namounts.\n   Congress restricted the amount of funds \u201cavailable\u201d to\npay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in two ways. First,\nin each annual appropriations statute for the Depart-\nment of the Interior from fiscal year 1994 to 2001, Con-\ngress provided that spending on contract support costs for\nall tribes was \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain amount. The\nfiscal year 1995 appropriations statute is representative.\nIt provided: \u201cFor operation of Indian programs . . . ,\n$1,526,778,000, . . . of which not to exceed $95,823,000\nshall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for\ncontract support costs . . . .\u201d 108 Stat. 2510\u20132511. As the\nCourt acknowledges, ante, at 11\u201312, the phrase \u201cnot to\nexceed\u201d has a settled meaning in federal appropriations\nlaw. By use of the phrase, Congress imposed a cap on the\ntotal funds available for contract support costs in each\nfiscal year. See 2 General Accounting Office, Principles of\nFederal Appropriations Law, p. 6\u20138 (2d ed. 1992) (herein-\nafter GAO Redbook) (\u201c[T]he most effective way to establish\na maximum . . . earmark is by the words \u2018not to exceed\u2019 or\n\u2018not more than\u2019 \u201d).\n   Second, in \u00a7450j\u20131(b) itself\u2014in the very same sentence\nthat conditions funding on the \u201cavailability of appropria-\ntions\u201d\u2014Congress provided that \u201cthe Secretary [of the\nInterior] is not required to reduce funding for programs,\nprojects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds avail-\nable to another tribe or tribal organization under [the Act].\u201d\nAn agency may be required to shift funds from one object\nto another, within statutory limits, when doing so is\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

But the \u201creduction\u201d clause\nin \u00a7450j\u20131(b) expressly provides that the Secretary is \u201cnot\nrequired\u201d to engage in such reprogramming to make one\ntribe\u2019s funds \u201cavailable to another tribe.\u201d It follows that\nappropriations allocated for \u201cprograms, projects, or activi-\nties serving a tribe\u201d are not \u201cavailable\u201d to another tribe,\nunless the Secretary reallocates them. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 13\u201314, the Government shares\nthis view that the \u201creduction\u201d clause \u201cspecifically relieves\nthe Secretary of any obligation to make funds available to\none contractor by reducing payments to others.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 51 (citing Arctic Slope Native Assn., Ltd. v.\nSebelius, 629 F. 3d 1296, 1304 (CA Fed. 2010), cert. pend-\ning, No. 11\u201383 (filed July 18, 2011)).\n   Given these express restrictions established by Con-\ngress\u2014which no one doubts are valid\u2014I cannot agree with\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that appropriations were \u201cavail-\nable\u201d to pay the Tribes\u2019 contract support costs in full.\nOnce the Secretary had allocated all the funds appropriated\nfor contract support costs, no other funds could be used\nfor that purpose without violating the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d re-\nstrictions in the relevant appropriations statutes. The\nCourt agrees. Ante, at 11\u201312. That leaves only one other\npossible source of funds to pay the disputed costs in this\ncase: funds appropriated for contract support costs, but\nallocated to pay such costs incurred by other tribes. Those\nfunds were not \u201cavailable\u201d either, however, because they\nwere \u201cfunding for programs, projects, or activities serving\na tribe,\u201d and the Secretary was not required to reduce\nsuch funding \u201cto make funds available to another tribe.\u201d\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b).\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court fails to\nappreciate the full significance of the \u201creduction\u201d clause in\n\u00a7450j\u20131(b). As construed by the Court, that clause merely\nconfirms that the Secretary \u201cmay allocate funds to one\n4           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntribe at the expense of another.\u201d Ante, at 9. But as ex-\nplained above, the clause does more than that: It also\nestablishes that when the Secretary does allocate funds to\none tribe at the expense of another, the latter tribe has no\nright to those funds\u2014the funds are not \u201cavailable\u201d to it.\nThe fact that the Secretary could have allocated the funds\nto the other tribe is irrelevant. What matters is what the\nSecretary actually does, and once he allocates the funds to\none tribe, they are not \u201cavailable\u201d to another.\n   The Court rejects this reading of the \u201creduction\u201d clause,\non the ground that it would constitute a \u201cradical departure\nfrom ordinary Government contracting principles.\u201d Ante,\nat 13, n. 6. But the fact that the clause operates as a\nconstraint on the \u201cavailability of appropriations\u201d is evident\nnot only from its text, which speaks in terms of \u201cfunds\navailable,\u201d but also from its placement in the statute,\nimmediately following the \u201csubject to the availability\u201d\nclause. Under the Court\u2019s view, by contrast, the \u201creduc-\ntion\u201d clause merely \u201cunderscores the Secretary\u2019s discretion\nto allocate funds among tribes.\u201d Ante, at 13. There is,\nhowever, no reason to suppose that Congress enacted the\nprovision simply to confirm this \u201cordinary\u201d rule. Ibid. We\ngenerally try to avoid reading statutes to be so \u201cinsig-\nnificant.\u201d TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court maintains that its holding is compelled by\nour decision in Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 543\nU. S. 631 (2005). Ante, at 8. Like respondents here, the\ntribes in Cherokee Nation sued the Government for unpaid\ncontract support costs under the Act. Congress had ap-\npropriated certain sums to the Indian Health Service \u201c[f]or\nexpenses necessary to carry out\u201d the Act, e.g., 108 Stat.\n2527\u20132528, but\u2014unlike in this case\u2014those appropriations\n\u201ccontained no relevant statutory restriction,\u201d 543 U. S., at\n637. The Government in Cherokee Nation contended that\nit was not obligated to pay the contract support costs as\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\npromised, in light of the \u201creduction\u201d clause in \u00a7450j\u20131(b).\nThe Government argued that the clause \u201cmakes nonbind-\ning a promise to pay one tribe\u2019s costs where doing so would\nrequire funds that the Government would otherwise de-\nvote to \u2018programs, projects, or activities serving . . . an-\nother tribe.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641 (quoting \u00a7450j\u20131(b)).\n   We ruled against the Government, but not because of\nany disagreement with its reading of the \u201creduction\u201d\nclause. The basis for our decision was instead that \u201cthe\nrelevant congressional appropriations contained other\nunrestricted funds, small in amount but sufficient to pay\nthe claims at issue.\u201d 543 U. S., at 641 (emphasis altered).\nThose funds were allocated for \u201c \u2018inherent federal func-\ntions,\u2019 such as the cost of running the Indian Health Ser-\nvice\u2019s central Washington office.\u201d Id., at 641\u2013642. They\nwere not restricted by the \u201creduction\u201d clause, because they\nwere not funds for \u201c \u2018programs, projects, or activities serv-\ning . . . another tribe.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 641 (quoting \u00a7450j\u20131(b)).\nNor were they restricted by the pertinent appropriations\nstatutes, which, as noted, contained no relevant limiting\nlanguage. See ibid. We therefore held that those funds\u2014\nwhich we described as \u201cunrestricted\u201d throughout our\nopinion, id., at 641, 642, 643, 647\u2014were available to pay\nthe disputed contract support costs.\n   As even the Tribes concede, Cherokee Nation does not\ncontrol this case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (\u201cI don\u2019t think this\ncase is controlled by Cherokee\u201d (counsel for the Tribes)).\nThe reason is not that the appropriations statutes in this\ncase contained \u201cnot to exceed\u201d caps while those in Chero-\nkee Nation did not. The Court is correct that appropriat-\ning an amount \u201cfor\u201d a particular purpose has the same\neffect as providing that appropriations for that purpose\nare \u201cnot to exceed\u201d that amount. Ante, at 11. What makes\nthis case different is where Congress drew the line. In\nCherokee Nation, the statutes capped funding for \u201cexpenses\nnecessary to carry out\u201d the Act, a category that included\n6           SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfunding for both \u201cinherent federal functions\u201d and contract\nsupport costs. Accordingly, funding for one could be used\nfor the other, without violating the cap. Here, by contrast,\nthe statutes capped funding for contract support costs\nspecifically. Thus, once the Secretary exhausted those\nfunds, he could not reprogram other funds\u2014such as\nfunds for \u201cinherent federal functions\u201d\u2014to pay the costs.\nWith the caps in place, moreover, the \u201creduction\u201d clause, as\nexplained above, rendered unavailable the only possible\nsource of funds left: funds already allocated for other\ncontract support costs. Unlike in Cherokee Nation, there-\nfore, there were no unrestricted funds to pay the costs at\nissue in this case. The Court\u2019s quotation from Cherokee\nNation concerning \u201cwhen an \u2018 \u201cunrestricted appropriation\nis sufficient to fund the contract,\u201d \u2019 \u201d ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded) (quoting Cherokee Nation, supra, at 641), is accord-\ningly beside the point.\n   The Court also relies on Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct.\nCl. 542 (1892). That case involved a government contract\nto dredge the Delaware River. When work under the\ncontract stopped because funds from the relevant appro-\npriation had been exhausted, a contractor sued the Gov-\nernment for breach of contract, and the Court of Claims\nheld that he was entitled to recover lost profits. As the\ncourt explained, \u201c[a] contractor who is one of several per-\nsons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable\nwith knowledge of its administration, nor can his legal\nrights be affected or impaired by its maladministration or\nby its diversion, whether legal or illegal, to other objects.\u201d\nId., at 546. That principle, however, cannot \u201cdictate the\nresult in this case.\u201d Ante, at 8. The statute in Ferris\nappropriated an amount \u201c[f]or improving [the] Delaware\nRiver,\u201d which prevented spending for that purpose beyond\nthe specified amount. 20 Stat. 364. But in that case, all\nfunds appropriated for that purpose were equally avail-\nable to all contractors. Here that is not true; \u00a7450j\u20131(b)\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmakes clear that funds allocated to one contractor are not\navailable to another. Thus, the principle in Ferris does not\napply.\n  It is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 10, that each of\nthe Tribes\u2019 contracts provides that the Act and the con-\ntract \u201cshall be liberally construed for the benefit of the\nContractor.\u201d App. 203; see also \u00a7450l(c) (Model Agreement\n\u00a71(a)(2)). But a provision can be construed \u201cliberally\u201d as\nopposed to \u201cstrictly\u201d only when there is some ambiguity to\nconstrue. And here there is none. Congress spoke clearly\nwhen it said that the provision of funds was \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations,\u201d that spending on contract\nsupport costs was \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a specific amount, and\nthat the Secretary was \u201cnot required\u201d to make funds allo-\ncated for one tribe\u2019s costs \u201cavailable\u201d to another. The\nunambiguous meaning of these provisions is that when\nthe Secretary has allocated the maximum amount of funds\nappropriated each fiscal year for contract support costs,\nthere are no other appropriations \u201cavailable\u201d to pay any\nremaining costs.\n  This is hardly a typical government contracts case.\nMany government contracts contain a \u201csubject to the\navailability of appropriations\u201d clause, and many appropri-\nations statutes contain \u201cnot to exceed\u201d language. But this\ncase involves not only those provisions but a third, reliev-\ning the Secretary of any obligation to make funds \u201cavaila-\nble\u201d to one contractor by reducing payments to others.\nSuch provisions will not always appear together, but when\nthey do, we must give them effect. Doing so here, I would\nhold that the Tribes are not entitled to payment of their\ncontract support costs in full, and I would reverse the\ncontrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit.\n</pre>",
