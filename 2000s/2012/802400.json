Argued April 24, 2012—Decided June 18, 2012*\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the\n  Interior to acquire property “for the purpose of providing land to In-\n  dians.” 25 U. S. C. §465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n  Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recog-\n  nized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its be-\n  half a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band\n  intended to use “for gaming purposes.” The Secretary took title to\n  the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives\n  near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Pro-\n  cedure Act (APA), asserting that §465 did not authorize the Secretary\n  to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recog-\n  nized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a va-\n  riety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of\n  the Band’s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and re-\n  quested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary’s\n  decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the\n  Secretary’s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of\n  Patchak’s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to chal-\n  lenge the Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D. C.\n  Circuit reversed and also rejected the Secretary’s and the Band’s al-\n  ternative argument that sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nHeld:\n    1.

PATCHAK\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    Patchak’s action. The APA’s general waiver of the Federal Govern-\n    ment’s immunity from suit does not apply “if any other statute that\n    grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which\n    is sought” by the plaintiff. 5 U. S. C. §702. The Government and\n    Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute. The\n    QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s sovereign immuni-\n    ty from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a “right, title, or interest” in\n    real property that conflicts with a “right, title, or interest” the United\n    States claims. 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). But it contains an exception for\n    “trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a).\n       To determine whether the “Indian lands” exception bars Patchak’s\n    suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of\n    grievance Patchak advances. It does not, because Patchak’s action is\n    not a quiet title action. The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional\n    grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of\n    “quiet title” actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in\n    which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else’s claim, but also\n    asserts his own right to disputed property. Although Patchak’s suit\n    contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim any competing interest\n    in the Bradley Property.\n       Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA\n    does not more broadly encompass any “civil action . . . to adjudicate a\n    disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an\n    interest.” §2409(a). Rather, §2409a includes a host of indications\n    that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit. The\n    Band and Government also contend that the QTA’s specific authori-\n    zation of adverse claimants’ suits creates the negative implication\n    that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government own-\n    ership of land under any statute. That argument is faulty for the\n    reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking\n    different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses. Finally, the Band\n    and Government argue that Patchak’s suit should be treated the\n    same as an adverse claimant’s because both equally implicate the\n    “Indian lands” exception’s policies. That argument must be ad-\n    dressed to Congress. The “Indian lands” exception reflects Congress’s\n    judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—not all suits chal-\n    lenging the Government’s ownership of property. Pp. 4−14.\n       2. Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretary’s ac-\n    quisition. A person suing under the APA must assert an interest\n    that is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regu-\n    lated by the statute” that he says was violated. Association of Data\n    Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153.\n    The Government and Band claim that Patchak’s economic, environ-\n    mental, and aesthetic injuries are not within §465’s zone of interests\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak’s inju-\n  ries relate to the land’s use as a casino. However, §465 has far more\n  to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.\n  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA’s land provisions, and func-\n  tions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’ economic devel-\n  opment. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye to-\n  ward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.\n  The Department’s regulations make this statutory concern with land\n  use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual\n  use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\n  And because §465 encompasses land’s use, neighbors to the use (like\n  Patchak) are reasonable―indeed, predictable―challengers of the Sec-\n  retary’s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\n  or aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.

S. C. §465, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior\n(Secretary) to acquire property “for the purpose of provid-\ning land for Indians.” Ch. 576, §5, 48 Stat. 985. The\nSecretary here acquired land in trust for an Indian tribe\nseeking to open a casino. Respondent David Patchak lives\nnear that land and challenges the Secretary’s decision in\na suit brought under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA), 5 U. S. C. §701 et seq. Patchak claims that the\nSecretary lacked authority under §465 to take title to the\nland, and alleges economic, environmental, and aesthetic\nharms from the casino’s operation.\n  We consider two questions arising from Patchak’s ac-\n2   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntion. The first is whether the United States has sovereign\nimmunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act\n(QTA), 86 Stat. 1176. We think it does not. The second is\nwhether Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary’s acquisition. We think he does. We therefore\nhold that Patchak’s suit may proceed.\n                             I\n   The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michi-\ngan. Although the Band has a long history, the Depart-\nment of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in\n1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,\nthe Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority\nunder §465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland\nTownship, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The\nBand’s application explained that the Band would use the\nproperty “for gaming purposes,” with the goal of generat-\ning the “revenue necessary to promote tribal economic\ndevelopment, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal govern-\nment capable of providing its members with sorely needed\nsocial and educational programs.” App. 52, 41.1\n   In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the\nSecretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley\nProperty in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.\nIn accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary\ncommitted to wait 30 days before taking action, so that\ninterested parties could seek judicial review. See ibid.; 25\nCFR §151.12(b) (2011). Within that window, an organiza-\ntion called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO)\n\n——————\n  1 Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S.

The application thus re-\nquested the Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band to\nopen a casino.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

The Secretary held\noff taking title to the property while that litigation pro-\nceeded. Within the next few years, a District Court and\nthe D. C. Circuit rejected MichGO’s claims. See Michigan\nGambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23, 27–28\n(CADC 2008); Michigan Gambling Opposition v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC 2007).\n   Shortly after the D. C. Circuit ruled against MichGO\n(but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this\nsuit under the APA advancing a different legal theory. He\nasserted that §465 did not authorize the Secretary to\nacquire property for the Band because it was not a feder-\nally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.\nSee App. 37. To establish his standing to bring suit,\nPatchak contended that he lived “in close proximity to” the\nBradley Property and that a casino there would “destroy\nthe lifestyle he has enjoyed” by causing “increased traffic,”\n“increased crime,” “decreased property values,” “an irre-\nversible change in the rural character of the area,” and\n“other aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental prob-\nlems.” Id., at 30–31. Notably, Patchak did not assert any\nclaim of his own to the Bradley Property. He requested\nonly a declaration that the decision to acquire the land\nviolated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary\nfrom accepting title. See id., at 38–39. The Band inter-\nvened in the suit to defend the Secretary’s decision.\n   In January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed\nsuit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO’s case, 555\nU. S. 1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property\ninto trust. That action mooted Patchak’s request for an\ninjunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree\nthat the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal\nGovernment of title to the land. See Brief for Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (herein-\nafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBrief for Respondent 24–25. The month after the Gov-\nernment took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that §465 authorizes the Secre-\ntary to take land into trust only for tribes that were “un-\nder federal jurisdiction” in 1934.2\n  The District Court dismissed the suit without consider-\ning the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling\nthat Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court\nreasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside\n§465’s “zone of interests.” </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/dcd/dVxZ/patchak-v-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (DC\n2009). The D. C. Circuit reversed that determination. See\n632 F. 3d 702, 704–707 (2011). The court also rejected the\nSecretary’s and the Band’s alternative argument that\nby virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nSee id., at 707–712. The latter ruling conflicted with\ndecisions of three Circuits holding that the United States\nhas immunity from suits like Patchak’s. See Neighbors for\nRational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961–\n962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of South-\nern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143–144 (CA9\n1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.\nDepartment of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253–1255 (CA11\n1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.\nCircuit’s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                         II\n  We begin by considering whether the United States’\nsovereign immunity bars Patchak’s suit under the APA.\n——————\n  2 The merits of Patchak’s case are not before this Court. We therefore\n\nexpress no view on whether the Band was “under federal jurisdiction”\nin 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question\nrelates to Patchak’s allegation that the Band was not “federally recog-\nnized” at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397–399 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (discussing this issue).\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat requires us first to look to the APA itself and then,\nfor reasons we will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that\nthe United States has waived its sovereign immunity from\nPatchak’s action.\n  The APA generally waives the Federal Government’s\nimmunity from a suit “seeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer\nor employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official\ncapacity or under color of legal authority.” 5 U. S. C. §702.\nThat waiver would appear to cover Patchak’s suit, which\nobjects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only\nnon-monetary relief. But the APA’s waiver of immunity\ncomes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not\napply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought”\nby the plaintiff. Ibid. That provision prevents plaintiffs\nfrom exploiting the APA’s waiver to evade limitations on\nsuit contained in other statutes. The question thus be-\ncomes whether another statute bars Patchak’s demand for\nrelief.\n  The Government and Band contend that the QTA does\nso. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s\nsovereign immunity from) a particular type of action,\nknown as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting\na “right, title, or interest” in real property that conflicts\nwith a “right, title, or interest” the United States claims.\n28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). The statute, however, contains an\nexception: The QTA’s authorization of suit “does not apply\nto trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a). According\nto the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title\nsuits satisfies the APA’s carve-out and so forbids Patchak’s\nsuit. In the Band’s words, the QTA exception retains “the\nUnited States’ full immunity from suits seeking to chal-\nlenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust\nlands.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.\n  Two hypothetical examples might help to frame consid-\n6   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued\nunder the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Prop-\nerty and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into\ntrust. The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just sug-\ngested. True, it fits within the APA’s general waiver, but\nthe QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which\nthis hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian\nlands (which this hypothetical suit does). In such a cir-\ncumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run\nthe QTA’s limitations. “[W]hen Congress has dealt in par-\nticularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified\nremedy”—including its exceptions—to be exclusive, that is the\nend of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.\nBlock v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School\nLands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H. R. Rep.\nNo. 94–1656, p. 13 (1976)).\n   But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the APA\nclaiming only that use of the Bradley Property was caus-\ning environmental harm, and raising no objection at all to\nthe Secretary’s title. The QTA could not bar that suit\nbecause even though involving Indian lands, it asserts\na grievance altogether different from the kind the statute\nconcerns. JUSTICE SCALIA, in a former life as Assistant\nAttorney General, made this precise point in a letter to\nCongress about the APA’s waiver of immunity (which we\nhasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative\nhistory, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute\n“is not addressed to the type of grievance which the plain-\ntiff seeks to assert,” then the statute cannot prevent an\nAPA suit. Id., at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant\nAtty. Gen. A. Scalia).3\n——————\n  3 According to the dissent, we should look only to the kind of relief a\n\nplaintiff seeks, rather than the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding\nwhether another statute bars an APA action. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). But the dissent’s test is inconsistent with the one we\nadopted in Block, which asked whether Congress had particularly dealt\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We think that principle controls Patchak’s case: The\nQTA’s “Indian lands” clause does not render the Govern-\nment immune because the QTA addresses a kind of griev-\nance different from the one Patchak advances. As we will\nexplain, the QTA—whose full name, recall, is the Quiet\nTitle Act—concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.\nAnd Patchak’s suit is not a quiet title action, because\nalthough it contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim\nany competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact\nmakes the QTA’s “Indian lands” limitation simply inappo-\nsite to this litigation.\n   In reaching this conclusion, we need look no further\nthan the QTA’s text. From its title to its jurisdictional\ngrant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and\nrepeatedly of “quiet title” actions. See 86 Stat. 1176 (“An\nAct [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property\nquiet title actions”); 28 U. S. C. §1346(f) (giving district\ncourts jurisdiction over “civil actions . . . to quiet title” to\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest);\n§1402(d) (setting forth venue for “[a]ny civil action . . . to\nquiet title” to property in which the United States claims\nan interest). That term is universally understood to refer\nto suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone\nelse’s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed\nproperty. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining an “action to quiet title” as “[a] proceeding\n——————\nwith a “claim.” See Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent’s\napproach has no obvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress\npassed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a\nprocurement contract suit except when the suit involved a “discretion-\nary function” of a federal employee. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §2680(a). Under\nthe dissent’s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit\nseeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary\nfunction, no matter what the nature of the claim. That implausible\nresult demonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be un-\nderstood apart from the claims to which they attach.\n8   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI \n\n                  INDIANS v.

C. §2409a(d). If the\nplaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does\nnot), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA\nprovides an option for the United States, if it loses the\nsuit, to pay “just compensation,” rather than return the\nproperty, to the “person determined to be entitled” to it.\n§2409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet\ntitle action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,\nthe Government can satisfy his claim through an award of\nmoney (while still retaining the land for its operations).\nBut the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,\n——————\n  4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical re-\n\nquirements for quiet title suits. See post, at 8. But many States had\nabandoned those requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See\nS. Rep. No. 92–575, p. 6 (1971) (noting “wide differences in State\nstatutory and decisional law” on quiet title suits); Steadman, “Forgive\nthe U. S.

W. 2d 729 (Mo. 1968) (en banc) (same). So Congress in enacting the\nQTA essentially chose one contemporaneous form of quiet title action.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

If\nthe United States loses the suit, an award of just compen-\nsation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he\nmight be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak’s claim.5\n  In two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as\naddressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an owner-\nship interest in Government-held property. In Block v.\nNorth Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461\nU. S. 273 (1982), we considered North Dakota’s claim to\nland that the United States viewed as its own. We held\nthat the State could not circumvent the QTA’s statute of\nlimitations by invoking other causes of action, among\nthem the APA. See id., at 277–278, 286, n. 22. The crux\nof our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA\nto address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had\nbrought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, “citizens assert-\ning title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by\nthe United States” had no recourse; by passing the stat-\nute, “Congress sought to rectify this state of affairs.” Id.,\nat 282. Our decision reflected that legislative purpose:\nCongress, we held, “intended the QTA to provide the\nexclusive means by which adverse claimants could chal-\nlenge the United States’ title to real property.” Id., at 286.\n——————\n  5 The  legislative history, for those who think it useful, further shows\nthat the QTA addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The\nSenate Report states that the QTA aimed to alleviate the “[g]rave\ninequity” to private parties “excluded, without benefit of a recourse to\nthe courts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully theirs.”\nS. Rep. No. 92–575, at 1. Similarly, the House Report notes that the\nhistory of quiet title actions “goes back to the Courts of England,” and\nprovided as examples “a plaintiff whose title to land was continually\nbeing subjected to litigation in the law courts,” and “one who feared\nthat an outstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be\npresented in the future.” H. R. Rep. No. 92–1559, p. 6 (1972). From top\nto bottom, these reports show that Congress thought itself to be author-\nizing bread-and-butter quiet title actions, in which a plaintiff asserts a\nright, title, or interest of his own in disputed land.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nWe repeat: “adverse claimants,” meaning plaintiffs who\nthemselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the\nFederal Government’s.\n   Our decision in United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834\n(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the\nQTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act,\ngoverned the plaintiff’s suit respecting certain allotments\nof land held by the United States. We thought the QTA\nthe relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted\ntitle to the property. Our opinion quoted the plaintiff’s\nown description of her suit: “At no time in this proceeding\ndid [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To the contrary,\nthe claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the\nplaintiff’s] case.” Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent\nin Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p. 3). That fact, we held,\nbrought the suit “within the [QTA’s] scope”: “What [the\nplaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses\nvalid title.” 476 U. S., at 842. So once again, we construed\nthe QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.\n   But Patchak is not an adverse claimant—and so the\nQTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign im-\nmunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot\nbar his suit. Patchak does not contend that he owns the\nBradley Property, nor does he seek any relief correspond-\ning to such a claim. He wants a court to strip the United\nStates of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is\nhis and not so that he can possess it. Patchak’s lawsuit\ntherefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action. He is\nnot trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to\ncircumvent the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception. Rather,\nhe is not bringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely\nthat the Secretary’s decision to take land into trust vio-\nlates a federal statute—a garden-variety APA claim. See\n5 U. S. C. §§706(2)(A), (C) (“The reviewing court shall . . .\nhold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in ac-\ncordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[or] authority”). Because that is true—because in then-\nAssistant Attorney General Scalia’s words, the QTA is\n“not addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]\nseeks to assert,” H. R. Rep. 94–1656, at 28—the QTA’s\nlimitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA’s general\nwaiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.\n   The Band and Government, along with the dissent,\nobject to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First,\nthey contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we\nhave indicated, waiving immunity from suits “to adjudi-\ncate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(a). That\nlanguage, the argument goes, encompasses all actions\ncontesting the Government’s legal interest in land, regard-\nless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself. See\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 19–20; Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 4–6; post, at 8–9 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\nThe QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute\nafter all—as to both its waiver and its “corresponding”\nreservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.\n   But the Band and Government can reach that result\nonly by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.\nThat sentence, more fully quoted, reads: “The United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.”\n§2409a(a) (emphasis added). And as we have already\nnoted, “this section”—§2409a—includes a host of indica-\ntions that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet\ntitle suit: Just recall the section’s title (“Real property\nquiet title actions”), and its pleading requirements (the\nplaintiff “shall set forth with particularity the nature of\nthe right, title, or interest which [he] claims”), and its\npermission to the Government to remedy an infraction by\npaying “just compensation.” Read with reference to all\n12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthese provisions (as well as to the QTA’s contemporane\nously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver\nclause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band’s and the\nGovernment’s argument: That clause speaks not to any\nsuit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government’s title,\nbut only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an\ninterest in the property.\n   The Band and Government next invoke cases holding\nthat “when a statute provides a detailed mechanism for\njudicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of\nparticular persons,” the statute may “impliedly preclude[ ]”\njudicial review “of those issues at the behest of other\npersons.” Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467\nU. S. 340, 349 (1984); see United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government\ncontend, the QTA’s specific authorization of adverse\nclaimants’ suits creates a negative implication: non-\nadverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Govern-\nment ownership of land under any other statute. See\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7–10; Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 7–9; see also post, at 3–4. The QTA,\nsays the Band, thus “preempts [Patchak’s] more general\nremedies.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   But we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases\ninapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bring-\ning a different claim, seeking different relief, from the\nkind the QTA addresses. See supra, at 7–10. To see the\npoint, consider a contrasting example. Suppose the QTA\nauthorized suit only by adverse claimants who could\nassert a property interest of at least a decade’s duration.\nThen suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that\nrequirement (because, say, his claim to title went back\nonly five years) brought suit under a general statute like\nthe APA. We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases\nthe Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary stat-\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could\nbring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude\nothers from doing so. But here, once again, Patchak is not\nbringing a quiet title action at all. He is not claiming to\nown the property, and he is not demanding that the court\ntransfer the property to him. So to succeed in their argu-\nment, the Government and Band must go much further\nthan the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing\none person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of\nrelief, Congress barred another person from bringing\nanother kind of suit seeking another form of relief. Pre-\nsumably, that contention would extend only to suits in-\nvolving similar subject matter—i.e., the Government’s\nownership of property. But that commonality is not itself\nsufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold\nhere, that some general similarity of subject matter can\nalone trigger a remedial statute’s preclusive effect.\n   Last, the Band and Government argue that we should\ntreat Patchak’s suit as we would an adverse claimant’s\nbecause they equally implicate the “Indian lands” excep-\ntion’s policies. According to the Government, allowing\nchallenges to the Secretary’s trust acquisitions would\n“pose significant barriers to tribes[’] . . . ability to promote\ninvestment and economic development on the lands.”\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 24. That harm is the same\nwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\nIndeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this\nsuit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants\nlike Patchak have “the most remote injuries and indirect\ninterests in the land.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see\nReply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11–12; see also post, at\n2, 7, 10.6\n——————\n  6 In a related vein, the dissent argues that our holding will under-\n\nmine the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception by allowing adverse claimants\nto file APA complaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit\n14 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   That argument is not without force, but it must be\naddressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a\njudgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—to a\npoint, but no further. (The “no further” includes not only\nthe “Indian lands” exception, but one for security interests\nand water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar\non jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and\nthe just compensation option discussed earlier.) Perhaps\nCongress would—perhaps Congress should—make the\nidentical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining\nto the Government’s ownership of land. But that is not\nour call. The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak\nhave a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title ac-\ntions, and so should be precluded a fortiori. But all we can\nsay is that Patchak has a different interest. Whether it is\nlesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property\nrights; whether it is greater because implicating public\ninterests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same—\nthat is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.\nAs the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to\nquiet title actions all other suits challenging the Govern-\nment’s ownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like\nPatchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the\nAPA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity.\n                               III\n   We finally consider the Band’s and the Government’s\nalternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this ac-\ntion because he lacks prudential standing. This Court\nhas long held that a person suing under the APA must\nsatisfy not only Article III’s standing requirements, but an\n——————\nthird parties to bring suit on their behalf. See post, at 9–11. But we\nthink that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble conceiv-\ning of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse claimant’s\ninterest in property yet somehow leads to relief recognizing that very\ninterest.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional test: The interest he asserts must be “arguably\nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by\nthe statute” that he says was violated. Association of Data\nProcessing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S.\n150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking\ntitle to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her\nauthority under §465, which authorizes the acquisition of\nproperty “for the purpose of providing land for Indians.”\nAnd he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him\neconomic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby\nproperty owner. See supra, at 3. The Government and\nBand argue that the relationship between §465 and\nPatchak’s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so,\nthey contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisi-\ntion, whereas Patchak’s interests relate to the land’s use\nas a casino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (“The Secre-\ntary’s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any\nparticular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . . [and]\nthus has no impact on [Patchak] or his asserted inter-\nests”); Brief for Federal Petitioners 34 (“[L]and may be\ntaken into trust for a host of purposes that have noth-\ning at all to do with gaming”). We find this argument\nunpersuasive.\n   The prudential standing test Patchak must meet “is not\nmeant to be especially demanding.” Clarke v. Securities\nIndustry Assn., 479 U. S. 388, 399 (1987). We apply the\ntest in keeping with Congress’s “evident intent” when\nenacting the APA “to make agency action presumptively\nreviewable.” Ibid. We do not require any “indication of\ncongressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”\nId., at 399–400.7 And we have always conspicuously\n——————\n  7 For this reason, the Band’s statement that Patchak is “not an Indian\n\nor tribal official seeking land” and does not “claim an interest in ad-\nvancing tribal development,” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 42, is beside the\npoint. The question is not whether §465 seeks to benefit Patchak;\neveryone can agree it does not. The question is instead, as the Band’s\n16 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nincluded the word “arguably” in the test to indicate that\nthe benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff. The test\nforecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s “interests are so\nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be as-\nsumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” Id.,\nat 399.\n   Patchak’s suit satisfies that standard, because §465 has\nfar more to do with land use than the Government and\nBand acknowledge. Start with what we and others have\nsaid about §465’s context and purpose. As the leading\ntreatise on federal Indian law notes, §465 is “the capstone”\nof the IRA’s land provisions. F. Cohen, Handbook of Fed-\neral Indian Law §15.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinaf-\nter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in the\nIRA’s overall effort “to rehabilitate the Indian’s economic\nlife,” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 152\n(1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Land forms\nthe basis” of that “economic life,” providing the foundation\nfor “tourism, manufacturing, mining, logging, . . . and\ngaming.” Cohen §15.01, at 965. Section 465 thus func-\ntions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’\neconomic development. As the D. C. Circuit explained in\nthe MichGO litigation, the section “provid[es] lands suffi-\ncient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.” Michigan\nGambling, 525 F. 3d, at 31 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974)\n(noting the IRA’s economic aspect). So when the Secretary\nobtains land for Indians under §465, she does not do so in\na vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at\nleast one eye directed toward how tribes will use those\n\n——————\nand the Government’s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of\nland use (arguably) fall within §465’s scope—because if they do, a\nneighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the statute’s\nlimits. See infra this page and 16–17.\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Those regulations\npermit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under §465\nif the “land is necessary to facilitate tribal self-\ndetermination, economic development, or Indian housing.”\n25 CFR §151.3(a)(3). And they require the Secretary to\nconsider, in evaluating any acquisition, both “[t]he pur-\nposes for which the land will be used” and the “poten-\ntial conflicts of land use which may arise.” §§151.10(c),\n151.10(f); see §151.11(a). For “off-reservation acquisitions”\nmade “for business purposes”—like the Bradley Property—\nthe regulations further provide that the tribe must\n“provide a plan which specifies the anticipated economic\nbenefits associated with the proposed use.” §151.11(c).\nDOI’s regulations thus show that the statute’s implemen-\ntation centrally depends on the projected use of a given\nproperty.\n    The Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property is\na case in point. The Band’s application to the Secretary\nhighlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.\nSee App. 41 (“[T]rust status for this Property is requested\nin order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans\nto conduct gaming”); id., at 61–62 (“The Tribe intends to\n. . . renovate the existing . . . building into a gaming fa-\ncility . . . . to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming”). Simi-\nlarly, DOI’s notice of intent to take the land into trust\nannounced that the land would “be used for the purpose of\nconstruction and operation of a gaming facility,” which the\nDepartment had already determined would meet the\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act’s requirements. 70 Fed.\nReg. 25596; 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721. So from start to\nfinish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop-\nerty under §465 involved questions of land use.\n    And because §465’s implementation encompasses these\nissues, the interests Patchak raises—at least arguably—\n18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nfall “within the zone . . . protected or regulated by the\nstatute.” If the Government had violated a statute specifi-\ncally addressing how federal land can be used, no one\nwould doubt that a neighboring landowner would have\nprudential standing to bring suit to enforce the statute’s\nlimits. The difference here, as the Government and Band\npoint out, is that §465 specifically addresses only land ac-\nquisition. But for the reasons already given, decisions\nunder the statute are closely enough and often enough\nentwined with considerations of land use to make that\ndifference immaterial. As in this very case, the Secretary\nwill typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind,\nafter assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\nSee 25 CFR §§151.10(c), 151.10(f), 151.11(a). And so\nneighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonable—\nindeed, predictable—challengers of the Secretary’s deci-\nsions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\nor aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.\n                        *     *   *\n  The QTA’s reservation of sovereign immunity does not\nbar Patchak’s suit.

No.\n92–575, p. 6 (1971).\n    Section 2409a(a) provides expansively that “[t]he United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.”\nThat language mirrors the title proposed by the Executive\nBranch for the legislation that Congress largely adopted:\n“A Bill To permit suits to adjudicate disputed titles to\nlands in which the United States claims an interest.” Id.,\nat 7.\n    The remainder of the Act, however, imposes important\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

First, the right to sue “does not apply to trust or\nrestricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a). The Indian lands\nexception reflects the view that “a waiver of immunity in\nthis area would not be consistent with specific commit-\nments [the Government] ha[s] made to the Indians\nthrough treaties and other agreements.” Block, 461 U. S.,\nat 283 (internal quotation marks omitted). By exempting\nIndian lands, Congress ensured that the Government’s\n“solemn obligations” to tribes would not be “abridg[ed] . . .\nwithout the consent of the Indians.” S. Rep. No. 92–575,\nat 4.\n   Second, the Act preserves the United States’ power to\nretain possession or control of any disputed property, even\nif a court determines that the Government’s property\nclaim is invalid. To that end, §2409a(b) “allow[s] the\nUnited States the option of paying money damages in-\nstead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the\nmerits.” Block, 461 U. S., at 283. This provision was\nconsidered essential to addressing the Government’s\n“main objection in the past to waiving sovereign immu-\nnity” where federal land was concerned: that an adverse\njudgment “would make possible decrees ousting the United\nStates from possession and thus interfer[e] with opera-\ntions of the Government.” S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5–6.\nSection 2409a(b) “eliminate[d] cause for such apprehen-\nsion,” by ensuring that—even under the QTA—the United\nStates could not be stripped of its possession or control of\nproperty without its consent. Id., at 6.\n   Finally, the Act limits the class of individuals permitted\nto sue the Government to those claiming a “right, title, or\ninterest” in disputed property. §2409a(d). As we have\nexplained, Congress’ decision to restrict the class entitled\nto relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the\nremainder. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Insti-\ntute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984) (“[W]hen a statute provides\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\na detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particu-\nlar issues at the behest of particular persons, judicial\nreview of those issues at the behest of other persons may\nbe found to be impliedly precluded”). That inference is\nespecially strong here, because the QTA was “enacted\nagainst the backdrop of sovereign immunity.” S. Rep. No.\n94–996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus indicates\nthat Congress concluded that those without any “right, title,\nor interest” in a given property did not have an inter-\nest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government’s\nsovereign immunity.\n  Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its\nimmunity waiver.1 “[W]hen Congress attaches conditions\nto legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates, those conditions must be strictly observed, and\nexceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.” Block,\n461 U. S., at 287. Congress and the Executive Branch\nintended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for\nresolving property title disputes involving the United\nStates. See id., at 285 (describing Act as a “careful and\nthorough remedial scheme”); S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 4\n(§2409a “provides a complete, thoughtful approach to the\nproblem of disputed titles to federally claimed land” (em-\nphasis added)).\n  For that reason, we held that Congress did not intend to\ncreate a “new supplemental remedy” when it enacted the\nAPA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity. Block, 461\n——————\n  1 As we explained in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\n\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 282–283 (1983), Congress’ initial proposal\nlacked such provisions. The Executive Branch, however, strongly\nopposed the original bill, explaining that it was “too broad and sweep-\ning in scope and lacking adequate safeguards to protect the public\ninterest.” Dispute of Titles on Public Lands: Hearings on S. 216 et al.\nbefore the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate Committee on\nInterior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1971). Congress\nultimately agreed, largely adopting the Executive’s substitute bill. See\nBlock, 461 U. S., at 283–284.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 286, n. 22. “ ‘It would require the suspension of\ndisbelief,’ ” we reasoned, “ ‘to ascribe to Congress the de-\nsign to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to\nbe circumvented by artful pleading.’ ” Id., at 285 (quoting\nBrown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff\ncould oust the Government of title to land by means of an\nAPA action, “all of the carefully crafted provisions of the\nQTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national\npublic interest could be averted,” and the “Indian lands\nexception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.” Block,\n461 U. S., at 284–285. We therefore had little difficulty\nconcluding that Congress did not intend to render the\nQTA’s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the\nright to dispute the Government’s title to any lands by\nway of an APA action—and to empower any such plaintiff\nto “disposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed prop-\nerty without being afforded the option of paying damages.”\nId., at 285.\n   It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the condi-\ntions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the\nGovernment’s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he\nseeks to force the Government to relinquish possession\nand title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compen-\nsation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal\nright, title, or interest in the property (strike three). Thus,\nby its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak\nseeks. Compare ante, at 3 (“[A]ll parties agree that the\nsuit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Govern-\nment of title to the [Indian trust] land”), with United\nStates v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834, 842 (1986) (Section\n2409a(a)’s Indian lands exclusion “operates solely to retain\nthe United States’ immunity from suit by third parties\nchallenging the United States’ title to land held in trust\nfor Indians”). Consequently, Patchak may not avoid the\nQTA’s constraints by suing under the APA, a statute\nenacted only four years later. See 5 U. S. C. §702 (render-\n6   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v.

It primarily argues that the careful limitations Con-\ngress imposed upon the QTA’s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity are “simply inapposite” to actions in which the\nplaintiff advances a different “grievance” to that underly-\ning a QTA suit, i.e., cases in which a plaintiff seeks to\n“strip the United States of title to the land . . . not on the\nground that it is his,” but rather because “the Secretary’s\ndecision to take land into trust violates a federal statute.”\nAnte, at 7, 10. This analysis is unmoored from the text of\nthe APA.\n  Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff ’s motivation for\nsuit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his case, but\nonly on whether another statute expressly or impliedly\nforbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly\nseeks—to oust the Government of title to Indian trust\nland—is identical to that forbidden by the QTA. Con-\nversely, the Court’s hypothetical suit, alleging that the\nBradley Property was causing environmental harm, would\nnot be barred by the QTA. See ante, at 6. That is not\nbecause such an action asserts a different “grievance,” but\nbecause it seeks different relief—abatement of a nuisance\nrather than the extinguishment of title.2\n——————\n  2 The majority claims, ante, at 7, n. 3, that this test has “no obvious\n\nlimits,” but it merely applies the text of §702 (which speaks of “relief,”\nnot “grievances”). In any event, the majority’s hypothetical, ibid.,\ncompares apples to oranges. I do not contend that the APA bars all\ninjunctive relief involving Indian lands, simply other suits—like this\none—that seek “to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which\nthe United States claims an interest.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(a). That\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 281. Cf. ante, at 10 (“[Patchak] as-\nserts merely that the Secretary’s decision to take land into\ntrust violates a federal statute”). The relief requested was\nalso identical to that sought here: injunctive relief direct-\ning the United States to “ ‘cease and desist from . . . exer-\ncising privileges of ownership’ ” over the land in question.\n461 U. S., at 278; see also App. 38.\n   The only difference that the majority can point to be-\ntween Block and this case is that Patchak asserts a weaker\ninterest in the disputed property. But that is no reason\nto imagine that Congress intended a different outcome. As\nthe majority itself acknowledges, the harm to the United\nStates and tribes when a plaintiff sues to extinguish the\nGovernment’s title to Indian trust land is identical\n“whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.”\nAnte, at 12. Yet, if the majority is correct, Congress in-\ntended the APA’s waiver of immunity to apply to those\nhypothetical plaintiffs differently. Congress, it suggests,\nintended to permit anyone to circumvent the QTA’s careful\n——————\nresult is entirely consistent with Block—which stated that the APA\n“specifically confers no ‘authority to grant relief if any other statute . . .\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’ ” 461 U. S, at\n286, n. 22 (quoting 5 U. S. C. §702).\n  3 An officer’s suit is an action directly against a federal officer, but\n\nwas otherwise identical to the kind of APA action at issue here. Com-\npare Block, 461 U. S., at 281 (seeking relief because agency official’s\nactions were “ ‘ “not within [his] statutory powers” ’ ”), with 5 U. S. C.\n§706(2)(C) (“The reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside\nagency action . . . found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction,\nauthority, or limitations”).\n8   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v.

This is highly implausible. Unsurprisingly, the\nmajority does not even attempt to explain why Congress\nwould have intended this counterintuitive result.\n   It is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no further\nthan an “ordinary quiet title suit.” Ante, at 11. The action\npermitted by §2409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit. At\ncommon law, equity courts “permit[ted] a bill to quiet title\nto be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a\ndefendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to estab-\nlish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.” Wehr-\nman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314, 321–322 (1894) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither pre-\nrequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante,\nat 7, an act to quiet title is “universally understood” as a\nproceeding “to establish a plaintiff ’s title to land.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). But\n§2409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither\nthe Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land\nat issue.

See S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5. Notwith-\nstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly\nallows suit in circumstances well beyond “bread-and-\nbutter quiet title actions,” ante, at 3, n. 3.5\n   The majority attempts to bolster its reading by empha-\nsizing an unexpected source within §2409a: the clause\nspecifying that the United States may be sued “ ‘in a civil\naction under this section.’ ” Ante, at 11. The majority\nunderstands this clause to narrow the QTA’s scope (and\nits limitations on the Government’s immunity waiver) to\nquiet title claims only. But “this section” speaks broadly\nto civil actions “to adjudicate a disputed title to real prop-\nerty in which the United States claims an interest.”\n§2409a. Moreover, this clause is read most straightfor-\nwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to\nstate that a claimant can file “a civil action under this\nsection”—§2409a—to adjudicate a disputed title in which\nthe United States claims an interest. Regardless of how\none reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA’s\nclear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other\nstatutes are not authorized by the APA. And the QTA\nforbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the\nGovernment to relinquish title to Indian lands.\n   Even if the majority were correct that the QTA itself\nreached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that\n——————\ntime of the Act. Ante, at 8, n. 4. But that substantial variation only\nillustrates the artificiality of the majority’s claim that the Act only\n“addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived.” Ante, at 9, n. 5.\n   5 I recognize, of course, that the QTA is titled “[a]n Act to permit suits\n\nto adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions.” 86 Stat. 1176.\nBut “the title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of [its]\ntext.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528–529\n(1947). As explained above, the substance of Congress’ enactment\nplainly extends more broadly than quiet title actions, mirroring the\nscope of the title proposed by the Government. See supra, at 2.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould establish only that the QTA does not expressly\nforbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does\nnot waive the Government’s sovereign immunity where\nany other statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought.” 5 U. S. C. §702 (emphasis added). The\ntext and history of the QTA, as well as this Court’s prece-\ndent, make clear that the United States intended to retain\nits sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Gov-\nernment of Indian trust land. Patchak’s suit to oust the\nGovernment of such land is therefore, at minimum, im-\npliedly forbidden.6\n                             II\n   Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today’s\nholding will present for courts and the Government. First,\nit will render the QTA’s limitations easily circumvented.\nAlthough those with property claims will remain formally\nprohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,\nsavvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family\nmember or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an “aes-\nthetic” interest in the land but seeking an identical prac-\ntical objective—to divest the Government of title and\npossession. §§2409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from\nobtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.\n   Second, the majority’s holding will frustrate the Gov-\nernment’s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust\ndecisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak\nasserts an “aesthetic” or “environmental” concern with a\nplanned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct\nsuit under statutes like the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nThose challenges generally may be brought within the\nAPA’s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations.

That deadline promoted finality and\nsecurity—necessary preconditions for the investment\nand “economic development” that are central goals of the\nIndian Reorganization Act. Ante, at 16.7 Today’s result\nwill promote the opposite, retarding tribes’ ability to de-\nvelop land until the APA’s 6-year statute of limitations\nhas lapsed.8\n   Finally, the majority’s rule creates substantial uncer-\ntainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA\nclaims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether\nits rule bars from suit only those who “claim any compet-\ning interest” in the disputed land in their complaint, ante,\nat 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but\nplead only that the Government’s title claim violates a\nfederal statute. If the former, the majority’s holding\nwould allow Patchak’s challenge to go forward even if he\nhad some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so\nlong as his complaint did not assert it. That result is\ndifficult to square with Block and Mottaz. If the latter,\nmatters are even more peculiar.

Delayed suits will also inhibit tribes\nfrom investing in uses other than gaming that might be less objection-\nable—like farming or office use.\n  8 Despite notice of the Government’s intent through an organization\n\nwith which he was affiliated, Patchak did not challenge the Govern-\nment’s fee-to-trust decision even though the organization did. See\nMichigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23 (CADC\n2008). Instead, Patchak waited to sue until three years after the\nSecretary’s intent to acquire the property was published.

Argued April 24, 2012—Decided June 18, 2012*\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the\n  Interior to acquire property “for the purpose of providing land to In-\n  dians.” 25 U. S. C. §465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n  Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recog-\n  nized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its be-\n  half a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band\n  intended to use “for gaming purposes.” The Secretary took title to\n  the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives\n  near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Pro-\n  cedure Act (APA), asserting that §465 did not authorize the Secretary\n  to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recog-\n  nized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a va-\n  riety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of\n  the Band’s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and re-\n  quested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary’s\n  decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the\n  Secretary’s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of\n  Patchak’s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to chal-\n  lenge the Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D.

The APA’s general waiver of the Federal Govern-\n    ment’s immunity from suit does not apply “if any other statute that\n    grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which\n    is sought” by the plaintiff. 5 U. S. C. §702. The Government and\n    Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute. The\n    QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s sovereign immuni-\n    ty from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a “right, title, or interest” in\n    real property that conflicts with a “right, title, or interest” the United\n    States claims. 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). But it contains an exception for\n    “trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a).\n       To determine whether the “Indian lands” exception bars Patchak’s\n    suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of\n    grievance Patchak advances. It does not, because Patchak’s action is\n    not a quiet title action. The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional\n    grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of\n    “quiet title” actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in\n    which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else’s claim, but also\n    asserts his own right to disputed property. Although Patchak’s suit\n    contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim any competing interest\n    in the Bradley Property.\n       Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA\n    does not more broadly encompass any “civil action . . . to adjudicate a\n    disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an\n    interest.” §2409(a). Rather, §2409a includes a host of indications\n    that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit. The\n    Band and Government also contend that the QTA’s specific authori-\n    zation of adverse claimants’ suits creates the negative implication\n    that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government own-\n    ership of land under any statute. That argument is faulty for the\n    reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking\n    different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses. Finally, the Band\n    and Government argue that Patchak’s suit should be treated the\n    same as an adverse claimant’s because both equally implicate the\n    “Indian lands” exception’s policies. That argument must be ad-\n    dressed to Congress. The “Indian lands” exception reflects Congress’s\n    judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—not all suits chal-\n    lenging the Government’s ownership of property. Pp. 4−14.\n       2. Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretary’s ac-\n    quisition. A person suing under the APA must assert an interest\n    that is “arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regu-\n    lated by the statute” that he says was violated.

However, §465 has far more\n  to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.\n  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA’s land provisions, and func-\n  tions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’ economic devel-\n  opment. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye to-\n  ward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.\n  The Department’s regulations make this statutory concern with land\n  use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual\n  use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\n  And because §465 encompasses land’s use, neighbors to the use (like\n  Patchak) are reasonable―indeed, predictable―challengers of the Sec-\n  retary’s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\n  or aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.

S. C. §465, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior\n(Secretary) to acquire property “for the purpose of provid-\ning land for Indians.” Ch. 576, §5, 48 Stat. 985. The\nSecretary here acquired land in trust for an Indian tribe\nseeking to open a casino. Respondent David Patchak lives\nnear that land and challenges the Secretary’s decision in\na suit brought under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA), 5 U. S. C. §701 et seq. Patchak claims that the\nSecretary lacked authority under §465 to take title to the\nland, and alleges economic, environmental, and aesthetic\nharms from the casino’s operation.\n  We consider two questions arising from Patchak’s ac-\n2   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v.

We think it does not. The second is\nwhether Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary’s acquisition. We think he does. We therefore\nhold that Patchak’s suit may proceed.\n                             I\n   The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michi-\ngan. Although the Band has a long history, the Depart-\nment of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in\n1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,\nthe Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority\nunder §465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland\nTownship, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The\nBand’s application explained that the Band would use the\nproperty “for gaming purposes,” with the goal of generat-\ning the “revenue necessary to promote tribal economic\ndevelopment, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal govern-\nment capable of providing its members with sorely needed\nsocial and educational programs.” App. 52, 41.1\n   In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the\nSecretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley\nProperty in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.\nIn accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary\ncommitted to wait 30 days before taking action, so that\ninterested parties could seek judicial review. See ibid.; 25\nCFR §151.12(b) (2011). Within that window, an organiza-\ntion called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO)\n\n——————\n  1 Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721,\n\nan Indian tribe may conduct gaming operations on “Indian lands,”\n§2710, which include lands “held in trust by the United States for the\nbenefit of any Indian tribe,” §2703(4)(B). The application thus re-\nquested the Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band to\nopen a casino.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiled suit alleging that the Secretary’s decision violated\nenvironmental and gaming statutes. The Secretary held\noff taking title to the property while that litigation pro-\nceeded. Within the next few years, a District Court and\nthe D. C. Circuit rejected MichGO’s claims. See Michigan\nGambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23, 27–28\n(CADC 2008); Michigan Gambling Opposition v. Norton,\n477 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 2007).\n   Shortly after the D. C. Circuit ruled against MichGO\n(but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this\nsuit under the APA advancing a different legal theory. He\nasserted that §465 did not authorize the Secretary to\nacquire property for the Band because it was not a feder-\nally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.\nSee App. 37. To establish his standing to bring suit,\nPatchak contended that he lived “in close proximity to” the\nBradley Property and that a casino there would “destroy\nthe lifestyle he has enjoyed” by causing “increased traffic,”\n“increased crime,” “decreased property values,” “an irre-\nversible change in the rural character of the area,” and\n“other aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental prob-\nlems.” Id., at 30–31. Notably, Patchak did not assert any\nclaim of his own to the Bradley Property. He requested\nonly a declaration that the decision to acquire the land\nviolated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary\nfrom accepting title. See id., at 38–39. The Band inter-\nvened in the suit to defend the Secretary’s decision.\n   In January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed\nsuit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO’s case, 555\nU. S. 1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property\ninto trust. That action mooted Patchak’s request for an\ninjunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree\nthat the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal\nGovernment of title to the land. See Brief for Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (herein-\nafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBrief for Respondent 24–25. The month after the Gov-\nernment took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that §465 authorizes the Secre-\ntary to take land into trust only for tribes that were “un-\nder federal jurisdiction” in 1934.2\n  The District Court dismissed the suit without consider-\ning the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling\nthat Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court\nreasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside\n§465’s “zone of interests.” 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC\n2009). The D. C. Circuit reversed that determination. See\n632 F. 3d 702, 704–707 (2011). The court also rejected the\nSecretary’s and the Band’s alternative argument that\nby virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nSee id., at 707–712. The latter ruling conflicted with\ndecisions of three Circuits holding that the United States\nhas immunity from suits like Patchak’s. See Neighbors for\nRational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961–\n962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of South-\nern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143–144 (CA9\n1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.\nDepartment of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253–1255 (CA11\n1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.\nCircuit’s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                         II\n  We begin by considering whether the United States’\nsovereign immunity bars Patchak’s suit under the APA.\n——————\n  2 The merits of Patchak’s case are not before this Court. We therefore\n\nexpress no view on whether the Band was “under federal jurisdiction”\nin 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question\nrelates to Patchak’s allegation that the Band was not “federally recog-\nnized” at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397–399 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (discussing this issue).\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat requires us first to look to the APA itself and then,\nfor reasons we will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that\nthe United States has waived its sovereign immunity from\nPatchak’s action.\n  The APA generally waives the Federal Government’s\nimmunity from a suit “seeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer\nor employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official\ncapacity or under color of legal authority.” 5 U. S. C. §702.\nThat waiver would appear to cover Patchak’s suit, which\nobjects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only\nnon-monetary relief. But the APA’s waiver of immunity\ncomes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not\napply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought”\nby the plaintiff. Ibid. That provision prevents plaintiffs\nfrom exploiting the APA’s waiver to evade limitations on\nsuit contained in other statutes. The question thus be-\ncomes whether another statute bars Patchak’s demand for\nrelief.\n  The Government and Band contend that the QTA does\nso. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government’s\nsovereign immunity from) a particular type of action,\nknown as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting\na “right, title, or interest” in real property that conflicts\nwith a “right, title, or interest” the United States claims.\n28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). The statute, however, contains an\nexception: The QTA’s authorization of suit “does not apply\nto trust or restricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a). According\nto the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title\nsuits satisfies the APA’s carve-out and so forbids Patchak’s\nsuit. In the Band’s words, the QTA exception retains “the\nUnited States’ full immunity from suits seeking to chal-\nlenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust\nlands.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.\n  Two hypothetical examples might help to frame consid-\n6   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued\nunder the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Prop-\nerty and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into\ntrust. The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just sug-\ngested. True, it fits within the APA’s general waiver, but\nthe QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which\nthis hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian\nlands (which this hypothetical suit does). In such a cir-\ncumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run\nthe QTA’s limitations. “[W]hen Congress has dealt in par-\nticularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified\nremedy”—including its exceptions—to be exclusive, that is the\nend of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.\nBlock v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School\nLands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H. R. Rep.\nNo. 94–1656, p. 13 (1976)).\n   But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the APA\nclaiming only that use of the Bradley Property was caus-\ning environmental harm, and raising no objection at all to\nthe Secretary’s title. The QTA could not bar that suit\nbecause even though involving Indian lands, it asserts\na grievance altogether different from the kind the statute\nconcerns. JUSTICE SCALIA, in a former life as Assistant\nAttorney General, made this precise point in a letter to\nCongress about the APA’s waiver of immunity (which we\nhasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative\nhistory, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute\n“is not addressed to the type of grievance which the plain-\ntiff seeks to assert,” then the statute cannot prevent an\nAPA suit. Id., at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant\nAtty. Gen. A. Scalia).3\n——————\n  3 According to the dissent, we should look only to the kind of relief a\n\nplaintiff seeks, rather than the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding\nwhether another statute bars an APA action. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). But the dissent’s test is inconsistent with the one we\nadopted in Block, which asked whether Congress had particularly dealt\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We think that principle controls Patchak’s case: The\nQTA’s “Indian lands” clause does not render the Govern-\nment immune because the QTA addresses a kind of griev-\nance different from the one Patchak advances. As we will\nexplain, the QTA—whose full name, recall, is the Quiet\nTitle Act—concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.\nAnd Patchak’s suit is not a quiet title action, because\nalthough it contests the Secretary’s title, it does not claim\nany competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact\nmakes the QTA’s “Indian lands” limitation simply inappo-\nsite to this litigation.\n   In reaching this conclusion, we need look no further\nthan the QTA’s text. From its title to its jurisdictional\ngrant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and\nrepeatedly of “quiet title” actions. See 86 Stat. 1176 (“An\nAct [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property\nquiet title actions”); 28 U. S. C. §1346(f) (giving district\ncourts jurisdiction over “civil actions . . . to quiet title” to\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest);\n§1402(d) (setting forth venue for “[a]ny civil action . . . to\nquiet title” to property in which the United States claims\nan interest). That term is universally understood to refer\nto suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone\nelse’s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed\nproperty. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining an “action to quiet title” as “[a] proceeding\n——————\nwith a “claim.” See Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent’s\napproach has no obvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress\npassed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a\nprocurement contract suit except when the suit involved a “discretion-\nary function” of a federal employee. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §2680(a). Under\nthe dissent’s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit\nseeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary\nfunction, no matter what the nature of the claim. That implausible\nresult demonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be un-\nderstood apart from the claims to which they attach.\n8   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI \n\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto establish a plaintiff’s title to land by compelling the\nadverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever es-\ntopped from asserting it”); Grable & Sons Metal Products,\nInc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 315\n(2005) (“[T]he facts showing the plaintiffs’ title . . . are\nessential parts of the plaintiffs’ [quiet title] cause of ac-\ntion” (quoting Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490\n(1917))).\n   And the QTA’s other provisions make clear that the\nrecurrent statutory term “quiet title action” carries its or-\ndinary meaning. The QTA directs that the complaint in\nsuch an action “shall set forth with particularity the na-\nture of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff\nclaims in the real property.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(d). If the\nplaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does\nnot), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA\nprovides an option for the United States, if it loses the\nsuit, to pay “just compensation,” rather than return the\nproperty, to the “person determined to be entitled” to it.\n§2409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet\ntitle action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,\nthe Government can satisfy his claim through an award of\nmoney (while still retaining the land for its operations).\nBut the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,\n——————\n  4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical re-\n\nquirements for quiet title suits. See post, at 8. But many States had\nabandoned those requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See\nS. Rep. No. 92–575, p. 6 (1971) (noting “wide differences in State\nstatutory and decisional law” on quiet title suits); Steadman, “Forgive\nthe U. S. Its Trespasses?”: Land Title Disputes With the Sovereign—\nPresent Remedies and Prospective Reforms, 1972 Duke L. J. 15, 48–49,\nand n. 152 (stating that cases had disputed whether a quiet title\nplaintiff needed to possess the land); Welch v. Kai, 4 Cal. App. 3d 374,\n380–381, 84 Cal. Rptr. 619, 622–623 (1970) (allowing a quiet title action\nwhen the plaintiff claimed only an easement); Benson v. Fekete, 424\nS. W. 2d 729 (Mo. 1968) (en banc) (same). So Congress in enacting the\nQTA essentially chose one contemporaneous form of quiet title action.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere Patchak does not assert a right to the property. If\nthe United States loses the suit, an award of just compen-\nsation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he\nmight be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak’s claim.5\n  In two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as\naddressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an owner-\nship interest in Government-held property. In Block v.\nNorth Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461\nU. S. 273 (1982), we considered North Dakota’s claim to\nland that the United States viewed as its own. We held\nthat the State could not circumvent the QTA’s statute of\nlimitations by invoking other causes of action, among\nthem the APA. See id., at 277–278, 286, n. 22. The crux\nof our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA\nto address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had\nbrought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, “citizens assert-\ning title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by\nthe United States” had no recourse; by passing the stat-\nute, “Congress sought to rectify this state of affairs.” Id.,\nat 282. Our decision reflected that legislative purpose:\nCongress, we held, “intended the QTA to provide the\nexclusive means by which adverse claimants could chal-\nlenge the United States’ title to real property.” Id., at 286.\n——————\n  5 The  legislative history, for those who think it useful, further shows\nthat the QTA addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The\nSenate Report states that the QTA aimed to alleviate the “[g]rave\ninequity” to private parties “excluded, without benefit of a recourse to\nthe courts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully theirs.”\nS. Rep. No. 92–575, at 1. Similarly, the House Report notes that the\nhistory of quiet title actions “goes back to the Courts of England,” and\nprovided as examples “a plaintiff whose title to land was continually\nbeing subjected to litigation in the law courts,” and “one who feared\nthat an outstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be\npresented in the future.” H. R. Rep. No. 92–1559, p. 6 (1972). From top\nto bottom, these reports show that Congress thought itself to be author-\nizing bread-and-butter quiet title actions, in which a plaintiff asserts a\nright, title, or interest of his own in disputed land.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nWe repeat: “adverse claimants,” meaning plaintiffs who\nthemselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the\nFederal Government’s.\n   Our decision in United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834\n(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the\nQTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act,\ngoverned the plaintiff’s suit respecting certain allotments\nof land held by the United States. We thought the QTA\nthe relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted\ntitle to the property. Our opinion quoted the plaintiff’s\nown description of her suit: “At no time in this proceeding\ndid [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To the contrary,\nthe claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the\nplaintiff’s] case.” Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent\nin Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p. 3). That fact, we held,\nbrought the suit “within the [QTA’s] scope”: “What [the\nplaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses\nvalid title.” 476 U. S., at 842. So once again, we construed\nthe QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.\n   But Patchak is not an adverse claimant—and so the\nQTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign im-\nmunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot\nbar his suit. Patchak does not contend that he owns the\nBradley Property, nor does he seek any relief correspond-\ning to such a claim. He wants a court to strip the United\nStates of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is\nhis and not so that he can possess it. Patchak’s lawsuit\ntherefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action. He is\nnot trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to\ncircumvent the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception. Rather,\nhe is not bringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely\nthat the Secretary’s decision to take land into trust vio-\nlates a federal statute—a garden-variety APA claim. See\n5 U. S. C. §§706(2)(A), (C) (“The reviewing court shall . . .\nhold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in ac-\ncordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[or] authority”). Because that is true—because in then-\nAssistant Attorney General Scalia’s words, the QTA is\n“not addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]\nseeks to assert,” H. R. Rep. 94–1656, at 28—the QTA’s\nlimitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA’s general\nwaiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.\n   The Band and Government, along with the dissent,\nobject to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First,\nthey contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we\nhave indicated, waiving immunity from suits “to adjudi-\ncate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(a). That\nlanguage, the argument goes, encompasses all actions\ncontesting the Government’s legal interest in land, regard-\nless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself. See\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 19–20; Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 4–6; post, at 8–9 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\nThe QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute\nafter all—as to both its waiver and its “corresponding”\nreservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.\n   But the Band and Government can reach that result\nonly by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.\nThat sentence, more fully quoted, reads: “The United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.”\n§2409a(a) (emphasis added). And as we have already\nnoted, “this section”—§2409a—includes a host of indica-\ntions that the “civil action” at issue is an ordinary quiet\ntitle suit: Just recall the section’s title (“Real property\nquiet title actions”), and its pleading requirements (the\nplaintiff “shall set forth with particularity the nature of\nthe right, title, or interest which [he] claims”), and its\npermission to the Government to remedy an infraction by\npaying “just compensation.” Read with reference to all\n12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthese provisions (as well as to the QTA’s contemporane\nously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver\nclause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band’s and the\nGovernment’s argument: That clause speaks not to any\nsuit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government’s title,\nbut only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an\ninterest in the property.\n   The Band and Government next invoke cases holding\nthat “when a statute provides a detailed mechanism for\njudicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of\nparticular persons,” the statute may “impliedly preclude[ ]”\njudicial review “of those issues at the behest of other\npersons.” Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467\nU. S. 340, 349 (1984); see United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government\ncontend, the QTA’s specific authorization of adverse\nclaimants’ suits creates a negative implication: non-\nadverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Govern-\nment ownership of land under any other statute. See\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7–10; Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 7–9; see also post, at 3–4. The QTA,\nsays the Band, thus “preempts [Patchak’s] more general\nremedies.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   But we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases\ninapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bring-\ning a different claim, seeking different relief, from the\nkind the QTA addresses. See supra, at 7–10. To see the\npoint, consider a contrasting example. Suppose the QTA\nauthorized suit only by adverse claimants who could\nassert a property interest of at least a decade’s duration.\nThen suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that\nrequirement (because, say, his claim to title went back\nonly five years) brought suit under a general statute like\nthe APA. We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases\nthe Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary stat-\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could\nbring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude\nothers from doing so. But here, once again, Patchak is not\nbringing a quiet title action at all. He is not claiming to\nown the property, and he is not demanding that the court\ntransfer the property to him. So to succeed in their argu-\nment, the Government and Band must go much further\nthan the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing\none person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of\nrelief, Congress barred another person from bringing\nanother kind of suit seeking another form of relief. Pre-\nsumably, that contention would extend only to suits in-\nvolving similar subject matter—i.e., the Government’s\nownership of property. But that commonality is not itself\nsufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold\nhere, that some general similarity of subject matter can\nalone trigger a remedial statute’s preclusive effect.\n   Last, the Band and Government argue that we should\ntreat Patchak’s suit as we would an adverse claimant’s\nbecause they equally implicate the “Indian lands” excep-\ntion’s policies. According to the Government, allowing\nchallenges to the Secretary’s trust acquisitions would\n“pose significant barriers to tribes[’] . . . ability to promote\ninvestment and economic development on the lands.”\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 24. That harm is the same\nwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\nIndeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this\nsuit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants\nlike Patchak have “the most remote injuries and indirect\ninterests in the land.” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see\nReply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11–12; see also post, at\n2, 7, 10.6\n——————\n  6 In a related vein, the dissent argues that our holding will under-\n\nmine the QTA’s “Indian lands” exception by allowing adverse claimants\nto file APA complaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit\n14 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   That argument is not without force, but it must be\naddressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a\njudgment about how far to allow quiet title suits—to a\npoint, but no further. (The “no further” includes not only\nthe “Indian lands” exception, but one for security interests\nand water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar\non jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and\nthe just compensation option discussed earlier.) Perhaps\nCongress would—perhaps Congress should—make the\nidentical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining\nto the Government’s ownership of land. But that is not\nour call. The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak\nhave a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title ac-\ntions, and so should be precluded a fortiori. But all we can\nsay is that Patchak has a different interest. Whether it is\nlesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property\nrights; whether it is greater because implicating public\ninterests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same—\nthat is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.\nAs the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to\nquiet title actions all other suits challenging the Govern-\nment’s ownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like\nPatchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the\nAPA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity.\n                               III\n   We finally consider the Band’s and the Government’s\nalternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this ac-\ntion because he lacks prudential standing. This Court\nhas long held that a person suing under the APA must\nsatisfy not only Article III’s standing requirements, but an\n——————\nthird parties to bring suit on their behalf. See post, at 9–11. But we\nthink that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble conceiv-\ning of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse claimant’s\ninterest in property yet somehow leads to relief recognizing that very\ninterest.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional test: The interest he asserts must be “arguably\nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by\nthe statute” that he says was violated. Association of Data\nProcessing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S.\n150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking\ntitle to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her\nauthority under §465, which authorizes the acquisition of\nproperty “for the purpose of providing land for Indians.”\nAnd he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him\neconomic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby\nproperty owner. See supra, at 3. The Government and\nBand argue that the relationship between §465 and\nPatchak’s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so,\nthey contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisi-\ntion, whereas Patchak’s interests relate to the land’s use\nas a casino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (“The Secre-\ntary’s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any\nparticular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . . [and]\nthus has no impact on [Patchak] or his asserted inter-\nests”); Brief for Federal Petitioners 34 (“[L]and may be\ntaken into trust for a host of purposes that have noth-\ning at all to do with gaming”). We find this argument\nunpersuasive.\n   The prudential standing test Patchak must meet “is not\nmeant to be especially demanding.” Clarke v. Securities\nIndustry Assn., 479 U. S. 388, 399 (1987). We apply the\ntest in keeping with Congress’s “evident intent” when\nenacting the APA “to make agency action presumptively\nreviewable.” Ibid. We do not require any “indication of\ncongressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”\nId., at 399–400.7 And we have always conspicuously\n——————\n  7 For this reason, the Band’s statement that Patchak is “not an Indian\n\nor tribal official seeking land” and does not “claim an interest in ad-\nvancing tribal development,” Brief for Tribal Petitioner 42, is beside the\npoint. The question is not whether §465 seeks to benefit Patchak;\neveryone can agree it does not. The question is instead, as the Band’s\n16 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nincluded the word “arguably” in the test to indicate that\nthe benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff. The test\nforecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s “interests are so\nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be as-\nsumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.” Id.,\nat 399.\n   Patchak’s suit satisfies that standard, because §465 has\nfar more to do with land use than the Government and\nBand acknowledge. Start with what we and others have\nsaid about §465’s context and purpose. As the leading\ntreatise on federal Indian law notes, §465 is “the capstone”\nof the IRA’s land provisions. F. Cohen, Handbook of Fed-\neral Indian Law §15.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinaf-\nter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in the\nIRA’s overall effort “to rehabilitate the Indian’s economic\nlife,” Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 152\n(1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Land forms\nthe basis” of that “economic life,” providing the foundation\nfor “tourism, manufacturing, mining, logging, . . . and\ngaming.” Cohen §15.01, at 965. Section 465 thus func-\ntions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes’\neconomic development. As the D. C. Circuit explained in\nthe MichGO litigation, the section “provid[es] lands suffi-\ncient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.” Michigan\nGambling, 525 F. 3d, at 31 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974)\n(noting the IRA’s economic aspect). So when the Secretary\nobtains land for Indians under §465, she does not do so in\na vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at\nleast one eye directed toward how tribes will use those\n\n——————\nand the Government’s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of\nland use (arguably) fall within §465’s scope—because if they do, a\nneighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the statute’s\nlimits. See infra this page and 16–17.\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Those regulations\npermit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under §465\nif the “land is necessary to facilitate tribal self-\ndetermination, economic development, or Indian housing.”\n25 CFR §151.3(a)(3). And they require the Secretary to\nconsider, in evaluating any acquisition, both “[t]he pur-\nposes for which the land will be used” and the “poten-\ntial conflicts of land use which may arise.” §§151.10(c),\n151.10(f); see §151.11(a). For “off-reservation acquisitions”\nmade “for business purposes”—like the Bradley Property—\nthe regulations further provide that the tribe must\n“provide a plan which specifies the anticipated economic\nbenefits associated with the proposed use.” §151.11(c).\nDOI’s regulations thus show that the statute’s implemen-\ntation centrally depends on the projected use of a given\nproperty.\n    The Secretary’s acquisition of the Bradley Property is\na case in point. The Band’s application to the Secretary\nhighlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.\nSee App. 41 (“[T]rust status for this Property is requested\nin order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans\nto conduct gaming”); id., at 61–62 (“The Tribe intends to\n. . . renovate the existing . . . building into a gaming fa-\ncility . . . . to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming”). Simi-\nlarly, DOI’s notice of intent to take the land into trust\nannounced that the land would “be used for the purpose of\nconstruction and operation of a gaming facility,” which the\nDepartment had already determined would meet the\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act’s requirements. 70 Fed.\nReg. 25596; 25 U. S. C. §§2701–2721. So from start to\nfinish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop-\nerty under §465 involved questions of land use.\n    And because §465’s implementation encompasses these\nissues, the interests Patchak raises—at least arguably—\n18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nfall “within the zone . . . protected or regulated by the\nstatute.” If the Government had violated a statute specifi-\ncally addressing how federal land can be used, no one\nwould doubt that a neighboring landowner would have\nprudential standing to bring suit to enforce the statute’s\nlimits. The difference here, as the Government and Band\npoint out, is that §465 specifically addresses only land ac-\nquisition. But for the reasons already given, decisions\nunder the statute are closely enough and often enough\nentwined with considerations of land use to make that\ndifference immaterial. As in this very case, the Secretary\nwill typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind,\nafter assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\nSee 25 CFR §§151.10(c), 151.10(f), 151.11(a). And so\nneighbors to the use (like Patchak) are reasonable—\nindeed, predictable—challengers of the Secretary’s deci-\nsions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\nor aesthetic, come within §465’s regulatory ambit.\n                        *     *   *\n  The QTA’s reservation of sovereign immunity does not\nbar Patchak’s suit.

S. C. §2409a(a).\nIn so doing, Congress was careful to retain the Govern-\nment’s sovereign immunity with respect to particular\nclaimants, particular categories of land, and particular\nremedies. Congress and the Executive Branch considered\nthese “carefully crafted provisions” essential to the im-\nmunity waiver and “necessary for the protection of the\nnational public interest.” Block v. North Dakota ex rel.\nBoard of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 284–285\n(1983).\n  The Court’s opinion sanctions an end-run around these\nvital limitations on the Government’s waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. After today, any person may sue under the\n2   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI \n\n                  INDIANS v.

That outcome cannot be squared with the\nAPA’s express admonition that it confers no “authority to\ngrant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”\n5 U. S. C. §702. The Court’s holding not only creates\nperverse incentives for private litigants, but also exposes\nthe Government’s ownership of land to costly and pro-\nlonged challenges. Because I believe those results to be\ninconsistent with the QTA and the APA, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n    Congress enacted the QTA to provide a comprehensive\nsolution to the problem of real-property disputes between\nprivate parties and the United States. The QTA strikes a\ncareful balance between private parties’ desire to adjudi-\ncate such disputes, and the Government’s desire to impose\n“ ‘appropriate safeguards’ ” on any waiver of sovereign\nimmunity to ensure “ ‘the protection of the public inter-\nest.’ ” Block, 461 U. S., at 282–283; see also S. Rep. No.\n92–575, p. 6 (1971).\n    Section 2409a(a) provides expansively that “[t]he United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.”\nThat language mirrors the title proposed by the Executive\nBranch for the legislation that Congress largely adopted:\n“A Bill To permit suits to adjudicate disputed titles to\nlands in which the United States claims an interest.” Id.,\nat 7.\n    The remainder of the Act, however, imposes important\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

First, the right to sue “does not apply to trust or\nrestricted Indian lands.” §2409a(a). The Indian lands\nexception reflects the view that “a waiver of immunity in\nthis area would not be consistent with specific commit-\nments [the Government] ha[s] made to the Indians\nthrough treaties and other agreements.” Block, 461 U. S.,\nat 283 (internal quotation marks omitted). By exempting\nIndian lands, Congress ensured that the Government’s\n“solemn obligations” to tribes would not be “abridg[ed] . . .\nwithout the consent of the Indians.” S. Rep. No. 92–575,\nat 4.\n   Second, the Act preserves the United States’ power to\nretain possession or control of any disputed property, even\nif a court determines that the Government’s property\nclaim is invalid. To that end, §2409a(b) “allow[s] the\nUnited States the option of paying money damages in-\nstead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the\nmerits.” Block, 461 U. S., at 283. This provision was\nconsidered essential to addressing the Government’s\n“main objection in the past to waiving sovereign immu-\nnity” where federal land was concerned: that an adverse\njudgment “would make possible decrees ousting the United\nStates from possession and thus interfer[e] with opera-\ntions of the Government.” S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5–6.\nSection 2409a(b) “eliminate[d] cause for such apprehen-\nsion,” by ensuring that—even under the QTA—the United\nStates could not be stripped of its possession or control of\nproperty without its consent. Id., at 6.\n   Finally, the Act limits the class of individuals permitted\nto sue the Government to those claiming a “right, title, or\ninterest” in disputed property. §2409a(d). As we have\nexplained, Congress’ decision to restrict the class entitled\nto relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the\nremainder. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Insti-\ntute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984) (“[W]hen a statute provides\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\na detailed mechanism for judicial consideration of particu-\nlar issues at the behest of particular persons, judicial\nreview of those issues at the behest of other persons may\nbe found to be impliedly precluded”). That inference is\nespecially strong here, because the QTA was “enacted\nagainst the backdrop of sovereign immunity.” S. Rep. No.\n94–996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus indicates\nthat Congress concluded that those without any “right, title,\nor interest” in a given property did not have an inter-\nest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government’s\nsovereign immunity.\n  Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its\nimmunity waiver.1 “[W]hen Congress attaches conditions\nto legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates, those conditions must be strictly observed, and\nexceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.” Block,\n461 U. S., at 287. Congress and the Executive Branch\nintended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for\nresolving property title disputes involving the United\nStates. See id., at 285 (describing Act as a “careful and\nthorough remedial scheme”); S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 4\n(§2409a “provides a complete, thoughtful approach to the\nproblem of disputed titles to federally claimed land” (em-\nphasis added)).\n  For that reason, we held that Congress did not intend to\ncreate a “new supplemental remedy” when it enacted the\nAPA’s general waiver of sovereign immunity. Block, 461\n——————\n  1 As we explained in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\n\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 282–283 (1983), Congress’ initial proposal\nlacked such provisions. The Executive Branch, however, strongly\nopposed the original bill, explaining that it was “too broad and sweep-\ning in scope and lacking adequate safeguards to protect the public\ninterest.” Dispute of Titles on Public Lands: Hearings on S. 216 et al.\nbefore the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate Committee on\nInterior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1971). Congress\nultimately agreed, largely adopting the Executive’s substitute bill. See\nBlock, 461 U. S., at 283–284.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 286, n. 22. “ ‘It would require the suspension of\ndisbelief,’ ” we reasoned, “ ‘to ascribe to Congress the de-\nsign to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to\nbe circumvented by artful pleading.’ ” Id., at 285 (quoting\nBrown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff\ncould oust the Government of title to land by means of an\nAPA action, “all of the carefully crafted provisions of the\nQTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national\npublic interest could be averted,” and the “Indian lands\nexception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.” Block,\n461 U. S., at 284–285. We therefore had little difficulty\nconcluding that Congress did not intend to render the\nQTA’s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the\nright to dispute the Government’s title to any lands by\nway of an APA action—and to empower any such plaintiff\nto “disposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed prop-\nerty without being afforded the option of paying damages.”\nId., at 285.\n   It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the condi-\ntions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the\nGovernment’s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he\nseeks to force the Government to relinquish possession\nand title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compen-\nsation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal\nright, title, or interest in the property (strike three). Thus,\nby its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak\nseeks. Compare ante, at 3 (“[A]ll parties agree that the\nsuit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Govern-\nment of title to the [Indian trust] land”), with United\nStates v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834, 842 (1986) (Section\n2409a(a)’s Indian lands exclusion “operates solely to retain\nthe United States’ immunity from suit by third parties\nchallenging the United States’ title to land held in trust\nfor Indians”). Consequently, Patchak may not avoid the\nQTA’s constraints by suing under the APA, a statute\nenacted only four years later. See 5 U. S.

It primarily argues that the careful limitations Con-\ngress imposed upon the QTA’s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity are “simply inapposite” to actions in which the\nplaintiff advances a different “grievance” to that underly-\ning a QTA suit, i.e., cases in which a plaintiff seeks to\n“strip the United States of title to the land . . . not on the\nground that it is his,” but rather because “the Secretary’s\ndecision to take land into trust violates a federal statute.”\nAnte, at 7, 10. This analysis is unmoored from the text of\nthe APA.\n  Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff ’s motivation for\nsuit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his case, but\nonly on whether another statute expressly or impliedly\nforbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly\nseeks—to oust the Government of title to Indian trust\nland—is identical to that forbidden by the QTA. Con-\nversely, the Court’s hypothetical suit, alleging that the\nBradley Property was causing environmental harm, would\nnot be barred by the QTA. See ante, at 6. That is not\nbecause such an action asserts a different “grievance,” but\nbecause it seeks different relief—abatement of a nuisance\nrather than the extinguishment of title.2\n——————\n  2 The majority claims, ante, at 7, n. 3, that this test has “no obvious\n\nlimits,” but it merely applies the text of §702 (which speaks of “relief,”\nnot “grievances”). In any event, the majority’s hypothetical, ibid.,\ncompares apples to oranges. I do not contend that the APA bars all\ninjunctive relief involving Indian lands, simply other suits—like this\none—that seek “to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which\nthe United States claims an interest.” 28 U. S. C. §2409a(a). That\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 281. Cf. ante, at 10 (“[Patchak] as-\nserts merely that the Secretary’s decision to take land into\ntrust violates a federal statute”). The relief requested was\nalso identical to that sought here: injunctive relief direct-\ning the United States to “ ‘cease and desist from . . . exer-\ncising privileges of ownership’ ” over the land in question.\n461 U. S., at 278; see also App. 38.\n   The only difference that the majority can point to be-\ntween Block and this case is that Patchak asserts a weaker\ninterest in the disputed property. But that is no reason\nto imagine that Congress intended a different outcome. As\nthe majority itself acknowledges, the harm to the United\nStates and tribes when a plaintiff sues to extinguish the\nGovernment’s title to Indian trust land is identical\n“whether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.”\nAnte, at 12. Yet, if the majority is correct, Congress in-\ntended the APA’s waiver of immunity to apply to those\nhypothetical plaintiffs differently. Congress, it suggests,\nintended to permit anyone to circumvent the QTA’s careful\n——————\nresult is entirely consistent with Block—which stated that the APA\n“specifically confers no ‘authority to grant relief if any other statute . . .\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’ ” 461 U. S, at\n286, n. 22 (quoting 5 U. S. C. §702).\n  3 An officer’s suit is an action directly against a federal officer, but\n\nwas otherwise identical to the kind of APA action at issue here.

This is highly implausible. Unsurprisingly, the\nmajority does not even attempt to explain why Congress\nwould have intended this counterintuitive result.\n   It is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no further\nthan an “ordinary quiet title suit.” Ante, at 11. The action\npermitted by §2409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit. At\ncommon law, equity courts “permit[ted] a bill to quiet title\nto be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a\ndefendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to estab-\nlish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.” Wehr-\nman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314, 321–322 (1894) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither pre-\nrequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante,\nat 7, an act to quiet title is “universally understood” as a\nproceeding “to establish a plaintiff ’s title to land.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). But\n§2409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither\nthe Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land\nat issue.

See S. Rep. No. 92–575, at 5. Notwith-\nstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly\nallows suit in circumstances well beyond “bread-and-\nbutter quiet title actions,” ante, at 3, n. 3.5\n   The majority attempts to bolster its reading by empha-\nsizing an unexpected source within §2409a: the clause\nspecifying that the United States may be sued “ ‘in a civil\naction under this section.’ ” Ante, at 11. The majority\nunderstands this clause to narrow the QTA’s scope (and\nits limitations on the Government’s immunity waiver) to\nquiet title claims only. But “this section” speaks broadly\nto civil actions “to adjudicate a disputed title to real prop-\nerty in which the United States claims an interest.”\n§2409a. Moreover, this clause is read most straightfor-\nwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to\nstate that a claimant can file “a civil action under this\nsection”—§2409a—to adjudicate a disputed title in which\nthe United States claims an interest. Regardless of how\none reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA’s\nclear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other\nstatutes are not authorized by the APA. And the QTA\nforbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the\nGovernment to relinquish title to Indian lands.\n   Even if the majority were correct that the QTA itself\nreached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that\n——————\ntime of the Act. Ante, at 8, n. 4. But that substantial variation only\nillustrates the artificiality of the majority’s claim that the Act only\n“addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived.” Ante, at 9, n. 5.\n   5 I recognize, of course, that the QTA is titled “[a]n Act to permit suits\n\nto adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions.” 86 Stat. 1176.\nBut “the title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of [its]\ntext.” Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528–529\n(1947). As explained above, the substance of Congress’ enactment\nplainly extends more broadly than quiet title actions, mirroring the\nscope of the title proposed by the Government. See supra, at 2.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould establish only that the QTA does not expressly\nforbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does\nnot waive the Government’s sovereign immunity where\nany other statute “expressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought.” 5 U. S. C. §702 (emphasis added). The\ntext and history of the QTA, as well as this Court’s prece-\ndent, make clear that the United States intended to retain\nits sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Gov-\nernment of Indian trust land. Patchak’s suit to oust the\nGovernment of such land is therefore, at minimum, im-\npliedly forbidden.6\n                             II\n   Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today’s\nholding will present for courts and the Government. First,\nit will render the QTA’s limitations easily circumvented.\nAlthough those with property claims will remain formally\nprohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,\nsavvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family\nmember or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an “aes-\nthetic” interest in the land but seeking an identical prac-\ntical objective—to divest the Government of title and\npossession. §§2409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from\nobtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.\n   Second, the majority’s holding will frustrate the Gov-\nernment’s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust\ndecisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak\nasserts an “aesthetic” or “environmental” concern with a\nplanned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct\nsuit under statutes like the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nThose challenges generally may be brought within the\nAPA’s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations.

Until today, parties seeking to challenge\nsuch decisions had only a 30-day window to seek judi-\ncial review.     25 CFR §151.12 (2011); 61 Fed. Reg.\n18,082–18,083 (1996). That deadline promoted finality and\nsecurity—necessary preconditions for the investment\nand “economic development” that are central goals of the\nIndian Reorganization Act. Ante, at 16.7 Today’s result\nwill promote the opposite, retarding tribes’ ability to de-\nvelop land until the APA’s 6-year statute of limitations\nhas lapsed.8\n   Finally, the majority’s rule creates substantial uncer-\ntainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA\nclaims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether\nits rule bars from suit only those who “claim any compet-\ning interest” in the disputed land in their complaint, ante,\nat 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but\nplead only that the Government’s title claim violates a\nfederal statute. If the former, the majority’s holding\nwould allow Patchak’s challenge to go forward even if he\nhad some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so\nlong as his complaint did not assert it. That result is\ndifficult to square with Block and Mottaz. If the latter,\nmatters are even more peculiar.

Delayed suits will also inhibit tribes\nfrom investing in uses other than gaming that might be less objection-\nable—like farming or office use.\n  8 Despite notice of the Government’s intent through an organization\n\nwith which he was affiliated, Patchak did not challenge the Govern-\nment’s fee-to-trust decision even though the organization did. See\nMichigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23 (CADC\n2008). Instead, Patchak waited to sue until three years after the\nSecretary’s intent to acquire the property was published.
