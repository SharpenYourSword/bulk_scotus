Argued April 24, 2012\u2014Decided June 18, 2012*\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the\n  Interior to acquire property \u201cfor the purpose of providing land to In-\n  dians.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n  Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recog-\n  nized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its be-\n  half a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band\n  intended to use \u201cfor gaming purposes.\u201d The Secretary took title to\n  the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives\n  near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Pro-\n  cedure Act (APA), asserting that \u00a7465 did not authorize the Secretary\n  to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recog-\n  nized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a va-\n  riety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of\n  the Band\u2019s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and re-\n  quested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary\u2019s\n  decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the\n  Secretary\u2019s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of\n  Patchak\u2019s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to chal-\n  lenge the Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D. C.\n  Circuit reversed and also rejected the Secretary\u2019s and the Band\u2019s al-\n  ternative argument that sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nHeld:\n    1. The United States has waived its sovereign immunity from\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u2013247, Salazar, Secretary of the Interior, et al. v.\nPatchak et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2     MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                    INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    Patchak\u2019s action. The APA\u2019s general waiver of the Federal Govern-\n    ment\u2019s immunity from suit does not apply \u201cif any other statute that\n    grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which\n    is sought\u201d by the plaintiff. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702. The Government and\n    Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute. The\n    QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\u2019s sovereign immuni-\n    ty from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d in\n    real property that conflicts with a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d the United\n    States claims. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). But it contains an exception for\n    \u201ctrust or restricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a).\n       To determine whether the \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception bars Patchak\u2019s\n    suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of\n    grievance Patchak advances. It does not, because Patchak\u2019s action is\n    not a quiet title action. The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional\n    grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of\n    \u201cquiet title\u201d actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in\n    which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else\u2019s claim, but also\n    asserts his own right to disputed property. Although Patchak\u2019s suit\n    contests the Secretary\u2019s title, it does not claim any competing interest\n    in the Bradley Property.\n       Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA\n    does not more broadly encompass any \u201ccivil action . . . to adjudicate a\n    disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an\n    interest.\u201d \u00a72409(a). Rather, \u00a72409a includes a host of indications\n    that the \u201ccivil action\u201d at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit. The\n    Band and Government also contend that the QTA\u2019s specific authori-\n    zation of adverse claimants\u2019 suits creates the negative implication\n    that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government own-\n    ership of land under any statute. That argument is faulty for the\n    reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking\n    different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses. Finally, the Band\n    and Government argue that Patchak\u2019s suit should be treated the\n    same as an adverse claimant\u2019s because both equally implicate the\n    \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception\u2019s policies. That argument must be ad-\n    dressed to Congress. The \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception reflects Congress\u2019s\n    judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\u2014not all suits chal-\n    lenging the Government\u2019s ownership of property. Pp. 4\u221214.\n       2. Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s ac-\n    quisition. A person suing under the APA must assert an interest\n    that is \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regu-\n    lated by the statute\u201d that he says was violated. Association of Data\n    Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153.\n    The Government and Band claim that Patchak\u2019s economic, environ-\n    mental, and aesthetic injuries are not within \u00a7465\u2019s zone of interests\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak\u2019s inju-\n  ries relate to the land\u2019s use as a casino. However, \u00a7465 has far more\n  to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.\n  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA\u2019s land provisions, and func-\n  tions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\u2019 economic devel-\n  opment. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye to-\n  ward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.\n  The Department\u2019s regulations make this statutory concern with land\n  use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual\n  use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\n  And because \u00a7465 encompasses land\u2019s use, neighbors to the use (like\n  Patchak) are reasonable\u2015indeed, predictable\u2015challengers of the Sec-\n  retary\u2019s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\n  or aesthetic, come within \u00a7465\u2019s regulatory ambit.

S. C. \u00a7465, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior\n(Secretary) to acquire property \u201cfor the purpose of provid-\ning land for Indians.\u201d Ch. 576, \u00a75, 48 Stat. 985. The\nSecretary here acquired land in trust for an Indian tribe\nseeking to open a casino. Respondent David Patchak lives\nnear that land and challenges the Secretary\u2019s decision in\na suit brought under the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701 et seq. Patchak claims that the\nSecretary lacked authority under \u00a7465 to take title to the\nland, and alleges economic, environmental, and aesthetic\nharms from the casino\u2019s operation.\n  We consider two questions arising from Patchak\u2019s ac-\n2   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntion. The first is whether the United States has sovereign\nimmunity from the suit by virtue of the Quiet Title Act\n(QTA), 86 Stat. 1176. We think it does not. The second is\nwhether Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary\u2019s acquisition. We think he does. We therefore\nhold that Patchak\u2019s suit may proceed.\n                             I\n   The Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians (Band) is an Indian tribe residing in rural Michi-\ngan. Although the Band has a long history, the Depart-\nment of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in\n1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,\nthe Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority\nunder \u00a7465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland\nTownship, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The\nBand\u2019s application explained that the Band would use the\nproperty \u201cfor gaming purposes,\u201d with the goal of generat-\ning the \u201crevenue necessary to promote tribal economic\ndevelopment, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal govern-\nment capable of providing its members with sorely needed\nsocial and educational programs.\u201d App. 52, 41.1\n   In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the\nSecretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley\nProperty in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.\nIn accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary\ncommitted to wait 30 days before taking action, so that\ninterested parties could seek judicial review. See ibid.; 25\nCFR \u00a7151.12(b) (2011). Within that window, an organiza-\ntion called Michigan Gambling Opposition (or MichGO)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72701\u20132721,\n\nan Indian tribe may conduct gaming operations on \u201cIndian lands,\u201d\n\u00a72710, which include lands \u201cheld in trust by the United States for the\nbenefit of any Indian tribe,\u201d \u00a72703(4)(B). The application thus re-\nquested the Secretary to take the action necessary for the Band to\nopen a casino.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiled suit alleging that the Secretary\u2019s decision violated\nenvironmental and gaming statutes. The Secretary held\noff taking title to the property while that litigation pro-\nceeded. Within the next few years, a District Court and\nthe D. C. Circuit rejected MichGO\u2019s claims. See Michigan\nGambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23, 27\u201328\n(CADC 2008); Michigan Gambling Opposition v. Norton,\n477 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 2007).\n   Shortly after the D. C. Circuit ruled against MichGO\n(but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this\nsuit under the APA advancing a different legal theory. He\nasserted that \u00a7465 did not authorize the Secretary to\nacquire property for the Band because it was not a feder-\nally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.\nSee App. 37. To establish his standing to bring suit,\nPatchak contended that he lived \u201cin close proximity to\u201d the\nBradley Property and that a casino there would \u201cdestroy\nthe lifestyle he has enjoyed\u201d by causing \u201cincreased traffic,\u201d\n\u201cincreased crime,\u201d \u201cdecreased property values,\u201d \u201can irre-\nversible change in the rural character of the area,\u201d and\n\u201cother aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental prob-\nlems.\u201d Id., at 30\u201331. Notably, Patchak did not assert any\nclaim of his own to the Bradley Property. He requested\nonly a declaration that the decision to acquire the land\nviolated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary\nfrom accepting title. See id., at 38\u201339. The Band inter-\nvened in the suit to defend the Secretary\u2019s decision.\n   In January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed\nsuit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO\u2019s case, 555\nU. S. 1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property\ninto trust. That action mooted Patchak\u2019s request for an\ninjunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree\nthat the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal\nGovernment of title to the land. See Brief for Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (herein-\nafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBrief for Respondent 24\u201325. The month after the Gov-\nernment took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that \u00a7465 authorizes the Secre-\ntary to take land into trust only for tribes that were \u201cun-\nder federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934.2\n  The District Court dismissed the suit without consider-\ning the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling\nthat Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court\nreasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside\n\u00a7465\u2019s \u201czone of interests.\u201d 646 F. Supp. 2d 72, 76 (DC\n2009). The D. C. Circuit reversed that determination. See\n632 F. 3d 702, 704\u2013707 (2011). The court also rejected the\nSecretary\u2019s and the Band\u2019s alternative argument that\nby virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nSee id., at 707\u2013712. The latter ruling conflicted with\ndecisions of three Circuits holding that the United States\nhas immunity from suits like Patchak\u2019s. See Neighbors for\nRational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961\u2013\n962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of South-\nern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143\u2013144 (CA9\n1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.\nDepartment of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253\u20131255 (CA11\n1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.\nCircuit\u2019s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                         II\n  We begin by considering whether the United States\u2019\nsovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit under the APA.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The merits of Patchak\u2019s case are not before this Court. We therefore\n\nexpress no view on whether the Band was \u201cunder federal jurisdiction\u201d\nin 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question\nrelates to Patchak\u2019s allegation that the Band was not \u201cfederally recog-\nnized\u201d at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397\u2013399 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (discussing this issue).\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat requires us first to look to the APA itself and then,\nfor reasons we will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that\nthe United States has waived its sovereign immunity from\nPatchak\u2019s action.\n  The APA generally waives the Federal Government\u2019s\nimmunity from a suit \u201cseeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer\nor employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official\ncapacity or under color of legal authority.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702.\nThat waiver would appear to cover Patchak\u2019s suit, which\nobjects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only\nnon-monetary relief. But the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity\ncomes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not\napply \u201cif any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought\u201d\nby the plaintiff. Ibid. That provision prevents plaintiffs\nfrom exploiting the APA\u2019s waiver to evade limitations on\nsuit contained in other statutes. The question thus be-\ncomes whether another statute bars Patchak\u2019s demand for\nrelief.\n  The Government and Band contend that the QTA does\nso. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity from) a particular type of action,\nknown as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting\na \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d in real property that conflicts\nwith a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d the United States claims.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). The statute, however, contains an\nexception: The QTA\u2019s authorization of suit \u201cdoes not apply\nto trust or restricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). According\nto the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title\nsuits satisfies the APA\u2019s carve-out and so forbids Patchak\u2019s\nsuit. In the Band\u2019s words, the QTA exception retains \u201cthe\nUnited States\u2019 full immunity from suits seeking to chal-\nlenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust\nlands.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.\n  Two hypothetical examples might help to frame consid-\n6   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued\nunder the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Prop-\nerty and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into\ntrust. The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just sug-\ngested. True, it fits within the APA\u2019s general waiver, but\nthe QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which\nthis hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian\nlands (which this hypothetical suit does). In such a cir-\ncumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run\nthe QTA\u2019s limitations. \u201c[W]hen Congress has dealt in par-\nticularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified\nremedy\u201d\u2014including its exceptions\u2014to be exclusive, that is the\nend of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.\nBlock v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School\nLands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H. R. Rep.\nNo. 94\u20131656, p. 13 (1976)).\n   But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the APA\nclaiming only that use of the Bradley Property was caus-\ning environmental harm, and raising no objection at all to\nthe Secretary\u2019s title. The QTA could not bar that suit\nbecause even though involving Indian lands, it asserts\na grievance altogether different from the kind the statute\nconcerns. JUSTICE SCALIA, in a former life as Assistant\nAttorney General, made this precise point in a letter to\nCongress about the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity (which we\nhasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative\nhistory, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute\n\u201cis not addressed to the type of grievance which the plain-\ntiff seeks to assert,\u201d then the statute cannot prevent an\nAPA suit.

Scalia).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 According to the dissent, we should look only to the kind of relief a\n\nplaintiff seeks, rather than the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding\nwhether another statute bars an APA action. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.).

S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We think that principle controls Patchak\u2019s case: The\nQTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d clause does not render the Govern-\nment immune because the QTA addresses a kind of griev-\nance different from the one Patchak advances. As we will\nexplain, the QTA\u2014whose full name, recall, is the Quiet\nTitle Act\u2014concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.\nAnd Patchak\u2019s suit is not a quiet title action, because\nalthough it contests the Secretary\u2019s title, it does not claim\nany competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact\nmakes the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d limitation simply inappo-\nsite to this litigation.\n   In reaching this conclusion, we need look no further\nthan the QTA\u2019s text. From its title to its jurisdictional\ngrant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and\nrepeatedly of \u201cquiet title\u201d actions. See 86 Stat. 1176 (\u201cAn\nAct [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property\nquiet title actions\u201d); 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(f) (giving district\ncourts jurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions . . . to quiet title\u201d to\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest);\n\u00a71402(d) (setting forth venue for \u201c[a]ny civil action . . . to\nquiet title\u201d to property in which the United States claims\nan interest). That term is universally understood to refer\nto suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone\nelse\u2019s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed\nproperty. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining an \u201caction to quiet title\u201d as \u201c[a] proceeding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith a \u201cclaim.\u201d See Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent\u2019s\napproach has no obvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress\npassed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a\nprocurement contract suit except when the suit involved a \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d of a federal employee. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(a). Under\nthe dissent\u2019s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit\nseeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary\nfunction, no matter what the nature of the claim. That implausible\nresult demonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be un-\nderstood apart from the claims to which they attach.\n8   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI \n\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto establish a plaintiff\u2019s title to land by compelling the\nadverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever es-\ntopped from asserting it\u201d); Grable & Sons Metal Products,\nInc. v.

S. 486, 490\n(1917))).\n   And the QTA\u2019s other provisions make clear that the\nrecurrent statutory term \u201cquiet title action\u201d carries its or-\ndinary meaning. The QTA directs that the complaint in\nsuch an action \u201cshall set forth with particularity the na-\nture of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff\nclaims in the real property.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). If the\nplaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does\nnot), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA\nprovides an option for the United States, if it loses the\nsuit, to pay \u201cjust compensation,\u201d rather than return the\nproperty, to the \u201cperson determined to be entitled\u201d to it.\n\u00a72409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet\ntitle action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,\nthe Government can satisfy his claim through an award of\nmoney (while still retaining the land for its operations).\nBut the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical re-\n\nquirements for quiet title suits. See post, at 8. But many States had\nabandoned those requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See\nS. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, p. 6 (1971) (noting \u201cwide differences in State\nstatutory and decisional law\u201d on quiet title suits); Steadman, \u201cForgive\nthe U. S.

So Congress in enacting the\nQTA essentially chose one contemporaneous form of quiet title action.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere Patchak does not assert a right to the property. If\nthe United States loses the suit, an award of just compen-\nsation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he\nmight be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak\u2019s claim.5\n  In two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as\naddressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an owner-\nship interest in Government-held property. In Block v.\nNorth Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461\nU. S. 273 (1982), we considered North Dakota\u2019s claim to\nland that the United States viewed as its own. We held\nthat the State could not circumvent the QTA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations by invoking other causes of action, among\nthem the APA. See id., at 277\u2013278, 286, n. 22. The crux\nof our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA\nto address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had\nbrought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, \u201ccitizens assert-\ning title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by\nthe United States\u201d had no recourse; by passing the stat-\nute, \u201cCongress sought to rectify this state of affairs.\u201d Id.,\nat 282. Our decision reflected that legislative purpose:\nCongress, we held, \u201cintended the QTA to provide the\nexclusive means by which adverse claimants could chal-\nlenge the United States\u2019 title to real property.\u201d Id., at 286.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  legislative history, for those who think it useful, further shows\nthat the QTA addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The\nSenate Report states that the QTA aimed to alleviate the \u201c[g]rave\ninequity\u201d to private parties \u201cexcluded, without benefit of a recourse to\nthe courts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully theirs.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 1. Similarly, the House Report notes that the\nhistory of quiet title actions \u201cgoes back to the Courts of England,\u201d and\nprovided as examples \u201ca plaintiff whose title to land was continually\nbeing subjected to litigation in the law courts,\u201d and \u201cone who feared\nthat an outstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be\npresented in the future.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 92\u20131559, p. 6 (1972). From top\nto bottom, these reports show that Congress thought itself to be author-\nizing bread-and-butter quiet title actions, in which a plaintiff asserts a\nright, title, or interest of his own in disputed land.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nWe repeat: \u201cadverse claimants,\u201d meaning plaintiffs who\nthemselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the\nFederal Government\u2019s.\n   Our decision in United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834\n(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the\nQTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act,\ngoverned the plaintiff\u2019s suit respecting certain allotments\nof land held by the United States. We thought the QTA\nthe relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted\ntitle to the property. Our opinion quoted the plaintiff\u2019s\nown description of her suit: \u201cAt no time in this proceeding\ndid [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To the contrary,\nthe claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the\nplaintiff\u2019s] case.\u201d Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent\nin Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p. 3). That fact, we held,\nbrought the suit \u201cwithin the [QTA\u2019s] scope\u201d: \u201cWhat [the\nplaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses\nvalid title.\u201d 476 U. S., at 842. So once again, we construed\nthe QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.\n   But Patchak is not an adverse claimant\u2014and so the\nQTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign im-\nmunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot\nbar his suit. Patchak does not contend that he owns the\nBradley Property, nor does he seek any relief correspond-\ning to such a claim. He wants a court to strip the United\nStates of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is\nhis and not so that he can possess it. Patchak\u2019s lawsuit\ntherefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action. He is\nnot trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to\ncircumvent the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception. Rather,\nhe is not bringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely\nthat the Secretary\u2019s decision to take land into trust vio-\nlates a federal statute\u2014a garden-variety APA claim. See\n5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7706(2)(A), (C) (\u201cThe reviewing court shall . . .\nhold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in ac-\ncordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Because that is true\u2014because in then-\nAssistant Attorney General Scalia\u2019s words, the QTA is\n\u201cnot addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]\nseeks to assert,\u201d H. R. Rep. 94\u20131656, at 28\u2014the QTA\u2019s\nlimitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA\u2019s general\nwaiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.\n   The Band and Government, along with the dissent,\nobject to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First,\nthey contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we\nhave indicated, waiving immunity from suits \u201cto adjudi-\ncate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(a). That\nlanguage, the argument goes, encompasses all actions\ncontesting the Government\u2019s legal interest in land, regard-\nless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself. See\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 19\u201320; Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 4\u20136; post, at 8\u20139 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\nThe QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute\nafter all\u2014as to both its waiver and its \u201ccorresponding\u201d\nreservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.\n   But the Band and Government can reach that result\nonly by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.\nThat sentence, more fully quoted, reads: \u201cThe United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d\n\u00a72409a(a) (emphasis added). And as we have already\nnoted, \u201cthis section\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014includes a host of indica-\ntions that the \u201ccivil action\u201d at issue is an ordinary quiet\ntitle suit: Just recall the section\u2019s title (\u201cReal property\nquiet title actions\u201d), and its pleading requirements (the\nplaintiff \u201cshall set forth with particularity the nature of\nthe right, title, or interest which [he] claims\u201d), and its\npermission to the Government to remedy an infraction by\npaying \u201cjust compensation.\u201d Read with reference to all\n12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthese provisions (as well as to the QTA\u2019s contemporane\nously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver\nclause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band\u2019s and the\nGovernment\u2019s argument: That clause speaks not to any\nsuit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government\u2019s title,\nbut only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an\ninterest in the property.\n   The Band and Government next invoke cases holding\nthat \u201cwhen a statute provides a detailed mechanism for\njudicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of\nparticular persons,\u201d the statute may \u201cimpliedly preclude[ ]\u201d\njudicial review \u201cof those issues at the behest of other\npersons.\u201d Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467\nU. S. 340, 349 (1984); see United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government\ncontend, the QTA\u2019s specific authorization of adverse\nclaimants\u2019 suits creates a negative implication: non-\nadverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Govern-\nment ownership of land under any other statute. See\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7\u201310; Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 7\u20139; see also post, at 3\u20134. The QTA,\nsays the Band, thus \u201cpreempts [Patchak\u2019s] more general\nremedies.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   But we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases\ninapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bring-\ning a different claim, seeking different relief, from the\nkind the QTA addresses. See supra, at 7\u201310. To see the\npoint, consider a contrasting example. Suppose the QTA\nauthorized suit only by adverse claimants who could\nassert a property interest of at least a decade\u2019s duration.\nThen suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that\nrequirement (because, say, his claim to title went back\nonly five years) brought suit under a general statute like\nthe APA. We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases\nthe Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary stat-\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could\nbring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude\nothers from doing so. But here, once again, Patchak is not\nbringing a quiet title action at all. He is not claiming to\nown the property, and he is not demanding that the court\ntransfer the property to him. So to succeed in their argu-\nment, the Government and Band must go much further\nthan the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing\none person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of\nrelief, Congress barred another person from bringing\nanother kind of suit seeking another form of relief. Pre-\nsumably, that contention would extend only to suits in-\nvolving similar subject matter\u2014i.e., the Government\u2019s\nownership of property. But that commonality is not itself\nsufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold\nhere, that some general similarity of subject matter can\nalone trigger a remedial statute\u2019s preclusive effect.\n   Last, the Band and Government argue that we should\ntreat Patchak\u2019s suit as we would an adverse claimant\u2019s\nbecause they equally implicate the \u201cIndian lands\u201d excep-\ntion\u2019s policies. According to the Government, allowing\nchallenges to the Secretary\u2019s trust acquisitions would\n\u201cpose significant barriers to tribes[\u2019] . . . ability to promote\ninvestment and economic development on the lands.\u201d\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 24. That harm is the same\nwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\nIndeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this\nsuit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants\nlike Patchak have \u201cthe most remote injuries and indirect\ninterests in the land.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see\nReply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11\u201312; see also post, at\n2, 7, 10.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In a related vein, the dissent argues that our holding will under-\n\nmine the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception by allowing adverse claimants\nto file APA complaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit\n14 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   That argument is not without force, but it must be\naddressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a\njudgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\u2014to a\npoint, but no further. (The \u201cno further\u201d includes not only\nthe \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception, but one for security interests\nand water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar\non jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and\nthe just compensation option discussed earlier.) Perhaps\nCongress would\u2014perhaps Congress should\u2014make the\nidentical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining\nto the Government\u2019s ownership of land. But that is not\nour call. The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak\nhave a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title ac-\ntions, and so should be precluded a fortiori. But all we can\nsay is that Patchak has a different interest. Whether it is\nlesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property\nrights; whether it is greater because implicating public\ninterests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same\u2014\nthat is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.\nAs the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to\nquiet title actions all other suits challenging the Govern-\nment\u2019s ownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like\nPatchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the\nAPA\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity.\n                               III\n   We finally consider the Band\u2019s and the Government\u2019s\nalternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this ac-\ntion because he lacks prudential standing. This Court\nhas long held that a person suing under the APA must\nsatisfy not only Article III\u2019s standing requirements, but an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthird parties to bring suit on their behalf. See post, at 9\u201311. But we\nthink that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble conceiv-\ning of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse claimant\u2019s\ninterest in property yet somehow leads to relief recognizing that very\ninterest.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional test: The interest he asserts must be \u201carguably\nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by\nthe statute\u201d that he says was violated. Association of Data\nProcessing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S.\n150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking\ntitle to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her\nauthority under \u00a7465, which authorizes the acquisition of\nproperty \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.\u201d\nAnd he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him\neconomic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby\nproperty owner. See supra, at 3. The Government and\nBand argue that the relationship between \u00a7465 and\nPatchak\u2019s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so,\nthey contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisi-\ntion, whereas Patchak\u2019s interests relate to the land\u2019s use\nas a casino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (\u201cThe Secre-\ntary\u2019s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any\nparticular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . .

The Band\u2019s application to the Secretary\nhighlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.\nSee App. 41 (\u201c[T]rust status for this Property is requested\nin order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans\nto conduct gaming\u201d); id., at 61\u201362 (\u201cThe Tribe intends to\n. . . renovate the existing . . . building into a gaming fa-\ncility . . . . to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming\u201d).

So from start to\nfinish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop-\nerty under \u00a7465 involved questions of land use.\n    And because \u00a7465\u2019s implementation encompasses these\nissues, the interests Patchak raises\u2014at least arguably\u2014\n18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v.

But for the reasons already given, decisions\nunder the statute are closely enough and often enough\nentwined with considerations of land use to make that\ndifference immaterial.

First, the right to sue \u201cdoes not apply to trust or\nrestricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). The Indian lands\nexception reflects the view that \u201ca waiver of immunity in\nthis area would not be consistent with specific commit-\nments [the Government] ha[s] made to the Indians\nthrough treaties and other agreements.\u201d Block, 461 U. S.,\nat 283 (internal quotation marks omitted). By exempting\nIndian lands, Congress ensured that the Government\u2019s\n\u201csolemn obligations\u201d to tribes would not be \u201cabridg[ed] . . .\nwithout the consent of the Indians.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575,\nat 4.\n   Second, the Act preserves the United States\u2019 power to\nretain possession or control of any disputed property, even\nif a court determines that the Government\u2019s property\nclaim is invalid. To that end, \u00a72409a(b) \u201callow[s] the\nUnited States the option of paying money damages in-\nstead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the\nmerits.\u201d Block, 461 U. S., at 283. This provision was\nconsidered essential to addressing the Government\u2019s\n\u201cmain objection in the past to waiving sovereign immu-\nnity\u201d where federal land was concerned: that an adverse\njudgment \u201cwould make possible decrees ousting the United\nStates from possession and thus interfer[e] with opera-\ntions of the Government.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 5\u20136.\nSection 2409a(b) \u201celiminate[d] cause for such apprehen-\nsion,\u201d by ensuring that\u2014even under the QTA\u2014the United\nStates could not be stripped of its possession or control of\nproperty without its consent. Id., at 6.\n   Finally, the Act limits the class of individuals permitted\nto sue the Government to those claiming a \u201cright, title, or\ninterest\u201d in disputed property. \u00a72409a(d). As we have\nexplained, Congress\u2019 decision to restrict the class entitled\nto relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the\nremainder. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Insti-\ntute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984) (\u201c[W]hen a statute provides\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v.

That inference is\nespecially strong here, because the QTA was \u201cenacted\nagainst the backdrop of sovereign immunity.\u201d S. Rep. No.\n94\u2013996, p. 27 (1976). Section 2409a(d) thus indicates\nthat Congress concluded that those without any \u201cright, title,\nor interest\u201d in a given property did not have an inter-\nest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity.\n  Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its\nimmunity waiver.1 \u201c[W]hen Congress attaches conditions\nto legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates, those conditions must be strictly observed, and\nexceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.\u201d Block,\n461 U. S., at 287. Congress and the Executive Branch\nintended the scheme to be the exclusive procedure for\nresolving property title disputes involving the United\nStates. See id., at 285 (describing Act as a \u201ccareful and\nthorough remedial scheme\u201d); S. Rep.

Block, 461\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As we explained in Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\n\nSchool Lands, 461 U.

GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff\ncould oust the Government of title to land by means of an\nAPA action, \u201call of the carefully crafted provisions of the\nQTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national\npublic interest could be averted,\u201d and the \u201cIndian lands\nexception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.\u201d Block,\n461 U. S., at 284\u2013285. We therefore had little difficulty\nconcluding that Congress did not intend to render the\nQTA\u2019s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the\nright to dispute the Government\u2019s title to any lands by\nway of an APA action\u2014and to empower any such plaintiff\nto \u201cdisposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed prop-\nerty without being afforded the option of paying damages.\u201d\nId., at 285.\n   It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the condi-\ntions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the\nGovernment\u2019s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he\nseeks to force the Government to relinquish possession\nand title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compen-\nsation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal\nright, title, or interest in the property (strike three). Thus,\nby its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak\nseeks. Compare ante, at 3 (\u201c[A]ll parties agree that the\nsuit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Govern-\nment of title to the [Indian trust] land\u201d), with United\nStates v.

This analysis is unmoored from the text of\nthe APA.\n  Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff \u2019s motivation for\nsuit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his case, but\nonly on whether another statute expressly or impliedly\nforbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly\nseeks\u2014to oust the Government of title to Indian trust\nland\u2014is identical to that forbidden by the QTA. Con-\nversely, the Court\u2019s hypothetical suit, alleging that the\nBradley Property was causing environmental harm, would\nnot be barred by the QTA. See ante, at 6. That is not\nbecause such an action asserts a different \u201cgrievance,\u201d but\nbecause it seeks different relief\u2014abatement of a nuisance\nrather than the extinguishment of title.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority claims, ante, at 7, n. 3, that this test has \u201cno obvious\n\nlimits,\u201d but it merely applies the text of \u00a7702 (which speaks of \u201crelief,\u201d\nnot \u201cgrievances\u201d).

At\ncommon law, equity courts \u201cpermit[ted] a bill to quiet title\nto be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a\ndefendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to estab-\nlish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.\u201d Wehr-\nman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314, 321\u2013322 (1894) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither pre-\nrequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante,\nat 7, an act to quiet title is \u201cuniversally understood\u201d as a\nproceeding \u201cto establish a plaintiff \u2019s title to land.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added). But\n\u00a72409a authorizes civil actions in cases in which neither\nthe Government, nor the plaintiff, claims title to the land\nat issue. See \u00a72409a(d) (\u201cThe complaint shall set forth . . .\nthe right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims\u201d (em-\nphasis added)).4 A plaintiff may file suit under \u00a72409a, for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority notes that some States permit a broader class of\n\nclaims under the rubric of \u201cquiet title,\u201d and points to the \u201c \u2018wide differ-\nences in State statutory and decisional law\u2019 on quiet title suits\u201d at the\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

See S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 5. Notwith-\nstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly\nallows suit in circumstances well beyond \u201cbread-and-\nbutter quiet title actions,\u201d ante, at 3, n. 3.5\n   The majority attempts to bolster its reading by empha-\nsizing an unexpected source within \u00a72409a: the clause\nspecifying that the United States may be sued \u201c \u2018in a civil\naction under this section.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11. The majority\nunderstands this clause to narrow the QTA\u2019s scope (and\nits limitations on the Government\u2019s immunity waiver) to\nquiet title claims only. But \u201cthis section\u201d speaks broadly\nto civil actions \u201cto adjudicate a disputed title to real prop-\nerty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d\n\u00a72409a. Moreover, this clause is read most straightfor-\nwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to\nstate that a claimant can file \u201ca civil action under this\nsection\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014to adjudicate a disputed title in which\nthe United States claims an interest. Regardless of how\none reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA\u2019s\nclear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other\nstatutes are not authorized by the APA. And the QTA\nforbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the\nGovernment to relinquish title to Indian lands.\n   Even if the majority were correct that the QTA itself\nreached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntime of the Act. Ante, at 8, n. 4. But that substantial variation only\nillustrates the artificiality of the majority\u2019s claim that the Act only\n\u201caddresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived.\u201d Ante, at 9, n. 5.\n   5 I recognize, of course, that the QTA is titled \u201c[a]n Act to permit suits\n\nto adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions.\u201d 86 Stat. 1176.\nBut \u201cthe title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of [its]\ntext.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528\u2013529\n(1947). As explained above, the substance of Congress\u2019 enactment\nplainly extends more broadly than quiet title actions, mirroring the\nscope of the title proposed by the Government. See supra, at 2.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould establish only that the QTA does not expressly\nforbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does\nnot waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity where\nany other statute \u201cexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702 (emphasis added). The\ntext and history of the QTA, as well as this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent, make clear that the United States intended to retain\nits sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Gov-\nernment of Indian trust land. Patchak\u2019s suit to oust the\nGovernment of such land is therefore, at minimum, im-\npliedly forbidden.6\n                             II\n   Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today\u2019s\nholding will present for courts and the Government. First,\nit will render the QTA\u2019s limitations easily circumvented.\nAlthough those with property claims will remain formally\nprohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,\nsavvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family\nmember or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an \u201caes-\nthetic\u201d interest in the land but seeking an identical prac-\ntical objective\u2014to divest the Government of title and\npossession. \u00a7\u00a72409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from\nobtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.\n   Second, the majority\u2019s holding will frustrate the Gov-\nernment\u2019s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust\ndecisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak\nasserts an \u201caesthetic\u201d or \u201cenvironmental\u201d concern with a\nplanned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct\nsuit under statutes like the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nThose challenges generally may be brought within the\nAPA\u2019s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations. Suits to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Because I conclude that sovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit,\n\nI would not reach the question of whether he has standing.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    11\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncontest the Government\u2019s decision to take title to land in\ntrust for Indian tribes, however, have been governed by a\ndifferent rule. Until today, parties seeking to challenge\nsuch decisions had only a 30-day window to seek judi-\ncial review.     25 CFR \u00a7151.12 (2011); 61 Fed. Reg.\n18,082\u201318,083 (1996). That deadline promoted finality and\nsecurity\u2014necessary preconditions for the investment\nand \u201ceconomic development\u201d that are central goals of the\nIndian Reorganization Act. Ante, at 16.7 Today\u2019s result\nwill promote the opposite, retarding tribes\u2019 ability to de-\nvelop land until the APA\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations\nhas lapsed.8\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s rule creates substantial uncer-\ntainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA\nclaims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether\nits rule bars from suit only those who \u201cclaim any compet-\ning interest\u201d in the disputed land in their complaint, ante,\nat 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but\nplead only that the Government\u2019s title claim violates a\nfederal statute. If the former, the majority\u2019s holding\nwould allow Patchak\u2019s challenge to go forward even if he\nhad some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so\nlong as his complaint did not assert it. That result is\ndifficult to square with Block and Mottaz. If the latter,\nmatters are even more peculiar. Because a shrewd plain-\ntiff will avoid referencing her own property claim in her\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Trust status, for instance, is a prerequisite to making lands eligible\nfor various federal incentives and tax credits closely tied to economic\ndevelopment. See, e.g., App. 56. Delayed suits will also inhibit tribes\nfrom investing in uses other than gaming that might be less objection-\nable\u2014like farming or office use.\n  8 Despite notice of the Government\u2019s intent through an organization\n\nwith which he was affiliated, Patchak did not challenge the Govern-\nment\u2019s fee-to-trust decision even though the organization did. See\nMichigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23 (CADC\n2008). Instead, Patchak waited to sue until three years after the\nSecretary\u2019s intent to acquire the property was published. App. 35, 39.\n12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v.

Not only does that impose a\nsubstantial burden on the Government, but it creates per-\nverse incentives for private litigants. What if a plain-\ntiff has a weak claim, or a claim that she does not know\nabout?

Argued April 24, 2012\u2014Decided June 18, 2012*\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) authorizes the Secretary of the\n  Interior to acquire property \u201cfor the purpose of providing land to In-\n  dians.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465. Petitioner Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n  Band of Pottawatomi Indians (Band), an Indian tribe federally recog-\n  nized in 1999, requested that the Secretary take into trust on its be-\n  half a tract of land known as the Bradley Property, which the Band\n  intended to use \u201cfor gaming purposes.\u201d The Secretary took title to\n  the Bradley Property in 2009. Respondent David Patchak, who lives\n  near the Bradley Property, filed suit under the Administrative Pro-\n  cedure Act (APA), asserting that \u00a7465 did not authorize the Secretary\n  to acquire the property because the Band was not a federally recog-\n  nized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934. Patchak alleged a va-\n  riety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of\n  the Band\u2019s proposed use of the property to operate a casino, and re-\n  quested injunctive and declaratory relief reversing the Secretary\u2019s\n  decision to take title to the land. The Band intervened to defend the\n  Secretary\u2019s decision. The District Court did not reach the merits of\n  Patchak\u2019s suit, but ruled that he lacked prudential standing to chal-\n  lenge the Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The D.

PATCHAK\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    Patchak\u2019s action. The APA\u2019s general waiver of the Federal Govern-\n    ment\u2019s immunity from suit does not apply \u201cif any other statute that\n    grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which\n    is sought\u201d by the plaintiff. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702. The Government and\n    Band contend that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) is such a statute. The\n    QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\u2019s sovereign immuni-\n    ty from) a suit by a plaintiff asserting a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d in\n    real property that conflicts with a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d the United\n    States claims. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). But it contains an exception for\n    \u201ctrust or restricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a).\n       To determine whether the \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception bars Patchak\u2019s\n    suit, the Court considers whether the QTA addresses the kind of\n    grievance Patchak advances. It does not, because Patchak\u2019s action is\n    not a quiet title action. The QTA, from its title to its jurisdictional\n    grant to its venue provision, speaks specifically and repeatedly of\n    \u201cquiet title\u201d actions, a term universally understood to refer to suits in\n    which a plaintiff not only challenges someone else\u2019s claim, but also\n    asserts his own right to disputed property. Although Patchak\u2019s suit\n    contests the Secretary\u2019s title, it does not claim any competing interest\n    in the Bradley Property.\n       Contrary to the argument of the Band and Government, the QTA\n    does not more broadly encompass any \u201ccivil action . . . to adjudicate a\n    disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an\n    interest.\u201d \u00a72409(a). Rather, \u00a72409a includes a host of indications\n    that the \u201ccivil action\u201d at issue is an ordinary quiet title suit. The\n    Band and Government also contend that the QTA\u2019s specific authori-\n    zation of adverse claimants\u2019 suits creates the negative implication\n    that non-claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Government own-\n    ership of land under any statute. That argument is faulty for the\n    reason already given: Patchak is bringing a different claim, seeking\n    different relief, from the kind the QTA addresses. Finally, the Band\n    and Government argue that Patchak\u2019s suit should be treated the\n    same as an adverse claimant\u2019s because both equally implicate the\n    \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception\u2019s policies. That argument must be ad-\n    dressed to Congress. The \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception reflects Congress\u2019s\n    judgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\u2014not all suits chal-\n    lenging the Government\u2019s ownership of property. Pp. 4\u221214.\n       2. Patchak has prudential standing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s ac-\n    quisition. A person suing under the APA must assert an interest\n    that is \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regu-\n    lated by the statute\u201d that he says was violated. Association of Data\n    Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, 153.\n    The Government and Band claim that Patchak\u2019s economic, environ-\n    mental, and aesthetic injuries are not within \u00a7465\u2019s zone of interests\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  because the statute focuses on land acquisition, while Patchak\u2019s inju-\n  ries relate to the land\u2019s use as a casino. However, \u00a7465 has far more\n  to do with land use than the Government and Band acknowledge.\n  Section 465 is the capstone of the IRA\u2019s land provisions, and func-\n  tions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\u2019 economic devel-\n  opment. The Secretary thus takes title to properties with an eye to-\n  ward how tribes will use those lands to support such development.\n  The Department\u2019s regulations make this statutory concern with land\n  use clear, requiring the Secretary to acquire land with its eventual\n  use in mind, after assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\n  And because \u00a7465 encompasses land\u2019s use, neighbors to the use (like\n  Patchak) are reasonable\u2015indeed, predictable\u2015challengers of the Sec-\n  retary\u2019s decisions: Their interests, whether economic, environmental,\n  or aesthetic, come within \u00a7465\u2019s regulatory ambit.

Although the Band has a long history, the Depart-\nment of the Interior (DOI) formally recognized it only in\n1999. See 63 Fed. Reg. 56936 (1998). Two years later,\nthe Band petitioned the Secretary to exercise her authority\nunder \u00a7465 by taking into trust a tract of land in Wayland\nTownship, Michigan, known as the Bradley Property. The\nBand\u2019s application explained that the Band would use the\nproperty \u201cfor gaming purposes,\u201d with the goal of generat-\ning the \u201crevenue necessary to promote tribal economic\ndevelopment, self-sufficiency and a strong tribal govern-\nment capable of providing its members with sorely needed\nsocial and educational programs.\u201d App. 52, 41.1\n   In 2005, after a lengthy administrative review, the\nSecretary announced her decision to acquire the Bradley\nProperty in trust for the Band. See 70 Fed. Reg. 25596.\nIn accordance with applicable regulations, the Secretary\ncommitted to wait 30 days before taking action, so that\ninterested parties could seek judicial review.

Circuit ruled against MichGO\n(but still before the Secretary took title), Patchak filed this\nsuit under the APA advancing a different legal theory. He\nasserted that \u00a7465 did not authorize the Secretary to\nacquire property for the Band because it was not a feder-\nally recognized tribe when the IRA was enacted in 1934.\nSee App. 37. To establish his standing to bring suit,\nPatchak contended that he lived \u201cin close proximity to\u201d the\nBradley Property and that a casino there would \u201cdestroy\nthe lifestyle he has enjoyed\u201d by causing \u201cincreased traffic,\u201d\n\u201cincreased crime,\u201d \u201cdecreased property values,\u201d \u201can irre-\nversible change in the rural character of the area,\u201d and\n\u201cother aesthetic, socioeconomic, and environmental prob-\nlems.\u201d Id., at 30\u201331. Notably, Patchak did not assert any\nclaim of his own to the Bradley Property. He requested\nonly a declaration that the decision to acquire the land\nviolated the IRA and an injunction to stop the Secretary\nfrom accepting title. See id., at 38\u201339. The Band inter-\nvened in the suit to defend the Secretary\u2019s decision.\n   In January 2009, about five months after Patchak filed\nsuit, this Court denied certiorari in MichGO\u2019s case, 555\nU. S. 1137, and the Secretary took the Bradley Property\ninto trust. That action mooted Patchak\u2019s request for an\ninjunction to prevent the acquisition, and all parties agree\nthat the suit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal\nGovernment of title to the land. See Brief for Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians 17 (herein-\nafter Tribal Petitioner); Brief for Federal Petitioners 11;\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBrief for Respondent 24\u201325. The month after the Gov-\nernment took title, this Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. 379, 382 (2009), that \u00a7465 authorizes the Secre-\ntary to take land into trust only for tribes that were \u201cun-\nder federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934.2\n  The District Court dismissed the suit without consider-\ning the merits (including the relevance of Carcieri), ruling\nthat Patchak lacked prudential standing to challenge the\nSecretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property. The court\nreasoned that the injuries Patchak alleged fell outside\n\u00a7465\u2019s \u201czone of interests.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/dcd/dVxZ/patchak-v-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court also rejected the\nSecretary\u2019s and the Band\u2019s alternative argument that\nby virtue of the QTA, sovereign immunity barred the suit.\nSee id., at 707\u2013712. The latter ruling conflicted with\ndecisions of three Circuits holding that the United States\nhas immunity from suits like Patchak\u2019s. See Neighbors for\nRational Development, Inc. v. Norton, 379 F. 3d 956, 961\u2013\n962 (CA10 2004); Metropolitan Water Dist. of South-\nern Cal. v. United States, 830 F. 2d 139, 143\u2013144 (CA9\n1987) (per curiam); Florida Dept. of Bus. Regulation v.\nDepartment of Interior, 768 F. 2d 1248, 1253\u20131255 (CA11\n1985). We granted certiorari to review both of the D. C.\nCircuit\u2019s holdings, 565 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                         II\n  We begin by considering whether the United States\u2019\nsovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit under the APA.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The merits of Patchak\u2019s case are not before this Court. We therefore\n\nexpress no view on whether the Band was \u201cunder federal jurisdiction\u201d\nin 1934, as Carcieri requires. Nor do we consider how that question\nrelates to Patchak\u2019s allegation that the Band was not \u201cfederally recog-\nnized\u201d at the time. Cf. Carcieri, 555 U. S., at 397\u2013399 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (discussing this issue).\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThat requires us first to look to the APA itself and then,\nfor reasons we will describe, to the QTA. We conclude that\nthe United States has waived its sovereign immunity from\nPatchak\u2019s action.\n  The APA generally waives the Federal Government\u2019s\nimmunity from a suit \u201cseeking relief other than money\ndamages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer\nor employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official\ncapacity or under color of legal authority.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702.\nThat waiver would appear to cover Patchak\u2019s suit, which\nobjects to official action of the Secretary and seeks only\nnon-monetary relief. But the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity\ncomes with an important carve-out: The waiver does not\napply \u201cif any other statute that grants consent to suit\nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought\u201d\nby the plaintiff. Ibid. That provision prevents plaintiffs\nfrom exploiting the APA\u2019s waiver to evade limitations on\nsuit contained in other statutes. The question thus be-\ncomes whether another statute bars Patchak\u2019s demand for\nrelief.\n  The Government and Band contend that the QTA does\nso. The QTA authorizes (and so waives the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity from) a particular type of action,\nknown as a quiet title suit: a suit by a plaintiff asserting\na \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d in real property that conflicts\nwith a \u201cright, title, or interest\u201d the United States claims.\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). The statute, however, contains an\nexception: The QTA\u2019s authorization of suit \u201cdoes not apply\nto trust or restricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). According\nto the Government and Band, that limitation on quiet title\nsuits satisfies the APA\u2019s carve-out and so forbids Patchak\u2019s\nsuit. In the Band\u2019s words, the QTA exception retains \u201cthe\nUnited States\u2019 full immunity from suits seeking to chal-\nlenge its title to or impair its legal interest in Indian trust\nlands.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 18.\n  Two hypothetical examples might help to frame consid-\n6   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neration of this argument. First, suppose Patchak had sued\nunder the APA claiming that he owned the Bradley Prop-\nerty and that the Secretary therefore could not take it into\ntrust. The QTA would bar that suit, for reasons just sug-\ngested. True, it fits within the APA\u2019s general waiver, but\nthe QTA specifically authorizes quiet title actions (which\nthis hypothetical suit is) except when they involve Indian\nlands (which this hypothetical suit does). In such a cir-\ncumstance, a plaintiff cannot use the APA to end-run\nthe QTA\u2019s limitations. \u201c[W]hen Congress has dealt in par-\nticularity with a claim and [has] intended a specified\nremedy\u201d\u2014including its exceptions\u2014to be exclusive, that is the\nend of the matter; the APA does not undo the judgment.\nBlock v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School\nLands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983) (quoting H. R. Rep.\nNo. 94\u20131656, p. 13 (1976)).\n   But now suppose that Patchak had sued under the APA\nclaiming only that use of the Bradley Property was caus-\ning environmental harm, and raising no objection at all to\nthe Secretary\u2019s title. The QTA could not bar that suit\nbecause even though involving Indian lands, it asserts\na grievance altogether different from the kind the statute\nconcerns. JUSTICE SCALIA, in a former life as Assistant\nAttorney General, made this precise point in a letter to\nCongress about the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity (which we\nhasten to add, given the author, we use not as legislative\nhistory, but only for its persuasive force). When a statute\n\u201cis not addressed to the type of grievance which the plain-\ntiff seeks to assert,\u201d then the statute cannot prevent an\nAPA suit. Id., at 28 (May 10, 1976, letter of Assistant\nAtty. Gen. A. Scalia).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 According to the dissent, we should look only to the kind of relief a\n\nplaintiff seeks, rather than the type of grievance he asserts, in deciding\nwhether another statute bars an APA action. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). But the dissent\u2019s test is inconsistent with the one we\nadopted in Block, which asked whether Congress had particularly dealt\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We think that principle controls Patchak\u2019s case: The\nQTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d clause does not render the Govern-\nment immune because the QTA addresses a kind of griev-\nance different from the one Patchak advances. As we will\nexplain, the QTA\u2014whose full name, recall, is the Quiet\nTitle Act\u2014concerns (no great surprise) quiet title actions.\nAnd Patchak\u2019s suit is not a quiet title action, because\nalthough it contests the Secretary\u2019s title, it does not claim\nany competing interest in the Bradley Property. That fact\nmakes the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d limitation simply inappo-\nsite to this litigation.\n   In reaching this conclusion, we need look no further\nthan the QTA\u2019s text. From its title to its jurisdictional\ngrant to its venue provision, the Act speaks specifically and\nrepeatedly of \u201cquiet title\u201d actions. See 86 Stat. 1176 (\u201cAn\nAct [t]o permit suits to adjudicate certain real property\nquiet title actions\u201d); 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(f) (giving district\ncourts jurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions . . . to quiet title\u201d to\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest);\n\u00a71402(d) (setting forth venue for \u201c[a]ny civil action . . . to\nquiet title\u201d to property in which the United States claims\nan interest). That term is universally understood to refer\nto suits in which a plaintiff not only challenges someone\nelse\u2019s claim, but also asserts his own right to disputed\nproperty. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 34 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining an \u201caction to quiet title\u201d as \u201c[a] proceeding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith a \u201cclaim.\u201d See Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and\nSchool Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 286, n. 22 (1983). And the dissent\u2019s\napproach has no obvious limits. Suppose, for example, that Congress\npassed a statute authorizing a particular form of injunctive relief in a\nprocurement contract suit except when the suit involved a \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d of a federal employee. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(a). Under\nthe dissent\u2019s method, that exception would preclude any APA suit\nseeking that kind of injunctive relief if it involved a discretionary\nfunction, no matter what the nature of the claim. That implausible\nresult demonstrates that limitations on relief cannot sensibly be un-\nderstood apart from the claims to which they attach.\n8   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI \n\n                  INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto establish a plaintiff\u2019s title to land by compelling the\nadverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever es-\ntopped from asserting it\u201d); Grable & Sons Metal Products,\nInc. v.

S. 486, 490\n(1917))).\n   And the QTA\u2019s other provisions make clear that the\nrecurrent statutory term \u201cquiet title action\u201d carries its or-\ndinary meaning. The QTA directs that the complaint in\nsuch an action \u201cshall set forth with particularity the na-\nture of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff\nclaims in the real property.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(d). If the\nplaintiff does not assert any such right (as Patchak does\nnot), the statute cannot come into play.4 Further, the QTA\nprovides an option for the United States, if it loses the\nsuit, to pay \u201cjust compensation,\u201d rather than return the\nproperty, to the \u201cperson determined to be entitled\u201d to it.\n\u00a72409a(b). That provision makes perfect sense in a quiet\ntitle action: If the plaintiff is found to own the property,\nthe Government can satisfy his claim through an award of\nmoney (while still retaining the land for its operations).\nBut the provision makes no sense in a suit like this one,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent contends that the QTA omits two other historical re-\n\nquirements for quiet title suits. See post, at 8. But many States had\nabandoned those requirements by the time the QTA was passed. See\nS. Rep.

S. ____ (2012)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhere Patchak does not assert a right to the property. If\nthe United States loses the suit, an award of just compen-\nsation to the rightful owner (whoever and wherever he\nmight be) could do nothing to satisfy Patchak\u2019s claim.5\n  In two prior cases, we likewise described the QTA as\naddressing suits in which the plaintiff asserts an owner-\nship interest in Government-held property. In Block v.\nNorth Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461\nU. S. 273 (1982), we considered North Dakota\u2019s claim to\nland that the United States viewed as its own. We held\nthat the State could not circumvent the QTA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations by invoking other causes of action, among\nthem the APA. See id., at 277\u2013278, 286, n. 22. The crux\nof our reasoning was that Congress had enacted the QTA\nto address exactly the kind of suit North Dakota had\nbrought. Prior to the QTA, we explained, \u201ccitizens assert-\ning title to or the right to possession of lands claimed by\nthe United States\u201d had no recourse; by passing the stat-\nute, \u201cCongress sought to rectify this state of affairs.\u201d Id.,\nat 282. Our decision reflected that legislative purpose:\nCongress, we held, \u201cintended the QTA to provide the\nexclusive means by which adverse claimants could chal-\nlenge the United States\u2019 title to real property.\u201d Id., at 286.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  legislative history, for those who think it useful, further shows\nthat the QTA addresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived. The\nSenate Report states that the QTA aimed to alleviate the \u201c[g]rave\ninequity\u201d to private parties \u201cexcluded, without benefit of a recourse to\nthe courts, from lands they have reason to believe are rightfully theirs.\u201d\nS. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 1. Similarly, the House Report notes that the\nhistory of quiet title actions \u201cgoes back to the Courts of England,\u201d and\nprovided as examples \u201ca plaintiff whose title to land was continually\nbeing subjected to litigation in the law courts,\u201d and \u201cone who feared\nthat an outstanding deed or other interest might cause a claim to be\npresented in the future.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 92\u20131559, p. 6 (1972). From top\nto bottom, these reports show that Congress thought itself to be author-\nizing bread-and-butter quiet title actions, in which a plaintiff asserts a\nright, title, or interest of his own in disputed land.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\nWe repeat: \u201cadverse claimants,\u201d meaning plaintiffs who\nthemselves assert a claim to property antagonistic to the\nFederal Government\u2019s.\n   Our decision in United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834\n(1986), is of a piece. There, we considered whether the\nQTA, or instead the Tucker Act or General Allotment Act,\ngoverned the plaintiff\u2019s suit respecting certain allotments\nof land held by the United States. We thought the QTA\nthe relevant statute because the plaintiff herself asserted\ntitle to the property. Our opinion quoted the plaintiff\u2019s\nown description of her suit: \u201cAt no time in this proceeding\ndid [the plaintiff] drop her claim for title. To the contrary,\nthe claim for title is the essence and bottom line of [the\nplaintiff\u2019s] case.\u201d Id., at 842 (quoting Brief for Respondent\nin Mottaz, O. T. 1985, No. 546, p. 3). That fact, we held,\nbrought the suit \u201cwithin the [QTA\u2019s] scope\u201d: \u201cWhat [the\nplaintiff] seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses\nvalid title.\u201d 476 U. S., at 842. So once again, we construed\nthe QTA as addressing suits by adverse claimants.\n   But Patchak is not an adverse claimant\u2014and so the\nQTA (more specifically, its reservation of sovereign im-\nmunity from actions respecting Indian trust lands) cannot\nbar his suit. Patchak does not contend that he owns the\nBradley Property, nor does he seek any relief correspond-\ning to such a claim. He wants a court to strip the United\nStates of title to the land, but not on the ground that it is\nhis and not so that he can possess it. Patchak\u2019s lawsuit\ntherefore lacks a defining feature of a QTA action. He is\nnot trying to disguise a QTA suit as an APA action to\ncircumvent the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception. Rather,\nhe is not bringing a QTA suit at all. He asserts merely\nthat the Secretary\u2019s decision to take land into trust vio-\nlates a federal statute\u2014a garden-variety APA claim. See\n5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7706(2)(A), (C) (\u201cThe reviewing court shall . . .\nhold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . not in ac-\ncordance with law [or] in excess of statutory jurisdiction\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Because that is true\u2014because in then-\nAssistant Attorney General Scalia\u2019s words, the QTA is\n\u201cnot addressed to the type of grievance which [Patchak]\nseeks to assert,\u201d H. R. Rep. 94\u20131656, at 28\u2014the QTA\u2019s\nlimitation of remedies has no bearing. The APA\u2019s general\nwaiver of sovereign immunity instead applies.\n   The Band and Government, along with the dissent,\nobject to this conclusion on three basic grounds. First,\nthey contend that the QTA speaks more broadly than we\nhave indicated, waiving immunity from suits \u201cto adjudi-\ncate a disputed title to real property in which the United\nStates claims an interest.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(a). That\nlanguage, the argument goes, encompasses all actions\ncontesting the Government\u2019s legal interest in land, regard-\nless whether the plaintiff claims ownership himself. See\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 19\u201320; Reply Brief for Tribal\nPetitioner 4\u20136; post, at 8\u20139 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\nThe QTA (not the APA) thus becomes the relevant statute\nafter all\u2014as to both its waiver and its \u201ccorresponding\u201d\nreservation of immunity from suits involving Indian lands.\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitioner 6.\n   But the Band and Government can reach that result\nonly by neglecting key words in the relevant provision.\nThat sentence, more fully quoted, reads: \u201cThe United\nStates may be named as a party defendant in a civil action\nunder this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real\nproperty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d\n\u00a72409a(a) (emphasis added). And as we have already\nnoted, \u201cthis section\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014includes a host of indica-\ntions that the \u201ccivil action\u201d at issue is an ordinary quiet\ntitle suit: Just recall the section\u2019s title (\u201cReal property\nquiet title actions\u201d), and its pleading requirements (the\nplaintiff \u201cshall set forth with particularity the nature of\nthe right, title, or interest which [he] claims\u201d), and its\npermission to the Government to remedy an infraction by\npaying \u201cjust compensation.\u201d Read with reference to all\n12 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthese provisions (as well as to the QTA\u2019s contemporane\nously enacted jurisdictional and venue sections), the waiver\nclause rebuts, rather than supports, the Band\u2019s and the\nGovernment\u2019s argument: That clause speaks not to any\nsuit in which a plaintiff challenges the Government\u2019s title,\nbut only to an action in which the plaintiff also claims an\ninterest in the property.\n   The Band and Government next invoke cases holding\nthat \u201cwhen a statute provides a detailed mechanism for\njudicial consideration of particular issues at the behest of\nparticular persons,\u201d the statute may \u201cimpliedly preclude[ ]\u201d\njudicial review \u201cof those issues at the behest of other\npersons.\u201d Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467\nU. S. 340, 349 (1984); see United States v. Fausto, 484\nU. S. 439, 455 (1988). Here, the Band and Government\ncontend, the QTA\u2019s specific authorization of adverse\nclaimants\u2019 suits creates a negative implication: non-\nadverse claimants like Patchak cannot challenge Govern-\nment ownership of land under any other statute. See\nReply Brief for Tribal Petitoner 7\u201310; Reply Brief for\nFederal Petitioners 7\u20139; see also post, at 3\u20134. The QTA,\nsays the Band, thus \u201cpreempts [Patchak\u2019s] more general\nremedies.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 23 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   But we think that argument faulty, and the cited cases\ninapposite, for the reason already given: Patchak is bring-\ning a different claim, seeking different relief, from the\nkind the QTA addresses. See supra, at 7\u201310. To see the\npoint, consider a contrasting example. Suppose the QTA\nauthorized suit only by adverse claimants who could\nassert a property interest of at least a decade\u2019s duration.\nThen suppose an adverse claimant failing to meet that\nrequirement (because, say, his claim to title went back\nonly five years) brought suit under a general statute like\nthe APA. We would surely bar that suit, citing the cases\nthe Government and Band rely on; in our imaginary stat-\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nute, Congress delineated the class of persons who could\nbring a quiet title suit, and that judgment would preclude\nothers from doing so. But here, once again, Patchak is not\nbringing a quiet title action at all. He is not claiming to\nown the property, and he is not demanding that the court\ntransfer the property to him. So to succeed in their argu-\nment, the Government and Band must go much further\nthan the cited cases: They must say that in authorizing\none person to bring one kind of suit seeking one form of\nrelief, Congress barred another person from bringing\nanother kind of suit seeking another form of relief. Pre-\nsumably, that contention would extend only to suits in-\nvolving similar subject matter\u2014i.e., the Government\u2019s\nownership of property. But that commonality is not itself\nsufficient. We have never held, and see no cause to hold\nhere, that some general similarity of subject matter can\nalone trigger a remedial statute\u2019s preclusive effect.\n   Last, the Band and Government argue that we should\ntreat Patchak\u2019s suit as we would an adverse claimant\u2019s\nbecause they equally implicate the \u201cIndian lands\u201d excep-\ntion\u2019s policies. According to the Government, allowing\nchallenges to the Secretary\u2019s trust acquisitions would\n\u201cpose significant barriers to tribes[\u2019] . . . ability to promote\ninvestment and economic development on the lands.\u201d\nBrief for Federal Petitioners 24. That harm is the same\nwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\nIndeed, the Band argues that the sole difference in this\nsuit cuts in its direction, because non-adverse claimants\nlike Patchak have \u201cthe most remote injuries and indirect\ninterests in the land.\u201d Brief for Tribal Petitioner 13; see\nReply Brief for Federal Petitioners 11\u201312; see also post, at\n2, 7, 10.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In a related vein, the dissent argues that our holding will under-\n\nmine the QTA\u2019s \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception by allowing adverse claimants\nto file APA complaints concealing their ownership interests or to recruit\n14 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   That argument is not without force, but it must be\naddressed to Congress. In the QTA, Congress made a\njudgment about how far to allow quiet title suits\u2014to a\npoint, but no further. (The \u201cno further\u201d includes not only\nthe \u201cIndian lands\u201d exception, but one for security interests\nand water rights, as well as a statute of limitations, a bar\non jury trials, jurisdictional and venue constraints, and\nthe just compensation option discussed earlier.) Perhaps\nCongress would\u2014perhaps Congress should\u2014make the\nidentical judgment for the full range of lawsuits pertaining\nto the Government\u2019s ownership of land. But that is not\nour call. The Band assumes that plaintiffs like Patchak\nhave a lesser interest than those bringing quiet title ac-\ntions, and so should be precluded a fortiori. But all we can\nsay is that Patchak has a different interest. Whether it is\nlesser, as the Band argues, because not based on property\nrights; whether it is greater because implicating public\ninterests; or whether it is in the end exactly the same\u2014\nthat is for Congress to tell us, not for us to tell Congress.\nAs the matter stands, Congress has not assimilated to\nquiet title actions all other suits challenging the Govern-\nment\u2019s ownership of property. And so when a plaintiff like\nPatchak brings a suit like this one, it falls within the\nAPA\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity.\n                               III\n   We finally consider the Band\u2019s and the Government\u2019s\nalternative argument that Patchak cannot bring this ac-\ntion because he lacks prudential standing. This Court\nhas long held that a person suing under the APA must\nsatisfy not only Article III\u2019s standing requirements, but an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthird parties to bring suit on their behalf. See post, at 9\u201311. But we\nthink that concern more imaginary than real. We have trouble conceiv-\ning of a plausible APA suit that omits mention of an adverse claimant\u2019s\ninterest in property yet somehow leads to relief recognizing that very\ninterest.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional test: The interest he asserts must be \u201carguably\nwithin the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by\nthe statute\u201d that he says was violated. Association of Data\nProcessing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S.\n150, 153 (1970). Here, Patchak asserts that in taking\ntitle to the Bradley Property, the Secretary exceeded her\nauthority under \u00a7465, which authorizes the acquisition of\nproperty \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.\u201d\nAnd he alleges that this statutory violation will cause him\neconomic, environmental, and aesthetic harm as a nearby\nproperty owner. See supra, at 3. The Government and\nBand argue that the relationship between \u00a7465 and\nPatchak\u2019s asserted interests is insufficient. That is so,\nthey contend, because the statute focuses on land acquisi-\ntion, whereas Patchak\u2019s interests relate to the land\u2019s use\nas a casino. See Brief for Tribal Petitioner 46 (\u201cThe Secre-\ntary\u2019s decision to put land into trust does not turn on any\nparticular use of the land, gaming or otherwise[,] . . .

The question is not whether \u00a7465 seeks to benefit Patchak;\neveryone can agree it does not. The question is instead, as the Band\u2019s\n16 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nincluded the word \u201carguably\u201d in the test to indicate that\nthe benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff. The test\nforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinterests are so\nmarginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\nimplicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be as-\nsumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Id.,\nat 399.\n   Patchak\u2019s suit satisfies that standard, because \u00a7465 has\nfar more to do with land use than the Government and\nBand acknowledge. Start with what we and others have\nsaid about \u00a7465\u2019s context and purpose. As the leading\ntreatise on federal Indian law notes, \u00a7465 is \u201cthe capstone\u201d\nof the IRA\u2019s land provisions. F. Cohen, Handbook of Fed-\neral Indian Law \u00a715.07[1][a], p. 1010 (2005 ed.) (hereinaf-\nter Cohen). And those provisions play a key role in the\nIRA\u2019s overall effort \u201cto rehabilitate the Indian\u2019s economic\nlife,\u201d Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 152\n(1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cLand forms\nthe basis\u201d of that \u201ceconomic life,\u201d providing the foundation\nfor \u201ctourism, manufacturing, mining, logging, . . . and\ngaming.\u201d Cohen \u00a715.01, at 965. Section 465 thus func-\ntions as a primary mechanism to foster Indian tribes\u2019\neconomic development. As the D. C. Circuit explained in\nthe MichGO litigation, the section \u201cprovid[es] lands suffi-\ncient to enable Indians to achieve self-support.\u201d Michigan\nGambling, 525 F. 3d, at 31 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974)\n(noting the IRA\u2019s economic aspect). So when the Secretary\nobtains land for Indians under \u00a7465, she does not do so in\na vacuum. Rather, she takes title to properties with at\nleast one eye directed toward how tribes will use those\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand the Government\u2019s main argument acknowledges, whether issues of\nland use (arguably) fall within \u00a7465\u2019s scope\u2014because if they do, a\nneighbor complaining about such use may sue to enforce the statute\u2019s\nlimits.

Those regulations\npermit the Secretary to acquire land in trust under \u00a7465\nif the \u201cland is necessary to facilitate tribal self-\ndetermination, economic development, or Indian housing.\u201d\n25 CFR \u00a7151.3(a)(3). And they require the Secretary to\nconsider, in evaluating any acquisition, both \u201c[t]he pur-\nposes for which the land will be used\u201d and the \u201cpoten-\ntial conflicts of land use which may arise.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7151.10(c),\n151.10(f); see \u00a7151.11(a). For \u201coff-reservation acquisitions\u201d\nmade \u201cfor business purposes\u201d\u2014like the Bradley Property\u2014\nthe regulations further provide that the tribe must\n\u201cprovide a plan which specifies the anticipated economic\nbenefits associated with the proposed use.\u201d \u00a7151.11(c).\nDOI\u2019s regulations thus show that the statute\u2019s implemen-\ntation centrally depends on the projected use of a given\nproperty.\n    The Secretary\u2019s acquisition of the Bradley Property is\na case in point. The Band\u2019s application to the Secretary\nhighlighted its plan to use the land for gaming purposes.\nSee App. 41 (\u201c[T]rust status for this Property is requested\nin order for the Tribe to acquire property on which it plans\nto conduct gaming\u201d); id., at 61\u201362 (\u201cThe Tribe intends to\n. . . renovate the existing . . . building into a gaming fa-\ncility . . . . to offer Class II and/or Class III gaming\u201d). Simi-\nlarly, DOI\u2019s notice of intent to take the land into trust\nannounced that the land would \u201cbe used for the purpose of\nconstruction and operation of a gaming facility,\u201d which the\nDepartment had already determined would meet the\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act\u2019s requirements. 70 Fed.\nReg. 25596; 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72701\u20132721. So from start to\nfinish, the decision whether to acquire the Bradley Prop-\nerty under \u00a7465 involved questions of land use.\n    And because \u00a7465\u2019s implementation encompasses these\nissues, the interests Patchak raises\u2014at least arguably\u2014\n18 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v.

The difference here, as the Government and Band\npoint out, is that \u00a7465 specifically addresses only land ac-\nquisition. But for the reasons already given, decisions\nunder the statute are closely enough and often enough\nentwined with considerations of land use to make that\ndifference immaterial. As in this very case, the Secretary\nwill typically acquire land with its eventual use in mind,\nafter assessing potential conflicts that use might create.\nSee 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7151.10(c), 151.10(f), 151.11(a).

First, the right to sue \u201cdoes not apply to trust or\nrestricted Indian lands.\u201d \u00a72409a(a). The Indian lands\nexception reflects the view that \u201ca waiver of immunity in\nthis area would not be consistent with specific commit-\nments [the Government] ha[s] made to the Indians\nthrough treaties and other agreements.\u201d Block, 461 U. S.,\nat 283 (internal quotation marks omitted). By exempting\nIndian lands, Congress ensured that the Government\u2019s\n\u201csolemn obligations\u201d to tribes would not be \u201cabridg[ed] . . .\nwithout the consent of the Indians.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575,\nat 4.\n   Second, the Act preserves the United States\u2019 power to\nretain possession or control of any disputed property, even\nif a court determines that the Government\u2019s property\nclaim is invalid. To that end, \u00a72409a(b) \u201callow[s] the\nUnited States the option of paying money damages in-\nstead of surrendering the property if it lost a case on the\nmerits.\u201d Block, 461 U. S., at 283. This provision was\nconsidered essential to addressing the Government\u2019s\n\u201cmain objection in the past to waiving sovereign immu-\nnity\u201d where federal land was concerned: that an adverse\njudgment \u201cwould make possible decrees ousting the United\nStates from possession and thus interfer[e] with opera-\ntions of the Government.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 5\u20136.\nSection 2409a(b) \u201celiminate[d] cause for such apprehen-\nsion,\u201d by ensuring that\u2014even under the QTA\u2014the United\nStates could not be stripped of its possession or control of\nproperty without its consent.

As we have\nexplained, Congress\u2019 decision to restrict the class entitled\nto relief indicates that Congress precluded relief for the\nremainder. See, e.g., Block v. Community Nutrition Insti-\ntute, 467 U. S. 340, 349 (1984) (\u201c[W]hen a statute provides\n4   MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                  INDIANS v.

Section 2409a(d) thus indicates\nthat Congress concluded that those without any \u201cright, title,\nor interest\u201d in a given property did not have an inter-\nest sufficient to warrant abrogation of the Government\u2019s\nsovereign immunity.\n  Congress considered these conditions indispensible to its\nimmunity waiver.1 \u201c[W]hen Congress attaches conditions\nto legislation waiving the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates, those conditions must be strictly observed, and\nexceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.\u201d Block,\n461 U.

GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 833 (1976)). If a plaintiff\ncould oust the Government of title to land by means of an\nAPA action, \u201call of the carefully crafted provisions of the\nQTA deemed necessary for the protection of the national\npublic interest could be averted,\u201d and the \u201cIndian lands\nexception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.\u201d Block,\n461 U. S., at 284\u2013285. We therefore had little difficulty\nconcluding that Congress did not intend to render the\nQTA\u2019s limitations obsolete by affording any plaintiff the\nright to dispute the Government\u2019s title to any lands by\nway of an APA action\u2014and to empower any such plaintiff\nto \u201cdisposses[s] [the United States] of the disputed prop-\nerty without being afforded the option of paying damages.\u201d\nId., at 285.\n   It is undisputed that Patchak does not meet the condi-\ntions to sue under the QTA. He seeks to challenge the\nGovernment\u2019s title to Indian trust land (strike one); he\nseeks to force the Government to relinquish possession\nand title outright, leaving it no alternative to pay compen-\nsation (strike two); and he does not claim any personal\nright, title, or interest in the property (strike three). Thus,\nby its express terms, the QTA forbids the relief Patchak\nseeks. Compare ante, at 3 (\u201c[A]ll parties agree that the\nsuit now effectively seeks to divest the Federal Govern-\nment of title to the [Indian trust] land\u201d), with United\nStates v.

It primarily argues that the careful limitations Con-\ngress imposed upon the QTA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity are \u201csimply inapposite\u201d to actions in which the\nplaintiff advances a different \u201cgrievance\u201d to that underly-\ning a QTA suit, i.e., cases in which a plaintiff seeks to\n\u201cstrip the United States of title to the land . . . not on the\nground that it is his,\u201d but rather because \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to take land into trust violates a federal statute.\u201d\nAnte, at 7, 10. This analysis is unmoored from the text of\nthe APA.\n  Section 702 focuses not on a plaintiff \u2019s motivation for\nsuit, nor the arguments on which he grounds his case, but\nonly on whether another statute expressly or impliedly\nforbids the relief he seeks. The relief Patchak admittedly\nseeks\u2014to oust the Government of title to Indian trust\nland\u2014is identical to that forbidden by the QTA. Con-\nversely, the Court\u2019s hypothetical suit, alleging that the\nBradley Property was causing environmental harm, would\nnot be barred by the QTA. See ante, at 6. That is not\nbecause such an action asserts a different \u201cgrievance,\u201d but\nbecause it seeks different relief\u2014abatement of a nuisance\nrather than the extinguishment of title.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority claims, ante, at 7, n. 3, that this test has \u201cno obvious\n\nlimits,\u201d but it merely applies the text of \u00a7702 (which speaks of \u201crelief,\u201d\nnot \u201cgrievances\u201d).

S., at 278; see also App. 38.\n   The only difference that the majority can point to be-\ntween Block and this case is that Patchak asserts a weaker\ninterest in the disputed property. But that is no reason\nto imagine that Congress intended a different outcome. As\nthe majority itself acknowledges, the harm to the United\nStates and tribes when a plaintiff sues to extinguish the\nGovernment\u2019s title to Indian trust land is identical\n\u201cwhether or not a plaintiff claims to own the land himself.\u201d\nAnte, at 12. Yet, if the majority is correct, Congress in-\ntended the APA\u2019s waiver of immunity to apply to those\nhypothetical plaintiffs differently.

This is highly implausible. Unsurprisingly, the\nmajority does not even attempt to explain why Congress\nwould have intended this counterintuitive result.\n   It is no answer to say that the QTA reaches no further\nthan an \u201cordinary quiet title suit.\u201d Ante, at 11. The action\npermitted by \u00a72409a is not an ordinary quiet title suit. At\ncommon law, equity courts \u201cpermit[ted] a bill to quiet title\nto be filed only by a party in possession [of land] against a\ndefendant, who ha[d] been ineffectually seeking to estab-\nlish a legal title by repeated actions of ejectment.\u201d Wehr-\nman v. Conklin, 155 U. S. 314, 321\u2013322 (1894) (emphasis\nadded). Section 2409a is broader, requiring neither pre-\nrequisite. Moreover, as the majority tells us, see ante,\nat 7, an act to quiet title is \u201cuniversally understood\u201d as a\nproceeding \u201cto establish a plaintiff \u2019s title to land.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 34 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis added).

See S. Rep. No. 92\u2013575, at 5. Notwith-\nstanding its colloquial title, therefore, the QTA plainly\nallows suit in circumstances well beyond \u201cbread-and-\nbutter quiet title actions,\u201d ante, at 3, n. 3.5\n   The majority attempts to bolster its reading by empha-\nsizing an unexpected source within \u00a72409a: the clause\nspecifying that the United States may be sued \u201c \u2018in a civil\naction under this section.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11. The majority\nunderstands this clause to narrow the QTA\u2019s scope (and\nits limitations on the Government\u2019s immunity waiver) to\nquiet title claims only. But \u201cthis section\u201d speaks broadly\nto civil actions \u201cto adjudicate a disputed title to real prop-\nerty in which the United States claims an interest.\u201d\n\u00a72409a. Moreover, this clause is read most straightfor-\nwardly to serve a far more pedestrian purpose: simply to\nstate that a claimant can file \u201ca civil action under this\nsection\u201d\u2014\u00a72409a\u2014to adjudicate a disputed title in which\nthe United States claims an interest. Regardless of how\none reads the clause, however, it does not alter the APA\u2019s\nclear command that suits seeking relief forbidden by other\nstatutes are not authorized by the APA. And the QTA\nforbids the relief sought here: injunctive relief forcing the\nGovernment to relinquish title to Indian lands.\n   Even if the majority were correct that the QTA itself\nreached only as far as ordinary quiet title actions, that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntime of the Act. Ante, at 8, n. 4. But that substantial variation only\nillustrates the artificiality of the majority\u2019s claim that the Act only\n\u201caddresses quiet title actions, as ordinarily conceived.\u201d Ante, at 9, n. 5.\n   5 I recognize, of course, that the QTA is titled \u201c[a]n Act to permit suits\n\nto adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions.\u201d 86 Stat. 1176.\nBut \u201cthe title of a statute . . . cannot limit the plain meaning of [its]\ntext.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528\u2013529\n(1947). As explained above, the substance of Congress\u2019 enactment\nplainly extends more broadly than quiet title actions, mirroring the\nscope of the title proposed by the Government. See supra, at 2.\n10 MATCH-E-BE-NASH-SHE-WISH BAND OF POTTAWATOMI\n                 INDIANS v. PATCHAK\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwould establish only that the QTA does not expressly\nforbid the relief Patchak seeks. The APA, however, does\nnot waive the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity where\nany other statute \u201cexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief\nwhich is sought.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702 (emphasis added). The\ntext and history of the QTA, as well as this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent, make clear that the United States intended to retain\nits sovereign immunity from suits to dispossess the Gov-\nernment of Indian trust land. Patchak\u2019s suit to oust the\nGovernment of such land is therefore, at minimum, im-\npliedly forbidden.6\n                             II\n   Three consequences illustrate the difficulties today\u2019s\nholding will present for courts and the Government. First,\nit will render the QTA\u2019s limitations easily circumvented.\nAlthough those with property claims will remain formally\nprohibited from bringing APA suits because of Block,\nsavvy plaintiffs and their lawyers can recruit a family\nmember or neighbor to bring suit asserting only an \u201caes-\nthetic\u201d interest in the land but seeking an identical prac-\ntical objective\u2014to divest the Government of title and\npossession. \u00a7\u00a72409a(a), (b). Nothing will prevent them from\nobtaining relief that the QTA was designed to foreclose.\n   Second, the majority\u2019s holding will frustrate the Gov-\nernment\u2019s ability to resolve challenges to its fee-to-trust\ndecisions expeditiously. When a plaintiff like Patchak\nasserts an \u201caesthetic\u201d or \u201cenvironmental\u201d concern with a\nplanned use of Indian trust land, he may bring a distinct\nsuit under statutes like the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nThose challenges generally may be brought within the\nAPA\u2019s ordinary 6-year statute of limitations. Suits to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Because I conclude that sovereign immunity bars Patchak\u2019s suit,\n\nI would not reach the question of whether he has standing.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Until today, parties seeking to challenge\nsuch decisions had only a 30-day window to seek judi-\ncial review.     25 CFR \u00a7151.12 (2011); 61 Fed. Reg.\n18,082\u201318,083 (1996). That deadline promoted finality and\nsecurity\u2014necessary preconditions for the investment\nand \u201ceconomic development\u201d that are central goals of the\nIndian Reorganization Act. Ante, at 16.7 Today\u2019s result\nwill promote the opposite, retarding tribes\u2019 ability to de-\nvelop land until the APA\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations\nhas lapsed.8\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s rule creates substantial uncer-\ntainty regarding who exactly is barred from bringing APA\nclaims. The majority leaves unclear, for instance, whether\nits rule bars from suit only those who \u201cclaim any compet-\ning interest\u201d in the disputed land in their complaint, ante,\nat 7, or those who could claim a competing interest, but\nplead only that the Government\u2019s title claim violates a\nfederal statute. If the former, the majority\u2019s holding\nwould allow Patchak\u2019s challenge to go forward even if he\nhad some personal interest in the Bradley Property, so\nlong as his complaint did not assert it. That result is\ndifficult to square with Block and Mottaz. If the latter,\nmatters are even more peculiar. Because a shrewd plain-\ntiff will avoid referencing her own property claim in her\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Trust status, for instance, is a prerequisite to making lands eligible\nfor various federal incentives and tax credits closely tied to economic\ndevelopment. See, e.g., App. 56. Delayed suits will also inhibit tribes\nfrom investing in uses other than gaming that might be less objection-\nable\u2014like farming or office use.\n  8 Despite notice of the Government\u2019s intent through an organization\n\nwith which he was affiliated, Patchak did not challenge the Govern-\nment\u2019s fee-to-trust decision even though the organization did. See\nMichigan Gambling Opposition v. Kempthorne, 525 F. 3d 23 (CADC\n2008). Instead, Patchak waited to sue until three years after the\nSecretary\u2019s intent to acquire the property was published.
