SMITHKLINE BEECHAM \n\n          CORP., DBA GLAXOSMITHKLINE\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11\u2013204.      Argued April 16, 2012\u2014Decided June 18, 2012\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay em-\n  ployees overtime wages, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7207(a), but this requirement\n  does not apply with respect to workers employed \u201cin the capacity of\n  outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1). Congress did not elaborate on the\n  meaning of \u201coutside salesman,\u201d but it delegated authority to the De-\n  partment of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.\n  Three of the DOL\u2019s regulations are relevant to this case. First, 29\n  CFR \u00a7541.500 defines \u201coutside salesman\u201d to mean \u201cany employee . . .\n  [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales within the meaning of [29\n  U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)].\u201d \u00a7\u00a7541.500(a)(1)\uf02d(2). Section 203(k), in turn, states\n  that \u201c \u2018[s]ale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell,\n  consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\u201d Se-\n  cond, \u00a7541.501 clarifies that \u201c[s]ales within the meaning of [\u00a7203(k)]\n  include the transfer of title to tangible property.\u201d \u00a7541.501(b). Third,\n  \u00a7541.503 provides that promotion work that is \u201cperformed incidental\n  to and in conjunction with an employee\u2019s own outside sales or solici-\n  tations is exempt work,\u201d whereas promotion work that is \u201cincidental\n  to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.\u201d \u00a7541.503(a).\n  The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its prom-\n  ulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an \u201cout-\n  side salesman\u201d when the employee \u201cin some sense, has made sales.\u201d\n  69 Fed. Reg. 22162.\n    The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regu-\n  lation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dis-\n  pensed only upon a physician\u2019s prescription. In light of this require-\n  ment, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct\n  marketing efforts on physicians. Pharmaceutical companies promote\n2          CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    their products to physicians through a process called \u201cdetailing,\u201d\n    whereby employees known as \u201cdetailers\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutical sales\n    representatives\u201d try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for\n    the products in appropriate cases.\n       Petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales\n    representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their\n    primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from phy-\n    sicians to prescribe respondent\u2019s products in appropriate cases. Each\n    week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physi-\n    cians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours\n    attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks. Peti-\n    tioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and\n    they were subject to only minimal supervision. Petitioners were well\n    compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a\n    base salary and incentive pay. The amount of incentive pay was de-\n    termined based on the performance of petitioners\u2019 assigned portfolio\n    of drugs in their assigned sales territories. It is undisputed that peti-\n    tioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more\n    than 40 hours per week.\n       Petitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA\n    by failing to compensate them for overtime. Respondent moved for\n    summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were \u201cemployed in the\n    capacity of outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt\n    from the FLSA\u2019s overtime compensation requirement. The District\n    Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent. Peti-\n    tioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending\n    that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling def-\n    erence to the DOL\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which\n    the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.\n    The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.\n    The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOL\u2019s interpretation was not\n    entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasona-\n ble interpretation of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Pp. 8\u201325.\n    (a) The DOL filed amicus briefs in the Second Circuit and the\n Ninth Circuit in which it took the view that \u201ca \u2018sale\u2019 for the purposes\n of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction\n directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.\u201d\n Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in In re Novartis Wage\n and Hour Litigation, No. 09\u20130437 (CA2), p. 11. The DOL changed\n course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and\n now maintains that \u201c[a]n employee does not make a \u2018sale\u2019 . . . unless\n he actually transfers title to the property at issue.\u201d Brief for United\n States as Amicus Curiae 12\uf02d13. The DOL\u2019s current interpretation of\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nits regulations is not entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519\nU. S. 452. Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that in-\nterpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461\uf02d462, this\ngeneral rule does not apply in all cases. Deference is inappropriate,\nfor example, when the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous\nor inconsistent with the regulation,\u2019 \u201d id., at 461, or when there is\nreason to suspect that the interpretation \u201cdoes not reflect the agen-\ncy\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter,\u201d id., at 462. There\nare strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case. Peti-\ntioners invoke the DOL\u2019s interpretation to impose potentially mas-\nsive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the\ninterpretation was announced. To defer to the DOL\u2019s interpretation\nwould result in precisely the kind of \u201cunfair surprise\u201d against which\nthis Court has long warned. See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170\uf02d171. Until 2009, the pharmaceutical\nindustry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of\ntreating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the\nFLSA. The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice. Even\nmore important, despite the industry\u2019s decades-long practice, the\nDOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detail-\ners or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting\nunlawfully. The only plausible explanation for the DOL\u2019s inaction is\nacquiescence. Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is\nunwarranted here. The DOL\u2019s interpretation should instead be given\na measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade. See\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228. Pp. 8\u201314.\n   (b) The DOL\u2019s current interpretation\u2014that a sale demands a trans-\nfer of title\u2014is quite unpersuasive. It plainly lacks the hallmarks of\nthorough consideration. Because the DOL first announced its view\nthat pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen\nin a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public com-\nment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOL\u2019s\ninternal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable. The inter-\npretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA. The statute de-\nfines \u201csale\u201d to mean, inter alia, a \u201cconsignment for sale,\u201d and a \u201ccon-\nsignment for sale\u201d does not involve the transfer of title. The DOL\nrelies heavily on 29 CFR \u00a7541.501, which provides that \u201c[s]ales . . .\ninclude the transfer of title to tangible property,\u201d \u00a7541.501(b), but it\nis apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must in-\nclude a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of\ntitle are included within the term \u201csale.\u201d The DOL\u2019s \u201cexplanation\nthat obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug consti-\ntutes promotion, and not sales,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also\n4          CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    unconvincing. Since promotion work that is performed incidental to\n    an employee\u2019s own sales is exempt, the DOL\u2019s conclusion that detail-\n    ers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the\n    reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not\n    make sales. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (c) Because the DOL\u2019s interpretation is neither entitled to Auer\n    deference nor persuasive in its own right, traditional tools of inter-\n    pretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are ex-\n    empt outside salesmen. Pp. 16\u201324.\n          (1) The FLSA does not furnish a clear answer to this question,\n    but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone\n    \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.\u201d 29 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7213(a)(1). The statute\u2019s emphasis on \u201ccapacity\u201d counsels in favor of\n    a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an em-\n    ployee\u2019s responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in\n    which the employee works. The DOL\u2019s regulations provide additional\n    guidance. Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an em-\n    ployee whose primary duty is \u201cmaking sales\u201d and adopts the statu-\n    tory definition of \u201csale.\u201d This statutory definition contains at least\n    three important textual clues. First, the definition is introduced with\n    the verb \u201cincludes,\u201d which indicates that the examples enumerated\n    in the text are illustrative, not exhaustive. See Burgess v. United\n    States, 553 U. S. 124, 131, n. 3. Second, the list of transactions in-\n    cluded in the statutory definition is modified by \u201cany,\u201d which, in the\n    context of \u00a7203(k), is best read to mean \u201c \u2018one or some indiscriminate-\n    ly of whatever kind,\u2019 \u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5.\n    Third, the definition includes the broad catchall phrase \u201cother dispo-\n    sition.\u201d Under the rule of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase is\n    most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that\n    are tantamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a\n    commodity. Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrow-\n    er construction. Pp. 16\u201320.\n          (2) Given this interpretation of \u201cother disposition,\u201d it follows that\n    petitioners made sales under the FLSA and thus are exempt outside\n    salesmen within the meaning of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Petitioners\n    obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe re-\n    spondent\u2019s drugs. This kind of arrangement, in the unique regula-\n    tory environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate,\n    comfortably falls within the catchall category of \u201cother disposition.\u201d\n    That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides\n    further support for this conclusion. And this holding also comports\n    with the apparent purpose of the FLSA\u2019s exemption. The exemption\n    is premised on the belief that exempt employees normally earn sala-\n    ries well above the minimum wage and perform a kind of work that is\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  difficult to standardize to a particular time frame and that cannot\n  easily be spread to other workers. Petitioners\u2014each of whom earned\n  an average of more than $70,000 per year and spent 10 to 20 hours\n  outside normal business hours each week performing work related to\n  his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory\u2014are\n  hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was intended to protect.\n  Pp. 20\u201322.\n       (3) Petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments are also unavailing.\n  Pp. 22\u201324.\n635 F. 3d 383, affirmed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORPORATION\n\n            DBA GLAXOSMITHKLINE\n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 18, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) imposes mini\u00ad\nmum wage and maximum hours requirements on employ\u00ad\ners, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7206\uf02d207 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), but\nthose requirements do not apply to workers employed \u201cin\nthe capacity of outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1). This case\nrequires us to decide whether the term \u201coutside sales\u00ad\nman,\u201d as defined by Department of Labor (DOL or De\u00ad\npartment) regulations, encompasses pharmaceutical sales\nrepresentatives whose primary duty is to obtain nonbinding\ncommitments from physicians to prescribe their employ-\ner\u2019s prescription drugs in appropriate cases. We conclude\nthat these employees qualify as \u201coutside salesm[e]n.\u201d\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress enacted the FLSA in 1938 with the goal of\n\u201cprotect[ing] all covered workers from substandard wages\nand oppressive working hours.\u201d Barrentine v. Arkansas-\nBest Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 739 (1981); see\nalso 29 U. S. C. \u00a7202(a). Among other requirements, the\n2        CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nFLSA obligates employers to compensate employees for\nhours in excess of 40 per week at a rate of 1\u00bd times\nthe employees\u2019 regular wages. See \u00a7207(a). The overtime\ncompensation requirement, however, does not apply with\nrespect to all employees. See \u00a7213. As relevant here, the\nstatute exempts workers \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of\noutside salesman.\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1).1\n   Congress did not define the term \u201coutside salesman,\u201d\nbut it delegated authority to the DOL to issue regulations\n\u201cfrom time to time\u201d to \u201cdefin[e] and delimi[t]\u201d the term.\nIbid. The DOL promulgated such regulations in 1938,\n1940, and 1949. In 2004, following notice-and-comment\nprocedures, the DOL reissued the regulations with minor\namendments. See 69 Fed. Reg. 22122 (2004). The current\nregulations are nearly identical in substance to the regula\u00ad\ntions issued in the years immediately following the FLSA\u2019s\nenactment. See 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7541.500\uf02d541.504 (2011).\n   Three of the DOL\u2019s regulations are directly relevant to\nthis case: \u00a7\u00a7541.500, 541.501, and 541.503. We refer to\nthese three regulations as the \u201cgeneral regulation,\u201d the\n\u201csales regulation,\u201d and the \u201cpromotion-work regulation,\u201d\nrespectively.\n   The general regulation sets out the definition of the\nstatutory term \u201cemployee employed in the capacity of\noutside salesman.\u201d It defines the term to mean \u201cany\nemployee . . . [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales\nwithin the meaning of [29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)]\u201d2 and \u201c[w]ho is\ncustomarily and regularly engaged away from the employ\u00ad\ner\u2019s place or places of business in performing such primary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 This provision also exempts workers \u201cemployed in a bona fide execu\u00ad\n\ntive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(1).\n    2 The definition also includes any employee \u201c[w]hose primary duty is\n\n. . . obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities\nfor which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.\u201d 29\nCFR \u00a7541.500(a)(1)(ii). That portion of the definition is not at issue in\nthis case.\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

C. \u00a7203(k), states that \u201c \u2018[s]ale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019\nincludes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment\nfor sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\u201d Thus, un-\nder the general regulation, an outside salesman is any\nemployee whose primary duty is making any sale, ex\u00ad\nchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for\nsale, or other disposition.\n   The sales regulation restates the statutory definition of\nsale discussed above and clarifies that \u201c[s]ales within the\nmeaning of [29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)] include the transfer of\ntitle to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible\nand valuable evidences of intangible property.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.501(b).\n   Finally, the promotion-work regulation identifies \u201c[p]ro\u00ad\nmotion work\u201d as \u201cone type of activity often performed\nby persons who make sales, which may or may not be\nexempt outside sales work, depending upon the circum\u00ad\nstances under which it is performed.\u201d \u00a7541.503(a). Pro\u00ad\nmotion work that is \u201cperformed incidental to and in\nconjunction with an employee\u2019s own outside sales or\nsolicitations is exempt work,\u201d whereas promotion work\nthat is \u201cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by some\u00ad\none else is not exempt outside sales work.\u201d Ibid.\n   Additional guidance concerning the scope of the outside\nsalesman exemption can be gleaned from reports issued in\nconnection with the DOL\u2019s promulgation of regulations in\n1940 and 1949, and from the preamble to the 2004 regu\u00ad\nlations.

Although\nthe DOL has rejected proposals to eliminate or dilute the\nrequirement that outside salesmen make their own sales,\nthe Department has stressed that this requirement is\nmet whenever an employee \u201cin some sense make[s] a sale.\u201d\n1940 Report 46; see also Preamble 22162 (reiterating that\nthe exemption applies only to an employee who \u201cin some\nsense, has made sales\u201d). And the DOL has made it clear\nthat \u201c[e]xempt status should not depend\u201d on technicalities,\nsuch as \u201cwhether it is the sales employee or the customer\nwho types the order into a computer system and hits the\nreturn button,\u201d Preamble 22163, or whether \u201cthe order is\nfilled by [a] jobber rather than directly by [the employee\u2019s]\nown employer,\u201d 1949 Report 83.\n                             B\n  Respondent SmithKline Beecham Corporation is in the\nbusiness of developing, manufacturing, and selling pre\u00ad\nscription drugs. The prescription drug industry is subject\nto extensive federal regulation, including the now-familiar\nrequirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only\nupon a physician\u2019s prescription.4 In light of this require\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Congress imposed this requirement in 1951 when it amended the\n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to provide that drugs\nthat are \u201cnot safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner\u201d\nmay be dispensed \u201conly . . . upon a . . . prescription of a practitioner\nlicensed by law to administer such drug.\u201d Durham-Humphrey Amend\u00ad\nment of 1951, ch. 578, 65 Stat. 648\uf02d649 (codified at 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b)).\nAs originally enacted in 1938, the FDCA allowed manufacturers to\ndesignate certain drugs as prescription only, but \u201cit did not say which\ndrugs were to be sold by prescription or that there were any drugs that\ncould not be sold without a prescription.\u201d Temin, The Origin of Com\u00ad\npulsory Drug Prescriptions, 22 J. Law & Econ. 91, 98 (1979). Prior to\nCongress\u2019 enactment of the FDCA, a prescription was not needed to\nobtain any drug other than certain narcotics.

S. ____ (2012)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their\ndirect marketing efforts, not on the retail pharmacies\nthat dispense prescription drugs, but rather on the medi-\ncal practitioners who possess the authority to prescribe the\ndrugs in the first place. Pharmaceutical companies pro\u00ad\nmote their prescription drugs to physicians through a\nprocess called \u201cdetailing,\u201d whereby employees known as\n\u201cdetailers\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutical sales representatives\u201d\nprovide information to physicians about the company\u2019s\nproducts in hopes of persuading them to write prescrip\u00ad\ntions for the products in appropriate cases. See Sorrell v.\nIMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1\uf02d2)\n(describing the process of \u201cdetailing\u201d). The position of\n\u201cdetailer\u201d has existed in the pharmaceutical industry in\nsubstantially its current form since at least the 1950\u2019s,\nand in recent years the industry has employed more than\n90,000 detailers nationwide. See 635 F. 3d 383, 387, and\nn. 5, 396 (CA9 2011).\n   Respondent hired petitioners Michael Christopher and\nFrank Buchanan as pharmaceutical sales representatives\nin 2003. During the roughly four years when petitioners\nwere employed in that capacity,5 they were responsible\nfor calling on physicians in an assigned sales territory to\ndiscuss the features, benefits, and risks of an assigned\nportfolio of respondent\u2019s prescription drugs. Petitioners\u2019\nprimary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commit\u00ad\nment6 from the physician to prescribe those drugs in ap\u00ad\npropriate cases, and the training that petitioners received\nunderscored the importance of that objective.\n   Petitioners spent about 40 hours each week in the field\ncalling on physicians. These visits occurred during normal\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Respondent   terminated Christopher\u2019s employment in 2007, and\nBuchanan left voluntarily the same year to accept a similar position\nwith another pharmaceutical company.\n  6 The parties agree that the commitment is nonbinding.\n6       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness hours, from about 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Outside of\nnormal business hours, petitioners spent an additional 10\nto 20 hours each week attending events, reviewing product\ninformation, returning phone calls, responding to e-mails,\nand performing other miscellaneous tasks. Petitioners\nwere not required to punch a clock or report their hours,\nand they were subject to only minimal supervision.\n  Petitioners were well compensated for their efforts. On\naverage, Christopher\u2019s annual gross pay was just over\n$72,000, and Buchanan\u2019s was just over $76,000.7 Petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 gross pay included both a base salary and incentive\npay. The amount of petitioners\u2019 incentive pay was based\non the sales volume or market share of their assigned\ndrugs in their assigned sales territories,8 and this amount\nwas uncapped. Christopher\u2019s incentive pay exceeded 30\npercent of his gross pay during each of his years of em\u00ad\nployment; Buchanan\u2019s exceeded 25 percent. It is undis\u00ad\nputed that respondent did not pay petitioners time-and-a\u00ad\nhalf wages when they worked in excess of 40 hours per\nweek.\n                              C\n   Petitioners brought this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona under 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7216(b). Petitioners alleged that respondent violated the\nFLSA by failing to compensate them for overtime, and\nthey sought both backpay and liquidated damages as re\u00ad\nlief. Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat petitioners were \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The median pay for pharmaceutical detailers nationwide exceeds\n\n$90,000 per year. See Brief for Respondent 14.\n  8 The amount of incentive pay is not formally tied to the number of\n\nprescriptions written or commitments obtained, but because retail\npharmacies are prohibited from dispensing prescription drugs without\na physician\u2019s prescription, retail sales of respondent\u2019s products neces\u00ad\nsarily reflect the number of prescriptions written.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noutside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt\nfrom the FLSA\u2019s overtime compensation requirement.9\nThe District Court agreed and granted summary judgment\nto respondent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a\uf02d47a.\n   After the District Court issued its order, petitioners filed\na motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending that\nthe District Court had erred in failing to accord control-\nling deference to the DOL\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent\nregulations. That interpretation had been announced in\nan uninvited amicus brief filed by the DOL in a similar\naction then pending in the Second Circuit. See Brief for\nSecretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in In re Novartis\nWage and Hour Litigation, No. 09\u20130437 (hereinafter\nSecretary\u2019s Novartis Brief). The District Court rejected\nthis argument and denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 48a\uf02d52a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nSee 635 F. 3d 383. The Court of Appeals agreed that\nthe DOL\u2019s interpretation10 was not entitled to controlling\ndeference. See id., at 393\uf02d395. It held that, because the\ncommitment that petitioners obtained from physicians\nwas the maximum possible under the rules applicable to\nthe pharmaceutical industry, petitioners made sales with\u00ad\nin the meaning of the regulations. See id., at 395\uf02d397.\nThe court found it significant, moreover, that the DOL had\npreviously interpreted the regulations as requiring only\nthat an employee \u201c \u2018in some sense\u2019 \u201d make a sale, see id.,\nat 395\uf02d396 (emphasis deleted), and had \u201cacquiesce[d] in\nthe sales practices of the drug industry for over seventy\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Respondent also argued that petitioners were exempt administra\u00ad\n\ntive employees. The District Court and the Court of Appeals found it\nunnecessary to reach that argument, and the question is not before us.\n   10 The DOL filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit advancing sub\u00ad\n\nstantially the same interpretation it had advanced in its brief in the\nSecond Circuit. See Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in\nNo. 10\u201315257.\n8        CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nyears,\u201d id., at 399.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision conflicts with the Second\nCircuit\u2019s decision in In re Novartis Wage and Hour Litiga-\ntion, 611 F. 3d 141, 153\uf02d155 (2010) (holding that the\nDOL\u2019s interpretation is entitled to controlling deference).\nWe granted certiorari to resolve this split, 565 U. S. ___\n(2011), and we now affirm the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit.\n                            II\n   We must determine whether pharmaceutical detailers\nare outside salesmen as the DOL has defined that term in\nits regulations. The parties agree that the regulations\nthemselves were validly promulgated and are therefore\nentitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\nBut the parties disagree sharply about whether the DOL\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations is owed deference under\nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). It is to that ques\u00ad\ntion that we now turn.\n                             A\n   The DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical\ndetailers are not exempt outside salesmen in an amicus\nbrief filed in the Second Circuit in 2009, and the Depart\u00ad\nment has subsequently filed similar amicus briefs in other\ncases, including the case now before us.11 While the DOL\u2019s\nultimate conclusion that detailers are not exempt has\nremained unchanged since 2009, the same cannot be said\nof its reasoning. In both the Second Circuit and the Ninth\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The DOL invites \u201cinterested parties to inform it of private cases\n\ninvolving the misclassification of employees in contravention of the new\nPart 541 rule\u201d so that it may file amicus briefs \u201cin appropriate cases to\nshare with courts the Department\u2019s view of the proper application of\nthe new Part 541 rule.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, Office of Solicitor, Overtime\nSecurity Amicus Program, http://www.dol.gov/sol/541amicus.htm (as visited\nJune 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit, the DOL took the view that \u201ca \u2018sale\u2019 for the pur\u00ad\nposes of the outside sales exemption requires a con-\nsummated transaction directly involving the employee for\nwhom the exemption is sought.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Novartis\nBrief 11; see also Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus\nCuriae in No. 10\u201315257 (CA9), p. 12. Perhaps because\nof the nebulous nature of this \u201cconsummated transaction\u201d\ntest,12 the Department changed course after we granted\ncertiorari in this case. The Department now takes the\nposition that \u201c[a]n employee does not make a \u2018sale\u2019 for\npurposes of the \u2018outside salesman\u2019 exemption unless he\nactually transfers title to the property at issue.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12\uf02d13 (hereinafter U. S.\nBrief).13 Petitioners and the DOL assert that this new\ninterpretation of the regulations is entitled to controlling\ndeference. See Brief for Petitioners 31\uf02d42; U. S. Brief\n30\uf02d34.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 For example, it is unclear why a physician\u2019s nonbinding commit\u00ad\n\nment to prescribe a drug in an appropriate case cannot qualify as a sale\nunder this test. The broad term \u201ctransaction\u201d easily encompasses such\na commitment. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2425 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Third) (defining \u201ctransaction\u201d to\nmean \u201ca communicative action or activity involving two parties or two\nthings reciprocally affecting or influencing each other\u201d). A \u201cconsum\u00ad\nmated transaction\u201d is simply a transaction that has been fully completed.\nSee id., at 490 (defining \u201cconsummate\u201d to mean \u201cto bring to comple\u00ad\ntion\u201d). And a pharmaceutical sales representative who obtains such a\ncommitment is \u201cdirectly involv[ed]\u201d in this transaction. Thus, once a\npharmaceutical sales representative and a physician have fully com\u00ad\npleted their agreement, it may be said that they have entered into a\n\u201cconsummated transaction.\u201d\n   13 When pressed to clarify its position at oral argument, the DOL\n\nsuggested that a \u201ctransfer of possession in contemplation of a transfer\nof title\u201d might also suffice. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.\n   14 Neither petitioners nor the DOL asks us to accord controlling def\u00ad\n\nerence to the \u201cconsummated transaction\u201d interpretation the Depart\u00ad\nment advanced in its briefs in the Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit, nor\ncould we given that the Department has now abandoned that interpre\u00ad\ntation. See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 480\n10      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agen\u00ad\ncy\u2019s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even\nwhen that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see\nChase Bank USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 12); Auer, 519 U. S., at 461\uf02d462, this general\nrule does not apply in all cases. Deference is undoubtedly\ninappropriate, for example, when the agency\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regu\u00ad\nlation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359 (1989)). And defer\u00ad\nence is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to\nsuspect that the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cdoes not reflect\nthe agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter\nin question.\u201d Auer, supra, at 462; see also, e.g., Chase\nBank, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). This might occur\nwhen the agency\u2019s interpretation conflicts with a prior\ninterpretation, see, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shala-\nla, 512 U. S. 504, 515 (1994), or when it appears that the\ninterpretation is nothing more than a \u201cconvenient litigat\u00ad\ning position,\u201d Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488\nU. S. 204, 213 (1988), or a \u201c \u2018post hoc rationalizatio[n]\u2019\nadvanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency\naction against attack,\u201d Auer, supra, at 462 (quoting Bowen,\nsupra, at 212; alteration in original).\n   In this case, there are strong reasons for withholding\nthe deference that Auer generally requires. Petitioners in\u00ad\nvoke the DOL\u2019s interpretation of ambiguous regulations\nto impose potentially massive liability on respondent for\nconduct that occurred well before that interpretation was\nannounced. To defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation in this\ncircumstance would seriously undermine the principle\nthat agencies should provide regulated parties \u201cfair warn\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(1992) (noting that \u201cit would be quite inappropriate to defer to an\n\ninterpretation which has been abandoned by the policymaking agency \n\nitself \u201d).\n\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfaith reliance on [agency] pronouncements\u201d or in a case\ninvolving \u201cfines or damages\u201d).\n   This case well illustrates the point. Until 2009, the\npharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that\nits longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt\noutside salesmen transgressed the FLSA. The statute and\nregulations certainly do not provide clear notice of this.\nThe general regulation adopts the broad statutory defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201csale,\u201d and that definition, in turn, employs the\nbroad catchall phrase \u201cother disposition.\u201d See 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1). This catchall phrase could reasonably be\nconstrued to encompass a nonbinding commitment from a\nphysician to prescribe a particular drug, and nothing in\nthe statutory or regulatory text or the DOL\u2019s prior guid\u00ad\nance plainly requires a contrary reading. See Preamble\n22162 (explaining that an employee must \u201cin some sense\u201d\nmake a sale); 1940 Report 46 (same).\n   Even more important, despite the industry\u2019s decades\u00ad\nlong practice of classifying pharmaceutical detailers as\nexempt employees, the DOL never initiated any enforce\u00ad\nment actions with respect to detailers or otherwise sug\u00ad\ngested that it thought the industry was acting unlaw\u00ad\nfully.16 We acknowledge that an agency\u2019s enforcement\ndecisions are informed by a host of factors, some bearing\nno relation to the agency\u2019s views regarding whether a\nviolation has occurred. See, e.g., Heckler v. Chaney, 470\nU. S. 821, 831 (1985) (noting that \u201can agency decision not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 It appears that the DOL only once directly opined on the exempt\n\nstatus of detailers prior to 2009. In 1945, the Wage and Hour Division\nissued an opinion letter tentatively concluding that \u201cmedical detailists\u201d\nwho performed \u201cwork . . . aimed at increasing the use of [their employ\u00ad\ner\u2019s] product in hospitals and through physicians\u2019 recommendations\u201d\nqualified as administrative employees. Opinion Letter from Dept. of\nLabor, Wage and Hour Division (May 19, 1945), 1 CCH Labor Law\nService, Federal Wage-Hour Guide \u00b633,093. But that letter did not\naddress the outside salesman exemption.\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a\nnumber of factors which are peculiarly within its exper\u00ad\ntise\u201d). But where, as here, an agency\u2019s announcement of\nits interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of\nconspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair surprise is\nacute. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, while it may be\n\u201cpossible for an entire industry to be in violation of the\n[FLSA] for a long time without the Labor Department\nnoticing,\u201d the \u201cmore plausible hypothesis\u201d is that the De\u00ad\npartment did not think the industry\u2019s practice was un\u00ad\nlawful. Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc., 480 F. 3d\n505, 510\uf02d511 (2007). There are now approximately 90,000\npharmaceutical sales representatives; the nature of their\nwork has not materially changed for decades and is well\nknown; these employees are well paid; and like quintes\u00ad\nsential outside salesmen, they do not punch a clock and\noften work more than 40 hours per week. Other than\nacquiescence, no explanation for the DOL\u2019s inaction is\nplausible.\n   Our practice of deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation\nof its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has im\u00ad\nportant advantages,17 but this practice also creates a risk\nthat agencies will promulgate vague and open-ended\nregulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,\nthereby \u201cfrustrat[ing] the notice and predictability pur\u00ad\nposes of rulemaking.\u201d Talk America, Inc. v.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJudicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency\nRules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 655\uf02d668 (1996). It is one\nthing to expect regulated parties to conform their conduct\nto an agency\u2019s interpretations once the agency announces\nthem; it is quite another to require regulated parties to\ndivine the agency\u2019s interpretations in advance or else be\nheld liable when the agency announces its interpretations\nfor the first time in an enforcement proceeding and de\u00ad\nmands deference.\n   Accordingly, whatever the general merits of Auer def\u00ad\nerence, it is unwarranted here. We instead accord the\nDepartment\u2019s interpretation a measure of deference propor\u00ad\ntional to the \u201c \u2018thoroughness evident in its consideration,\nthe validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier\nand later pronouncements, and all those factors which\ngive it power to persuade.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218, 228 (2001) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)).\n                             B\n  We find the DOL\u2019s interpretation of its regulations quite\nunpersuasive. The interpretation to which we are now\nasked to defer\u2014that a sale demands a transfer of title\u2014\nplainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.\nBecause the DOL first announced its view that pharma\u00ad\nceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside\nsalesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no oppor\u00ad\ntunity for public comment, and the interpretation that\ninitially emerged from the Department\u2019s internal deci\u00ad\nsionmaking process proved to be untenable. After arguing\nsuccessfully in the Second Circuit and then unsucess-\nfully in the Ninth Circuit that a sale for present purposes\nsimply requires a \u201cconsummated transaction,\u201d the DOL ad\u00ad\nvanced a different interpretation in this Court. Here, the\nDOL\u2019s brief states unequivocally that \u201c[a]n employee does\nnot make a \u2018sale\u2019 for purposes of the \u2018outside salesman\u2019\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexemption unless he actually transfers title to the prop\u00ad\nerty at issue.\u201d U. S. Brief 12\uf02d13.\n   This new interpretation is flatly inconsistent with the\nFLSA, which defines \u201csale\u201d to mean, inter alia, a \u201ccon\u00ad\nsignment for sale.\u201d A \u201cconsignment for sale\u201d does not\ninvolve the transfer of title. See, e.g., Sturm v. Boker, 150\nU. S. 312, 330 (1893) (\u201cThe agency to sell and return the\nproceeds, or the specific goods if not sold . . . does not\ninvolve a change of title\u201d); Hawkland, Consignment Sell\u00ad\ning Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 67 Com. L. J.\n146, 147 (1962) (explaining that \u201c \u2018[a] consignment of goods\nfor sale does not pass the title at any time, nor does it\ncontemplate that it should be passed\u2019 \u201d (quoting Rio\nGrande Oil Co. v. Miller Rubber Co. of N. Y., 31 Ariz. 84,\n87, 250 P. 564, 565 (1926))).\n   The DOL cannot salvage its interpretation by arguing\nthat a \u201cconsignment for sale\u201d may eventually result in the\ntransfer of title (from the consignor to the ultimate pur\u00ad\nchaser if the consignee in fact sells the good). Much the\nsame may be said about a physician\u2019s nonbinding com\u00ad\nmitment to prescribe a particular product in an appropri\u00ad\nate case. In that situation, too, agreement may eventually\nresult in the transfer of title (from the manufacturer to a\npharmacy and ultimately to the patient for whom the drug\nis prescribed).\n   In support of its new interpretation, the DOL relies\nheavily on its sales regulation, which states in part that\n\u201c[s]ales [for present purposes] include the transfer of title\nto tangible property,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7541.501(b) (emphasis\nadded). This regulation, however, provides little support\nfor the DOL\u2019s position. The DOL reads the sales regula\u00ad\ntion to mean that a \u201csale\u201d necessarily includes the transfer\nof title, but that is not what the regulation says. And it\nseems clear that that is not what the regulation means.\nThe sentence just subsequent to the one on which the DOL\nrelies, echoing the terms of the FLSA, makes clear that a\n16     CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cconsignment for sale\u201d qualifies as a sale. Since a con\u00ad\nsignment for sale does not involve a transfer of title, it is\napparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a\nsale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions\ninvolving a transfer of title are included within the term\n\u201csale.\u201d\n   Petitioners invite us to look past the DOL\u2019s \u201cdetermina\u00ad\ntion that a sale must involve the transfer of title\u201d and\ninstead defer to the Department\u2019s \u201cexplanation that ob\u00ad\ntaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug\nconstitutes promotion, and not sales.\u201d Reply Brief for\nPetitioners 17. The problem with the DOL\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the promotion-work regulation, however, is that it\ndepends almost entirely on the DOL\u2019s flawed transfer-of\u00ad\ntitle interpretation. The promotion-work regulation does\nnot distinguish between promotion work and sales; rather,\nit distinguishes between exempt promotion work and\nnonexempt promotion work. Since promotion work that is\nperformed incidental to an employee\u2019s own sales is ex\u00ad\nempt, the DOL\u2019s conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers\nperform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong\nas the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those\nemployees do not make sales. For the reasons already\ndiscussed, we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.\n   In light of our conclusion that the DOL\u2019s interpretation\nis neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its\nown right, we must employ traditional tools of interpreta\u00ad\ntion to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside\nsalesmen.\n                             C\n                              1\n   We begin with the text of the FLSA. Although the\nprovision that establishes the overtime salesman exemp\u00ad\ntion does not furnish a clear answer to the question before\nus, it provides at least one interpretive clue: It exempts\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nanyone \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside\nsalesman.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(1) (emphasis added). \u201cCa\u00ad\npacity,\u201d used in this sense, means \u201c[o]utward condition\nor circumstances; relation; character; position.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2\nOxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (\u201cPosition,\ncondition, character, relation\u201d). The statute\u2019s emphasis on\nthe \u201ccapacity\u201d of the employee counsels in favor of a func\u00ad\ntional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an\nemployee\u2019s responsibilities in the context of the particular\nindustry in which the employee works.\n   The DOL\u2019s regulations provide additional guidance. The\ngeneral regulation defines an outside salesman as an\nemployee whose primary duty is \u201cmaking sales,\u201d and\nit adopts the statutory definition of \u201csale.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1)(i). This definition contains at least three\nimportant textual clues. First, the definition is introduced\nwith the verb \u201cincludes\u201d instead of \u201cmeans.\u201d This word\nchoice is significant because it makes clear that the exam\u00ad\nples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative,\nnot exhaustive. See Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.\n124, 131, n. 3 (2008) (explaining that \u201c[a] term whose\nstatutory definition declares what it \u2018includes\u2019 is more\nsusceptible to extension of meaning . . . than where . . . the\ndefinition declares what a term \u2018means\u2019 \u201d (alteration in\noriginal; some internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed,\nCongress used the narrower word \u201cmeans\u201d in other provi\u00ad\nsions of the FLSA when it wanted to cabin a definition to\na specific list of enumerated items. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7203(a) (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means an individual, partnership, asso\u00ad\nciation, corporation, business trust, legal representative,\nor any organized group of persons\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Second, the list of transactions included in the statu\u00ad\ntory definition of sale is modified by the word \u201cany.\u201d We\nhave recognized that the modifier \u201cany\u201d can mean \u201cdiffer\u00ad\nent things depending upon the setting,\u201d Nixon v. Missouri\n18       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nMunicipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004), but in the\ncontext of 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k), it is best read to mean \u201c \u2018one\nor some indiscriminately of whatever kind,\u2019 \u201d United States\nv. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 97 (1976)). That is so\nbecause Congress defined \u201csale\u201d to include both the un\u00ad\nmodified word \u201csale\u201d and transactions that might not be\nconsidered sales in a technical sense, including exchanges\nand consignments for sale.18\n   Third, Congress also included a broad catchall phrase:\n\u201cother disposition.\u201d Neither the statute nor the regula\u00ad\ntions define \u201cdisposition,\u201d but dictionary definitions of the\nterm range from \u201crelinquishment or alienation\u201d to \u201car\u00ad\nrangement.\u201d See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (\u201c[t]he getting rid, or making over, of\nanything; relinquishment or alienation\u201d); ibid. (def. 1(a))\n(\u201c[t]he ordering, regulating, or administering of any\u00ad\nthing\u201d); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 493 (def. 4)\n(\u201c[t]he action of disposing of, putting away, getting rid of,\nmaking over, etc.\u201d); ibid. (def. 1) (\u201c[t]he action of setting in\norder, or condition of being set in order; arrangement,\norder\u201d). We agree with the DOL that the rule of ejusdem\ngeneris should guide our interpretation of the catchall\nphrase, since it follows a list of specific items.19 But the\nlimit the DOL posits, one that would confine the phrase to\ndispositions involving \u201ccontract[s] for the exchange of\ngoods or services in return for value,\u201d see U. S. Brief 20, is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   18 Given that the FLSA provides its own definition of \u201csale\u201d that is\n\nmore expansive than the term\u2019s ordinary meaning, the DOL\u2019s reliance\non dictionary definitions of the word \u201csale\u201d is misplaced. See, e.g.,\nBurgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (noting that \u201c[w]hen\na statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   19 The canon of ejusdem generis \u201climits general terms [that] follow\n\nspecific ones to matters similar to those specified.\u201d CSX Transp., Inc. v.\nAlabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U.

These interpretations would\ndefeat Congress\u2019 intent to define \u201csale\u201d in a broad manner\nand render the general statutory language meaningless.\nSee United States v. Alpers, 338 U. S. 680, 682 (1950)\n(instructing that rule of ejusdem generis cannot be em\u00ad\nployed to \u201cobscure and defeat the intent and purpose of\nCongress\u201d or \u201crender general words meaningless\u201d). In\u00ad\ndeed, we are hard pressed to think of any contract for the\nexchange of goods or services in return for value or any\nfirm agreement to buy that would not also fall within one\nof the specifically enumerated categories.20\n   The specific list of transactions that precedes the phrase\n\u201cother disposition\u201d seems to us to represent an attempt to\naccommodate industry-by-industry variations in methods\nof selling commodities. Consequently, we think that the\ncatchall phrase \u201cother disposition\u201d is most reasonably in\u00ad\nterpreted as including those arrangements that are tan\u00ad\ntamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale\nof a commodity.\n   Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a nar\u00ad\nrower construction.21 As discussed above, the sales regu\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 The dissent\u2019s approach suffers from the same flaw. The dissent\n\ncontends that, in order to make a sale, an employee must at least\nobtain a \u201cfirm commitment to buy.\u201d Post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\nBut when an employee who has extended an offer to sell obtains a \u201cfirm\ncommitment to buy,\u201d that transaction amounts to a \u201ccontract to sell.\u201d\nGiven that a \u201ccontract to sell\u201d already falls within the statutory defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201csale,\u201d the dissent\u2019s interpretation would strip the catchall\nphrase of independent meaning.\n   21 In the past, we have stated that exemptions to the FLSA must be\n\n\u201cnarrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and\ntheir application limited to those [cases] plainly and unmistakably\nwithin their terms and spirit.\u201d Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S.\n388, 392 (1960). Petitioners and the DOL contend that Arnold requires\nus to construe the outside salesman exemption narrowly, but Arnold is\n20       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlation instructs that sales within the meaning of 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7203(k) \u201cinclude the transfer of title to tangible\nproperty,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7541.501(b) (emphasis added), but this\nregulation in no way limits the broad statutory definition\nof \u201csale.\u201d And although the promotion-work regulation\ndistinguishes between promotion work that is incidental\nto an employee\u2019s own sales and work that is incidental to\nsales made by someone else, see \u00a7541.503(a), this distinc\u00ad\ntion tells us nothing about the meaning of \u201csale.\u201d22\n                             2\n  Given our interpretation of \u201cother disposition,\u201d it follows\nthat petitioners made sales for purposes of the FLSA and\ntherefore are exempt outside salesmen within the mean\u00ad\ning of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Obtaining a nonbinding\ncommitment from a physician to prescribe one of respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to\nensure the eventual disposition of the products that re\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninapposite where, as here, we are interpreting a general definition that\napplies throughout the FLSA.\n   22 The dissent\u2019s view that pharmaceutical detailers are more naturally\n\ncharacterized as nonexempt promotional employees than as exempt out\u00ad\nside salesmen relies heavily on the DOL\u2019s explanation in its 1940 Re\u00ad\nport that \u201csales promotion men\u201d are not salesmen. See post, at 7; see\nalso 1940 Report 46. There, the Department described a \u201csales promo\u00ad\ntion man\u201d as an employee who merely \u201cpav[es] the way for salesmen\u201d\nand who frequently \u201cdeals with retailers who are not customers of his\nown employer but of his employer\u2019s customer\u201d and is \u201cinterested in\nsales by the retailer, not to the retailer.\u201d 1940 Report 46. The dissent\nasserts that detailers are analogous to \u201csales promotion men\u201d because\nthey deal with \u201cindividuals, namely doctors, \u2018who are not customers\u2019 of\ntheir own employer\u201d and \u201care primarily interested in sales authorized\nby the doctor, not to the doctor.\u201d Post, at 7. But this comparison is\ninapt. The equivalent of a \u201csales promotion man\u201d in the pharmaceuti\u00ad\ncal industry would be an employee who promotes a manufacturer\u2019s\nproducts to the retail pharmacies that sell the products after purchas\u00ad\ning them from a wholesaler or distributor. Detailers, by contrast,\nobtain nonbinding commitments from the gatekeepers who must\nprescribe the product if any sale is to take place at all.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nspondent sells.23 This kind of arrangement, in the unique\nregulatory environment within which pharmaceutical com\u00ad\npanies must operate, comfortably falls within the catch-\nall category of \u201cother disposition.\u201d\n   That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of\nsalesmen provides further support for our conclusion.\nPetitioners were hired for their sales experience. They\nwere trained to close each sales call by obtaining the\nmaximum commitment possible from the physician. They\nworked away from the office, with minimal supervision,\nand they were rewarded for their efforts with incentive\ncompensation. It would be anomalous to require respond\u00ad\nent to compensate petitioners for overtime, while at the\nsame time exempting employees who function identically to\npetitioners in every respect except that they sell physician\u00ad\nadministered drugs, such as vaccines and other inject-\nable pharmaceuticals, that are ordered by the physician\ndirectly rather than purchased by the end user at a phar\u00ad\nmacy with a prescription from the physician.\n   Our holding also comports with the apparent purpose of\nthe FLSA\u2019s exemption for outside salesmen. The exemp\u00ad\ntion is premised on the belief that exempt employees\n\u201ctypically earned salaries well above the minimum wage\u201d\nand enjoyed other benefits that \u201cse[t] them apart from the\nnonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.\u201d Preamble\n22124. It was also thought that exempt employees per\u00ad\nformed a kind of work that \u201cwas difficult to standardize to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 Our point is not, as the dissent suggests, that any employee who\n\ndoes the most that he or she is able to do in a particular position to\nensure the eventual sale of a product should qualify as an exempt\noutside salesman. See post, at 9 (noting that \u201cthe \u2018most\u2019 a California\nfirm\u2019s marketing employee may be able \u2018to do\u2019 to secure orders from\nNew York customers is to post an advertisement on the Internet\u201d).\nRather, our point is that, when an entire industry is constrained by law\nor regulation from selling its products in the ordinary manner, an\nemployee who functions in all relevant respects as an outside salesman\nshould not be excluded from that category based on technicalities.\n22      CHRISTOPHER v.

Petitioners\u2014each of\nwhom earned an average of more than $70,000 per year\nand spent between 10 and 20 hours outside normal busi\u00ad\nness hours each week performing work related to his as\u00ad\nsigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory\u2014\nare hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was\nintended to protect. And it would be challenging, to say\nthe least, for pharmaceutical companies to compensate\ndetailers for overtime going forward without significantly\nchanging the nature of that position. See, e.g., Brief for\nPhRMA as Amicus Curiae 14\uf02d20 (explaining that \u201ckey\naspects of [detailers\u2019] jobs as they are currently structured\nare fundamentally incompatible with treating [detailers]\nas hourly employees\u201d).\n                             3\n   The remaining arguments advanced by petitioners and\nthe dissent are unavailing. Petitioners contend that de\u00ad\ntailers are more naturally classified as nonexempt promo\u00ad\ntional employees who merely stimulate sales made by\nothers than as exempt outside salesmen. They point out\nthat respondent\u2019s prescription drugs are not actually sold\nuntil distributors and retail pharmacies order the drugs\nfrom other employees. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 7.\nThose employees,24 they reason, are the true salesmen in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 According to one of respondent\u2019s amici, most pharmaceutical com\u00ad\n\npanies \u201chave systems in place to maintain the inventories of wholesal\u00ad\ners and retailers of prescription drugs (consisting mainly of periodic\nrestocking pursuant to a general contract), [and] these systems are\nlargely ministerial and require only a few employees to administer\nthem.\u201d Brief for PhRMA as Amicus Curiae 24; see also ibid.

But, taken to its extreme,\npetitioners\u2019 theory would require that we treat as a nonex\u00ad\nempt promotional employee a manufacturer\u2019s representa\u00ad\ntive who takes an order from a retailer but then transfers\nthe order to a jobber\u2019s employee to be filled, or a car\nsalesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks\nhis or her assistant to enter the order into the computer.\nThis formalistic approach would be difficult to reconcile\nwith the broad language of the regulations and the stat\u00ad\nutory definition of \u201csale,\u201d and it is in significant ten\u00ad\nsion with the DOL\u2019s past practice. See 1949 Report 83\n(explaining that the manufacturer\u2019s representative was\nclearly \u201cperforming sales work regardless of the fact that\nthe order is filled by the jobber rather than directly by his\nown employer\u201d); Preamble 22162 (noting that \u201ctechnologi\u00ad\ncal changes in how orders are taken and processed should\nnot preclude the exemption for employees who in some\nsense make the sales\u201d).\n   Petitioners additionally argue that detailers are the\nfunctional equivalent of employees who sell a \u201cconcept,\u201d\nand they point to Wage and Hour Division opinion letters,\nas well as lower court decisions, deeming such employees\nnonexempt. See Brief for Petitioners 47\uf02d48. Two of these\nopinions, however, concerned employees who were more\nanalogous to buyers than to sellers. See Clements v. Serco,\nInc., 530 F. 3d 1224, 1229\u20131230, n. 4 (CA10 2008) (ex\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nrepresentatives but \u201cfewer than ten employees who are responsible for\n\nprocessing orders from retailers and wholesalers, a ratio that is typical\n\nof how the industry is structured\u201d).\n\n24     CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaining that, although military recruiters \u201c[i]n a loose\nsense\u201d were \u201cselling the Army\u2019s services,\u201d it was the Army\nthat would \u201cpa[y] for the services of the recruits who en\u00ad\nlist\u201d); Opinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour\nDivision (Aug. 19, 1994), 1994 WL 1004855 (explaining\nthat selling the \u201cconcept\u201d of organ donation \u201cis similar\nto that of outside buyers who in a very loose sense are\nsometimes described as selling their employer\u2019s \u2018service\u2019\nto the person for whom they obtain their goods\u201d). And the\nother two opinions are likewise inapposite. One concerned\nemployees who were not selling a good or service at all,\nsee Opinion Letter from Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour\nDivision (May 22, 2006), 2006 WL 1698305 (concluding\nthat employees who solicit charitable contributions are not\nexempt), and the other concerned employees who were\nincapable of selling any good or service because their\nemployer had yet to extend an offer, see Opinion Letter\nfrom Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division (Apr. 20,\n1999), 1999 WL 1002391 (concluding that college recruit\u00ad\ners are not exempt because they merely induce qualified\ncustomers to apply to the college, and the college \u201cin turn\ndecides whether to make a contractual offer of its educa\u00ad\ntional services to the applicant\u201d).\n   Finally, the dissent posits that the \u201cprimary duty\u201d of a\npharmaceutical detailer is not \u201cto obtain a promise to\nprescribe a particular drug,\u201d but rather to \u201cprovid[e] in\u00ad\nformation so that the doctor will keep the drug in mind\nwith an eye toward using it when appropriate.\u201d Post, at 6.\nBut the record in this case belies that contention. Peti\u00ad\ntioners\u2019 end goal was not merely to make physicians aware\nof the medically appropriate uses of a particular drug.\nRather, it was to convince physicians actually to prescribe\nthe drug in appropriate cases. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n40a (finding that petitioners\u2019 \u201cprimary objective was con\u00ad\nvincing physicians to prescribe [respondent\u2019s] products to\ntheir patients\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The question is\nwhether drug company detailers fall within the scope of\nthe term \u201coutside salesman.\u201d In my view, they do not.\n                             I\n   The Court describes the essential aspects of the detail-\ner\u2019s job as follows: First, the detailer \u201cprovide[s] infor-\nmation to physicians about the company\u2019s products in\nhopes of persuading them to write prescriptions for the\nproducts in appropriate cases.\u201d Ante, at 5.

Third, the detailers\u2019 compensation\nincludes an \u201cincentive\u201d element \u201cbased on the sales volume\nor market share of their assigned drugs in their assigned\nsales territories.\u201d Ante, at 6. The Court adds that the\n2      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndetailers work with \u201conly minimal supervision\u201d and be-\nyond normal business hours \u201cattending events, reviewing\nproduct information, returning phone calls, responding to\ne-mails, and performing other miscellaneous tasks.\u201d Ante,\nat 6.\n   As summarized, I agree with the Court\u2019s description\nof the job. In light of important, near-contemporaneous\ndifferences in the Justice Department\u2019s views as to the\nmeaning of relevant Labor Department regulations, see\nante, at 8\u20139, I also agree that we should not give the Solic-\nitor General\u2019s current interpretive view any especially\nfavorable weight. Ante, at 14. Thus, I am willing to as-\nsume, with the Court, that we should determine whether\nthe statutory term covers the detailer\u2019s job as here\ndescribed through our independent examination of the\nstatute\u2019s language and the related Labor Department\nregulations. But, I conclude on that basis that a detailer\nis not an \u201coutside salesman.\u201d\n                              II\n   The FLSA does not itself define the term \u201coutside\nsalesman.\u201d Rather, it exempts from wage and hour re-\nquirements \u201cany employee employed . . . in the capacity of\noutside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited\nfrom time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, we must look\nto relevant Labor Department regulations to answer the\nquestion. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); see also Long\nIsland Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 165\n(2007) (explaining that \u201cthe FLSA explicitly leaves gaps\u201d\nto be filled by regulations).\n   There are three relevant regulations. The first is enti-\ntled \u201cGeneral rule for outside sales employees,\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.500 (2011); the second is entitled \u201cMaking sales or\nobtaining orders,\u201d \u00a7541.501; and the third is entitled\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cPromotion work,\u201d \u00a7541.503. The relevant language of\nthe first two regulations is similar. The first says that\nthe term \u201c \u2018employee employed in the capacity of outside\nsalesman\u2019 . . . shall mean any employee . . . [w]hose pri-\nmary duty is: (i) making sales within the meaning of sec-\ntion 3(k) of the Act, or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for\nservices or for the use of facilities . . . .\u201d \u00a7541.500(a)(1).\nThe second regulation tells us that the first regulation\n\u201crequires that the employee be engaged in . . . (1) Making\nsales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (2)\nObtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of\nfacilities.\u201d \u00a7541.501(a).\n   The second part of these quoted passages is irrelevant\nhere, for it concerns matters not at issue, namely \u201corders\nor contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\u201d The\nremaining parts of the two regulations are similarly irrel-\nevant. See Appendix, infra. Thus, the relevant portions of\nthe first two regulations say simply that the employee\u2019s\n\u201cprimary duty\u201d must be \u201cmaking sales within the meaning\nof section 3(k) of the Act.\u201d And \u00a73(k) of the Act says that\nthe word \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 includes any sale, exchange, con-\ntract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or\nother disposition.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k).\n   Unless we give the words of the statute and regulations\nsome special meaning, a detailer\u2019s primary duty is not that\nof \u201cmaking sales\u201d or the equivalent. A detailer might\nconvince a doctor to prescribe a drug for a particular kind\nof patient. If the doctor encounters such a patient, he\nmight prescribe the drug. The doctor\u2019s client, the patient,\nmight take the prescription to a pharmacist and ask the\npharmacist to fill the prescription. If so, the pharmacist\nmight sell the manufacturer\u2019s drug to the patient, or\nmight substitute a generic version. But it is the pharma-\ncist, not the detailer, who will have sold the drug.\n   To put the same fairly obvious point in the language of\nthe regulations and of \u00a73(k) of the FLSA, see 29 U. S. C.\n4      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7203(k), the detailer does not \u201csell\u201d anything to the doctor.\nSee Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1454 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n\u201csale\u201d as \u201c[t]he transfer of property or title for a price\u201d).\nNor does he, during the course of that visit or immedi-\nately thereafter, \u201cexchange\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s product for\nmoney or for anything else. He enters into no \u201ccontract to\nsell\u201d on behalf of anyone. He \u201cconsigns\u201d nothing \u201cfor sale.\u201d\nHe \u201cships\u201d nothing for sale. He does not \u201cdispose\u201d of any\nproduct at all.\n   What the detailer does is inform the doctor about the\nnature of the manufacturer\u2019s drugs and explain their uses,\ntheir virtues, their drawbacks, and their limitations. The\ndetailer may well try to convince the doctor to prescribe\nthe manufacturer\u2019s drugs for patients. And if the detailer\nis successful, the doctor will make a \u201cnonbinding commit-\nment\u201d to write prescriptions using one or more of those\ndrugs where appropriate. If followed, that \u201cnonbinding\ncommitment\u201d is, at most, a nonbinding promise to consider\nadvising a patient to use a drug where medical indications\nso indicate (if the doctor encounters such a patient), and to\nwrite a prescription that will likely (but may not) lead that\nperson to order that drug under its brand name from the\npharmacy. (I say \u201cmay not\u201d because 30% of patients in a\n2-year period have not filled a prescription given to them\nby a doctor. See USA Today, Kaiser Family Foundation,\nHarvard School of Public Health, The Public on Prescrip-\ntion Drugs and Pharmaceutical Companies 3 (2008),\navailable at http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/7748.pdf\n(all Internet materials as visited June 13, 2012, and avail-\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). And when patients do\nfill prescriptions, 75% are filled with generic drugs. See\nDept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Science &\nData Policy, Expanding the Use of Generic Drugs 2\n(2010).)\n   Where in this process does the detailer sell the product?\nAt most he obtains from the doctor a \u201cnonbinding com-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmitment\u201d to advise his patient to take the drug (or per-\nhaps a generic equivalent) as well as to write any neces-\nsary prescription. I put to the side the fact that neither\nthe Court nor the record explains exactly what a \u201cnonbind-\ning commitment\u201d is. Like a \u201cdefinite maybe,\u201d an \u201cimpos-\nsible solution,\u201d or a \u201ctheoretical experience,\u201d a \u201cnonbinding\ncommitment\u201d seems to claim more than it can deliver.\nRegardless, other than in colloquial speech, to obtain a\ncommitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to\nobtain a commitment to sell that product, no matter how\noften the client takes the advice (or the patient does what\nthe doctor recommends).\n  The third regulation, entitled \u201cPromotion work,\u201d lends\nsupport to this view. That is because the detailer\u2019s work\nas described above is best viewed as promotion work. The\nregulation makes clear that promotion work falls within\nthe statutory exemption only when the promotion work \u201cis\nactually performed incidental to and in conjunction with\nan employee\u2019s own outside sales or solicitations.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.503(a) (emphasis added). But it is not exempt if it is\n\u201cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else.\u201d\nIbid.\n  The detailer\u2019s work, in my view, is more naturally char-\nacterized as involving \u201c[p]romotional activities designed to\nstimulate sales . . . made by someone else,\u201d \u00a7541.503, e.g.,\nthe pharmacist or the wholesaler, than as involving\n\u201c[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate\u201d the detail-\ner\u2019s \u201cown sales.\u201d\n  Three other relevant documents support this reading.\nFirst, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America (PhRMA), of which respondent is a mem-\nber, publishes a \u201cCode on Interactions with Healthcare Pro-\nfessionals.\u201d    See PhRMA, Code on Interactions with\nHealthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code) (rev. July 2008),\navailable at http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/108/\nphrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf. The PhRMA Code de-\n6      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nscribes a detailer\u2019s job in some depth. It consistently\nrefers to detailers as \u201cdelivering accurate, up-to-date\ninformation to healthcare professionals,\u201d id., at 14, and it\nstresses the importance of a doctor\u2019s treatment decision\nbeing based \u201csolely on each patient\u2019s medical needs\u201d and\nthe doctor\u2019s \u201cmedical knowledge and experience,\u201d id., at 2.\nThe PhRMA Code also forbids the offering or providing of\nanything \u201cin a manner or on conditions that would inter-\nfere with the independence of a healthcare professional\u2019s\nprescribing practices.\u201d Id., at 13. But the PhRMA Code\nnowhere refers to detailers as if they were salesmen,\nrather than providers of information, nor does it refer to\nany kind of commitment.\n  To the contrary, the document makes clear that the\npharmaceutical industry itself understands that it cannot\nbe a detailer\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d to obtain a nonbinding\ncommitment, for, in respect to many doctors, such a com-\nmitment taken alone is unlikely to make a significant\ndifference to their doctor\u2019s use of a particular drug. When\na particular drug, say Drug D, constitutes the best treat-\nment for a particular patient, a knowledgeable doctor\nshould (hence likely will) prescribe it irrespective of any\nnonbinding commitment to do so. Where some other drug,\nhowever, is likely to prove more beneficial for a particular\npatient, that doctor should not (hence likely will not)\nprescribe Drug D irrespective of any nonbinding commit-\nment to the contrary.\n  At a minimum, the document explains why a detailer\nshould not (hence likely does not) see himself as seeking\nprimarily to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular\ndrug, as opposed to providing information so that the\ndoctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward\nusing it when appropriate. And because the detailer\u2019s\n\u201cprimary duty\u201d is informational, as opposed to sales-\noriented, he fails to qualify as an outside salesman. See\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1)(i) (restricting the outside salesman exemp-\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

The 1940 Report says that such individuals\n\u201cpav[e] the way\u201d for sales by others. Id., at 46. \u201cFrequently,\u201d\nthey deal \u201cwith [the] retailers who are not custom-\ners of [their] own employer but of [their] employer\u2019s cus-\ntomer.\u201d Ibid. And they are \u201cprimarily interested in sales by\nthe retailer, not to the retailer.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[T]hey do not make\nactual sales,\u201d and they \u201care admittedly not outside sales-\nmen.\u201d Ibid.\n   Like the \u201csales promotion men,\u201d the detailers before us\ndeal with individuals, namely doctors, \u201cwho are not cus-\ntomers\u201d of their own employer. And the detailers are\nprimarily interested in sales authorized by the doctor, not\nto the doctor. According to the 1940 Report, sales promo-\ntion men are not \u201coutside salesmen,\u201d primarily because\nthey seek to bring about, not their own sales, but sales by\nothers. Thus, the detailers in this case are not \u201coutside\nsalesmen.\u201d\n   Third, a Wage and Hour Division Report written in 1949\nnotes that where \u201cwork is promotional in nature it is\nsometimes difficult to determine whether it is incidental\nto the employee\u2019s own sales work.\u201d See Dept. of Labor,\nWage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on\nProposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541, p. 82 (1949)\n(1949 Report). It adds that in borderline cases\n8      CHRISTOPHER v.

Given the fact that the doctor buys noth-\ning, the fact that the detailer sells nothing to the doctor,\nand the fact that any \u201cnonbinding commitment\u201d by the\ndoctor must, of ethical necessity, be of secondary im-\nportance, there is nothing about the detailer\u2019s visit with\nthe doctor that makes the visit (or what occurs during the\nvisit) \u201ctantamount . . . to a paradigmatic sale.\u201d Ibid. See\nPart I, supra.\n   The Court adds that \u201c[o]btaining a nonbinding commit-\nment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent\u2019s\ndrugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to en-\nsure the eventual disposition of the products that respond-\nent sells.\u201d Ante, at 20. And that may be so. But there is\nno \u201cmost they are able to do\u201d test.

But the law\nmight preclude an industry from selling its products\nthrough an outside salesman without thereby leading the\nlegal term \u201coutside salesman\u201d to apply to whatever is the\nnext best thing.

An industry might, after all, sell its\ngoods through wholesalers or retailers, while using its own\noutside employees to encourage sales only by providing\nthird parties with critically important information.\n   The Court expresses concern lest a holding that detail-\ners are not \u201csalesmen\u201d lead to holdings that the statute\nforbids treating as a \u201csalesman\u201d an employee \u201cwho takes\nan order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a\njobber\u2019s employee to be filled,\u201d ante, at 23, or \u201ca car sales-\nman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his\nor her assistant to enter the order into the computer,\u201d ibid.\nBut there is no need for any such fear. Both these exam-\nples involve employees who are salesmen because they\nobtain a firm commitment to buy the product. See 1949\nReport 83 (as to the first example, such an employee \u201chas\nobtained a commitment from the customer\u201d); 69 Fed.

The problem facing the detailer is\nthat he does not obtain any such commitment.\n   Finally, the Court points to the detailers\u2019 relatively high\npay, their uncertain hours, the location of their work, their\nindependence, and the fact that they frequently work\novertime, all as showing that detailers fall within the\nbasic purposes of the statutory provision that creates\nexceptions from wage and hour requirements.

The problem for the detailers, however, is that the\nstatute seeks to achieve its general objectives by creating\ncertain categories of exempt employees, one of which is the\ncategory of \u201coutside salesman.\u201d It places into that category\nonly those who satisfy the definition of \u201coutside sales-\nman\u201d as \u201cdefined and delimited from time to time by regu-\nlations of the Secretary.\u201d 29 U.

Argued April 16, 2012\u2014Decided June 18, 2012\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay em-\n  ployees overtime wages, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7207(a), but this requirement\n  does not apply with respect to workers employed \u201cin the capacity of\n  outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1). Congress did not elaborate on the\n  meaning of \u201coutside salesman,\u201d but it delegated authority to the De-\n  partment of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.\n  Three of the DOL\u2019s regulations are relevant to this case. First, 29\n  CFR \u00a7541.500 defines \u201coutside salesman\u201d to mean \u201cany employee . . .\n  [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales within the meaning of [29\n  U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)].\u201d \u00a7\u00a7541.500(a)(1)\uf02d(2). Section 203(k), in turn, states\n  that \u201c \u2018[s]ale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell,\n  consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\u201d Se-\n  cond, \u00a7541.501 clarifies that \u201c[s]ales within the meaning of [\u00a7203(k)]\n  include the transfer of title to tangible property.\u201d \u00a7541.501(b). Third,\n  \u00a7541.503 provides that promotion work that is \u201cperformed incidental\n  to and in conjunction with an employee\u2019s own outside sales or solici-\n  tations is exempt work,\u201d whereas promotion work that is \u201cincidental\n  to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.\u201d \u00a7541.503(a).\n  The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its prom-\n  ulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an \u201cout-\n  side salesman\u201d when the employee \u201cin some sense, has made sales.\u201d\n  69 Fed. Reg. 22162.\n    The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regu-\n  lation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dis-\n  pensed only upon a physician\u2019s prescription. In light of this require-\n  ment, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct\n  marketing efforts on physicians. Pharmaceutical companies promote\n2          CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    their products to physicians through a process called \u201cdetailing,\u201d\n    whereby employees known as \u201cdetailers\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutical sales\n    representatives\u201d try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for\n    the products in appropriate cases.\n       Petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales\n    representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their\n    primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from phy-\n    sicians to prescribe respondent\u2019s products in appropriate cases. Each\n    week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physi-\n    cians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours\n    attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks. Peti-\n    tioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and\n    they were subject to only minimal supervision. Petitioners were well\n    compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a\n    base salary and incentive pay. The amount of incentive pay was de-\n    termined based on the performance of petitioners\u2019 assigned portfolio\n    of drugs in their assigned sales territories. It is undisputed that peti-\n    tioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more\n    than 40 hours per week.\n       Petitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA\n    by failing to compensate them for overtime. Respondent moved for\n    summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were \u201cemployed in the\n    capacity of outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt\n    from the FLSA\u2019s overtime compensation requirement. The District\n    Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent. Peti-\n    tioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending\n    that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling def-\n    erence to the DOL\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which\n    the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.\n    The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.\n    The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOL\u2019s interpretation was not\n    entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasona-\n ble interpretation of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Pp. 8\u201325.\n    (a) The DOL filed amicus briefs in the Second Circuit and the\n Ninth Circuit in which it took the view that \u201ca \u2018sale\u2019 for the purposes\n of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction\n directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.\u201d\n Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in In re Novartis Wage\n and Hour Litigation, No. 09\u20130437 (CA2), p. 11. The DOL changed\n course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and\n now maintains that \u201c[a]n employee does not make a \u2018sale\u2019 . . . unless\n he actually transfers title to the property at issue.\u201d Brief for United\n States as Amicus Curiae 12\uf02d13.

Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency\u2019s\ninterpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that in-\nterpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461\uf02d462, this\ngeneral rule does not apply in all cases. Deference is inappropriate,\nfor example, when the agency\u2019s interpretation is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous\nor inconsistent with the regulation,\u2019 \u201d id., at 461, or when there is\nreason to suspect that the interpretation \u201cdoes not reflect the agen-\ncy\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter,\u201d id., at 462. There\nare strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case. Peti-\ntioners invoke the DOL\u2019s interpretation to impose potentially mas-\nsive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the\ninterpretation was announced. To defer to the DOL\u2019s interpretation\nwould result in precisely the kind of \u201cunfair surprise\u201d against which\nthis Court has long warned. See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170\uf02d171. Until 2009, the pharmaceutical\nindustry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of\ntreating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the\nFLSA. The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice. Even\nmore important, despite the industry\u2019s decades-long practice, the\nDOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detail-\ners or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting\nunlawfully. The only plausible explanation for the DOL\u2019s inaction is\nacquiescence. Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is\nunwarranted here. The DOL\u2019s interpretation should instead be given\na measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade. See\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228. Pp. 8\u201314.\n   (b) The DOL\u2019s current interpretation\u2014that a sale demands a trans-\nfer of title\u2014is quite unpersuasive. It plainly lacks the hallmarks of\nthorough consideration. Because the DOL first announced its view\nthat pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen\nin a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public com-\nment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOL\u2019s\ninternal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable. The inter-\npretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA. The statute de-\nfines \u201csale\u201d to mean, inter alia, a \u201cconsignment for sale,\u201d and a \u201ccon-\nsignment for sale\u201d does not involve the transfer of title. The DOL\nrelies heavily on 29 CFR \u00a7541.501, which provides that \u201c[s]ales . . .\ninclude the transfer of title to tangible property,\u201d \u00a7541.501(b), but it\nis apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must in-\nclude a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of\ntitle are included within the term \u201csale.\u201d The DOL\u2019s \u201cexplanation\nthat obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug consti-\ntutes promotion, and not sales,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also\n4          CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    unconvincing. Since promotion work that is performed incidental to\n    an employee\u2019s own sales is exempt, the DOL\u2019s conclusion that detail-\n    ers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the\n    reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not\n    make sales. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (c) Because the DOL\u2019s interpretation is neither entitled to Auer\n    deference nor persuasive in its own right, traditional tools of inter-\n    pretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are ex-\n    empt outside salesmen. Pp. 16\u201324.\n          (1) The FLSA does not furnish a clear answer to this question,\n    but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone\n    \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.\u201d 29 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7213(a)(1). The statute\u2019s emphasis on \u201ccapacity\u201d counsels in favor of\n    a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an em-\n    ployee\u2019s responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in\n    which the employee works. The DOL\u2019s regulations provide additional\n    guidance. Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an em-\n    ployee whose primary duty is \u201cmaking sales\u201d and adopts the statu-\n    tory definition of \u201csale.\u201d This statutory definition contains at least\n    three important textual clues. First, the definition is introduced with\n    the verb \u201cincludes,\u201d which indicates that the examples enumerated\n    in the text are illustrative, not exhaustive. See Burgess v. United\n    States, 553 U. S. 124, 131, n. 3. Second, the list of transactions in-\n    cluded in the statutory definition is modified by \u201cany,\u201d which, in the\n    context of \u00a7203(k), is best read to mean \u201c \u2018one or some indiscriminate-\n    ly of whatever kind,\u2019 \u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5.\n    Third, the definition includes the broad catchall phrase \u201cother dispo-\n    sition.\u201d Under the rule of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase is\n    most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that\n    are tantamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a\n    commodity. Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrow-\n    er construction. Pp. 16\u201320.\n          (2) Given this interpretation of \u201cother disposition,\u201d it follows that\n    petitioners made sales under the FLSA and thus are exempt outside\n    salesmen within the meaning of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Petitioners\n    obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe re-\n    spondent\u2019s drugs. This kind of arrangement, in the unique regula-\n    tory environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate,\n    comfortably falls within the catchall category of \u201cother disposition.\u201d\n    That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides\n    further support for this conclusion. And this holding also comports\n    with the apparent purpose of the FLSA\u2019s exemption. The exemption\n    is premised on the belief that exempt employees normally earn sala-\n    ries well above the minimum wage and perform a kind of work that is\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORPORATION\n\n            DBA GLAXOSMITHKLINE\n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 18, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) imposes mini\u00ad\nmum wage and maximum hours requirements on employ\u00ad\ners, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7206\uf02d207 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), but\nthose requirements do not apply to workers employed \u201cin\nthe capacity of outside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1). This case\nrequires us to decide whether the term \u201coutside sales\u00ad\nman,\u201d as defined by Department of Labor (DOL or De\u00ad\npartment) regulations, encompasses pharmaceutical sales\nrepresentatives whose primary duty is to obtain nonbinding\ncommitments from physicians to prescribe their employ-\ner\u2019s prescription drugs in appropriate cases. We conclude\nthat these employees qualify as \u201coutside salesm[e]n.\u201d\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress enacted the FLSA in 1938 with the goal of\n\u201cprotect[ing] all covered workers from substandard wages\nand oppressive working hours.\u201d Barrentine v. Arkansas-\nBest Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 739 (1981); see\nalso 29 U. S. C. \u00a7202(a). Among other requirements, the\n2        CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nFLSA obligates employers to compensate employees for\nhours in excess of 40 per week at a rate of 1\u00bd times\nthe employees\u2019 regular wages. See \u00a7207(a). The overtime\ncompensation requirement, however, does not apply with\nrespect to all employees. See \u00a7213. As relevant here, the\nstatute exempts workers \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of\noutside salesman.\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1).1\n   Congress did not define the term \u201coutside salesman,\u201d\nbut it delegated authority to the DOL to issue regulations\n\u201cfrom time to time\u201d to \u201cdefin[e] and delimi[t]\u201d the term.\nIbid. The DOL promulgated such regulations in 1938,\n1940, and 1949. In 2004, following notice-and-comment\nprocedures, the DOL reissued the regulations with minor\namendments. See 69 Fed. Reg. 22122 (2004). The current\nregulations are nearly identical in substance to the regula\u00ad\ntions issued in the years immediately following the FLSA\u2019s\nenactment. See 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7541.500\uf02d541.504 (2011).\n   Three of the DOL\u2019s regulations are directly relevant to\nthis case: \u00a7\u00a7541.500, 541.501, and 541.503. We refer to\nthese three regulations as the \u201cgeneral regulation,\u201d the\n\u201csales regulation,\u201d and the \u201cpromotion-work regulation,\u201d\nrespectively.\n   The general regulation sets out the definition of the\nstatutory term \u201cemployee employed in the capacity of\noutside salesman.\u201d It defines the term to mean \u201cany\nemployee . . . [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales\nwithin the meaning of [29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)]\u201d2 and \u201c[w]ho is\ncustomarily and regularly engaged away from the employ\u00ad\ner\u2019s place or places of business in performing such primary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 This provision also exempts workers \u201cemployed in a bona fide execu\u00ad\n\ntive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(1).\n    2 The definition also includes any employee \u201c[w]hose primary duty is\n\n. . . obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities\nfor which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.\u201d 29\nCFR \u00a7541.500(a)(1)(ii). That portion of the definition is not at issue in\nthis case.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nduty.\u201d3 \u00a7\u00a7541.500(a)(1)\uf02d(2). The referenced statutory\nprovision, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k), states that \u201c \u2018[s]ale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019\nincludes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment\nfor sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\u201d Thus, un-\nder the general regulation, an outside salesman is any\nemployee whose primary duty is making any sale, ex\u00ad\nchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for\nsale, or other disposition.\n   The sales regulation restates the statutory definition of\nsale discussed above and clarifies that \u201c[s]ales within the\nmeaning of [29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k)] include the transfer of\ntitle to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible\nand valuable evidences of intangible property.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.501(b).\n   Finally, the promotion-work regulation identifies \u201c[p]ro\u00ad\nmotion work\u201d as \u201cone type of activity often performed\nby persons who make sales, which may or may not be\nexempt outside sales work, depending upon the circum\u00ad\nstances under which it is performed.\u201d \u00a7541.503(a). Pro\u00ad\nmotion work that is \u201cperformed incidental to and in\nconjunction with an employee\u2019s own outside sales or\nsolicitations is exempt work,\u201d whereas promotion work\nthat is \u201cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by some\u00ad\none else is not exempt outside sales work.\u201d Ibid.\n   Additional guidance concerning the scope of the outside\nsalesman exemption can be gleaned from reports issued in\nconnection with the DOL\u2019s promulgation of regulations in\n1940 and 1949, and from the preamble to the 2004 regu\u00ad\nlations. See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division,\nReport and Recommendations of the Presiding Officer at\nHearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940) (hereinafter\n1940 Report); Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour Division,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 It is undisputed that petitioners were \u201ccustomarily and regularly\n\nengaged away\u201d from respondent\u2019s place of business in performing their\nresponsibilities.\n4        CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nReport and Recommendations on Proposed Revisions of\nRegulations, Part 541 (1949) (hereinafter 1949 Report); 69\nFed. Reg. 22160\uf02d22163 (hereinafter Preamble). Although\nthe DOL has rejected proposals to eliminate or dilute the\nrequirement that outside salesmen make their own sales,\nthe Department has stressed that this requirement is\nmet whenever an employee \u201cin some sense make[s] a sale.\u201d\n1940 Report 46; see also Preamble 22162 (reiterating that\nthe exemption applies only to an employee who \u201cin some\nsense, has made sales\u201d). And the DOL has made it clear\nthat \u201c[e]xempt status should not depend\u201d on technicalities,\nsuch as \u201cwhether it is the sales employee or the customer\nwho types the order into a computer system and hits the\nreturn button,\u201d Preamble 22163, or whether \u201cthe order is\nfilled by [a] jobber rather than directly by [the employee\u2019s]\nown employer,\u201d 1949 Report 83.\n                             B\n  Respondent SmithKline Beecham Corporation is in the\nbusiness of developing, manufacturing, and selling pre\u00ad\nscription drugs. The prescription drug industry is subject\nto extensive federal regulation, including the now-familiar\nrequirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only\nupon a physician\u2019s prescription.4 In light of this require\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Congress imposed this requirement in 1951 when it amended the\n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to provide that drugs\nthat are \u201cnot safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner\u201d\nmay be dispensed \u201conly . . . upon a . . . prescription of a practitioner\nlicensed by law to administer such drug.\u201d Durham-Humphrey Amend\u00ad\nment of 1951, ch. 578, 65 Stat. 648\uf02d649 (codified at 21 U. S. C. \u00a7353(b)).\nAs originally enacted in 1938, the FDCA allowed manufacturers to\ndesignate certain drugs as prescription only, but \u201cit did not say which\ndrugs were to be sold by prescription or that there were any drugs that\ncould not be sold without a prescription.\u201d Temin, The Origin of Com\u00ad\npulsory Drug Prescriptions, 22 J. Law & Econ. 91, 98 (1979). Prior to\nCongress\u2019 enactment of the FDCA, a prescription was not needed to\nobtain any drug other than certain narcotics.

S. ____ (2012)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nment, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their\ndirect marketing efforts, not on the retail pharmacies\nthat dispense prescription drugs, but rather on the medi-\ncal practitioners who possess the authority to prescribe the\ndrugs in the first place. Pharmaceutical companies pro\u00ad\nmote their prescription drugs to physicians through a\nprocess called \u201cdetailing,\u201d whereby employees known as\n\u201cdetailers\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutical sales representatives\u201d\nprovide information to physicians about the company\u2019s\nproducts in hopes of persuading them to write prescrip\u00ad\ntions for the products in appropriate cases. See Sorrell v.\nIMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1\uf02d2)\n(describing the process of \u201cdetailing\u201d). The position of\n\u201cdetailer\u201d has existed in the pharmaceutical industry in\nsubstantially its current form since at least the 1950\u2019s,\nand in recent years the industry has employed more than\n90,000 detailers nationwide. See 635 F. 3d 383, 387, and\nn. 5, 396 (CA9 2011).\n   Respondent hired petitioners Michael Christopher and\nFrank Buchanan as pharmaceutical sales representatives\nin 2003. During the roughly four years when petitioners\nwere employed in that capacity,5 they were responsible\nfor calling on physicians in an assigned sales territory to\ndiscuss the features, benefits, and risks of an assigned\nportfolio of respondent\u2019s prescription drugs. Petitioners\u2019\nprimary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commit\u00ad\nment6 from the physician to prescribe those drugs in ap\u00ad\npropriate cases, and the training that petitioners received\nunderscored the importance of that objective.\n   Petitioners spent about 40 hours each week in the field\ncalling on physicians. These visits occurred during normal\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Respondent   terminated Christopher\u2019s employment in 2007, and\nBuchanan left voluntarily the same year to accept a similar position\nwith another pharmaceutical company.\n  6 The parties agree that the commitment is nonbinding.\n6       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness hours, from about 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Outside of\nnormal business hours, petitioners spent an additional 10\nto 20 hours each week attending events, reviewing product\ninformation, returning phone calls, responding to e-mails,\nand performing other miscellaneous tasks. Petitioners\nwere not required to punch a clock or report their hours,\nand they were subject to only minimal supervision.\n  Petitioners were well compensated for their efforts. On\naverage, Christopher\u2019s annual gross pay was just over\n$72,000, and Buchanan\u2019s was just over $76,000.7 Petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 gross pay included both a base salary and incentive\npay. The amount of petitioners\u2019 incentive pay was based\non the sales volume or market share of their assigned\ndrugs in their assigned sales territories,8 and this amount\nwas uncapped. Christopher\u2019s incentive pay exceeded 30\npercent of his gross pay during each of his years of em\u00ad\nployment; Buchanan\u2019s exceeded 25 percent. It is undis\u00ad\nputed that respondent did not pay petitioners time-and-a\u00ad\nhalf wages when they worked in excess of 40 hours per\nweek.\n                              C\n   Petitioners brought this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona under 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7216(b). Petitioners alleged that respondent violated the\nFLSA by failing to compensate them for overtime, and\nthey sought both backpay and liquidated damages as re\u00ad\nlief. Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing\nthat petitioners were \u201cemployed . . . in the capacity of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The median pay for pharmaceutical detailers nationwide exceeds\n\n$90,000 per year. See Brief for Respondent 14.\n  8 The amount of incentive pay is not formally tied to the number of\n\nprescriptions written or commitments obtained, but because retail\npharmacies are prohibited from dispensing prescription drugs without\na physician\u2019s prescription, retail sales of respondent\u2019s products neces\u00ad\nsarily reflect the number of prescriptions written.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noutside salesman,\u201d \u00a7213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt\nfrom the FLSA\u2019s overtime compensation requirement.9\nThe District Court agreed and granted summary judgment\nto respondent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a\uf02d47a.\n   After the District Court issued its order, petitioners filed\na motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending that\nthe District Court had erred in failing to accord control-\nling deference to the DOL\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent\nregulations. That interpretation had been announced in\nan uninvited amicus brief filed by the DOL in a similar\naction then pending in the Second Circuit. See Brief for\nSecretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in In re Novartis\nWage and Hour Litigation, No. 09\u20130437 (hereinafter\nSecretary\u2019s Novartis Brief). The District Court rejected\nthis argument and denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 48a\uf02d52a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nSee 635 F. 3d 383. The Court of Appeals agreed that\nthe DOL\u2019s interpretation10 was not entitled to controlling\ndeference. See id., at 393\uf02d395. It held that, because the\ncommitment that petitioners obtained from physicians\nwas the maximum possible under the rules applicable to\nthe pharmaceutical industry, petitioners made sales with\u00ad\nin the meaning of the regulations. See id., at 395\uf02d397.\nThe court found it significant, moreover, that the DOL had\npreviously interpreted the regulations as requiring only\nthat an employee \u201c \u2018in some sense\u2019 \u201d make a sale, see id.,\nat 395\uf02d396 (emphasis deleted), and had \u201cacquiesce[d] in\nthe sales practices of the drug industry for over seventy\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Respondent also argued that petitioners were exempt administra\u00ad\n\ntive employees. The District Court and the Court of Appeals found it\nunnecessary to reach that argument, and the question is not before us.\n   10 The DOL filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit advancing sub\u00ad\n\nstantially the same interpretation it had advanced in its brief in the\nSecond Circuit. See Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in\nNo. 10\u201315257.\n8        CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nyears,\u201d id., at 399.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision conflicts with the Second\nCircuit\u2019s decision in In re Novartis Wage and Hour Litiga-\ntion, 611 F. 3d 141, 153\uf02d155 (2010) (holding that the\nDOL\u2019s interpretation is entitled to controlling deference).\nWe granted certiorari to resolve this split, 565 U. S. ___\n(2011), and we now affirm the judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit.\n                            II\n   We must determine whether pharmaceutical detailers\nare outside salesmen as the DOL has defined that term in\nits regulations. The parties agree that the regulations\nthemselves were validly promulgated and are therefore\nentitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu-\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\nBut the parties disagree sharply about whether the DOL\u2019s\ninterpretation of the regulations is owed deference under\nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). It is to that ques\u00ad\ntion that we now turn.\n                             A\n   The DOL first announced its view that pharmaceutical\ndetailers are not exempt outside salesmen in an amicus\nbrief filed in the Second Circuit in 2009, and the Depart\u00ad\nment has subsequently filed similar amicus briefs in other\ncases, including the case now before us.11 While the DOL\u2019s\nultimate conclusion that detailers are not exempt has\nremained unchanged since 2009, the same cannot be said\nof its reasoning. In both the Second Circuit and the Ninth\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The DOL invites \u201cinterested parties to inform it of private cases\n\ninvolving the misclassification of employees in contravention of the new\nPart 541 rule\u201d so that it may file amicus briefs \u201cin appropriate cases to\nshare with courts the Department\u2019s view of the proper application of\nthe new Part 541 rule.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, Office of Solicitor, Overtime\nSecurity Amicus Program, http://www.dol.gov/sol/541amicus.htm (as visited\nJune 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit, the DOL took the view that \u201ca \u2018sale\u2019 for the pur\u00ad\nposes of the outside sales exemption requires a con-\nsummated transaction directly involving the employee for\nwhom the exemption is sought.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Novartis\nBrief 11; see also Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus\nCuriae in No. 10\u201315257 (CA9), p. 12. Perhaps because\nof the nebulous nature of this \u201cconsummated transaction\u201d\ntest,12 the Department changed course after we granted\ncertiorari in this case. The Department now takes the\nposition that \u201c[a]n employee does not make a \u2018sale\u2019 for\npurposes of the \u2018outside salesman\u2019 exemption unless he\nactually transfers title to the property at issue.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12\uf02d13 (hereinafter U. S.\nBrief).13 Petitioners and the DOL assert that this new\ninterpretation of the regulations is entitled to controlling\ndeference. See Brief for Petitioners 31\uf02d42; U. S. Brief\n30\uf02d34.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 For example, it is unclear why a physician\u2019s nonbinding commit\u00ad\n\nment to prescribe a drug in an appropriate case cannot qualify as a sale\nunder this test. The broad term \u201ctransaction\u201d easily encompasses such\na commitment. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2425 (2002) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Third) (defining \u201ctransaction\u201d to\nmean \u201ca communicative action or activity involving two parties or two\nthings reciprocally affecting or influencing each other\u201d). A \u201cconsum\u00ad\nmated transaction\u201d is simply a transaction that has been fully completed.\nSee id., at 490 (defining \u201cconsummate\u201d to mean \u201cto bring to comple\u00ad\ntion\u201d). And a pharmaceutical sales representative who obtains such a\ncommitment is \u201cdirectly involv[ed]\u201d in this transaction. Thus, once a\npharmaceutical sales representative and a physician have fully com\u00ad\npleted their agreement, it may be said that they have entered into a\n\u201cconsummated transaction.\u201d\n   13 When pressed to clarify its position at oral argument, the DOL\n\nsuggested that a \u201ctransfer of possession in contemplation of a transfer\nof title\u201d might also suffice. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.\n   14 Neither petitioners nor the DOL asks us to accord controlling def\u00ad\n\nerence to the \u201cconsummated transaction\u201d interpretation the Depart\u00ad\nment advanced in its briefs in the Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit, nor\ncould we given that the Department has now abandoned that interpre\u00ad\ntation. See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 480\n10      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agen\u00ad\ncy\u2019s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even\nwhen that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see\nChase Bank USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 12); Auer, 519 U. S., at 461\uf02d462, this general\nrule does not apply in all cases. Deference is undoubtedly\ninappropriate, for example, when the agency\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regu\u00ad\nlation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 461 (quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 359 (1989)). And defer\u00ad\nence is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to\nsuspect that the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cdoes not reflect\nthe agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter\nin question.\u201d Auer, supra, at 462; see also, e.g., Chase\nBank, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).

Until 2009, the\npharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that\nits longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt\noutside salesmen transgressed the FLSA. The statute and\nregulations certainly do not provide clear notice of this.\nThe general regulation adopts the broad statutory defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201csale,\u201d and that definition, in turn, employs the\nbroad catchall phrase \u201cother disposition.\u201d See 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1). This catchall phrase could reasonably be\nconstrued to encompass a nonbinding commitment from a\nphysician to prescribe a particular drug, and nothing in\nthe statutory or regulatory text or the DOL\u2019s prior guid\u00ad\nance plainly requires a contrary reading. See Preamble\n22162 (explaining that an employee must \u201cin some sense\u201d\nmake a sale); 1940 Report 46 (same).\n   Even more important, despite the industry\u2019s decades\u00ad\nlong practice of classifying pharmaceutical detailers as\nexempt employees, the DOL never initiated any enforce\u00ad\nment actions with respect to detailers or otherwise sug\u00ad\ngested that it thought the industry was acting unlaw\u00ad\nfully.16 We acknowledge that an agency\u2019s enforcement\ndecisions are informed by a host of factors, some bearing\nno relation to the agency\u2019s views regarding whether a\nviolation has occurred. See, e.g., Heckler v. Chaney, 470\nU. S. 821, 831 (1985) (noting that \u201can agency decision not\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 It appears that the DOL only once directly opined on the exempt\n\nstatus of detailers prior to 2009. In 1945, the Wage and Hour Division\nissued an opinion letter tentatively concluding that \u201cmedical detailists\u201d\nwho performed \u201cwork . . . aimed at increasing the use of [their employ\u00ad\ner\u2019s] product in hospitals and through physicians\u2019 recommendations\u201d\nqualified as administrative employees. Opinion Letter from Dept. of\nLabor, Wage and Hour Division (May 19, 1945), 1 CCH Labor Law\nService, Federal Wage-Hour Guide \u00b633,093. But that letter did not\naddress the outside salesman exemption.\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto enforce often involves a complicated balancing of a\nnumber of factors which are peculiarly within its exper\u00ad\ntise\u201d). But where, as here, an agency\u2019s announcement of\nits interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of\nconspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair surprise is\nacute. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, while it may be\n\u201cpossible for an entire industry to be in violation of the\n[FLSA] for a long time without the Labor Department\nnoticing,\u201d the \u201cmore plausible hypothesis\u201d is that the De\u00ad\npartment did not think the industry\u2019s practice was un\u00ad\nlawful. Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc., 480 F. 3d\n505, 510\uf02d511 (2007). There are now approximately 90,000\npharmaceutical sales representatives; the nature of their\nwork has not materially changed for decades and is well\nknown; these employees are well paid; and like quintes\u00ad\nsential outside salesmen, they do not punch a clock and\noften work more than 40 hours per week. Other than\nacquiescence, no explanation for the DOL\u2019s inaction is\nplausible.\n   Our practice of deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation\nof its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has im\u00ad\nportant advantages,17 but this practice also creates a risk\nthat agencies will promulgate vague and open-ended\nregulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,\nthereby \u201cfrustrat[ing] the notice and predictability pur\u00ad\nposes of rulemaking.\u201d Talk America, Inc. v.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJudicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency\nRules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612, 655\uf02d668 (1996). It is one\nthing to expect regulated parties to conform their conduct\nto an agency\u2019s interpretations once the agency announces\nthem; it is quite another to require regulated parties to\ndivine the agency\u2019s interpretations in advance or else be\nheld liable when the agency announces its interpretations\nfor the first time in an enforcement proceeding and de\u00ad\nmands deference.\n   Accordingly, whatever the general merits of Auer def\u00ad\nerence, it is unwarranted here. We instead accord the\nDepartment\u2019s interpretation a measure of deference propor\u00ad\ntional to the \u201c \u2018thoroughness evident in its consideration,\nthe validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier\nand later pronouncements, and all those factors which\ngive it power to persuade.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218, 228 (2001) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)).\n                             B\n  We find the DOL\u2019s interpretation of its regulations quite\nunpersuasive. The interpretation to which we are now\nasked to defer\u2014that a sale demands a transfer of title\u2014\nplainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.\nBecause the DOL first announced its view that pharma\u00ad\nceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside\nsalesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no oppor\u00ad\ntunity for public comment, and the interpretation that\ninitially emerged from the Department\u2019s internal deci\u00ad\nsionmaking process proved to be untenable. After arguing\nsuccessfully in the Second Circuit and then unsucess-\nfully in the Ninth Circuit that a sale for present purposes\nsimply requires a \u201cconsummated transaction,\u201d the DOL ad\u00ad\nvanced a different interpretation in this Court. Here, the\nDOL\u2019s brief states unequivocally that \u201c[a]n employee does\nnot make a \u2018sale\u2019 for purposes of the \u2018outside salesman\u2019\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexemption unless he actually transfers title to the prop\u00ad\nerty at issue.\u201d U. S. Brief 12\uf02d13.\n   This new interpretation is flatly inconsistent with the\nFLSA, which defines \u201csale\u201d to mean, inter alia, a \u201ccon\u00ad\nsignment for sale.\u201d A \u201cconsignment for sale\u201d does not\ninvolve the transfer of title. See, e.g., Sturm v. Boker, 150\nU. S. 312, 330 (1893) (\u201cThe agency to sell and return the\nproceeds, or the specific goods if not sold . . . does not\ninvolve a change of title\u201d); Hawkland, Consignment Sell\u00ad\ning Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 67 Com. L. J.\n146, 147 (1962) (explaining that \u201c \u2018[a] consignment of goods\nfor sale does not pass the title at any time, nor does it\ncontemplate that it should be passed\u2019 \u201d (quoting Rio\nGrande Oil Co. v. Miller Rubber Co. of N. Y., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n87, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (1926))).\n   The DOL cannot salvage its interpretation by arguing\nthat a \u201cconsignment for sale\u201d may eventually result in the\ntransfer of title (from the consignor to the ultimate pur\u00ad\nchaser if the consignee in fact sells the good). Much the\nsame may be said about a physician\u2019s nonbinding com\u00ad\nmitment to prescribe a particular product in an appropri\u00ad\nate case. In that situation, too, agreement may eventually\nresult in the transfer of title (from the manufacturer to a\npharmacy and ultimately to the patient for whom the drug\nis prescribed).\n   In support of its new interpretation, the DOL relies\nheavily on its sales regulation, which states in part that\n\u201c[s]ales [for present purposes] include the transfer of title\nto tangible property,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7541.501(b) (emphasis\nadded). This regulation, however, provides little support\nfor the DOL\u2019s position. The DOL reads the sales regula\u00ad\ntion to mean that a \u201csale\u201d necessarily includes the transfer\nof title, but that is not what the regulation says. And it\nseems clear that that is not what the regulation means.\nThe sentence just subsequent to the one on which the DOL\nrelies, echoing the terms of the FLSA, makes clear that a\n16     CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cconsignment for sale\u201d qualifies as a sale. Since a con\u00ad\nsignment for sale does not involve a transfer of title, it is\napparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a\nsale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions\ninvolving a transfer of title are included within the term\n\u201csale.\u201d\n   Petitioners invite us to look past the DOL\u2019s \u201cdetermina\u00ad\ntion that a sale must involve the transfer of title\u201d and\ninstead defer to the Department\u2019s \u201cexplanation that ob\u00ad\ntaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug\nconstitutes promotion, and not sales.\u201d Reply Brief for\nPetitioners 17. The problem with the DOL\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the promotion-work regulation, however, is that it\ndepends almost entirely on the DOL\u2019s flawed transfer-of\u00ad\ntitle interpretation. The promotion-work regulation does\nnot distinguish between promotion work and sales; rather,\nit distinguishes between exempt promotion work and\nnonexempt promotion work. Since promotion work that is\nperformed incidental to an employee\u2019s own sales is ex\u00ad\nempt, the DOL\u2019s conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers\nperform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong\nas the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those\nemployees do not make sales. For the reasons already\ndiscussed, we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.\n   In light of our conclusion that the DOL\u2019s interpretation\nis neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its\nown right, we must employ traditional tools of interpreta\u00ad\ntion to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside\nsalesmen.\n                             C\n                              1\n   We begin with the text of the FLSA. Although the\nprovision that establishes the overtime salesman exemp\u00ad\ntion does not furnish a clear answer to the question before\nus, it provides at least one interpretive clue: It exempts\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

C. \u00a7213(a)(1) (emphasis added). \u201cCa\u00ad\npacity,\u201d used in this sense, means \u201c[o]utward condition\nor circumstances; relation; character; position.\u201d Webster\u2019s\nNew International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2\nOxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (\u201cPosition,\ncondition, character, relation\u201d). The statute\u2019s emphasis on\nthe \u201ccapacity\u201d of the employee counsels in favor of a func\u00ad\ntional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an\nemployee\u2019s responsibilities in the context of the particular\nindustry in which the employee works.\n   The DOL\u2019s regulations provide additional guidance. The\ngeneral regulation defines an outside salesman as an\nemployee whose primary duty is \u201cmaking sales,\u201d and\nit adopts the statutory definition of \u201csale.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1)(i). This definition contains at least three\nimportant textual clues. First, the definition is introduced\nwith the verb \u201cincludes\u201d instead of \u201cmeans.\u201d This word\nchoice is significant because it makes clear that the exam\u00ad\nples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative,\nnot exhaustive. See Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.\n124, 131, n. 3 (2008) (explaining that \u201c[a] term whose\nstatutory definition declares what it \u2018includes\u2019 is more\nsusceptible to extension of meaning . . . than where . . . the\ndefinition declares what a term \u2018means\u2019 \u201d (alteration in\noriginal; some internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed,\nCongress used the narrower word \u201cmeans\u201d in other provi\u00ad\nsions of the FLSA when it wanted to cabin a definition to\na specific list of enumerated items. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7203(a) (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means an individual, partnership, asso\u00ad\nciation, corporation, business trust, legal representative,\nor any organized group of persons\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Second, the list of transactions included in the statu\u00ad\ntory definition of sale is modified by the word \u201cany.\u201d We\nhave recognized that the modifier \u201cany\u201d can mean \u201cdiffer\u00ad\nent things depending upon the setting,\u201d Nixon v. Missouri\n18       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nMunicipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004), but in the\ncontext of 29 U. S.

S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 97 (1976)). That is so\nbecause Congress defined \u201csale\u201d to include both the un\u00ad\nmodified word \u201csale\u201d and transactions that might not be\nconsidered sales in a technical sense, including exchanges\nand consignments for sale.18\n   Third, Congress also included a broad catchall phrase:\n\u201cother disposition.\u201d Neither the statute nor the regula\u00ad\ntions define \u201cdisposition,\u201d but dictionary definitions of the\nterm range from \u201crelinquishment or alienation\u201d to \u201car\u00ad\nrangement.\u201d See Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (\u201c[t]he getting rid, or making over, of\nanything; relinquishment or alienation\u201d); ibid.

We agree with the DOL that the rule of ejusdem\ngeneris should guide our interpretation of the catchall\nphrase, since it follows a list of specific items.19 But the\nlimit the DOL posits, one that would confine the phrase to\ndispositions involving \u201ccontract[s] for the exchange of\ngoods or services in return for value,\u201d see U.

Consequently, we think that the\ncatchall phrase \u201cother disposition\u201d is most reasonably in\u00ad\nterpreted as including those arrangements that are tan\u00ad\ntamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale\nof a commodity.\n   Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a nar\u00ad\nrower construction.21 As discussed above, the sales regu\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 The dissent\u2019s approach suffers from the same flaw. The dissent\n\ncontends that, in order to make a sale, an employee must at least\nobtain a \u201cfirm commitment to buy.\u201d Post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\nBut when an employee who has extended an offer to sell obtains a \u201cfirm\ncommitment to buy,\u201d that transaction amounts to a \u201ccontract to sell.\u201d\nGiven that a \u201ccontract to sell\u201d already falls within the statutory defini\u00ad\ntion of \u201csale,\u201d the dissent\u2019s interpretation would strip the catchall\nphrase of independent meaning.\n   21 In the past, we have stated that exemptions to the FLSA must be\n\n\u201cnarrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and\ntheir application limited to those [cases] plainly and unmistakably\nwithin their terms and spirit.\u201d Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S.\n388, 392 (1960). Petitioners and the DOL contend that Arnold requires\nus to construe the outside salesman exemption narrowly, but Arnold is\n20       CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlation instructs that sales within the meaning of 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7203(k) \u201cinclude the transfer of title to tangible\nproperty,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7541.501(b) (emphasis added), but this\nregulation in no way limits the broad statutory definition\nof \u201csale.\u201d And although the promotion-work regulation\ndistinguishes between promotion work that is incidental\nto an employee\u2019s own sales and work that is incidental to\nsales made by someone else, see \u00a7541.503(a), this distinc\u00ad\ntion tells us nothing about the meaning of \u201csale.\u201d22\n                             2\n  Given our interpretation of \u201cother disposition,\u201d it follows\nthat petitioners made sales for purposes of the FLSA and\ntherefore are exempt outside salesmen within the mean\u00ad\ning of the DOL\u2019s regulations. Obtaining a nonbinding\ncommitment from a physician to prescribe one of respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to\nensure the eventual disposition of the products that re\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ninapposite where, as here, we are interpreting a general definition that\napplies throughout the FLSA.\n   22 The dissent\u2019s view that pharmaceutical detailers are more naturally\n\ncharacterized as nonexempt promotional employees than as exempt out\u00ad\nside salesmen relies heavily on the DOL\u2019s explanation in its 1940 Re\u00ad\nport that \u201csales promotion men\u201d are not salesmen. See post, at 7; see\nalso 1940 Report 46. There, the Department described a \u201csales promo\u00ad\ntion man\u201d as an employee who merely \u201cpav[es] the way for salesmen\u201d\nand who frequently \u201cdeals with retailers who are not customers of his\nown employer but of his employer\u2019s customer\u201d and is \u201cinterested in\nsales by the retailer, not to the retailer.\u201d 1940 Report 46. The dissent\nasserts that detailers are analogous to \u201csales promotion men\u201d because\nthey deal with \u201cindividuals, namely doctors, \u2018who are not customers\u2019 of\ntheir own employer\u201d and \u201care primarily interested in sales authorized\nby the doctor, not to the doctor.\u201d Post, at 7. But this comparison is\ninapt. The equivalent of a \u201csales promotion man\u201d in the pharmaceuti\u00ad\ncal industry would be an employee who promotes a manufacturer\u2019s\nproducts to the retail pharmacies that sell the products after purchas\u00ad\ning them from a wholesaler or distributor. Detailers, by contrast,\nobtain nonbinding commitments from the gatekeepers who must\nprescribe the product if any sale is to take place at all.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nspondent sells.23 This kind of arrangement, in the unique\nregulatory environment within which pharmaceutical com\u00ad\npanies must operate, comfortably falls within the catch-\nall category of \u201cother disposition.\u201d\n   That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of\nsalesmen provides further support for our conclusion.\nPetitioners were hired for their sales experience. They\nwere trained to close each sales call by obtaining the\nmaximum commitment possible from the physician. They\nworked away from the office, with minimal supervision,\nand they were rewarded for their efforts with incentive\ncompensation. It would be anomalous to require respond\u00ad\nent to compensate petitioners for overtime, while at the\nsame time exempting employees who function identically to\npetitioners in every respect except that they sell physician\u00ad\nadministered drugs, such as vaccines and other inject-\nable pharmaceuticals, that are ordered by the physician\ndirectly rather than purchased by the end user at a phar\u00ad\nmacy with a prescription from the physician.\n   Our holding also comports with the apparent purpose of\nthe FLSA\u2019s exemption for outside salesmen. The exemp\u00ad\ntion is premised on the belief that exempt employees\n\u201ctypically earned salaries well above the minimum wage\u201d\nand enjoyed other benefits that \u201cse[t] them apart from the\nnonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.\u201d Preamble\n22124. It was also thought that exempt employees per\u00ad\nformed a kind of work that \u201cwas difficult to standardize to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 Our point is not, as the dissent suggests, that any employee who\n\ndoes the most that he or she is able to do in a particular position to\nensure the eventual sale of a product should qualify as an exempt\noutside salesman. See post, at 9 (noting that \u201cthe \u2018most\u2019 a California\nfirm\u2019s marketing employee may be able \u2018to do\u2019 to secure orders from\nNew York customers is to post an advertisement on the Internet\u201d).\nRather, our point is that, when an entire industry is constrained by law\nor regulation from selling its products in the ordinary manner, an\nemployee who functions in all relevant respects as an outside salesman\nshould not be excluded from that category based on technicalities.\n22      CHRISTOPHER v.

Petitioners\u2014each of\nwhom earned an average of more than $70,000 per year\nand spent between 10 and 20 hours outside normal busi\u00ad\nness hours each week performing work related to his as\u00ad\nsigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory\u2014\nare hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was\nintended to protect. And it would be challenging, to say\nthe least, for pharmaceutical companies to compensate\ndetailers for overtime going forward without significantly\nchanging the nature of that position. See, e.g., Brief for\nPhRMA as Amicus Curiae 14\uf02d20 (explaining that \u201ckey\naspects of [detailers\u2019] jobs as they are currently structured\nare fundamentally incompatible with treating [detailers]\nas hourly employees\u201d).\n                             3\n   The remaining arguments advanced by petitioners and\nthe dissent are unavailing. Petitioners contend that de\u00ad\ntailers are more naturally classified as nonexempt promo\u00ad\ntional employees who merely stimulate sales made by\nothers than as exempt outside salesmen. They point out\nthat respondent\u2019s prescription drugs are not actually sold\nuntil distributors and retail pharmacies order the drugs\nfrom other employees. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 7.\nThose employees,24 they reason, are the true salesmen in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 According to one of respondent\u2019s amici, most pharmaceutical com\u00ad\n\npanies \u201chave systems in place to maintain the inventories of wholesal\u00ad\ners and retailers of prescription drugs (consisting mainly of periodic\nrestocking pursuant to a general contract), [and] these systems are\nlargely ministerial and require only a few employees to administer\nthem.\u201d Brief for PhRMA as Amicus Curiae 24; see also ibid.

This formalistic argument is\ninconsistent with the realistic approach that the outside\nsalesman exemption is meant to reflect.\n   Petitioners\u2019 theory seems to be that an employee is\nproperly classified as a nonexempt promotional employee\nwhenever there is another employee who actually makes\nthe sale in a technical sense. But, taken to its extreme,\npetitioners\u2019 theory would require that we treat as a nonex\u00ad\nempt promotional employee a manufacturer\u2019s representa\u00ad\ntive who takes an order from a retailer but then transfers\nthe order to a jobber\u2019s employee to be filled, or a car\nsalesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks\nhis or her assistant to enter the order into the computer.\nThis formalistic approach would be difficult to reconcile\nwith the broad language of the regulations and the stat\u00ad\nutory definition of \u201csale,\u201d and it is in significant ten\u00ad\nsion with the DOL\u2019s past practice. See 1949 Report 83\n(explaining that the manufacturer\u2019s representative was\nclearly \u201cperforming sales work regardless of the fact that\nthe order is filled by the jobber rather than directly by his\nown employer\u201d); Preamble 22162 (noting that \u201ctechnologi\u00ad\ncal changes in how orders are taken and processed should\nnot preclude the exemption for employees who in some\nsense make the sales\u201d).\n   Petitioners additionally argue that detailers are the\nfunctional equivalent of employees who sell a \u201cconcept,\u201d\nand they point to Wage and Hour Division opinion letters,\nas well as lower court decisions, deeming such employees\nnonexempt. See Brief for Petitioners 47\uf02d48. Two of these\nopinions, however, concerned employees who were more\nanalogous to buyers than to sellers. See Clements v. Serco,\nInc., 530 F. 3d 1224, 1229\u20131230, n. 4 (CA10 2008) (ex\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nrepresentatives but \u201cfewer than ten employees who are responsible for\n\nprocessing orders from retailers and wholesalers, a ratio that is typical\n\nof how the industry is structured\u201d).\n\n24     CHRISTOPHER v.

In light of important, near-contemporaneous\ndifferences in the Justice Department\u2019s views as to the\nmeaning of relevant Labor Department regulations, see\nante, at 8\u20139, I also agree that we should not give the Solic-\nitor General\u2019s current interpretive view any especially\nfavorable weight. Ante, at 14. Thus, I am willing to as-\nsume, with the Court, that we should determine whether\nthe statutory term covers the detailer\u2019s job as here\ndescribed through our independent examination of the\nstatute\u2019s language and the related Labor Department\nregulations. But, I conclude on that basis that a detailer\nis not an \u201coutside salesman.\u201d\n                              II\n   The FLSA does not itself define the term \u201coutside\nsalesman.\u201d Rather, it exempts from wage and hour re-\nquirements \u201cany employee employed . . . in the capacity of\noutside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited\nfrom time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, we must look\nto relevant Labor Department regulations to answer the\nquestion. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

The first says that\nthe term \u201c \u2018employee employed in the capacity of outside\nsalesman\u2019 . . . shall mean any employee . . . [w]hose pri-\nmary duty is: (i) making sales within the meaning of sec-\ntion 3(k) of the Act, or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for\nservices or for the use of facilities . . . .\u201d \u00a7541.500(a)(1).\nThe second regulation tells us that the first regulation\n\u201crequires that the employee be engaged in . . . (1) Making\nsales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (2)\nObtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of\nfacilities.\u201d \u00a7541.501(a).\n   The second part of these quoted passages is irrelevant\nhere, for it concerns matters not at issue, namely \u201corders\nor contracts for services or for the use of facilities.\u201d The\nremaining parts of the two regulations are similarly irrel-\nevant. See Appendix, infra. Thus, the relevant portions of\nthe first two regulations say simply that the employee\u2019s\n\u201cprimary duty\u201d must be \u201cmaking sales within the meaning\nof section 3(k) of the Act.\u201d And \u00a73(k) of the Act says that\nthe word \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 includes any sale, exchange, con-\ntract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or\nother disposition.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(k).\n   Unless we give the words of the statute and regulations\nsome special meaning, a detailer\u2019s primary duty is not that\nof \u201cmaking sales\u201d or the equivalent. A detailer might\nconvince a doctor to prescribe a drug for a particular kind\nof patient. If the doctor encounters such a patient, he\nmight prescribe the drug. The doctor\u2019s client, the patient,\nmight take the prescription to a pharmacist and ask the\npharmacist to fill the prescription. If so, the pharmacist\nmight sell the manufacturer\u2019s drug to the patient, or\nmight substitute a generic version. But it is the pharma-\ncist, not the detailer, who will have sold the drug.\n   To put the same fairly obvious point in the language of\nthe regulations and of \u00a73(k) of the FLSA, see 29 U. S. C.\n4      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a7203(k), the detailer does not \u201csell\u201d anything to the doctor.\nSee Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1454 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n\u201csale\u201d as \u201c[t]he transfer of property or title for a price\u201d).\nNor does he, during the course of that visit or immedi-\nately thereafter, \u201cexchange\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s product for\nmoney or for anything else. He enters into no \u201ccontract to\nsell\u201d on behalf of anyone. He \u201cconsigns\u201d nothing \u201cfor sale.\u201d\nHe \u201cships\u201d nothing for sale. He does not \u201cdispose\u201d of any\nproduct at all.\n   What the detailer does is inform the doctor about the\nnature of the manufacturer\u2019s drugs and explain their uses,\ntheir virtues, their drawbacks, and their limitations. The\ndetailer may well try to convince the doctor to prescribe\nthe manufacturer\u2019s drugs for patients. And if the detailer\nis successful, the doctor will make a \u201cnonbinding commit-\nment\u201d to write prescriptions using one or more of those\ndrugs where appropriate. If followed, that \u201cnonbinding\ncommitment\u201d is, at most, a nonbinding promise to consider\nadvising a patient to use a drug where medical indications\nso indicate (if the doctor encounters such a patient), and to\nwrite a prescription that will likely (but may not) lead that\nperson to order that drug under its brand name from the\npharmacy. (I say \u201cmay not\u201d because 30% of patients in a\n2-year period have not filled a prescription given to them\nby a doctor.

Like a \u201cdefinite maybe,\u201d an \u201cimpos-\nsible solution,\u201d or a \u201ctheoretical experience,\u201d a \u201cnonbinding\ncommitment\u201d seems to claim more than it can deliver.\nRegardless, other than in colloquial speech, to obtain a\ncommitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to\nobtain a commitment to sell that product, no matter how\noften the client takes the advice (or the patient does what\nthe doctor recommends).\n  The third regulation, entitled \u201cPromotion work,\u201d lends\nsupport to this view. That is because the detailer\u2019s work\nas described above is best viewed as promotion work. The\nregulation makes clear that promotion work falls within\nthe statutory exemption only when the promotion work \u201cis\nactually performed incidental to and in conjunction with\nan employee\u2019s own outside sales or solicitations.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7541.503(a) (emphasis added). But it is not exempt if it is\n\u201cincidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else.\u201d\nIbid.\n  The detailer\u2019s work, in my view, is more naturally char-\nacterized as involving \u201c[p]romotional activities designed to\nstimulate sales . . . made by someone else,\u201d \u00a7541.503, e.g.,\nthe pharmacist or the wholesaler, than as involving\n\u201c[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate\u201d the detail-\ner\u2019s \u201cown sales.\u201d\n  Three other relevant documents support this reading.\nFirst, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America (PhRMA), of which respondent is a mem-\nber, publishes a \u201cCode on Interactions with Healthcare Pro-\nfessionals.\u201d    See PhRMA, Code on Interactions with\nHealthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code) (rev. July 2008),\navailable at http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/108/\nphrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf. The PhRMA Code de-\n6      CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nscribes a detailer\u2019s job in some depth. It consistently\nrefers to detailers as \u201cdelivering accurate, up-to-date\ninformation to healthcare professionals,\u201d id., at 14, and it\nstresses the importance of a doctor\u2019s treatment decision\nbeing based \u201csolely on each patient\u2019s medical needs\u201d and\nthe doctor\u2019s \u201cmedical knowledge and experience,\u201d id., at 2.\nThe PhRMA Code also forbids the offering or providing of\nanything \u201cin a manner or on conditions that would inter-\nfere with the independence of a healthcare professional\u2019s\nprescribing practices.\u201d Id., at 13. But the PhRMA Code\nnowhere refers to detailers as if they were salesmen,\nrather than providers of information, nor does it refer to\nany kind of commitment.\n  To the contrary, the document makes clear that the\npharmaceutical industry itself understands that it cannot\nbe a detailer\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d to obtain a nonbinding\ncommitment, for, in respect to many doctors, such a com-\nmitment taken alone is unlikely to make a significant\ndifference to their doctor\u2019s use of a particular drug. When\na particular drug, say Drug D, constitutes the best treat-\nment for a particular patient, a knowledgeable doctor\nshould (hence likely will) prescribe it irrespective of any\nnonbinding commitment to do so. Where some other drug,\nhowever, is likely to prove more beneficial for a particular\npatient, that doctor should not (hence likely will not)\nprescribe Drug D irrespective of any nonbinding commit-\nment to the contrary.\n  At a minimum, the document explains why a detailer\nshould not (hence likely does not) see himself as seeking\nprimarily to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular\ndrug, as opposed to providing information so that the\ndoctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward\nusing it when appropriate. And because the detailer\u2019s\n\u201cprimary duty\u201d is informational, as opposed to sales-\noriented, he fails to qualify as an outside salesman. See\n\u00a7541.500(a)(1)(i) (restricting the outside salesman exemp-\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

A detailer operating in accord\nwith the PhRMA Code \u201csells\u201d the product only in the way\nadvertisers (particularly very low key advertisers) \u201csell\u201d a\nproduct: by creating demand for the product, not by taking\norders.\n   Second, a Labor Department Wage and Hour Division\nReport written in 1940 further describes the work of \u201csales\npromotion men.\u201d See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour\nDivision, Report and Recommendations of the Presiding\nOfficer at Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940)\n(1940 Report). The 1940 Report says that such individuals\n\u201cpav[e] the way\u201d for sales by others. Id., at 46. \u201cFrequently,\u201d\nthey deal \u201cwith [the] retailers who are not custom-\ners of [their] own employer but of [their] employer\u2019s cus-\ntomer.\u201d Ibid. And they are \u201cprimarily interested in sales by\nthe retailer, not to the retailer.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[T]hey do not make\nactual sales,\u201d and they \u201care admittedly not outside sales-\nmen.\u201d Ibid.\n   Like the \u201csales promotion men,\u201d the detailers before us\ndeal with individuals, namely doctors, \u201cwho are not cus-\ntomers\u201d of their own employer. And the detailers are\nprimarily interested in sales authorized by the doctor, not\nto the doctor. According to the 1940 Report, sales promo-\ntion men are not \u201coutside salesmen,\u201d primarily because\nthey seek to bring about, not their own sales, but sales by\nothers. Thus, the detailers in this case are not \u201coutside\nsalesmen.\u201d\n   Third, a Wage and Hour Division Report written in 1949\nnotes that where \u201cwork is promotional in nature it is\nsometimes difficult to determine whether it is incidental\nto the employee\u2019s own sales work.\u201d See Dept. of Labor,\nWage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on\nProposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541, p. 82 (1949)\n(1949 Report). It adds that in borderline cases\n8      CHRISTOPHER v.

The doctor whom the detailer visits,\nlike the example\u2019s store manager, \u201chas no authority to\nbuy.\u201d\n   Taken together, the statute, regulations, ethical codes,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand Labor Department Reports indicate that the drug\ndetailers do not promote their \u201cown sales,\u201d but rather\n\u201csales made, or to be made, by someone else.\u201d Therefore,\ndetailers are not \u201coutside salesmen.\u201d\n                              III\n   The Court\u2019s different conclusion rests primarily upon its\ninterpretation of the statutory words \u201cother disposition\u201d as\n\u201cincluding those arrangements that are tantamount, in a\nparticular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a commod-\nity.\u201d Ante, at 19. Given the fact that the doctor buys noth-\ning, the fact that the detailer sells nothing to the doctor,\nand the fact that any \u201cnonbinding commitment\u201d by the\ndoctor must, of ethical necessity, be of secondary im-\nportance, there is nothing about the detailer\u2019s visit with\nthe doctor that makes the visit (or what occurs during the\nvisit) \u201ctantamount . . . to a paradigmatic sale.\u201d Ibid. See\nPart I, supra.\n   The Court adds that \u201c[o]btaining a nonbinding commit-\nment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent\u2019s\ndrugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to en-\nsure the eventual disposition of the products that respond-\nent sells.\u201d Ante, at 20. And that may be so. But there is\nno \u201cmost they are able to do\u201d test. After all, the \u201cmost\u201d a\nCalifornia firm\u2019s marketing employee may be able \u201cto do\u201d\nto secure orders from New York customers is to post an\nadvertisement on the Internet, but that fact does not help\nqualify the posting employee as a \u201csalesman.\u201d The Court\nadds that it means to apply this test only when the law\nprecludes \u201can entire industry . . . from selling its products\nin the ordinary manner.\u201d Ante, at 21, n. 23. But the law\nmight preclude an industry from selling its products\nthrough an outside salesman without thereby leading the\nlegal term \u201coutside salesman\u201d to apply to whatever is the\nnext best thing. In any event, the Court would be wrong\nto assume, if it does assume, that there is in nearly every\n10     CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nindustry an outside salesman lurking somewhere (if only\nwe can find him). An industry might, after all, sell its\ngoods through wholesalers or retailers, while using its own\noutside employees to encourage sales only by providing\nthird parties with critically important information.\n   The Court expresses concern lest a holding that detail-\ners are not \u201csalesmen\u201d lead to holdings that the statute\nforbids treating as a \u201csalesman\u201d an employee \u201cwho takes\nan order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a\njobber\u2019s employee to be filled,\u201d ante, at 23, or \u201ca car sales-\nman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his\nor her assistant to enter the order into the computer,\u201d ibid.\nBut there is no need for any such fear. Both these exam-\nples involve employees who are salesmen because they\nobtain a firm commitment to buy the product. See 1949\nReport 83 (as to the first example, such an employee \u201chas\nobtained a commitment from the customer\u201d); 69 Fed. Reg.\n22163 (2004) (as to the second example, explaining that\n\u201c[e]xempt status should not depend on . . . who types the\norder into a computer,\u201d but maintaining requirement that\na salesman \u201cobtai[n] a commitment to buy from the person\nto whom he is selling\u201d). The problem facing the detailer is\nthat he does not obtain any such commitment.\n   Finally, the Court points to the detailers\u2019 relatively high\npay, their uncertain hours, the location of their work, their\nindependence, and the fact that they frequently work\novertime, all as showing that detailers fall within the\nbasic purposes of the statutory provision that creates\nexceptions from wage and hour requirements. Ante, at 5\u2013\n6. The problem for the detailers, however, is that the\nstatute seeks to achieve its general objectives by creating\ncertain categories of exempt employees, one of which is the\ncategory of \u201coutside salesman.\u201d It places into that category\nonly those who satisfy the definition of \u201coutside sales-\nman\u201d as \u201cdefined and delimited from time to time by regu-\nlations of the Secretary.\u201d 29 U.

The\n     arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the re-\n     plenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is in-\n     cidental to and in conjunction with the employee's\n     own outside sales. Because the employee in this in-\n     stance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts\n     toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not\n     exempt outside sales work.\u201d\n</pre>",
