UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11–94. Argued March 19, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012\nPetitioner Southern Union Company was convicted by a jury in federal\n  court on one count of violating the Resource Conservation and Recov-\n  ery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury\n  without a permit at a subsidiary’s facility “on or about September 19,\n  2002 to October 19, 2004.” Violations of the RCRA are punishable by,\n  inter alia, a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.\n  42 U. S. C. §6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office calculated a\n  maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern Union vio-\n  lated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from September 19, 2002,\n  through October 19, 2004. Southern Union argued that imposing any\n  fine greater than the 1-day penalty of $50,000 would be unconstitu-\n  tional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, which holds that\n  the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee requires that any fact\n  (other than the fact of a prior conviction) that increases the maxi-\n  mum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury\n  beyond a reasonable doubt. Southern Union contended that, based\n  on the jury verdict and the District Court’s instructions, the only vio-\n  lation the jury necessarily found was for one day. The District Court\n  held that Apprendi applies to criminal fines, but concluded from the\n  “content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a\n  762-day violation. The court therefore set a maximum potential fine\n  of $38.1 million, from which it imposed a fine of $6 million and a\n  “community service obligation” of $12 million. On appeal, the First\n  Circuit disagreed with the District Court that the jury necessarily\n  found a violation of 762 days. But the First Circuit affirmed the sen-\n  tence because it held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.\nHeld: The rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.\n Pp. 3−16.\n2             SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law prac-\n    tice,” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281, and preserves\n    the “historic jury function” of “determining whether the prosecution\n    has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt,”\n    Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 163. This Court has repeatedly affirmed\n    Apprendi’s rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that\n    allow judges to find facts that increase a defendant’s maximum au-\n    thorized sentence. See Cunningham, 549 U. S., at 274−275; United\n    States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–227; Blakely v. Washington, 542\n    U. S. 296, 299–300; Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589; Ap-\n    prendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469. While the punishments at stake in these\n    cases were imprisonment or a death sentence, there is no principled\n    basis under Apprendi to treat criminal fines differently. Apprendi’s\n    “core concern”—to reserve to the jury “the determination of facts that\n    warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense,” Ice, 555 U. S.,\n    at 170—applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprison-\n    ment or death. Criminal fines, like these other forms of punishment,\n    are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.\n    Fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in\n    colonial America and they continue to be frequently imposed today.\n    And, the amount of a fine, like the maximum term of imprisonment\n    or eligibility for the death penalty, is often determined by reference to\n    particular facts. The Government argues that fines are less onerous\n    than incarceration and the death sentence and therefore should be\n    exempt from Apprendi. But where a fine is substantial enough to\n    trigger the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies\n    in full. Pp. 3−8.\n       (b) The “historical role of the jury at common law,” which informs\n    the “scope of the constitutional jury right,” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170, sup-\n    ports applying Apprendi to criminal fines. To be sure, judges in the\n    colonies and during the founding era had much discretion in deter-\n    mining whether to impose a fine and in what amount. But the exer-\n    cise of such discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which per-\n    mits courts to impose “judgment within the range prescribed by\n    statute.” 530 U. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). The more salient\n    question is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that\n    pegged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts. A\n    review of both state and federal decisions discloses that the predomi-\n    nant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and\n    proved to the jury. The rule that juries must determine facts that set\n    a fine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two longstanding\n    tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence” on which Apprendi is\n    based: first, “the ‘truth of every accusation’ against a defendant\n    ‘should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  of his equals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301. And se-\n  cond, “ ‘an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law\n  makes essential to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the\n  requirements of the common law, and is no accusation in reason.’ ”\n  Ibid. Contrary to the Government’s contentions, neither United\n  States v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/s5N/united-states-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, nor United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch\n  285, overcomes the ample historical evidence that juries routinely\n  found facts that set maximum criminal fines. Pp. 8−14.\n     (c) The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the dissent,\n  are unpersuasive. The Government claims that facts relevant to a fine’s\n  amount typically quantify the harm caused by the defendant’s of-\n  fense, and do not define a separate set of acts for punishment. The\n  Government contends that only the latter determination implicates\n  Apprendi’s concerns. But this argument rests on the rejected as-\n  sumption that, in determining the maximum punishment for an of-\n  fense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact\n  that is an “element” of the offense and one that is a “sentencing fac-\n  tor.” Further, the facts the District Court found in imposing a fine on\n  Southern Union are not fairly characterized as merely quantifying\n  the harm the company caused.\n     The Government also argues that applying Apprendi to criminal\n  fines will prevent States and the Federal Government from enact-\n  ing statutes that calibrate the amount of a fine to a defendant’s culp-\n  ability. But legislatures are free to enact such statutes, so long\n  as the statutes are administered in conformance with the Sixth\n  Amendment.\n     Finally, the Government contends that requiring juries to deter-\n  mine facts related to fines will cause confusion, prejudice defendants,\n  or be impractical. These policy arguments rehearse those made by\n  the dissents in our prior Apprendi cases. They must be rejected be-\n  cause the rule the Government espouses is unconstitutional. In addi-\n  tion, because Apprendi is now more than a decade old, the reliance\n  interests underlying the Government’s arguments are by this point\n  attenuated.

Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000);\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004). We have\napplied this principle in numerous cases where the sen-\ntence was imprisonment or death. The question here is\nwhether the same rule applies to sentences of criminal\nfines. We hold that it does.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Southern Union Company is a natural gas\ndistributor. Its subsidiary stored liquid mercury, a haz-\nardous substance, at a facility in Pawtucket, Rhode Is-\nland. In September 2004, youths from a nearby apart-\nment complex broke into the facility, played with the mer-\ncury, and spread it around the facility and complex. The\ncomplex’s residents were temporarily displaced during\nthe cleanup and most underwent testing for mercury\npoisoning.\n  In 2007, a grand jury indicted Southern Union on mul-\n2         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiple counts of violating federal environmental statutes.\nAs relevant here, the first count alleged that the company\nknowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at the\nPawtucket facility “[f ]rom on or about September 19, 2002\nuntil on or about October 19, 2004,” App. 104, in viola-\ntion of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of\n1976 (RCRA). See 90 Stat. 2812, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n§6928(d)(2)(A). A jury convicted Southern Union on this\ncount following a trial in the District Court for the District\nof Rhode Island. The verdict form stated that Southern\nUnion was guilty of unlawfully storing liquid mercury\n“on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.”\nApp. 140.\n   Violations of the RCRA are punishable by, inter alia,\n“a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.”\n§6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office set a maxi-\nmum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern\nUnion violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from\nSeptember 19, 2002, through October 19, 2004. Southern\nUnion objected that this calculation violated Apprendi\nbecause the jury was not asked to determine the precise\nduration of the violation. The company noted that the ver-\ndict form listed only the violation’s approximate start\ndate (i.e., “on or about”), and argued that the court’s in-\nstructions permitted conviction if the jury found even a\n1-day violation. Therefore, Southern Union maintained, the\nonly violation the jury necessarily found was for one day,\nand imposing any fine greater than the single-day penalty\nof $50,000 would require factfinding by the court, in con-\ntravention of Apprendi.\n   The Government acknowledged the jury was not asked\nto specify the duration of the violation, but argued that\nApprendi does not apply to criminal fines. The District\nCourt disagreed and held that Apprendi applies. But the\ncourt concluded from the “content and context of the ver-\ndict all together” that the jury found a 762-day violation.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The court therefore set a\nmaximum potential fine of $38.1 million, from which\nit imposed a fine of $6 million and a “community service\nobligatio[n]” of $12 million. App. 154.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit rejected the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe jury necessarily found a violation of 762 days. 630\nF. 3d 17, 36 (2010). But the Court of Appeals affirmed\nthe sentence because it also held, again in contrast to the\nDistrict Court, that Apprendi does not apply to criminal\nfines. 630 F. 3d, at 33–36. Other Circuits have reached\nthe opposite conclusion. See United States v. Pfaff, 619\nF. 3d 172 (CA2 2010) (per curiam); United States v.\nLaGrou Distribution Sys., Inc., 466 F. 3d 585 (CA7 2006).\nWe granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 565 U. S. ___\n(2011), and now reverse.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   This case requires us to consider the scope of the Sixth\nAmendment right of jury trial, as construed in Apprendi.\nUnder Apprendi, “[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic-\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at\n490. The “ ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is\nthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the\nbasis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted\nby the defendant.” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis\ndeleted). Thus, while judges may exercise discretion in\nsentencing, they may not “inflic[t] punishment that the\njury’s verdict alone does not allow.” Id., at 304.\n   Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law\npractice.” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281\n(2007). It preserves the “historic jury function” of “deter-\nmining whether the prosecution has proved each element\n4           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” Oregon v. Ice,\n555 U. S. 160, 163 (2009). We have repeatedly affirmed\nthis rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes\nthat allowed judges to find facts that increased a defend-\nant’s maximum authorized sentence. See Cunningham,\n549 U. S., at 274–275 (elevated “upper term” of impris-\nonment); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–\n227, 233–234 (2005) (increased imprisonment range for\ndefendant under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines); Blakely, 542 U. S., at 299–300 (increased im-\nprisonment above statutorily prescribed “standard range”);\nRing v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589 (2002) (death\npenalty authorized upon finding existence of aggravating\nfactors); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469 (extended term\nof imprisonment based on violation of a “hate crime”\nstatute).\n  While the punishments at stake in those cases were\nimprisonment or a death sentence, we see no principled\nbasis under Apprendi for treating criminal fines differ-\nently. Apprendi’s “core concern” is to reserve to the jury\n“the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a\nspecific statutory offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. That\nconcern applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or\nimprisonment or death. Criminal fines, like these other\nforms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sover-\neign for the commission of offenses. Fines were by far the\nmost common form of noncapital punishment in colonial\nAmerica.1 They are frequently imposed today, especially\n——————\n    1 See\n        Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview,\n26 Am.

Sometimes,\nas here, the fact is the duration of a statutory violation;3\nunder other statutes it is the amount of the defendant’s\ngain or the victim’s loss, or some other factor.4 In all\nsuch cases, requiring juries to find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt facts that determine the fine’s maximum amount is\nnecessary to implement Apprendi’s “animating principle”:\nthe “preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bulwark\nbetween the State and the accused at the trial for an\nalleged offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 168. In stating Appren-\ndi’s rule, we have never distinguished one form of pun-\nishment from another. Instead, our decisions broadly\nprohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum\ncriminal “sentence[s],” “penalties,” or “punishment[s]”—\nterms that each undeniably embrace fines. E.g., Blakely,\n542 U. S., at 304; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490; Ring, 536\nU. S., at 589.\n  The Government objects, however, that fines are less\n——————\npunishment in some colonies, was not a central feature of criminal\npunishment until a later time.” Preyer 329; see also Lillquist 641–643.\n   2 In 2011, a fine was imposed on 9.0% of individual defendants and on\n\n70.6% of organizational defendants in the federal system. See United\nStates Sentencing Commission, 2011 Annual Report, ch. 5, pp. 34, 40.\n   3 See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. §1467a(i)(1); 15 U. S. C. §717t(b); 16 U. S. C.\n\n§825o(b); Cal.

C. §645 (fine for embezzlement by officers of\nUnited States courts of up to twice the value of the money embezzled);\n§201(b) (fine for bribery of public officials of up to three times the value\nof the bribe).\n6         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nonerous than incarceration and the death sentence. The\nGovernment notes that Apprendi itself referred to the\nphysical deprivation of liberty that imprisonment occa-\nsions, see 530 U. S., at 484, and that we have placed more\nweight on imprisonment than on fines when construing\nthe scope of the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and\njury trial. See Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538,\n542–543 (1989) (jury trial); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367,\n373–374 (1979) (counsel). Therefore, the Government\nconcludes, fines categorically “do not implicate” the “pri-\nmary concerns motivating Apprendi.” Brief for United\nStates 23–25.\n   This argument fails because its conclusion does not fol-\nlow from its premise. Where a fine is so insubstantial that\nthe underlying offense is considered “petty,” the Sixth\nAmendment right of jury trial is not triggered, and no\nApprendi issue arises. See, e.g., Muniz v. Hoffman, 422\nU. S. 454, 477 (1975) ($10,000 fine imposed on labor union\ndoes not entitle union to jury trial); see also Blanton,\n489 U. S., at 541 (no jury trial right for “petty” offenses,\nas measured by the “severity of the maximum authorized\npenalty” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The same,\nof course, is true of offenses punishable by relatively brief\nterms of imprisonment—these, too, do not entitle a de-\nfendant to a jury trial. See id., at 543 (establishing a\nrebuttable presumption that offenses punishable by six\nmonths’ imprisonment or less are petty); Duncan v. Loui-\nsiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159–162 (1968).\n   But not all fines are insubstantial, and not all offenses\npunishable by fines are petty. See, e.g., Mine Workers v.\nBagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 838, n. 5 (1994) (criminal contempt\nfine of $52 million imposed on union “unquestionably is\na serious contempt sanction” that triggers right of jury\ntrial). The federal twice-the-gain-or-loss statute, in par-\nticular, see 18 U. S.

S.\n147, 151 (1969)); see also 18 U. S. C. §3572(a)(2) (requiring\ncourt to consider “the burden that the fine will impose\nupon the defendant” in determining whether to impose a\nfine and in what amount).\n   The Government thus asks the wrong question by com-\nparing the severity of criminal fines to that of other pun-\nishments. So far as Apprendi is concerned, the relevant\nquestion is the significance of the fine from the perspective\nof the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Where a\nfine is substantial enough to trigger that right, Apprendi\napplies in full. As we said in Cunningham, “Asking\nwhether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,\nthough some facts essential to punishment are reserved\nfor determination by the judge, . . . is the very inquiry\nApprendi’s ‘bright-line rule’ was designed to exclude.” 549\nU. S., at 291.\n   This case is exemplary. The RCRA subjects Southern\nUnion to a maximum fine of $50,000 for each day of\nviolation. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d). The Government does not\ndeny that, in light of the seriousness of that punishment,\nthe company was properly accorded a jury trial. And the\nGovernment now concedes the District Court made factual\nfindings that increased both the “potential and actual” fine\n8           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe court imposed. Brief for United States 28. This is\nexactly what Apprendi guards against: judicial factfinding\nthat enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces\nbeyond what the jury’s verdict or the defendant’s admis-\nsions allow.\n                             B\n  In concluding that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to\ncriminal fines, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision\nin Ice. Ice addressed the question whether, when a de-\nfendant is convicted of multiple offenses, Apprendi forbids\njudges to determine facts that authorize the imposition of\nconsecutive sentences. 555 U. S., at 164. In holding that\nApprendi does not, Ice emphasized that juries historically\nplayed no role in deciding whether sentences should run\nconsecutively or concurrently. See 555 U. S., at 168–169.\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that juries were similarly\nuninvolved in setting criminal fines. 630 F. 3d, at 35.5\n  The Court of Appeals was correct to examine the histor-\nical record, because “the scope of the constitutional jury\nright must be informed by the historical role of the jury\nat common law.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. See also, e.g.,\nBlakely, 542 U. S., at 301–302; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n477–484. But in our view, the record supports applying\n\n——————\n   5 Ice also stated in dicta that applying Apprendi to consecutive-\n\nversus-concurrent sentencing determinations might imperil a variety of\nsentencing decisions judges commonly make, including “the imposition\nof statutorily prescribed fines.” 555 U. S., at 171. The Court of Appeals\nread this statement to mean that Apprendi does not apply to criminal\nfines. 630 F. 3d, at 34. We think the statement is at most ambiguous,\nand more likely refers to the routine practice of judges’ imposing fines\nfrom within a range authorized by jury-found facts. Such a practice\nposes no problem under Apprendi because the penalty does not exceed\nwhat the jury’s verdict permits. See 530 U. S., at 481. In any event,\nour statement in Ice was unnecessary to the judgment and is not\nbinding. Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363\n(2006).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nApprendi to criminal fines. To be sure, judges in the col-\nonies and during the founding era “possessed a great deal\nof discretion” in determining whether to impose a fine\nand in what amount. Lillquist 640–641; see also Preyer\n350. Often, a fine’s range “was apparently without limit\nexcept insofar as it was within the expectation on the part\nof the court that it would be paid.” Ibid. For some other\noffenses, the maximum fine was capped by statute. See,\ne.g., id., at 333 (robbery, larceny, burglary, and other\noffenses punishable in Massachusetts Bay Colony “by\nfines of up to £5”); Act of Feb. 28, 1803, ch. 9, §7, 2 Stat.\n205 (any consul who gives a false certificate shall “forfeit\nand pay a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, at the\ndiscretion of the court”); K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of\nJudging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9\n(1998) (describing federal practice).\n   The exercise of such sentencing discretion is fully con-\nsistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose\n“judgment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530\nU. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). Nor, a fortiori, could\nthere be an Apprendi violation where no maximum is\nprescribed. Indeed, in surveying the historical record that\nformed the basis of our holding in Apprendi, we specifi-\ncally considered the English practice with respect to fines,\nwhich, as was true of many colonial offenses, made sen-\ntencing largely “dependent upon judicial discretion.” See\nid., at 480, n. 7; see also Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.\n227, 244–245 (1999); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 372–373 (1769) (hereinafter Black-\nstone). And even then, as the dissent acknowledges, post,\nat 11–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.), there is authority sug-\ngesting that English juries were required to find facts that\ndetermined the authorized pecuniary punishment. See\n1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–188\n(1814) (In cases “where the offence, or its defined measure\nof punishment, depends upon” property’s specific value,\n10        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe value “must be proved precisely as it is laid [in the\nindictment], and any variance will be fatal”); see also\nid., at 188 (“[I]n the case of usury, where the judgment\ndepends upon the quantum taken, the usurious contract\nmust be averred according to the fact; and a variance from\nit, in evidence, would be fatal, because the penalty is\napportioned to the value” (emphasis in original)); 2 W.\nHawkins, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75,\npp. 234–235 (3d ed. 1739) (doubting whether “it be need-\nful to set forth the Value of the Goods in an Indictment\nof Trespass for any other Purpose than to aggravate the\nFine”).\n   In any event, the salient question here is what role the\njury played in prosecutions for offenses that did peg the\namount of a fine to the determination of specified facts—\noften, the value of damaged or stolen property. See Ap-\nprendi, 530 U. S., at 502, n. 2 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\nOur review of state and federal decisions discloses that the\npredominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in\nthe indictment and proved to the jury.

See post, at 18–20. But this fact was not the basis of\nthe decisions; rather, the courts required value to be alleged and proved\nto the jury because “the extent of the punishment . . . depend[s] upon\nthe value of the property consumed or injured.” Ritchey, 7 Blackf.,\nat 169; see also, e.g., Clark, 2 Ill., at 120–121 (same). And as Bishop\nexplained, this requirement of proof originated not from a unique fea-\nture of jury sentencing, but from longstanding common-law princi-\nples—a point to which the dissent notably does not respond. 1 J.\nBishop, Criminal Procedure §§81, 540 (2d ed. 1872). See infra, at 12.\n  Nor, for that matter, do larceny cases “presen[t] a special circum-\nstance.” Post, at 20. Such decisions invoked the same reasoning as the\nother cases just mentioned. See, e.g., Hope, 50 Mass., at 137 (value\nmust be proved because, among other things, “[o]ur statutes . . . pre-\nscribe the punishment for larceny . . . with reference to the value of the\nproperty stolen”); Goodrich, 46 N. H., at 188 (same). Bishop made this\npoint explicit: “[Value] must be alleged wherever it is an element to\nbe considered by the court in determining the punishment, and it is\nimmaterial whether the particular crime is larceny or any other crime.”\nCriminal Procedure §541, at 331 (footnote omitted and emphasis\nadded). At the end of the day, the only evidence the dissent musters\nthat judges found fine-enhancing facts are United States v. Tyler, 7\nCranch 285 (1812), and one lower-court decision restating Tyler’s\nholding. See post, at 15–17. We address Tyler below. See infra, at\n13–14.\n12        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two\nlongstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurispru-\ndence” on which Apprendi is based: First, “the ‘truth of\nevery accusation’ against a defendant ‘should afterwards\nbe confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his\nequals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301 (quot-\ning 4 Blackstone 343). And second, “ ‘an accusation which\nlacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to\nthe punishment is . . . no accusation within the require-\nments of the common law, and it is no accusation in rea-\nson.’ ” 542 U. S., at 301–302 (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Crimi-\nnal Procedure §87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)). Indeed, Bishop’s\nleading treatise on criminal procedure specifically identi-\nfied cases involving fines as evidence of the proposition\nthat “the indictment must, in order to inform the court\nwhat punishment to inflict, contain an averment of every\nparticular thing which enters into the punishment.” Id.,\n§540, at 330 (discussing Clark and Garner). This princi-\nple, Bishop explained, “pervades the entire system of the\nadjudged law of criminal procedure. It is not made appar-\nent to our understandings by a single case only, but by\nall the cases.” Criminal Procedure §81, at 51. See also Ap-\nprendi, 530 U. S., at 510–511 (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(explaining that Bishop grounded this principle in “well-\nestablished common-law practice . . . and in the provisions\nof Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing notice of\nan accusation in all criminal cases, indictment by a grand\njury for serious crimes, and trial by jury”).\n   As counterevidence that juries historically did not de-\ntermine facts relevant to criminal fines, the Government\npoints to two decisions from this Court. One is United\nStates v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/s5N/united-states-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1842), which considered\nwhether an interested witness was competent to testify in\na larceny prosecution brought under a provision of the\nCrimes Act of 1790. Murphy’s only relevance to this case\nis that the Crimes Act authorized a fine of up to four times\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe value of the stolen property, and the Court remarked\nthat “the fine is, as to its amount, purely in the discretion\nof the Court.” Id., at 209. But this statement is best\nread as permitting the court to select a fine from within\nthe maximum authorized by jury-found facts—a practice,\nas noted, that accords with Apprendi. Such a reading is\nconsistent with the fact that the indictment in Murphy\nalleged the value of the stolen items, see 16 Pet., at 207–\n208, and with the practice of contemporary courts address-\ning the same statute, see United States v. Holland, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ca11/4TPW/united-states-v-holland/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812). But like\nMurphy, this decision involved no constitutional question.\nRather, it construed a federal embargo statute that im-\nposed a fine of four times the value of the property intended\nto be exported. The indictment identified the property at\nissue as “pearl-ashes,” but the jury’s guilty verdict re-\nferred instead to “ ‘pot-ashes [that] were worth two hun-\ndred and eighty dollars.’ ” Tyler, 7 Cranch, at 285.7 The\nquestion was whether the discrepancy rendered the ver-\ndict “not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property\ncharged in the indictment,” i.e., pearl-ashes. Ibid. The\nCourt held that the discrepancy was immaterial, on the\nground that “under this law, no valuation by the jury was\n——————\n  7 We will not keep the reader in suspense: pot-ash and pearl-ash are\n\nalkaline salts of differing causticity that “for a long time . . .

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to enable the Circuit Court to impose the proper\nfine.” Ibid. The Court’s reasoning is somewhat opaque,\nbut appears to rest on the text of the embargo statute,\nwhich directed that the defendant “shall, upon conviction,\nbe . . . fined a sum by the Court.” Ibid. In any event,\nnothing in the decision purports to construe the Sixth\nAmendment. And, insofar as Tyler reflects prevailing\npractice, it bears noting that both the indictment and ver-\ndict identified the value of the property at issue. See\nTr. 2 in Tyler, 7 Cranch 285, reprinted in Appellate Case\nFiles of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1792–\n1831, National Archives Microfilm Publications No. 214\n(1962), roll 18 (indictment: “nineteen barrels of pearlashes,\nwhich were then and there of the value of six hundred\ndollars”). Whatever the precise meaning of this decision,\nit does not outweigh the ample historical evidence showing\nthat juries routinely found facts that set the maximum\namounts of fines.\n                              III\n   The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the\ndissent (see post, at 23–28), are unpersuasive. The Gov-\nernment first submits that, when it comes to fines, “the\njudicially found facts typically involve only quantifying\nthe harm caused by the defendant’s offense”—for example,\nhow long did the violation last, or how much money did the\ndefendant gain (or the victim lose)?—“as opposed to de-\nfining a separate set of acts for punishment.” Brief for\nUnited States 25. Only the latter determination, the\nGovernment contends, implicates Apprendi’s concerns.\n   This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an\nassumption that Apprendi and its progeny have uniformly\nrejected: that in determining the maximum punishment\nfor an offense, there is a constitutionally significant differ-\nence between a fact that is an “element” of the offense and\none that is a “sentencing factor.” See, e.g., 530 U. S., at\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n478; Ring, 536 U. S., at 605. Second, we doubt the coher-\nence of this distinction. This case proves the point. Under\n42 U. S. C. §6928(d), the fact that will ultimately deter-\nmine the maximum fine Southern Union faces is the num-\nber of days the company violated the statute. Such a\nfinding is not fairly characterized as merely “quantifying\nthe harm” Southern Union caused. Rather, it is a deter-\nmination that for each given day, the Government has\nproved that Southern Union committed all of the acts\nconstituting the offense.\n   The Government next contends that applying Apprendi\nto fines will prevent States and the Federal Government\nfrom enacting statutes that, like §6928(d), calibrate fines\nto a defendant’s culpability, thus providing just punish-\nment and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity.\nBut the Government presents a false choice. As was true\nin our prior Apprendi cases, and remains so here, legisla-\ntures are free to enact statutes that constrain judges’\ndiscretion in sentencing—Apprendi requires only that\nsuch provisions be administered in conformance with the\nSixth Amendment.\n   Last, the Government argues that requiring juries to\ndetermine facts related to fines will cause confusion (be-\ncause expert testimony might be needed to guide the\ninquiry); or prejudice the defendant (who might have to\ndeny violating a statute while simultaneously arguing\nthat any violation was minimal); or be impractical (at\nleast when the relevant facts are unknown or unknowable\nuntil the trial is completed).8 These arguments rehearse\n——————\n  8 In this vein, the dissent speculates that today’s decision may\n\n“nudg[e] our [criminal justice] system” further in favor of plea bargains\nat the expense of jury trials. Post, at 28. But groups representing the\ninterests of defendants—whom the dissent’s rule purportedly favors—\ntell us the opposite is true. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the\nUnited States of America et al. as Amici Curiae 5 (“[E]xempting crimi-\nnal fines from Apprendi makes innocent defendants more likely to\n16           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v.

Here, as there, they\nmust be rejected. For even if these predictions are ac-\ncurate, the rule the Government espouses is unconstitu-\ntional. That “should be the end of the matter.” Blakely, 542\nU. S., at 313.\n   But here there is particular reason to doubt the strength\nof these policy concerns. Apprendi is now more than a\ndecade old. The reliance interests that underlie many of\nthe Government’s arguments are by this point attenuated.\nNor, in our view, does applying Apprendi’s rule to criminal\nfines mark an unexpected extension of the doctrine. Most\nCircuits to have addressed the issue already embrace this\nposition, see Pfaff, 619 F. 3d, at 175–176; LaGrou Distri-\nbution Sys., 466 F. 3d, at 594; United States v. Yang, 144\nFed.

And a jury must find the existence of\neach such element “beyond a reasonable doubt.” See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re\nWinship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).\n   Thus, a bank robbery statute might prohibit an offender\nfrom (1) taking by force or by intimidation (2) in the pres­\nence of another person (3) a thing of value (4) belonging to,\nor in custody of, a bank. In that case, the jury can convict\nonly if it finds the existence of each of these four factual\n“elements” beyond a reasonable doubt. But it need not\nfind other facts beyond a reasonable doubt, for these four\nfactual elements alone constitute the crime.\n   Other facts may be relevant to the length or kind of\nsentence the court will impose upon a convicted offender.\nThese sentencing facts typically characterize the manner\nin which the offender carried out the crime or set forth\nrelevant features characterizing the offender. For exam­\nple, in respect to manner, an offender might have carried\nout a particular bank robbery\n    “with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hid­\n    den (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely\n    warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up\n    (or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at\n    night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for\n    other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of\n    a few (or many) other robbers . . . .” United States\n    Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.3,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The Apprendi dissenters\nconcluded that the Constitution did not require the jury\nto find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Rather the law, through its rules, statutes, and\nthe Constitution’s Due Process Clause would typically offer\nthe defendant factfinding protection. See, e.g., Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 32 (federal presentence report prepared by\nprobation office sets forth facts, which defendant may\ncontest at sentencing proceeding); Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U. S. 224, 239–247 (1998) (constitu­\ntional inquiry).\n   The dispute in Apprendi and its line of cases arose after\nCongress and many States codified these sentencing facts\nduring the sentencing reform movement of the 1970’s and\n1980’s. Congress, for example, concluded that too many\ndifferent judges were imposing too many different sen­\ntences upon too many similar offenders who had com-\nmitted similar crimes in similar ways. It subsequently\nenacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, creating a\nfederal Sentencing Commission which would produce greater\nuniformity in sentencing through the promulgation of\nmandatory uniform Guidelines structuring how judges, in\nordinary cases, should typically use sentencing facts to\ndetermine sentences. 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV); see also 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e). The\nApprendi-line majority agreed that, where a statute set a\nhigher maximum sentence, a Commission might structure\nhow a judge found sentencing facts relevant to the sen­\n4         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntence imposed below that otherwise applicable maximum,\nat least if the resulting guidelines were not mandatory.\nSee Booker, 543 U. S., at 245. But the majority held that\nwhere a sentencing fact increased the otherwise applicable\nmaximum penalty, that fact had to be found by a jury.\nApprendi, 530 U. S., at 490.\n  As I have said, the dissenters thought that the Sixth\nAmendment did not require a jury to find any of these\nsentencing facts. Why, asked the dissenters, should Con­\ngress’ or a State’s desire for greater sentencing uniformity\nachieved through statutes seeking more uniform treat­\nment (of similar offenders committing similar offenses in\nsimilar ways) suddenly produce new Sixth Amendment\njury trial requirements?\n  Those requirements would work against greater sen­\ntencing fairness. To treat all sentencing facts (where so\nspecified in a statute or rule) as if they were elements of\nthe offense could lead Congress simply to set high maxi­\nmum ranges for each crime, thereby avoiding Appren-\ndi’s jury trial requirement. Alternatively, Congress might\nenact statutes that more specifically tied particular pun­\nishments to each crime (limiting or removing judicial\ndiscretion), for example, mandatory minimum statutes.\nBut this system would threaten disproportionality by in-\nsisting that similar punishments be applied to very dif­\nferent kinds of offense behavior or offenders. Apprendi’s\njury trial requirements might also prove unworkable. Con-\nsider the difficulty of juries’ having to find the differ-\nent facts in the bank robbery example I have set forth\nabove. Moreover, how is a defendant, arguing that he did\nnot have a gun, alternatively to argue that, in any event,\nhe did not fire the gun?\n  Finally, the dissenters took a different view of Sixth\nAmendment history. They believed that under the com­\nmon law and at the time the Constitution was ratified,\njudges, not juries, often found sentencing facts, i.e., facts\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

See, e.g., Booker, supra, at 329 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting in part); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 527–529\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting).\n  The dissenters lost the argument. The Court in Ap-\nprendi held that (other than the fact of a prior conviction)\n“any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 490.\nBut the dissenters’ views help to explain why I continue to\nbelieve this Court should not extend Apprendi’s rule be­\nyond “ ‘the central sphere of [its] concern.’ ” Ice, 555 U. S.,\nat 172 (quoting Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270,\n295 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). That is the Court’s\nview, too, as set forth in Ice. And I base my dissent here\nprimarily upon Ice.\n                            II\n  This case involves sentencing facts, not elements of a\ncrime. The criminal statute at issue constitutes one part\nof the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976\n(RCRA), which, among others things, authorizes the Envi­\nronmental Protection Agency to create a list of hazardous\nwastes. 42 U. S. C. §6921. The criminal statute says:\n    “Any person who . . . knowingly treats, stores, or dis­\n    poses of any hazardous waste identified or listed un­\n    der [RCRA] . . . without [an RCRA-authorized] permit\n    . . . shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not\n    more than $50,000 for each day of violation, or im­\n    prisonment not to exceed . . . five years . . . , or both.”\n    §6928(d)(2)(A).\nNo one here denies that this statute creates a crime with\nfour elements: (1) knowing treatment, storage, or disposal\nof a waste (2) that is hazardous, (3) without a permit, and\n(4) knowing that the waste has a substantial potential of\n6         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncausing harm to others or to the environment. App. 129–\n130; see Brief for Petitioner 30.\n   The number of “day[s] of each violation,” however, is not\nan additional element of the crime. The statute says that\nthe number of days becomes relevant only “upon convic­\ntion” of the crime as previously defined. Moreover, the\nnumber of days is relevant to application of only one of\ntwo kinds of punishment that the statute mentions (fine\nand imprisonment); one cannot easily read this statute as\ncreating two separate crimes identical but for the punish­\nment. Finally, Congress did not include here, as it some­\ntimes has done, statutory words such as “each day of\nviolation shall constitute a separate offense.” E.g., 47\nU. S. C. §223(b); see also 42 U. S. C. §4910(b). Rather, as\nin many other similar statutes, the statute here sets forth\nthe crime and kinds of punishments (fine and imprison­\nment), while separately specifying facts that determine\nthe maximum punishment of one kind (fines).\n   In this particular case, the indictment set forth a viola­\ntion period of 762 days (from “on or about September 19,\n2002 until on or about October 19, 2004”). App. 104. The\njury’s guilty verdict did not specify the number of days on\nwhich the defendant committed the offense. Id., at 141.\nBut after the conviction and sentencing hearing, the judge\nfound that, among other things, the “clear and essentially\nirrefutable evidence” at trial supported the conclusion set\nforth in the presentence report, namely, that the maxi­\nmum fine available amounted to $50,000 per day for 762\ndays—or $38.1 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a–48a.\nThe judge imposed a fine of $6 million along with a $12\nmillion community service obligation. App. 162–163.\n                           III\n  Apprendi says that “any fact that increases the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\nmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reason­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490. The number of days (be­\nyond one) on which the defendant violated this criminal\nstatute is such a fact. Nonetheless, like the majority, I\nbelieve that Apprendi’s rule does not automatically control\nthe outcome in this case.\n   That is because this case concerns a fine, not, as in\nApprendi, a term of imprisonment. And we made clear in\nOregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, that Apprendi does not en­\ncompass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision\nthat increases the statutory maximum. In Ice, we consid­\nered Apprendi’s application to a sentencing decision about\nwhether two prison sentences for conviction of two sepa­\nrate crimes (e.g., illegal drug possession and illegal gun\npossession) would run concurrently or consecutively. 555\nU. S., at 163. An Oregon statute required a concurrent\nsentence unless the sentencing judge found certain facts.\nId., at 165. Those facts could make a large difference in a\nterm of imprisonment. Their presence could mean that a\n5-year sentence for illegal drug possession and a 5-year\nsentence for illegal gun possession would amount to 10\nyears of imprisonment rather than 5 (indeed, in Ice itself,\nthe judge’s factfinding increased the sentence by 20 years,\nsee id., at 166, and n. 5). Thus, the presence of those\n“fact[s]” could “increas[e] the penalty” beyond what would\notherwise be “the prescribed statutory maximum.” Id., at\n167 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, we\nheld that the Sixth Amendment permitted a judge—it did\nnot require a jury—to make that factual determination.\nId., at 164.\n   We consequently concluded that Apprendi does not\nencompass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision\nthat increases the statutory maximum. In doing so, we\nwrote that the “animating principle” of Apprendi’s rule\n“is the preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bul-\nwark between the State and the accused at the trial for\nan alleged offense.” 555 U. S., at 168. And we refused\n8         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto extend Apprendi’s rule to a new category of sentence­\nrelated facts for two basic reasons.\n   First, we considered a historical question, namely,\nwhether “the finding of a particular fact was understood\nas within ‘the domain of the jury . . . by those who framed\nthe Bill of Rights.’ ” 555 U. S., at 168 (quoting Harris, 536\nU. S., at 557). And we read the “historical record” as\nshowing that “in England before the founding of our Na­\ntion, and in the early American States,” the jury “played\nno role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively\nor concurrently.” 555 U. S., at 168–169 (footnote omitted).\nRather, that decision “rested exclusively with the judge.”\nId., at 168.\n   Second, recognizing that “administration of a discrete\ncriminal justice system is among the [States’] basic sover­\neign prerogatives,” we considered the need to “respect . . .\nstate sovereignty.” Ibid. We expressed concern lest appli­\ncation of Apprendi to this kind of decision inhibit state\nlegislative efforts to establish a fairer sentencing system\nby helping to bring about more uniform sentencing. Ice,\n555 U. S., at 171. We concluded that “[n]either Apprendi\nnor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacket­\ning the States” in this respect. Ibid.\n   This case presents another new category of fact-related\nsentencing decisions, namely, decisions about the amount\nof a fine. Thus, as the majority recognizes, we must be-\ngin with a historical question. Ante, at 8. Who—judge or\njury—found the facts that determine the amount of a\ncriminal fine “in England before the founding of our\nNation, and in the early American States?” Ice, supra, at\n169 (footnote omitted). Unlike the majority, I believe\nthe answer to this question is that, in most instances, the\njudge made that determination.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Apprendi relied heavily upon the fact that in “England\nbefore the founding of our Nation” the prescribed punish­\nment for more serious crimes, i.e., felonies, was typically\nfixed—indeed, fixed at death. 530 U. S., at 478–480; see J.\nBaker, An Introduction to English Legal History 512 (4th\ned. 2007); J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England,\n1660–1800, pp. 409, 450–451 (1986) (hereinafter Beattie);\nLangbein, The English Criminal Trial on the Eve of the\nFrench Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,\nGermany 1700–1900, pp. 13, 16, 36–37 (A. Schioppa ed.\n1987). The facts related to the application of that pun­\nishment were typically elements of the crime. And the\njury, not the judge, determined the existence of those\nfacts. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also\nBaker, supra, at 512–518 (in practice, the jury or judge\ncould ameliorate capital punishment through application\nof doctrines such as “pious perjury,” “benefit of clergy,”\nand reprieves, or the King could grant a royal pardon);\nBeattie 419–435 (same).\n   Punishment for lesser crimes, however, included fines.\nAnd under the common law, the judge, not the jury, de­\ntermined the amount of the fine and the sentencing facts\nrelevant to the setting of that amount. See Baker, supra,\nat 512; Beattie 459. Pertinent sentencing facts typically\nconcerned the manner in which the offender committed\nthe crime and the characteristics of that offender. See id.,\nat 456–460. Thus, in 1769, Blackstone wrote:\n    “Our statute law has not therefore often ascertained\n    the quantity of fines, nor the common law ever; it di­\n    recting such an offense to be punished by fine, in gen­\n    eral, without specifying the certain sum.” Blackstone\n    372 (emphasis added).\n10        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nThat is because\n     “the quantum, in particular, of pecuniary fines neither\n     can, nor ought to be, ascertained by any invariable\n     law. The value of money itself changes from a thou­\n     sand causes; and, at all events, what is ruin to one\n     man’s fortune, may be a matter of indifference to an­\n     other.” Id., at 371.\nMoreover, the “quantum” of pecuniary fines\n     “must frequently vary, from aggravations or otherwise\n     of the offense [i.e., the manner in which the crime was\n     committed], the quality and conditions of the parties\n     [e.g., the offender’s characteristics], and from innu­\n     merable other circumstances.” Ibid.\n   Similarly, the 18th-century statesman and treatise­\nwriter Baron Auckland pointed out that in 10th-century\nEngland pre-Norman law had attached a fixed financial\npenalty to each specific crime. Principles of Penal Law 69\n(2d ed. 1771). That law, for example, imposed a penalty of\n3 cows for perjury and 12 cows for the rape of a maid.\nIbid. This system, Baron Auckland added, ignored varia­\ntions in, for example, the differing value of a fixed fine, say\na cow, over time and among individuals; it also ignored\nthe manner in which the offense was committed and the\ncharacteristics of the offender. Id., at 69–72. For those\nreasons, 18th-century English law ordinarily left “the\nquantum of the fine” to “the discretion of the Judges.” Id.,\nat 68 (emphasis deleted).\n     “[Because t]he enormity and tendency of the crime,\n     the malice and wilfulness of the intention, the incon­\n     siderateness and suddenness of the act, the age, facul­\n     ties, and fortune of the offender, form a chain of\n     complex questions; which can be resolved only by\n     the evidence of each separate charge, and for which no\n     human foresight can provide . . . then arises a neces­\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Stat. at Large 440 (forbidding “excessive\nFines”); Magna Carta §20, 9 Hen. III, §14, in 1 Eng. Stat.\nat Large 5 (1225) (fine cannot deprive offender of means of\nlivelihood); see Auckland, supra, at 73 (so interpreting\nMagna Carta); Blackstone 372–373 (same).\n   To be sure, the jury, not the judge, would determine the\nfacts that made up the elements of the crime, even though\nthose elements might be relevant to whether a fine could\napply and, if so, the amount of the fine imposed as well.\nThe common law, for example, defined larceny as the theft\nof goods that had some intrinsic value and divided the\noffense into grand larceny, which was theft of goods val­\nued at more than a shilling, and petit larceny, which was\ntheft of goods worth less than a shilling. Blackstone 229–\n234; Langbein, supra, at 16–17; see also Beattie 424\n(whether “benefit of clergy” was available depended on\nvalue stolen). Consequently, the jury would determine the\nvalue of the goods in question. In doing so, the jury might\n“manipulate the sentence by valuing the goods at under a\nshilling and thereby spare the defendant the capital sanc­\ntion.” Lillquist, The Puzzling Return of Jury Sentencing:\nMisgivings About Apprendi, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 621, 636\n(2004). But otherwise “the jury could not influence what\nother penalties” like fines the defendant might face be­\ncause in “non-capital criminal cases” the amount of pun­\nishment “was left solely in the hands of the justices.” Ibid.\n   I cannot determine with any certainty the extent to\nwhich 18th-century law placed other relevant limitations\nupon the judges’ authority to determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts. I have found an 1814 English treatise on\n12        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncriminal pleading that says, unlike in cases “where to\nconstitute the offence the value must [only] be of a certain\namount,” in cases “where the offence, or its defined meas­\nure of punishment, depends upon the quantity of that\nexcess . . . a variance from the amount averred . . . will be\nfatal.” 1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–\n188 (emphasis deleted). It then adds that “in the case of\nusury, where the judgment depends upon the quantum\ntaken, the usurious contract must be averred according to\nthe fact; and a variance from it, in evidence, would be\nfatal, because the penalty is apportioned to the value.”\nId., at 188. And an 18th-century treatise says that it\nis questionable whether it is necessary “to set forth the\nValue of the Goods in an Indictment of Trespass for any\nother Purpose than to aggravate the Fine.” 2 W. Hawkins,\nA Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75, pp. 234–\n235 (3d ed. 1739) (emphasis added). One might read these\nstatements as supporting the majority, for they might in-\ndicate that, where a statute sets forth facts that deter­\nmine a pecuniary penalty, then a jury, not judge, would\ndetermine those facts.\n  But whether that is the correct reading is unclear. For\none thing, prosecutions for economic crimes were usually\nbrought by injured parties and the “fine” in such cases\nwent in whole or in part to compensate that party for\ndamages. See Beattie 35–36, 192. For example, immedi­\nately following the sentence I have just quoted, Hawkins\nwrote that it is questionable whether it is necessary “to set\nforth the Value of the Goods . . . in an Indictment of Lar­\nceny for any other Purpose than to sh[o]w that the Crime\namounts to grand Larceny, and to ascertain the Goods,\nthereby the better to [e]ntitle the Prosecutor to a Resti-\ntution.” Hawkins, supra, at 234–235 (emphasis added;\nfootnote omitted). Likewise, Blackstone dated English\nusury law back to a 1545 statute that provided as the\npenalty that the offending lender shall both “make f[i]ne\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . at the King’s will and pleasure” and forfeit “treble\nvalue” of the money borrowed—with half to the King and\nthe other half “to him or them that will sue for the same.”\n37 Hen. VIII, ch. 9, in 3 Stat. of Realm 997 (emphasis\nadded); see Blackstone 156; see also M. Ord, An Essay\non the Law of Usury 122–123 (3d ed. 1809) (treble-value\nforfeitures recovered through information qui tam but dis-\ncretionary fines recovered through criminal indictment).\nThus, the statutes at issue were what American courts\nwould later call quasi-civil statutes—part civil, part crimi­\nnal; see also Beattie 457.\n    Parliament consequently would have had a special rea­\nson for requiring jury determinations of the amount of\nthe pecuniary penalty. And Parliament had the authority\nto depart from the common law and to insist that juries\ndetermine sentencing facts without establishing a generally\napplicable principle. The relevant question here is how\noften and for what purposes Parliament did so. Black­\nstone himself wrote that such statutes fixing fines in\namounts were both in derogation of the common law and\nuncommon. Blackstone 372. Finally, no one here argues\nthat we adopt the rule actually suggested by the treatises.\nThat rule is not that sentencing is to be done according to\nvalue found by the jury but instead that a discrepancy\nbetween the value alleged and value found by the jury\nmight render the entire case fatal. See Starkie, supra,\nat 188.\n    Thus, I cannot place great weight upon these statutes.\nThe parties did not refer to them in their briefs. And in\nany event, the historical sources taken together make\nclear that the predominant practice in 18th-century Eng­\nland was for a judge, not a jury, to find sentencing facts\nrelated to the imposition of a fine.\n    Indeed, the Court in Apprendi conceded the point. It\ndistinguished 18th-century punishments for greater\ncrimes (fixed punishments) from punishments for lesser\n14        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncrimes (included fines). 530 U. S., at 480, n. 7. And it\nwrote that “judges most commonly imposed discretionary\n‘sentences’ of fines . . . upon misdemeanants.” Ibid. (em­\nphasis added). Insofar as 18th-century English practice\nhelps determine what the Framers would have thought\nabout the scope of the Constitution’s terms—here, the\nSixth Amendment’s right to trial by an impartial jury—\nthat practice suggests they would not have expected that\nright to include determination of sentencing facts relevant\nonly to the imposition of a fine.\n                              B\n   Practice in the “early American States” is even less am-\nbiguous. In the colonial era, judges would normally\ndetermine the amount of a fine (within an unlimited or\notherwise broad range) while also determining related\nsentencing facts (say, about the manner in which the\noffender committed the crime and the offender’s character­\nistics). Legal historians tell us that in the American\ncolonies a criminal fine was “overwhelmingly the most\ncommon of the non-capital punishments,” that in most\ninstances the range of the fine was “apparently without\nlimit except insofar as it was within the expectation of the\ncourt that it would be paid,” that the judge established the\nprecise amount of the fine, and that the amount was “tai­\nlored individually to the particular case.” Preyer, Penal\nMeasures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am.\nJ. Legal Hist. 326, 350 (1982). “[C]olonial judges, like\ntheir English brethren, possessed a great deal of discre­\ntion” and could set the amount of fine “depending upon\nthe nature of the defendant and the crime.” Lillquist, 82\nN. C. L. Rev., at 640–641.\n   Enactment of the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not\nchange this practice. Some early American statutes speci­\nfied that the judge has discretion to set the amount of the\nfine while saying nothing about amount. E.g., Crimes Act\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof 1790, ch. 9, §21, 1 Stat. 117 (any person who bribes a\njudge “on conviction thereof shall be fined and imprisoned\nat the discretion of the court”); §28, 1 Stat. 118 (any per­\nson who does violence to an ambassador or public min-\nister, “on conviction, shall be imprisoned not exceeding\nthree years, and fined at the discretion of the court”).\nOthers set only a maximum limitation. E.g., Act of Mar. 3,\n1791, ch. 15, §39, 1 Stat. 208 (officer of inspection con-\nvicted of oppression or extortion “shall be fined not exceed-\ning five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six\nmonths, or both, at the discretion of the court”). In respect\nto these statutes, Justice Iredell wrote in 1795 that the\n“common law practice . . . must be adhered to; that is to\nsay, the jury are to find whether the prisoner be guilty,\nand . . . the court must assess the fine.” United States v.\nMundell, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/hawapp/6JUX/state-v-mundell/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (No. 15,834) (CC Va.).\n   Still other statutes, as in England, specifically keyed the\namount of the fine to a specific factual finding. A section\nof the Crimes Act of 1790, for example, said that any\nperson who upon United States property or the high seas\n“shall take and carry away, with an intent to steal or\npurloin the personal goods of another . . . shall, on convic­\ntion, be fined not exceeding the fourfold value of the prop­\nerty so stolen.” §16, 1 Stat. 116. This crime has several\nelements: (1) taking and (2) carrying away (3) with intent\nto steal (4) personal goods (5) belonging to another (6) on\nUnited States property or the high seas. The jury must\nfind the existence of these facts beyond a reasonable doubt\nto establish a conviction. But the statute also says that\nthe fine cannot exceed “the fourfold value of the property\nso stolen.” And it thereby requires the finding of a sen­\ntencing fact, namely the value of the stolen property. Who\nwould make this determination—judge or jury?\n   Unlike in 18th-century England, in the United States\nthere is case law directly answering the question. In\nUnited States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812), this Court\n16        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconsidered a federal embargo statute making it a crime to\n“put” certain “goods” on board a ship with intent to “ex­\nport” them outside of the United States. See Act of Jan. 9,\n1809, ch. 5, §1, 2 Stat. 506. The statute also provided\nthat an offender’s “goods” and ship “shall be forfeited,” and\nthe offender, “shall, upon conviction,” be “fined a sum, by\nthe court before which the conviction is had, equal to four\ntimes the value of such specie, goods, wares and merchan­\ndise.” Ibid. The statute thereby required determination of\na sentencing fact, namely “the value of such . . . goods.”\nWas the finding of this sentencing fact for the judge or for\nthe jury?\n   In Tyler, the defendant had been indicted for attempting\nto export 19 barrels of pearl-ashes, valued at $600. Ante,\nat 13–14. The jury convicted the defendant, but when\ndoing so, it said that it found the defendant guilty of hav­\ning tried to export “ ‘pot-ashes . . . worth two hundred and\neighty dollars.’ ” 7 Cranch, at 285 (emphasis deleted). The\ndefendant appealed, claiming a difference between the\njury’s basis for conviction and the crime as charged in the\nindictment. The difference between the words “pearl­\nashes” and “pot-ashes” is unlikely to have mattered, for\npearl-ash is simply a refined grade of pot-ash (potassium\ncarbonate). See T. Barker, R. Dickinson, & D. Hardie,\nOrigins of the Synthetic Alkali Industry in Britain, 23\nEconomica 158, 163 (1956). Thus, the defendant did not\nfocus upon that difference. Rather, he claimed that the\njury’s verdict “was not sufficiently certain as to the value\nof the property charged in the indictment.” Tyler, 7\nCranch, at 285 (emphasis added). Because $280 differs\nfrom $600, the jury had not found him guilty of the crime\ncharged.\n   The Supreme Court, however, found that the jury’s\nfinding as to valuation was not relevant. It upheld the\nconviction because it was “of the opinion that, under this\nlaw, no valuation by the jury was necessary to enable the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCircuit Court to impose the proper fine.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). The Court did not say explicitly that the Sixth\nAmendment permitted the judge to find the relevant sen­\ntencing fact. See ante, at 14. But it seems unlikely\nthat a Court that included Chief Justice John Marshall,\nJustice Joseph Story, and others familiar with both the\ncommon law and the Constitution would have interpreted\na federal statute as they did if either contemporary legal\npractice or the Constitution suggested or required a differ­\nent interpretation.\n  Nor can we say that the Court did not fully consider the\nmatter. Justice Story later authoritatively interpreted\nTyler.

But, to the contrary, there is a\nSupreme Court opinion, namely Tyler, that holds, or at\nleast strongly indicates, the opposite.\n                          C\n  The majority reaches a different conclusion. But the\nmajority does not pose what I believe to be the relevant\nhistorical question, namely whether traditionally “in\nEngland before the founding of our Nation, and in the\n18        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nearly American States,” see Ice, 555 U. S., at 169 (footnote\nomitted), judges, not juries, normally determined fine­\nrelated sentencing facts. Instead, it asks whether a jury,\nrather than the judge, found those facts in that subclass of\ncases where a statute “peg[ged] the amount of a fine to the\ndetermination of specified facts.” Ante, at 10. It concludes\nthat “the predominant practice was for such facts to be\nalleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.” Ibid.\n   Putting the question this way invites a circular re­\nsponse. As is true of the English usury cases, nothing\nprohibits a legislature from requiring a jury to find a\nsentencing fact in a particular subset of cases. And obvi­\nously when a State does so, the jury will indeed have to\nfind those facts. Thus, if, say, 10 States decide to make\njuries find facts that will set the fine for, say, simple lar­\nceny, then jury practice in those States (during, say, the\n19th century) will include the jury’s finding of those sen­\ntencing facts. But that circumstance tells us only that in\nthose 10 States for those specific statutes the legislatures\nso required. It tells us little, if anything, about practices\nin most States, and it tells us nothing at all about tradi­\ntional practice in England or 18th-century America. Nor\ndoes a discovery that, say, 10 state legislatures once re­\nquired juries, rather than judges, generally to set fines tell\nus about the scope of the Sixth Amendment’s constitu-\ntional right to trial by jury. The matter is important be-\ncause the majority rests its conclusion almost exclusively\nupon reports of mid-19th-century jury trials in a handful of\nStates, namely Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,\nand New Hampshire, and a treatise that bases its state­\nments upon those cases. Ante, at 10–12.\n   Scholars tell us that in fact there were about 10\nStates—including Alabama, Illinois, and Indiana—that\n(after ratification of the Sixth Amendment) enacted stat­\nutes that required juries, not judges, to determine a de­\nfendant’s punishment, including not only the length of a\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Rev.\n311, 317 (2003); King, Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing\nin the United States 78 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 937, 963 (2003).\nThe courts that considered this practice, however, did\nnot believe that the constitutional right to jury trial com­\npelled it.\n   Alabama’s Supreme Court, for example, explained that\nits State’s jury-sentencing system, which allowed the jury\n“to determine both the fine and imprisonment,” was in\nderogation of, and created “an innovation upon[,] the rules\nof the common law, so far as it transfers [those] powers\nfrom the court to the jury.” Hawkins v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Stew. & P.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1832).

The statute, in other words, trans­\nferred all sentencing facts to the jury and was not illus­\ntrative of 18th-century practice. Further, the statute said\nthat the “ ‘fine shall be paid to the party injured.’ ” Ibid.\nThe court held that it was consequently proper to allege\nthe amount of the property’s value in the indictment, not\nbecause the State’s constitution required any such thing,\nbut because “the fine thus assesse[d] is for the benefit of\nthe injured party”; the case “is, therefore, a quasi civil\nproceeding”; and for that reason “it would be more con-\nsonant to the rules of pleading, and to the principles\nwhich govern analogous cases, that the indictment should\ncontain an averment of the value of the property.” Ibid.;\nOrd, Law of Usury, at 122–123 (usury as quasi-civil\nproceeding).\n   Illinois law was similar.       Illinois became a jury­\nsentencing State in 1831. See Iontcheva, supra, at 317,\nn. 28 (citing Act of Feb. 15, 1831, §42, 1830 Ill. Laws 103,\n20        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n113). The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently wrote\nthat, even though “at common law . . . juries . . . never\nwere invested with the power of determining the character\nor extent of the punishment . . . , we are to be governed\nentirely the provisions and enactments of our code of\ncriminal jurisprudence.” Blevings v.

Iontcheva,\nsupra, at 317, n. 28; King, supra, at 937. Indiana case law\ndecided before Indiana changed its system indicates that\nthe judge could decide certain facts required to set the\napplicable maximum fine. E.g., Morris v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Blackf.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1819). But after Indiana became a jury-sentencing\nState, its courts held, not surprisingly, that under Indiana\nlaw the jury must determine sentencing facts. See Ritchey\nv.

The\ntwo Massachusetts cases that the majority cites, ante, at\n10–11, are larceny cases. Value traditionally was an\nelement of the crime of larceny—both because larceny was\ntheft of goods that had some intrinsic value and because\nvalue distinguished grand larceny from petit larceny—and\nthus juries traditionally had to determine at least some\nfacts about the value of the property stolen. See Black­\nstone 229, 234. Massachusetts had abolished the distinc­\ntion between grand and petit larceny before its courts\ndecided the two cases the majority cites. See Common-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwealth v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246 (1804). But those deci­\nsions nonetheless rest in significant part upon the jury’s\ntraditional larceny factfinding role. In Hope v. Common-\nwealth, 9 Metcalf 134 (1845), for example, the Massachu­\nsetts Supreme Judicial Court wrote:\n    “The well settled practice, familiar to us all, has been\n    that of stating in the indictment the value of the arti­\n    cle alleged to have been stolen. . . . The reason for re­\n    quiring this allegation and finding of value may have\n    been, originally, that a distinction might appear be­\n    tween the offences of grand and petit larceny . . . . Our\n    statutes . . . prescribe the punishment for larceny,\n    with reference to the value of the property stolen; and\n    for this reason, as well as because it is in conformity\n    with long established practice, the court are of opinion\n    that the value of the property alleged to be stolen\n    must be set forth in the indictment.” Id., at 136–137.\nThe “long established practice” to which the court refers is\nlarceny case practice, not practice in all criminal cases.\n  The New Hampshire case to which the majority refers,\nState v. Goodrich, 46 N. H. 186 (1865), ante, at 11, is also\na larceny case that relied on the “established” larceny case\npractice. The court explained:\n    “The indictment ought to state the value of the arti­\n    cles stolen that it may appear whether the offence be\n    grand or petit larceny, and such we believe is the set­\n    tled practice. . . . It has been held in some jurisdic­\n    tions, that, in case no value is alleged, the offence\n    charged may be regarded as simple larceny, and a\n    conviction be had accordingly . . . but we think it best\n    to adhere to the well established doctrine in such\n    cases . . . . It may also be suggested, that, in the case\n    of simple larceny, the respondent may be sentenced\n    to pay the owner of the goods stolen, treble the value\n    thereof, which is an additional reason for requiring\n22        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n     the character of the offence to be stated.” 46 N. H., at\n     187–188.\nThe court wrote nothing to suggest that its holding rested\non generally applicable constitutional grounds. And it was\nin the New Hampshire federal circuit court a half-century\nearlier when Justice Story had indicated that the Federal\nConstitution did not impose any such requirement. See\nMann, 26 F. Cas., at 1155 (No. 15,718).\n   That leaves the majority’s puzzling 1895 Federal Dis­\ntrict Court case from Kansas. United States v. Woodruff,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Kan. 1895); ante, at 11. The circumstances\nof this case are highly unusual, and the District Court’s\nreasoning as to why no fine could be set seems to have\nrested on a combination of statutory construction and\nconstitutional principle. See Woodruff v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767–768 (CC Kan. 1893); Woodruff, 68 F., at 538–\n539. Still, I concede this case to the majority—as the lone\nswallow that cannot make the majority’s summer.\n   Taken together, the 19th-century cases upon which the\nmajority rests its holding do not show anything about\npractice in the vast majority of States. They concede that\ncommon-law practice was to the contrary. And they tell us\nlittle about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Even\nwere that not so, I do not understand why these mid-19th­\ncentury cases should tell us more about the Constitution’s\nmeaning than, say, the common 20th-century practice\nof leaving sentencing fact determinations to the judge.\nThis Court apparently once approved the latter practice as\nconstitutional. E.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.\n79 (1986); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224. And these\ncases seem more closely related to the present topic.\n                           D\n  The upshot is that both 18th-century English common\nlaw and 18th-century American law typically provided\njudges with broad discretion to assess fines. The judge,\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnot the jury, would normally determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts. In this respect, ordinary 18th-century sen­\ntencing practice related to fines was unlike sentencing\npractice in respect to felonies. In the latter case, in Ap-\nprendi’s view, punishment was normally “fixed” and the\njudge’s sentencing role was consequently minimal. 530\nU. S., at 478–480. In the former case, namely fines, the\njudge’s role was not normally minimal, but the opposite.\nFor these reasons, I believe that allowing a judge to de­\ntermine sentencing facts related to imposition of a fine\ndoes not invade the historic province of the jury. The\nhistorical test that we set forth in Ice is satisfied.\n                               V\n  In Ice, we also took account of the practical extent\nto which extending Apprendi’s rule beyond the “ ‘central\nsphere of [its] concern’ ” would “diminish” the States’ “role”\nin “devising solutions to difficult legal problems . . . absent\nimpelling reason to do so.” 555 U. S., at 171–172. In\nparticular, we feared that insisting that juries determine\nthe relevant sentencing facts (concerning concurrent, as\nopposed to consecutive, punishment) would unjustifiably\ninterfere with a State’s legislative efforts “to rein in the\ndiscretion judges possessed at common law to impose\nconsecutive sentences at will.” Id., at 171. It would in-\nhibit (indeed “straightjacke[t]”) States seeking to make\n“concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences\nthe exception.” Ibid. We said that we were “unclear how\nmany other state initiatives would fall” if Apprendi were\nextended, and that expansion would be “difficult for\nStates to administer.” Id., at 171–172. We believed that\nthese considerations argued strongly against any such\n“expansion.”\n  Here, the same kinds of considerations similarly argue\nagainst “expansion” of Apprendi’s rule. Today’s decision\napplies to the States. In the 1950’s and thereafter, States\n24        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas well as the Federal Government recognized a serious\nproblem in respect to the sentencing of corporations.\nFines, imposed as a punishment upon corporate offenders,\nwere both nonuniform (treating identical offenders differ­\nently) and too often they were set too low. Judges would\nfrequently fine corporations in amounts that failed to\napproximate the harm a corporation had caused or the\ngain that it had obtained through its illegal activity, both\nbecause often the statutory maximums were low and be-\ncause often the fines imposed tended to be substantially\nlower than those maximums. See Gruner, Towards an\nOrganizational Jurisprudence: Transforming Corporate\nCriminal Law Through Federal Sentencing Reform, 36\nAriz. L. Rev. 407, 408 (1994); Kadish, Some Observa­\ntions on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Eco­\nnomic Regulations, 30 U. Chi. L.

Q. 205, 215 (1993).\n   Consequently, the authors of the Model Penal Code\nadopted a model provision stating that, in respect to of­\nfenses involving financial gain, a court could impose an\nalternative “higher” fine “equal to double the pecuniary\ngain derived from the offense by the offender.” Model\nPenal Code §6.03(5), 10A U. L. A. 259 (2001). New York\nsoon thereafter adopted such a provision. N. Y. Penal Law\nAnn. §80.10(2)(b) (West 2009). And other States followed\nNew York’s example with similar provisions permitting\njudges to set fines equal to twice the gain to the offender\nor twice the loss to the victim, thereby helping to diminish\ndisparity while helping potential victims by increasing\ndeterrence. E.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §53a–44 (West\n2007); Fla. Stat. §775.083(1)(f) (2010). Many of these\nstatutes say in particular that the “court” shall make the\nfinding of gain or loss, in a separate hearing if necessary.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          25\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nE.g., N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §80.00(3) (West 2009); N. J.\nStat. Ann. §2C:43–3(e) (West 2005).\n  The Federal Government followed suit. In some in­\nstances, such as RCRA, where environmental harm likely\nvaries with the length of the violation period, Congress\nadvanced its uniformity and deterrence goals by tying a\ndollar-limited fine to the length of time during which that\nviolation took place. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d)(2)(A). In other\ninstances, it did so through a new general gain-or-loss\nprovision, applying to all offenses, including such crimes\nas corporate fraud, antitrust violations, and environmen­\ntal pollution. That provision says:\n    “ALTERNATIVE FINE BASED ON GAIN OR LOSS.—If any\n    person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if\n    the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other\n    than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not\n    more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice\n    the gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this\n    subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the\n    sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C. §3571(d).\n  To apply Apprendi’s rule to the fines set forth in such\nstatutes, no less than in Ice, would weaken or destroy the\nStates’ and Federal Government’s efforts “to rein in the\ndiscretion judges possessed at common law,” Ice, 555 U. S.,\nat 171, over fines. Congress, in enacting such statutes,\nexpected judges, not juries, to determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts because doing so will often involve highly\ncomplex determinations. Where, say, major fraud is at\nissue, the full extent of the loss (or gain) may be unknown\nat the time of indictment or at any other time prior to the\nconclusion of the trial. And in an antitrust or an environ­\nmental pollution case, the jury may have particular diffi­\nculty assessing different estimates of resulting losses.\n  The consequence of the majority’s holding, insisting that\njuries make such determinations, is likely to diminish the\n26        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfairness of the criminal trial process. A defendant will not\nfind it easy to show the jury at trial that (1) he committed\nno environmental crime, but (2) in any event, he commit­\nted the crime only on 20 days, not 30. Moreover, the\nmajority’s holding will sometimes permit prosecutors to\nintroduce newly relevant evidence that would otherwise\nhave been kept from the jury on the ground that it was\ncumulative or unduly prejudicial. If victims’ losses are\nrelevant, the prosecutor may be able to produce witness\nafter witness testifying only about the amount of life\nsavings lost to the fraud. The defendant in this case, for\nexample, thought the introduction of evidence about the\ndiscovery of mercury and remediation and evacuation of a\nnearby apartment complex was unduly prejudicial.

But even if that were\nso, that evidence might now be admitted as showing the\namount of harm caused or the number of days upon which\nthe defendant’s unlawful activity took place.\n   Administrative problems here may prove more serious\nthan where, as in Apprendi, prison terms were at stake.\nIn part, that is because corporate criminal cases often\nfocus upon complex frauds, criminal price fixing, extended\nenvironmental pollution, food-and-drug safety violations,\nand the like. Both Congress and the Sentencing Commis­\nsion have recognized as much. The federal criminal fine\nstatute to which I earlier referred specifically creates an\nexception where assessing total loss or gain “would unduly\ncomplicate or prolong the sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3571(d). Similarly, Sentencing Guidelines applicable to\ncorporations exclude fine provisions for environmental\ncrimes (along with most crimes involving export viola­\ntions, food-and-drug safety, agricultural-and-consumer\nproducts, and RICO violations) because of the “potential\ndifficulty . . . of defining and computing loss.” Nagel &\nSwenson, supra, at 256; see USSG §8C2.1, and comment.,\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n§8C2.10. Where the defendant is a human being, the\nGovernment can avoid problems of proof simply by aban­\ndoning any effort to obtain a fine; instead, perhaps to the\nindividual defendant’s dismay, the prosecution can seek\na longer prison term. Where the criminal defendant is a\ncorporation, however, no such possibility exists.\n   If, as seems likely, it becomes too difficult to prove fine­\nrelated sentencing facts to a jury, legislatures will have\nto change their statutes. Some may choose to return to\nhighly discretionary sentencing, with its related risks of\nnonuniformity. Others may link conviction with fines\nspecified in amount, rather like the 10th-century pre-\nNorman system of three cows for perjury or more modern\nmandatory minimum penalties. As Blackstone pointed\nout, those systems produce sentences that are not propor­\ntionate; they tend to treat alike offenders who committed\nthe same crime in very different ways. See 4 Blackstone\n371–372.\n   The majority believes that 10 years of experience with\nApprendi “attenuate[s]” any legal claim of reliance on\ndifferent rule of constitutional law here. Ante, at 16.\nPerhaps so. Perhaps that experience shows that Appren-\ndi’s jury trial requirement is workable. But there is an­\nother less optimistic possibility.\n   Perhaps that experience, like the canary in a mine­\nshaft, tells us only that our criminal justice system is no\nlonger the jury-trial-based adversarial system that it once\nwas. We have noted that “[n]inety-seven percent of fed­\neral convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions\nare the result of guilty pleas.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). We have added that today\n“ ‘plea bargaining” is “not some adjunct to the criminal\njustice system; it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101\nYale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992)). And in such a system, com­\nplex jury trial requirements may affect the strength of a\n28       SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nparty’s bargaining position rather than the conduct of\nmany actual trials.\n  At the same time, the prosecutor in such a system,\nperhaps armed with statutes providing for mandatory\nminimum sentences, can become the ultimate adjudicator.\nThe prosecutor/adjudicator plays an important role in\nmany “European inquisitorial” systems. But those prose­\ncutors, unlike ours, typically are trained formally to be\nmore like neutral adjudicators than advocates. Cf. Lang­\nbein & Weinreb, Continental Criminal Procedure: “Myth”\nand Reality, 87 Yale L. J. 1549, 1559 (1978); see, e.g.,\nÈcole Nationale de la Magistrature. Today’s holding, by\nunnecessarily complicating the trial process, may prove\nworkable only because it nudges our system slightly fur­\nther in this direction. I see no virtue in doing so.\n  For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 802770, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/21/southern_union_co._v._united_states.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11–94. Argued March 19, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012\nPetitioner Southern Union Company was convicted by a jury in federal\n  court on one count of violating the Resource Conservation and Recov-\n  ery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury\n  without a permit at a subsidiary’s facility “on or about September 19,\n  2002 to October 19, 2004.” Violations of the RCRA are punishable by,\n  inter alia, a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.\n  42 U. S. C. §6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office calculated a\n  maximum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern Union vio-\n  lated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from September 19, 2002,\n  through October 19, 2004. Southern Union argued that imposing any\n  fine greater than the 1-day penalty of $50,000 would be unconstitu-\n  tional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, which holds that\n  the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee requires that any fact\n  (other than the fact of a prior conviction) that increases the maxi-\n  mum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury\n  beyond a reasonable doubt. Southern Union contended that, based\n  on the jury verdict and the District Court’s instructions, the only vio-\n  lation the jury necessarily found was for one day. The District Court\n  held that Apprendi applies to criminal fines, but concluded from the\n  “content and context of the verdict all together” that the jury found a\n  762-day violation. The court therefore set a maximum potential fine\n  of $38.1 million, from which it imposed a fine of $6 million and a\n  “community service obligation” of $12 million. On appeal, the First\n  Circuit disagreed with the District Court that the jury necessarily\n  found a violation of 762 days. But the First Circuit affirmed the sen-\n  tence because it held that Apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.\nHeld: The rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.\n Pp. 3−16.\n2             SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law prac-\n    tice,” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281, and preserves\n    the “historic jury function” of “determining whether the prosecution\n    has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt,”\n    Oregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, 163. This Court has repeatedly affirmed\n    Apprendi’s rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that\n    allow judges to find facts that increase a defendant’s maximum au-\n    thorized sentence. See Cunningham, 549 U. S., at 274−275; United\n    States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–227; Blakely v. Washington, 542\n    U. S. 296, 299–300; Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589; Ap-\n    prendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469. While the punishments at stake in these\n    cases were imprisonment or a death sentence, there is no principled\n    basis under Apprendi to treat criminal fines differently. Apprendi’s\n    “core concern”—to reserve to the jury “the determination of facts that\n    warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense,” Ice, 555 U. S.,\n    at 170—applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprison-\n    ment or death. Criminal fines, like these other forms of punishment,\n    are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.\n    Fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in\n    colonial America and they continue to be frequently imposed today.\n    And, the amount of a fine, like the maximum term of imprisonment\n    or eligibility for the death penalty, is often determined by reference to\n    particular facts. The Government argues that fines are less onerous\n    than incarceration and the death sentence and therefore should be\n    exempt from Apprendi. But where a fine is substantial enough to\n    trigger the Sixth Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies\n    in full. Pp. 3−8.\n       (b) The “historical role of the jury at common law,” which informs\n    the “scope of the constitutional jury right,” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170, sup-\n    ports applying Apprendi to criminal fines. To be sure, judges in the\n    colonies and during the founding era had much discretion in deter-\n    mining whether to impose a fine and in what amount. But the exer-\n    cise of such discretion is fully consistent with Apprendi, which per-\n    mits courts to impose “judgment within the range prescribed by\n    statute.” 530 U. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). The more salient\n    question is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that\n    pegged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts. A\n    review of both state and federal decisions discloses that the predomi-\n    nant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and\n    proved to the jury. The rule that juries must determine facts that set\n    a fine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two longstanding\n    tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence” on which Apprendi is\n    based: first, “the ‘truth of every accusation’ against a defendant\n    ‘should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  of his equals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301. And se-\n  cond, “ ‘an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law\n  makes essential to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the\n  requirements of the common law, and is no accusation in reason.’ ”\n  Ibid. Contrary to the Government’s contentions, neither United\n  States v. Murphy, 16 Pet. 203, nor United States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch\n  285, overcomes the ample historical evidence that juries routinely\n  found facts that set maximum criminal fines. Pp. 8−14.\n     (c) The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the dissent,\n  are unpersuasive. The Government claims that facts relevant to a fine’s\n  amount typically quantify the harm caused by the defendant’s of-\n  fense, and do not define a separate set of acts for punishment. The\n  Government contends that only the latter determination implicates\n  Apprendi’s concerns. But this argument rests on the rejected as-\n  sumption that, in determining the maximum punishment for an of-\n  fense, there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact\n  that is an “element” of the offense and one that is a “sentencing fac-\n  tor.” Further, the facts the District Court found in imposing a fine on\n  Southern Union are not fairly characterized as merely quantifying\n  the harm the company caused.\n     The Government also argues that applying Apprendi to criminal\n  fines will prevent States and the Federal Government from enact-\n  ing statutes that calibrate the amount of a fine to a defendant’s culp-\n  ability. But legislatures are free to enact such statutes, so long\n  as the statutes are administered in conformance with the Sixth\n  Amendment.\n     Finally, the Government contends that requiring juries to deter-\n  mine facts related to fines will cause confusion, prejudice defendants,\n  or be impractical. These policy arguments rehearse those made by\n  the dissents in our prior Apprendi cases. They must be rejected be-\n  cause the rule the Government espouses is unconstitutional. In addi-\n  tion, because Apprendi is now more than a decade old, the reliance\n  interests underlying the Government’s arguments are by this point\n  attenuated.

Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000);\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004). We have\napplied this principle in numerous cases where the sen-\ntence was imprisonment or death. The question here is\nwhether the same rule applies to sentences of criminal\nfines. We hold that it does.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Southern Union Company is a natural gas\ndistributor. Its subsidiary stored liquid mercury, a haz-\nardous substance, at a facility in Pawtucket, Rhode Is-\nland. In September 2004, youths from a nearby apart-\nment complex broke into the facility, played with the mer-\ncury, and spread it around the facility and complex. The\ncomplex’s residents were temporarily displaced during\nthe cleanup and most underwent testing for mercury\npoisoning.\n  In 2007, a grand jury indicted Southern Union on mul-\n2         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiple counts of violating federal environmental statutes.\nAs relevant here, the first count alleged that the company\nknowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at the\nPawtucket facility “[f ]rom on or about September 19, 2002\nuntil on or about October 19, 2004,” App. 104, in viola-\ntion of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of\n1976 (RCRA). See 90 Stat. 2812, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n§6928(d)(2)(A). A jury convicted Southern Union on this\ncount following a trial in the District Court for the District\nof Rhode Island. The verdict form stated that Southern\nUnion was guilty of unlawfully storing liquid mercury\n“on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004.”\nApp. 140.\n   Violations of the RCRA are punishable by, inter alia,\n“a fine of not more than $50,000 for each day of violation.”\n§6928(d). At sentencing, the probation office set a maxi-\nmum fine of $38.1 million, on the basis that Southern\nUnion violated the RCRA for each of the 762 days from\nSeptember 19, 2002, through October 19, 2004. Southern\nUnion objected that this calculation violated Apprendi\nbecause the jury was not asked to determine the precise\nduration of the violation. The company noted that the ver-\ndict form listed only the violation’s approximate start\ndate (i.e., “on or about”), and argued that the court’s in-\nstructions permitted conviction if the jury found even a\n1-day violation. Therefore, Southern Union maintained, the\nonly violation the jury necessarily found was for one day,\nand imposing any fine greater than the single-day penalty\nof $50,000 would require factfinding by the court, in con-\ntravention of Apprendi.\n   The Government acknowledged the jury was not asked\nto specify the duration of the violation, but argued that\nApprendi does not apply to criminal fines. The District\nCourt disagreed and held that Apprendi applies. But the\ncourt concluded from the “content and context of the ver-\ndict all together” that the jury found a 762-day violation.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The court therefore set a\nmaximum potential fine of $38.1 million, from which\nit imposed a fine of $6 million and a “community service\nobligatio[n]” of $12 million. App. 154.\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit rejected the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe jury necessarily found a violation of 762 days. 630\nF. 3d 17, 36 (2010). But the Court of Appeals affirmed\nthe sentence because it also held, again in contrast to the\nDistrict Court, that Apprendi does not apply to criminal\nfines. 630 F. 3d, at 33–36. Other Circuits have reached\nthe opposite conclusion. See United States v. Pfaff, 619\nF. 3d 172 (CA2 2010) (per curiam); United States v.\nLaGrou Distribution Sys., Inc., 466 F. 3d 585 (CA7 2006).\nWe granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 565 U. S. ___\n(2011), and now reverse.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   This case requires us to consider the scope of the Sixth\nAmendment right of jury trial, as construed in Apprendi.\nUnder Apprendi, “[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic-\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at\n490. The “ ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is\nthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the\nbasis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted\nby the defendant.” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis\ndeleted). Thus, while judges may exercise discretion in\nsentencing, they may not “inflic[t] punishment that the\njury’s verdict alone does not allow.” Id., at 304.\n   Apprendi’s rule is “rooted in longstanding common-law\npractice.” Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 281\n(2007). It preserves the “historic jury function” of “deter-\nmining whether the prosecution has proved each element\n4           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” Oregon v. Ice,\n555 U. S. 160, 163 (2009). We have repeatedly affirmed\nthis rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes\nthat allowed judges to find facts that increased a defend-\nant’s maximum authorized sentence. See Cunningham,\n549 U. S., at 274–275 (elevated “upper term” of impris-\nonment); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 226–\n227, 233–234 (2005) (increased imprisonment range for\ndefendant under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines); Blakely, 542 U. S., at 299–300 (increased im-\nprisonment above statutorily prescribed “standard range”);\nRing v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 588–589 (2002) (death\npenalty authorized upon finding existence of aggravating\nfactors); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 468–469 (extended term\nof imprisonment based on violation of a “hate crime”\nstatute).\n  While the punishments at stake in those cases were\nimprisonment or a death sentence, we see no principled\nbasis under Apprendi for treating criminal fines differ-\nently. Apprendi’s “core concern” is to reserve to the jury\n“the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a\nspecific statutory offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. That\nconcern applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or\nimprisonment or death. Criminal fines, like these other\nforms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sover-\neign for the commission of offenses. Fines were by far the\nmost common form of noncapital punishment in colonial\nAmerica.1 They are frequently imposed today, especially\n——————\n    1 See\n        Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An Overview,\n26 Am.

Sometimes,\nas here, the fact is the duration of a statutory violation;3\nunder other statutes it is the amount of the defendant’s\ngain or the victim’s loss, or some other factor.4 In all\nsuch cases, requiring juries to find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt facts that determine the fine’s maximum amount is\nnecessary to implement Apprendi’s “animating principle”:\nthe “preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bulwark\nbetween the State and the accused at the trial for an\nalleged offense.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 168. In stating Appren-\ndi’s rule, we have never distinguished one form of pun-\nishment from another. Instead, our decisions broadly\nprohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum\ncriminal “sentence[s],” “penalties,” or “punishment[s]”—\nterms that each undeniably embrace fines. E.g., Blakely,\n542 U. S., at 304; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490; Ring, 536\nU.

North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538,\n542–543 (1989) (jury trial); Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367,\n373–374 (1979) (counsel). Therefore, the Government\nconcludes, fines categorically “do not implicate” the “pri-\nmary concerns motivating Apprendi.” Brief for United\nStates 23–25.\n   This argument fails because its conclusion does not fol-\nlow from its premise. Where a fine is so insubstantial that\nthe underlying offense is considered “petty,” the Sixth\nAmendment right of jury trial is not triggered, and no\nApprendi issue arises. See, e.g., Muniz v. Hoffman, 422\nU. S. 454, 477 (1975) ($10,000 fine imposed on labor union\ndoes not entitle union to jury trial); see also Blanton,\n489 U. S., at 541 (no jury trial right for “petty” offenses,\nas measured by the “severity of the maximum authorized\npenalty” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The same,\nof course, is true of offenses punishable by relatively brief\nterms of imprisonment—these, too, do not entitle a de-\nfendant to a jury trial. See id., at 543 (establishing a\nrebuttable presumption that offenses punishable by six\nmonths’ imprisonment or less are petty); Duncan v. Loui-\nsiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159–162 (1968).\n   But not all fines are insubstantial, and not all offenses\npunishable by fines are petty. See, e.g., Mine Workers v.\nBagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 838, n. 5 (1994) (criminal contempt\nfine of $52 million imposed on union “unquestionably is\na serious contempt sanction” that triggers right of jury\ntrial). The federal twice-the-gain-or-loss statute, in par-\nticular, see 18 U. S. C. §3571(d), has been used to obtain\nsubstantial judgments against organizational defendants.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee, e.g., Amended Judgment in United States v. LG Dis-\nplay Co., Ltd., No. 08–CR–803–SI (ND Cal.), pp. 1–2 ($400\nmillion fine for conviction of single count of violating\nSherman Antitrust Act); Judgment in United States v.\nSiemens Aktiengesellschaft, No. 08–CR–367–RJL (D DC),\npp. 1–2, 5 ($448.5 million fine for two violations of Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act); United States Sentencing Com-\nmission, 2010 Annual Report, ch. 5, p. 38 (noting fine of\n$1.195 billion imposed on pharmaceutical corporation for\nviolations of food and drug laws). And, where the defend-\nant is an individual, a large fine may “engender ‘a signifi-\ncant infringement of personal freedom.’ ” Blanton, 489\nU. S., at 542 (quoting Frank v. United States, 395 U. S.\n147, 151 (1969)); see also 18 U. S. C. §3572(a)(2) (requiring\ncourt to consider “the burden that the fine will impose\nupon the defendant” in determining whether to impose a\nfine and in what amount).\n   The Government thus asks the wrong question by com-\nparing the severity of criminal fines to that of other pun-\nishments. So far as Apprendi is concerned, the relevant\nquestion is the significance of the fine from the perspective\nof the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Where a\nfine is substantial enough to trigger that right, Apprendi\napplies in full. As we said in Cunningham, “Asking\nwhether a defendant’s basic jury-trial right is preserved,\nthough some facts essential to punishment are reserved\nfor determination by the judge, . . . is the very inquiry\nApprendi’s ‘bright-line rule’ was designed to exclude.” 549\nU. S., at 291.\n   This case is exemplary. The RCRA subjects Southern\nUnion to a maximum fine of $50,000 for each day of\nviolation. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d). The Government does not\ndeny that, in light of the seriousness of that punishment,\nthe company was properly accorded a jury trial. And the\nGovernment now concedes the District Court made factual\nfindings that increased both the “potential and actual” fine\n8           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe court imposed. Brief for United States 28. This is\nexactly what Apprendi guards against: judicial factfinding\nthat enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces\nbeyond what the jury’s verdict or the defendant’s admis-\nsions allow.\n                             B\n  In concluding that the rule of Apprendi does not apply to\ncriminal fines, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision\nin Ice. Ice addressed the question whether, when a de-\nfendant is convicted of multiple offenses, Apprendi forbids\njudges to determine facts that authorize the imposition of\nconsecutive sentences. 555 U. S., at 164. In holding that\nApprendi does not, Ice emphasized that juries historically\nplayed no role in deciding whether sentences should run\nconsecutively or concurrently. See 555 U. S., at 168–169.\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that juries were similarly\nuninvolved in setting criminal fines. 630 F. 3d, at 35.5\n  The Court of Appeals was correct to examine the histor-\nical record, because “the scope of the constitutional jury\nright must be informed by the historical role of the jury\nat common law.” Ice, 555 U. S., at 170. See also, e.g.,\nBlakely, 542 U. S., at 301–302; Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n477–484. But in our view, the record supports applying\n\n——————\n   5 Ice also stated in dicta that applying Apprendi to consecutive-\n\nversus-concurrent sentencing determinations might imperil a variety of\nsentencing decisions judges commonly make, including “the imposition\nof statutorily prescribed fines.” 555 U. S., at 171. The Court of Appeals\nread this statement to mean that Apprendi does not apply to criminal\nfines. 630 F. 3d, at 34. We think the statement is at most ambiguous,\nand more likely refers to the routine practice of judges’ imposing fines\nfrom within a range authorized by jury-found facts. Such a practice\nposes no problem under Apprendi because the penalty does not exceed\nwhat the jury’s verdict permits. See 530 U. S., at 481. In any event,\nour statement in Ice was unnecessary to the judgment and is not\nbinding. Central Va. Community College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363\n(2006).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

To be sure, judges in the col-\nonies and during the founding era “possessed a great deal\nof discretion” in determining whether to impose a fine\nand in what amount. Lillquist 640–641; see also Preyer\n350. Often, a fine’s range “was apparently without limit\nexcept insofar as it was within the expectation on the part\nof the court that it would be paid.” Ibid. For some other\noffenses, the maximum fine was capped by statute. See,\ne.g., id., at 333 (robbery, larceny, burglary, and other\noffenses punishable in Massachusetts Bay Colony “by\nfines of up to £5”); Act of Feb. 28, 1803, ch. 9, §7, 2 Stat.\n205 (any consul who gives a false certificate shall “forfeit\nand pay a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, at the\ndiscretion of the court”); K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of\nJudging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9\n(1998) (describing federal practice).\n   The exercise of such sentencing discretion is fully con-\nsistent with Apprendi, which permits courts to impose\n“judgment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530\nU. S., at 481 (emphasis in original). Nor, a fortiori, could\nthere be an Apprendi violation where no maximum is\nprescribed. Indeed, in surveying the historical record that\nformed the basis of our holding in Apprendi, we specifi-\ncally considered the English practice with respect to fines,\nwhich, as was true of many colonial offenses, made sen-\ntencing largely “dependent upon judicial discretion.” See\nid., at 480, n. 7; see also Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.\n227, 244–245 (1999); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on\nthe Laws of England 372–373 (1769) (hereinafter Black-\nstone). And even then, as the dissent acknowledges, post,\nat 11–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.), there is authority sug-\ngesting that English juries were required to find facts that\ndetermined the authorized pecuniary punishment. See\n1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–188\n(1814) (In cases “where the offence, or its defined measure\nof punishment, depends upon” property’s specific value,\n10        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe value “must be proved precisely as it is laid [in the\nindictment], and any variance will be fatal”); see also\nid., at 188 (“[I]n the case of usury, where the judgment\ndepends upon the quantum taken, the usurious contract\nmust be averred according to the fact; and a variance from\nit, in evidence, would be fatal, because the penalty is\napportioned to the value” (emphasis in original)); 2 W.\nHawkins, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75,\npp. 234–235 (3d ed. 1739) (doubting whether “it be need-\nful to set forth the Value of the Goods in an Indictment\nof Trespass for any other Purpose than to aggravate the\nFine”).\n   In any event, the salient question here is what role the\njury played in prosecutions for offenses that did peg the\namount of a fine to the determination of specified facts—\noften, the value of damaged or stolen property. See Ap-\nprendi, 530 U. S., at 502, n. 2 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\nOur review of state and federal decisions discloses that the\npredominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in\nthe indictment and proved to the jury. See, e.g., Com-\nmonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 247 (1804) (declining to\naward judgment of treble damages for all stolen items in\nlarceny prosecution when indictment alleged value of only\nsome of the items); Clark v. People, 2 Ill. 117, 120–121\n(1833) (arson indictment must allege value of destroyed\nbuilding because statute imposed “a fine equal in value to\nthe property burned”); State v.

Woodruff, 68 F. 536, 538 (Kan. 1895) (“[T]he\ndefendant is entitled to his constitutional right of trial by\njury” to ascertain “the exact sum for which a fine may be\nimposed”).6\n  The rule that juries must determine facts that set a\n\n——————\n  6 The dissent believes these decisions are inapposite because some of\n\nthem arose in States that authorized juries, rather than judges, to im-\npose sentence. See post, at 18–20. But this fact was not the basis of\nthe decisions; rather, the courts required value to be alleged and proved\nto the jury because “the extent of the punishment . . . depend[s] upon\nthe value of the property consumed or injured.” Ritchey, 7 Blackf.,\nat 169; see also, e.g., Clark, 2 Ill., at 120–121 (same). And as Bishop\nexplained, this requirement of proof originated not from a unique fea-\nture of jury sentencing, but from longstanding common-law princi-\nples—a point to which the dissent notably does not respond. 1 J.\nBishop, Criminal Procedure §§81, 540 (2d ed. 1872). See infra, at 12.\n  Nor, for that matter, do larceny cases “presen[t] a special circum-\nstance.” Post, at 20. Such decisions invoked the same reasoning as the\nother cases just mentioned. See, e.g., Hope, 50 Mass., at 137 (value\nmust be proved because, among other things, “[o]ur statutes . . . pre-\nscribe the punishment for larceny . . . with reference to the value of the\nproperty stolen”); Goodrich, 46 N. H., at 188 (same). Bishop made this\npoint explicit: “[Value] must be alleged wherever it is an element to\nbe considered by the court in determining the punishment, and it is\nimmaterial whether the particular crime is larceny or any other crime.”\nCriminal Procedure §541, at 331 (footnote omitted and emphasis\nadded). At the end of the day, the only evidence the dissent musters\nthat judges found fine-enhancing facts are United States v. Tyler, 7\nCranch 285 (1812), and one lower-court decision restating Tyler’s\nholding. See post, at 15–17. We address Tyler below. See infra, at\n13–14.\n12        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfine’s maximum amount is an application of the “two\nlongstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurispru-\ndence” on which Apprendi is based: First, “the ‘truth of\nevery accusation’ against a defendant ‘should afterwards\nbe confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his\nequals and neighbours.’ ” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 301 (quot-\ning 4 Blackstone 343). And second, “ ‘an accusation which\nlacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to\nthe punishment is . . . no accusation within the require-\nments of the common law, and it is no accusation in rea-\nson.’ ” 542 U. S., at 301–302 (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Crimi-\nnal Procedure §87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)). Indeed, Bishop’s\nleading treatise on criminal procedure specifically identi-\nfied cases involving fines as evidence of the proposition\nthat “the indictment must, in order to inform the court\nwhat punishment to inflict, contain an averment of every\nparticular thing which enters into the punishment.” Id.,\n§540, at 330 (discussing Clark and Garner). This princi-\nple, Bishop explained, “pervades the entire system of the\nadjudged law of criminal procedure. It is not made appar-\nent to our understandings by a single case only, but by\nall the cases.” Criminal Procedure §81, at 51. See also Ap-\nprendi, 530 U. S., at 510–511 (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(explaining that Bishop grounded this principle in “well-\nestablished common-law practice . . . and in the provisions\nof Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing notice of\nan accusation in all criminal cases, indictment by a grand\njury for serious crimes, and trial by jury”).\n   As counterevidence that juries historically did not de-\ntermine facts relevant to criminal fines, the Government\npoints to two decisions from this Court. One is United\nStates v. Murphy, 16 Pet. 203 (1842), which considered\nwhether an interested witness was competent to testify in\na larceny prosecution brought under a provision of the\nCrimes Act of 1790. Murphy’s only relevance to this case\nis that the Crimes Act authorized a fine of up to four times\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe value of the stolen property, and the Court remarked\nthat “the fine is, as to its amount, purely in the discretion\nof the Court.” Id., at 209. But this statement is best\nread as permitting the court to select a fine from within\nthe maximum authorized by jury-found facts—a practice,\nas noted, that accords with Apprendi. Such a reading is\nconsistent with the fact that the indictment in Murphy\nalleged the value of the stolen items, see 16 Pet., at 207–\n208, and with the practice of contemporary courts address-\ning the same statute, see United States v. Holland, 26\nF. Cas. 343, 345 (No. 15,378) (CC SDNY 1843) (trial court\ninstructs jury “to assess the value of the property taken”\nin order to determine maximum fine); Pye v. United\nStates, 20 F. Cas. 99 (No. 11,488) (CC DC 1842) (value of\nstolen items alleged in indictment).\n  The Government and dissent place greater reliance on\nUnited States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812). But like\nMurphy, this decision involved no constitutional question.\nRather, it construed a federal embargo statute that im-\nposed a fine of four times the value of the property intended\nto be exported. The indictment identified the property at\nissue as “pearl-ashes,” but the jury’s guilty verdict re-\nferred instead to “ ‘pot-ashes [that] were worth two hun-\ndred and eighty dollars.’ ” Tyler, 7 Cranch, at 285.7 The\nquestion was whether the discrepancy rendered the ver-\ndict “not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property\ncharged in the indictment,” i.e., pearl-ashes. Ibid. The\nCourt held that the discrepancy was immaterial, on the\nground that “under this law, no valuation by the jury was\n——————\n  7 We will not keep the reader in suspense: pot-ash and pearl-ash are\n\nalkaline salts of differing causticity that “for a long time . . .

Townsend, Principles and Observations\nApplied to the Manufacture and Inspection of Pot and Pearl Ashes 3\n(1793).

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to enable the Circuit Court to impose the proper\nfine.” Ibid. The Court’s reasoning is somewhat opaque,\nbut appears to rest on the text of the embargo statute,\nwhich directed that the defendant “shall, upon conviction,\nbe . . . fined a sum by the Court.” Ibid. In any event,\nnothing in the decision purports to construe the Sixth\nAmendment. And, insofar as Tyler reflects prevailing\npractice, it bears noting that both the indictment and ver-\ndict identified the value of the property at issue. See\nTr. 2 in Tyler, 7 Cranch 285, reprinted in Appellate Case\nFiles of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1792–\n1831, National Archives Microfilm Publications No. 214\n(1962), roll 18 (indictment: “nineteen barrels of pearlashes,\nwhich were then and there of the value of six hundred\ndollars”). Whatever the precise meaning of this decision,\nit does not outweigh the ample historical evidence showing\nthat juries routinely found facts that set the maximum\namounts of fines.\n                              III\n   The Government’s remaining arguments, echoed by the\ndissent (see post, at 23–28), are unpersuasive. The Gov-\nernment first submits that, when it comes to fines, “the\njudicially found facts typically involve only quantifying\nthe harm caused by the defendant’s offense”—for example,\nhow long did the violation last, or how much money did the\ndefendant gain (or the victim lose)?—“as opposed to de-\nfining a separate set of acts for punishment.” Brief for\nUnited States 25. Only the latter determination, the\nGovernment contends, implicates Apprendi’s concerns.\n   This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an\nassumption that Apprendi and its progeny have uniformly\nrejected: that in determining the maximum punishment\nfor an offense, there is a constitutionally significant differ-\nence between a fact that is an “element” of the offense and\none that is a “sentencing factor.” See, e.g., 530 U. S., at\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n478; Ring, 536 U. S., at 605. Second, we doubt the coher-\nence of this distinction. This case proves the point. Under\n42 U. S. C. §6928(d), the fact that will ultimately deter-\nmine the maximum fine Southern Union faces is the num-\nber of days the company violated the statute. Such a\nfinding is not fairly characterized as merely “quantifying\nthe harm” Southern Union caused. Rather, it is a deter-\nmination that for each given day, the Government has\nproved that Southern Union committed all of the acts\nconstituting the offense.\n   The Government next contends that applying Apprendi\nto fines will prevent States and the Federal Government\nfrom enacting statutes that, like §6928(d), calibrate fines\nto a defendant’s culpability, thus providing just punish-\nment and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity.\nBut the Government presents a false choice. As was true\nin our prior Apprendi cases, and remains so here, legisla-\ntures are free to enact statutes that constrain judges’\ndiscretion in sentencing—Apprendi requires only that\nsuch provisions be administered in conformance with the\nSixth Amendment.\n   Last, the Government argues that requiring juries to\ndetermine facts related to fines will cause confusion (be-\ncause expert testimony might be needed to guide the\ninquiry); or prejudice the defendant (who might have to\ndeny violating a statute while simultaneously arguing\nthat any violation was minimal); or be impractical (at\nleast when the relevant facts are unknown or unknowable\nuntil the trial is completed).8 These arguments rehearse\n——————\n  8 In this vein, the dissent speculates that today’s decision may\n\n“nudg[e] our [criminal justice] system” further in favor of plea bargains\nat the expense of jury trials. Post, at 28. But groups representing the\ninterests of defendants—whom the dissent’s rule purportedly favors—\ntell us the opposite is true. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the\nUnited States of America et al. as Amici Curiae 5 (“[E]xempting crimi-\nnal fines from Apprendi makes innocent defendants more likely to\n16           SOUTHERN UNION CO. v.

Here, as there, they\nmust be rejected. For even if these predictions are ac-\ncurate, the rule the Government espouses is unconstitu-\ntional. That “should be the end of the matter.” Blakely, 542\nU. S., at 313.\n   But here there is particular reason to doubt the strength\nof these policy concerns. Apprendi is now more than a\ndecade old. The reliance interests that underlie many of\nthe Government’s arguments are by this point attenuated.\nNor, in our view, does applying Apprendi’s rule to criminal\nfines mark an unexpected extension of the doctrine. Most\nCircuits to have addressed the issue already embrace this\nposition, see Pfaff, 619 F. 3d, at 175–176; LaGrou Distri-\nbution Sys., 466 F. 3d, at 594; United States v. Yang, 144\nFed.

See id., at 523–554\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 555–556 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting); see also United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.\n220, 327 (2005) (BREYER, J., dissenting in part) (citing\ncases); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 329 (2004)\n2         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(BREYER, J., dissenting) (same). The Apprendi dissenters\nargued that the law had long distinguished between (1)\nfacts that constitute elements of the offense and (2) facts\nrelevant only to sentencing. The term “elements of the\noffense” means “constituent parts of a crime . . . that the\nprosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 597 (9th ed. 2009). The statute that cre­\nates the crime in question typically sets forth those con­\nstituent parts. And a jury must find the existence of\neach such element “beyond a reasonable doubt.” See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re\nWinship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).\n   Thus, a bank robbery statute might prohibit an offender\nfrom (1) taking by force or by intimidation (2) in the pres­\nence of another person (3) a thing of value (4) belonging to,\nor in custody of, a bank. In that case, the jury can convict\nonly if it finds the existence of each of these four factual\n“elements” beyond a reasonable doubt. But it need not\nfind other facts beyond a reasonable doubt, for these four\nfactual elements alone constitute the crime.\n   Other facts may be relevant to the length or kind of\nsentence the court will impose upon a convicted offender.\nThese sentencing facts typically characterize the manner\nin which the offender carried out the crime or set forth\nrelevant features characterizing the offender. For exam­\nple, in respect to manner, an offender might have carried\nout a particular bank robbery\n    “with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hid­\n    den (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely\n    warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up\n    (or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at\n    night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for\n    other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of\n    a few (or many) other robbers . . . .” United States\n    Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.3,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The Apprendi dissenters\nconcluded that the Constitution did not require the jury\nto find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Rather the law, through its rules, statutes, and\nthe Constitution’s Due Process Clause would typically offer\nthe defendant factfinding protection. See, e.g., Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 32 (federal presentence report prepared by\nprobation office sets forth facts, which defendant may\ncontest at sentencing proceeding); Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U. S. 224, 239–247 (1998) (constitu­\ntional inquiry).\n   The dispute in Apprendi and its line of cases arose after\nCongress and many States codified these sentencing facts\nduring the sentencing reform movement of the 1970’s and\n1980’s. Congress, for example, concluded that too many\ndifferent judges were imposing too many different sen­\ntences upon too many similar offenders who had com-\nmitted similar crimes in similar ways. It subsequently\nenacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, creating a\nfederal Sentencing Commission which would produce greater\nuniformity in sentencing through the promulgation of\nmandatory uniform Guidelines structuring how judges, in\nordinary cases, should typically use sentencing facts to\ndetermine sentences. 28 U. S. C. §§991, 994 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV); see also 18 U. S. C. §§3553(b)(1), 3742(e). The\nApprendi-line majority agreed that, where a statute set a\nhigher maximum sentence, a Commission might structure\nhow a judge found sentencing facts relevant to the sen­\n4         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntence imposed below that otherwise applicable maximum,\nat least if the resulting guidelines were not mandatory.\nSee Booker, 543 U. S., at 245. But the majority held that\nwhere a sentencing fact increased the otherwise applicable\nmaximum penalty, that fact had to be found by a jury.\nApprendi, 530 U. S., at 490.\n  As I have said, the dissenters thought that the Sixth\nAmendment did not require a jury to find any of these\nsentencing facts. Why, asked the dissenters, should Con­\ngress’ or a State’s desire for greater sentencing uniformity\nachieved through statutes seeking more uniform treat­\nment (of similar offenders committing similar offenses in\nsimilar ways) suddenly produce new Sixth Amendment\njury trial requirements?\n  Those requirements would work against greater sen­\ntencing fairness. To treat all sentencing facts (where so\nspecified in a statute or rule) as if they were elements of\nthe offense could lead Congress simply to set high maxi­\nmum ranges for each crime, thereby avoiding Appren-\ndi’s jury trial requirement. Alternatively, Congress might\nenact statutes that more specifically tied particular pun­\nishments to each crime (limiting or removing judicial\ndiscretion), for example, mandatory minimum statutes.\nBut this system would threaten disproportionality by in-\nsisting that similar punishments be applied to very dif­\nferent kinds of offense behavior or offenders. Apprendi’s\njury trial requirements might also prove unworkable. Con-\nsider the difficulty of juries’ having to find the differ-\nent facts in the bank robbery example I have set forth\nabove. Moreover, how is a defendant, arguing that he did\nnot have a gun, alternatively to argue that, in any event,\nhe did not fire the gun?\n  Finally, the dissenters took a different view of Sixth\nAmendment history. They believed that under the com­\nmon law and at the time the Constitution was ratified,\njudges, not juries, often found sentencing facts, i.e., facts\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelevant only to the determination of the offender’s pun­\nishment. See, e.g., Booker, supra, at 329 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting in part); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 527–529\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting).\n  The dissenters lost the argument. The Court in Ap-\nprendi held that (other than the fact of a prior conviction)\n“any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 490.\nBut the dissenters’ views help to explain why I continue to\nbelieve this Court should not extend Apprendi’s rule be­\nyond “ ‘the central sphere of [its] concern.’ ” Ice, 555 U. S.,\nat 172 (quoting Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270,\n295 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). That is the Court’s\nview, too, as set forth in Ice. And I base my dissent here\nprimarily upon Ice.\n                            II\n  This case involves sentencing facts, not elements of a\ncrime. The criminal statute at issue constitutes one part\nof the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976\n(RCRA), which, among others things, authorizes the Envi­\nronmental Protection Agency to create a list of hazardous\nwastes. 42 U. S. C. §6921. The criminal statute says:\n    “Any person who . . . knowingly treats, stores, or dis­\n    poses of any hazardous waste identified or listed un­\n    der [RCRA] . . . without [an RCRA-authorized] permit\n    . . . shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not\n    more than $50,000 for each day of violation, or im­\n    prisonment not to exceed . . . five years . . . , or both.”\n    §6928(d)(2)(A).\nNo one here denies that this statute creates a crime with\nfour elements: (1) knowing treatment, storage, or disposal\nof a waste (2) that is hazardous, (3) without a permit, and\n(4) knowing that the waste has a substantial potential of\n6         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncausing harm to others or to the environment. App. 129–\n130; see Brief for Petitioner 30.\n   The number of “day[s] of each violation,” however, is not\nan additional element of the crime. The statute says that\nthe number of days becomes relevant only “upon convic­\ntion” of the crime as previously defined. Moreover, the\nnumber of days is relevant to application of only one of\ntwo kinds of punishment that the statute mentions (fine\nand imprisonment); one cannot easily read this statute as\ncreating two separate crimes identical but for the punish­\nment. Finally, Congress did not include here, as it some­\ntimes has done, statutory words such as “each day of\nviolation shall constitute a separate offense.” E.g., 47\nU. S. C. §223(b); see also 42 U. S. C. §4910(b). Rather, as\nin many other similar statutes, the statute here sets forth\nthe crime and kinds of punishments (fine and imprison­\nment), while separately specifying facts that determine\nthe maximum punishment of one kind (fines).\n   In this particular case, the indictment set forth a viola­\ntion period of 762 days (from “on or about September 19,\n2002 until on or about October 19, 2004”). App. 104. The\njury’s guilty verdict did not specify the number of days on\nwhich the defendant committed the offense. Id., at 141.\nBut after the conviction and sentencing hearing, the judge\nfound that, among other things, the “clear and essentially\nirrefutable evidence” at trial supported the conclusion set\nforth in the presentence report, namely, that the maxi­\nmum fine available amounted to $50,000 per day for 762\ndays—or $38.1 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a–48a.\nThe judge imposed a fine of $6 million along with a $12\nmillion community service obligation. App. 162–163.\n                           III\n  Apprendi says that “any fact that increases the penalty\nfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\nmust be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reason­\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490. The number of days (be­\nyond one) on which the defendant violated this criminal\nstatute is such a fact. Nonetheless, like the majority, I\nbelieve that Apprendi’s rule does not automatically control\nthe outcome in this case.\n   That is because this case concerns a fine, not, as in\nApprendi, a term of imprisonment. And we made clear in\nOregon v. Ice, 555 U. S. 160, that Apprendi does not en­\ncompass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision\nthat increases the statutory maximum. In Ice, we consid­\nered Apprendi’s application to a sentencing decision about\nwhether two prison sentences for conviction of two sepa­\nrate crimes (e.g., illegal drug possession and illegal gun\npossession) would run concurrently or consecutively. 555\nU. S., at 163. An Oregon statute required a concurrent\nsentence unless the sentencing judge found certain facts.\nId., at 165. Those facts could make a large difference in a\nterm of imprisonment. Their presence could mean that a\n5-year sentence for illegal drug possession and a 5-year\nsentence for illegal gun possession would amount to 10\nyears of imprisonment rather than 5 (indeed, in Ice itself,\nthe judge’s factfinding increased the sentence by 20 years,\nsee id., at 166, and n. 5). Thus, the presence of those\n“fact[s]” could “increas[e] the penalty” beyond what would\notherwise be “the prescribed statutory maximum.” Id., at\n167 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nonetheless, we\nheld that the Sixth Amendment permitted a judge—it did\nnot require a jury—to make that factual determination.\nId., at 164.\n   We consequently concluded that Apprendi does not\nencompass every kind of fact-related sentencing decision\nthat increases the statutory maximum. In doing so, we\nwrote that the “animating principle” of Apprendi’s rule\n“is the preservation of the jury’s historic role as a bul-\nwark between the State and the accused at the trial for\nan alleged offense.” 555 U. S., at 168. And we refused\n8         SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto extend Apprendi’s rule to a new category of sentence­\nrelated facts for two basic reasons.\n   First, we considered a historical question, namely,\nwhether “the finding of a particular fact was understood\nas within ‘the domain of the jury . . . by those who framed\nthe Bill of Rights.’ ” 555 U. S., at 168 (quoting Harris, 536\nU. S., at 557). And we read the “historical record” as\nshowing that “in England before the founding of our Na­\ntion, and in the early American States,” the jury “played\nno role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively\nor concurrently.” 555 U. S., at 168–169 (footnote omitted).\nRather, that decision “rested exclusively with the judge.”\nId., at 168.\n   Second, recognizing that “administration of a discrete\ncriminal justice system is among the [States’] basic sover­\neign prerogatives,” we considered the need to “respect . . .\nstate sovereignty.” Ibid. We expressed concern lest appli­\ncation of Apprendi to this kind of decision inhibit state\nlegislative efforts to establish a fairer sentencing system\nby helping to bring about more uniform sentencing. Ice,\n555 U. S., at 171. We concluded that “[n]either Apprendi\nnor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacket­\ning the States” in this respect. Ibid.\n   This case presents another new category of fact-related\nsentencing decisions, namely, decisions about the amount\nof a fine. Thus, as the majority recognizes, we must be-\ngin with a historical question. Ante, at 8. Who—judge or\njury—found the facts that determine the amount of a\ncriminal fine “in England before the founding of our\nNation, and in the early American States?” Ice, supra, at\n169 (footnote omitted). Unlike the majority, I believe\nthe answer to this question is that, in most instances, the\njudge made that determination.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Apprendi relied heavily upon the fact that in “England\nbefore the founding of our Nation” the prescribed punish­\nment for more serious crimes, i.e., felonies, was typically\nfixed—indeed, fixed at death. 530 U. S., at 478–480; see J.\nBaker, An Introduction to English Legal History 512 (4th\ned. 2007); J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England,\n1660–1800, pp. 409, 450–451 (1986) (hereinafter Beattie);\nLangbein, The English Criminal Trial on the Eve of the\nFrench Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France,\nGermany 1700–1900, pp. 13, 16, 36–37 (A. Schioppa ed.\n1987). The facts related to the application of that pun­\nishment were typically elements of the crime. And the\njury, not the judge, determined the existence of those\nfacts. See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also\nBaker, supra, at 512–518 (in practice, the jury or judge\ncould ameliorate capital punishment through application\nof doctrines such as “pious perjury,” “benefit of clergy,”\nand reprieves, or the King could grant a royal pardon);\nBeattie 419–435 (same).\n   Punishment for lesser crimes, however, included fines.\nAnd under the common law, the judge, not the jury, de­\ntermined the amount of the fine and the sentencing facts\nrelevant to the setting of that amount. See Baker, supra,\nat 512; Beattie 459. Pertinent sentencing facts typically\nconcerned the manner in which the offender committed\nthe crime and the characteristics of that offender. See id.,\nat 456–460. Thus, in 1769, Blackstone wrote:\n    “Our statute law has not therefore often ascertained\n    the quantity of fines, nor the common law ever; it di­\n    recting such an offense to be punished by fine, in gen­\n    eral, without specifying the certain sum.” Blackstone\n    372 (emphasis added).\n10        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nThat is because\n     “the quantum, in particular, of pecuniary fines neither\n     can, nor ought to be, ascertained by any invariable\n     law. The value of money itself changes from a thou­\n     sand causes; and, at all events, what is ruin to one\n     man’s fortune, may be a matter of indifference to an­\n     other.” Id., at 371.\nMoreover, the “quantum” of pecuniary fines\n     “must frequently vary, from aggravations or otherwise\n     of the offense [i.e., the manner in which the crime was\n     committed], the quality and conditions of the parties\n     [e.g., the offender’s characteristics], and from innu­\n     merable other circumstances.” Ibid.\n   Similarly, the 18th-century statesman and treatise­\nwriter Baron Auckland pointed out that in 10th-century\nEngland pre-Norman law had attached a fixed financial\npenalty to each specific crime. Principles of Penal Law 69\n(2d ed. 1771). That law, for example, imposed a penalty of\n3 cows for perjury and 12 cows for the rape of a maid.\nIbid. This system, Baron Auckland added, ignored varia­\ntions in, for example, the differing value of a fixed fine, say\na cow, over time and among individuals; it also ignored\nthe manner in which the offense was committed and the\ncharacteristics of the offender. Id., at 69–72. For those\nreasons, 18th-century English law ordinarily left “the\nquantum of the fine” to “the discretion of the Judges.” Id.,\nat 68 (emphasis deleted).\n     “[Because t]he enormity and tendency of the crime,\n     the malice and wilfulness of the intention, the incon­\n     siderateness and suddenness of the act, the age, facul­\n     ties, and fortune of the offender, form a chain of\n     complex questions; which can be resolved only by\n     the evidence of each separate charge, and for which no\n     human foresight can provide . . . then arises a neces­\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Stat. at Large 440 (forbidding “excessive\nFines”); Magna Carta §20, 9 Hen. III, §14, in 1 Eng. Stat.\nat Large 5 (1225) (fine cannot deprive offender of means of\nlivelihood); see Auckland, supra, at 73 (so interpreting\nMagna Carta); Blackstone 372–373 (same).\n   To be sure, the jury, not the judge, would determine the\nfacts that made up the elements of the crime, even though\nthose elements might be relevant to whether a fine could\napply and, if so, the amount of the fine imposed as well.\nThe common law, for example, defined larceny as the theft\nof goods that had some intrinsic value and divided the\noffense into grand larceny, which was theft of goods val­\nued at more than a shilling, and petit larceny, which was\ntheft of goods worth less than a shilling. Blackstone 229–\n234; Langbein, supra, at 16–17; see also Beattie 424\n(whether “benefit of clergy” was available depended on\nvalue stolen). Consequently, the jury would determine the\nvalue of the goods in question. In doing so, the jury might\n“manipulate the sentence by valuing the goods at under a\nshilling and thereby spare the defendant the capital sanc­\ntion.” Lillquist, The Puzzling Return of Jury Sentencing:\nMisgivings About Apprendi, 82 N. C. L. Rev. 621, 636\n(2004). But otherwise “the jury could not influence what\nother penalties” like fines the defendant might face be­\ncause in “non-capital criminal cases” the amount of pun­\nishment “was left solely in the hands of the justices.” Ibid.\n   I cannot determine with any certainty the extent to\nwhich 18th-century law placed other relevant limitations\nupon the judges’ authority to determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts. I have found an 1814 English treatise on\n12        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncriminal pleading that says, unlike in cases “where to\nconstitute the offence the value must [only] be of a certain\namount,” in cases “where the offence, or its defined meas­\nure of punishment, depends upon the quantity of that\nexcess . . . a variance from the amount averred . . . will be\nfatal.” 1 T. Starkie, A Treatise on Criminal Pleading 187–\n188 (emphasis deleted). It then adds that “in the case of\nusury, where the judgment depends upon the quantum\ntaken, the usurious contract must be averred according to\nthe fact; and a variance from it, in evidence, would be\nfatal, because the penalty is apportioned to the value.”\nId., at 188. And an 18th-century treatise says that it\nis questionable whether it is necessary “to set forth the\nValue of the Goods in an Indictment of Trespass for any\nother Purpose than to aggravate the Fine.” 2 W. Hawkins,\nA Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown, ch. 25, §75, pp. 234–\n235 (3d ed. 1739) (emphasis added). One might read these\nstatements as supporting the majority, for they might in-\ndicate that, where a statute sets forth facts that deter­\nmine a pecuniary penalty, then a jury, not judge, would\ndetermine those facts.\n  But whether that is the correct reading is unclear. For\none thing, prosecutions for economic crimes were usually\nbrought by injured parties and the “fine” in such cases\nwent in whole or in part to compensate that party for\ndamages. See Beattie 35–36, 192. For example, immedi­\nately following the sentence I have just quoted, Hawkins\nwrote that it is questionable whether it is necessary “to set\nforth the Value of the Goods . . . in an Indictment of Lar­\nceny for any other Purpose than to sh[o]w that the Crime\namounts to grand Larceny, and to ascertain the Goods,\nthereby the better to [e]ntitle the Prosecutor to a Resti-\ntution.” Hawkins, supra, at 234–235 (emphasis added;\nfootnote omitted). Likewise, Blackstone dated English\nusury law back to a 1545 statute that provided as the\npenalty that the offending lender shall both “make f[i]ne\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n. . . at the King’s will and pleasure” and forfeit “treble\nvalue” of the money borrowed—with half to the King and\nthe other half “to him or them that will sue for the same.”\n37 Hen. VIII, ch. 9, in 3 Stat. of Realm 997 (emphasis\nadded); see Blackstone 156; see also M. Ord, An Essay\non the Law of Usury 122–123 (3d ed. 1809) (treble-value\nforfeitures recovered through information qui tam but dis-\ncretionary fines recovered through criminal indictment).\nThus, the statutes at issue were what American courts\nwould later call quasi-civil statutes—part civil, part crimi­\nnal; see also Beattie 457.\n    Parliament consequently would have had a special rea­\nson for requiring jury determinations of the amount of\nthe pecuniary penalty. And Parliament had the authority\nto depart from the common law and to insist that juries\ndetermine sentencing facts without establishing a generally\napplicable principle. The relevant question here is how\noften and for what purposes Parliament did so. Black­\nstone himself wrote that such statutes fixing fines in\namounts were both in derogation of the common law and\nuncommon. Blackstone 372. Finally, no one here argues\nthat we adopt the rule actually suggested by the treatises.\nThat rule is not that sentencing is to be done according to\nvalue found by the jury but instead that a discrepancy\nbetween the value alleged and value found by the jury\nmight render the entire case fatal. See Starkie, supra,\nat 188.\n    Thus, I cannot place great weight upon these statutes.\nThe parties did not refer to them in their briefs. And in\nany event, the historical sources taken together make\nclear that the predominant practice in 18th-century Eng­\nland was for a judge, not a jury, to find sentencing facts\nrelated to the imposition of a fine.\n    Indeed, the Court in Apprendi conceded the point. It\ndistinguished 18th-century punishments for greater\ncrimes (fixed punishments) from punishments for lesser\n14        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncrimes (included fines). 530 U. S., at 480, n. 7. And it\nwrote that “judges most commonly imposed discretionary\n‘sentences’ of fines . . . upon misdemeanants.” Ibid. (em­\nphasis added). Insofar as 18th-century English practice\nhelps determine what the Framers would have thought\nabout the scope of the Constitution’s terms—here, the\nSixth Amendment’s right to trial by an impartial jury—\nthat practice suggests they would not have expected that\nright to include determination of sentencing facts relevant\nonly to the imposition of a fine.\n                              B\n   Practice in the “early American States” is even less am-\nbiguous. In the colonial era, judges would normally\ndetermine the amount of a fine (within an unlimited or\notherwise broad range) while also determining related\nsentencing facts (say, about the manner in which the\noffender committed the crime and the offender’s character­\nistics). Legal historians tell us that in the American\ncolonies a criminal fine was “overwhelmingly the most\ncommon of the non-capital punishments,” that in most\ninstances the range of the fine was “apparently without\nlimit except insofar as it was within the expectation of the\ncourt that it would be paid,” that the judge established the\nprecise amount of the fine, and that the amount was “tai­\nlored individually to the particular case.” Preyer, Penal\nMeasures in the American Colonies: An Overview, 26 Am.\nJ. Legal Hist. 326, 350 (1982). “[C]olonial judges, like\ntheir English brethren, possessed a great deal of discre­\ntion” and could set the amount of fine “depending upon\nthe nature of the defendant and the crime.” Lillquist, 82\nN. C. L. Rev., at 640–641.\n   Enactment of the Constitution and Bill of Rights did not\nchange this practice. Some early American statutes speci­\nfied that the judge has discretion to set the amount of the\nfine while saying nothing about amount. E.g., Crimes Act\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof 1790, ch. 9, §21, 1 Stat. 117 (any person who bribes a\njudge “on conviction thereof shall be fined and imprisoned\nat the discretion of the court”); §28, 1 Stat. 118 (any per­\nson who does violence to an ambassador or public min-\nister, “on conviction, shall be imprisoned not exceeding\nthree years, and fined at the discretion of the court”).\nOthers set only a maximum limitation. E.g., Act of Mar. 3,\n1791, ch. 15, §39, 1 Stat. 208 (officer of inspection con-\nvicted of oppression or extortion “shall be fined not exceed-\ning five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six\nmonths, or both, at the discretion of the court”). In respect\nto these statutes, Justice Iredell wrote in 1795 that the\n“common law practice . . . must be adhered to; that is to\nsay, the jury are to find whether the prisoner be guilty,\nand . . . the court must assess the fine.” United States v.\nMundell, 27 F. Cas. 23, 24 (No. 15,834) (CC Va.).\n   Still other statutes, as in England, specifically keyed the\namount of the fine to a specific factual finding. A section\nof the Crimes Act of 1790, for example, said that any\nperson who upon United States property or the high seas\n“shall take and carry away, with an intent to steal or\npurloin the personal goods of another . . . shall, on convic­\ntion, be fined not exceeding the fourfold value of the prop­\nerty so stolen.” §16, 1 Stat. 116. This crime has several\nelements: (1) taking and (2) carrying away (3) with intent\nto steal (4) personal goods (5) belonging to another (6) on\nUnited States property or the high seas. The jury must\nfind the existence of these facts beyond a reasonable doubt\nto establish a conviction. But the statute also says that\nthe fine cannot exceed “the fourfold value of the property\nso stolen.” And it thereby requires the finding of a sen­\ntencing fact, namely the value of the stolen property. Who\nwould make this determination—judge or jury?\n   Unlike in 18th-century England, in the United States\nthere is case law directly answering the question. In\nUnited States v. Tyler, 7 Cranch 285 (1812), this Court\n16        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconsidered a federal embargo statute making it a crime to\n“put” certain “goods” on board a ship with intent to “ex­\nport” them outside of the United States. See Act of Jan. 9,\n1809, ch. 5, §1, 2 Stat. 506. The statute also provided\nthat an offender’s “goods” and ship “shall be forfeited,” and\nthe offender, “shall, upon conviction,” be “fined a sum, by\nthe court before which the conviction is had, equal to four\ntimes the value of such specie, goods, wares and merchan­\ndise.” Ibid. The statute thereby required determination of\na sentencing fact, namely “the value of such . . . goods.”\nWas the finding of this sentencing fact for the judge or for\nthe jury?\n   In Tyler, the defendant had been indicted for attempting\nto export 19 barrels of pearl-ashes, valued at $600. Ante,\nat 13–14. The jury convicted the defendant, but when\ndoing so, it said that it found the defendant guilty of hav­\ning tried to export “ ‘pot-ashes . . . worth two hundred and\neighty dollars.’ ” 7 Cranch, at 285 (emphasis deleted). The\ndefendant appealed, claiming a difference between the\njury’s basis for conviction and the crime as charged in the\nindictment. The difference between the words “pearl­\nashes” and “pot-ashes” is unlikely to have mattered, for\npearl-ash is simply a refined grade of pot-ash (potassium\ncarbonate). See T. Barker, R. Dickinson, & D. Hardie,\nOrigins of the Synthetic Alkali Industry in Britain, 23\nEconomica 158, 163 (1956). Thus, the defendant did not\nfocus upon that difference. Rather, he claimed that the\njury’s verdict “was not sufficiently certain as to the value\nof the property charged in the indictment.” Tyler, 7\nCranch, at 285 (emphasis added). Because $280 differs\nfrom $600, the jury had not found him guilty of the crime\ncharged.\n   The Supreme Court, however, found that the jury’s\nfinding as to valuation was not relevant. It upheld the\nconviction because it was “of the opinion that, under this\nlaw, no valuation by the jury was necessary to enable the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCircuit Court to impose the proper fine.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). The Court did not say explicitly that the Sixth\nAmendment permitted the judge to find the relevant sen­\ntencing fact. See ante, at 14. But it seems unlikely\nthat a Court that included Chief Justice John Marshall,\nJustice Joseph Story, and others familiar with both the\ncommon law and the Constitution would have interpreted\na federal statute as they did if either contemporary legal\npractice or the Constitution suggested or required a differ­\nent interpretation.\n  Nor can we say that the Court did not fully consider the\nmatter. Justice Story later authoritatively interpreted\nTyler. Sitting as a Circuit Justice in United States v.\nMann, 26 F. Cas. 1153 (No. 15,717) (CCNH 1812), he\nconsidered the same judge/jury question in respect to the\nsame embargo statute. His court wrote that in “Tyler, 7\nCranch 285, in a prosecution on this same clause, the court\nheld that the fine and quadruple value must be assessed\nand adjudged by the court, and not by the jury.” Id., at\n1153 (emphasis added); see also 26 F. Cas. 1153, 1155\n(No. 15,718) (CCNH 1812) (Story, J.) (noting that the Su-\npreme Court would not have reached its result unless\nsatisfied “that the fine was to be imposed by the court, and\nnot found by the jury”).\n  Thus, nothing in early American practice suggests that\nthe Framers thought that the Sixth Amendment jury trial\nright encompassed a right to have a jury determine fine­\nrelated sentencing facts. But, to the contrary, there is a\nSupreme Court opinion, namely Tyler, that holds, or at\nleast strongly indicates, the opposite.\n                          C\n  The majority reaches a different conclusion. But the\nmajority does not pose what I believe to be the relevant\nhistorical question, namely whether traditionally “in\nEngland before the founding of our Nation, and in the\n18        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nearly American States,” see Ice, 555 U. S., at 169 (footnote\nomitted), judges, not juries, normally determined fine­\nrelated sentencing facts. Instead, it asks whether a jury,\nrather than the judge, found those facts in that subclass of\ncases where a statute “peg[ged] the amount of a fine to the\ndetermination of specified facts.” Ante, at 10. It concludes\nthat “the predominant practice was for such facts to be\nalleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.” Ibid.\n   Putting the question this way invites a circular re­\nsponse. As is true of the English usury cases, nothing\nprohibits a legislature from requiring a jury to find a\nsentencing fact in a particular subset of cases. And obvi­\nously when a State does so, the jury will indeed have to\nfind those facts. Thus, if, say, 10 States decide to make\njuries find facts that will set the fine for, say, simple lar­\nceny, then jury practice in those States (during, say, the\n19th century) will include the jury’s finding of those sen­\ntencing facts. But that circumstance tells us only that in\nthose 10 States for those specific statutes the legislatures\nso required. It tells us little, if anything, about practices\nin most States, and it tells us nothing at all about tradi­\ntional practice in England or 18th-century America. Nor\ndoes a discovery that, say, 10 state legislatures once re­\nquired juries, rather than judges, generally to set fines tell\nus about the scope of the Sixth Amendment’s constitu-\ntional right to trial by jury. The matter is important be-\ncause the majority rests its conclusion almost exclusively\nupon reports of mid-19th-century jury trials in a handful of\nStates, namely Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,\nand New Hampshire, and a treatise that bases its state­\nments upon those cases. Ante, at 10–12.\n   Scholars tell us that in fact there were about 10\nStates—including Alabama, Illinois, and Indiana—that\n(after ratification of the Sixth Amendment) enacted stat­\nutes that required juries, not judges, to determine a de­\nfendant’s punishment, including not only the length of a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprison term but also the amount of a fine. See Iontcheva,\nJury Sentencing as Democratic Practice, 89 Va. L. Rev.\n311, 317 (2003); King, Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing\nin the United States 78 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 937, 963 (2003).\nThe courts that considered this practice, however, did\nnot believe that the constitutional right to jury trial com­\npelled it.\n   Alabama’s Supreme Court, for example, explained that\nits State’s jury-sentencing system, which allowed the jury\n“to determine both the fine and imprisonment,” was in\nderogation of, and created “an innovation upon[,] the rules\nof the common law, so far as it transfers [those] powers\nfrom the court to the jury.” Hawkins v. State, 3 Stew. & P.\n63 (1832). Thus, in State v. Garner, 8 Port. 447 (1839), see\nante, at 10, the malicious mischief statute at issue said\nthat the offender would “ ‘be fined in such sum as the jury\ntrying the same may assess, not exceeding four fold the\nvalue of the property injured or destroyed.’ ” 8 Port., at\n448 (emphasis added). The statute, in other words, trans­\nferred all sentencing facts to the jury and was not illus­\ntrative of 18th-century practice. Further, the statute said\nthat the “ ‘fine shall be paid to the party injured.’ ” Ibid.\nThe court held that it was consequently proper to allege\nthe amount of the property’s value in the indictment, not\nbecause the State’s constitution required any such thing,\nbut because “the fine thus assesse[d] is for the benefit of\nthe injured party”; the case “is, therefore, a quasi civil\nproceeding”; and for that reason “it would be more con-\nsonant to the rules of pleading, and to the principles\nwhich govern analogous cases, that the indictment should\ncontain an averment of the value of the property.” Ibid.;\nOrd, Law of Usury, at 122–123 (usury as quasi-civil\nproceeding).\n   Illinois law was similar.       Illinois became a jury­\nsentencing State in 1831. See Iontcheva, supra, at 317,\nn. 28 (citing Act of Feb. 15, 1831, §42, 1830 Ill. Laws 103,\n20        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n113). The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently wrote\nthat, even though “at common law . . . juries . . . never\nwere invested with the power of determining the character\nor extent of the punishment . . . , we are to be governed\nentirely the provisions and enactments of our code of\ncriminal jurisprudence.” Blevings v. People, 1 Scam. 172\n(1835). And in Clark v. People, 1 Scam. 117 (1833), see\nante, at 10, the court made clear that the arson statute at\nissue\n     “ha[d] changed the common law, . . . [that the] fine\n     equal in value to the property burne[d] is imposed as\n     part of the punishment[; hence,] [t]he indictment . . .\n     should have charged the value of the property de­\n     stroyed, [for] otherwise it could not properly have\n     been inquired into by the jury.” 1 Scam., at 117.\n   Indiana was another jury-sentencing State. Iontcheva,\nsupra, at 317, n. 28; King, supra, at 937. Indiana case law\ndecided before Indiana changed its system indicates that\nthe judge could decide certain facts required to set the\napplicable maximum fine. E.g., Morris v. State, 1 Blackf.\n37 (1819). But after Indiana became a jury-sentencing\nState, its courts held, not surprisingly, that under Indiana\nlaw the jury must determine sentencing facts. See Ritchey\nv. State, 7 Blackf. 168, 169 (1844); ante, at 10.\n   Massachusetts presents a special circumstance. The\ntwo Massachusetts cases that the majority cites, ante, at\n10–11, are larceny cases. Value traditionally was an\nelement of the crime of larceny—both because larceny was\ntheft of goods that had some intrinsic value and because\nvalue distinguished grand larceny from petit larceny—and\nthus juries traditionally had to determine at least some\nfacts about the value of the property stolen. See Black­\nstone 229, 234. Massachusetts had abolished the distinc­\ntion between grand and petit larceny before its courts\ndecided the two cases the majority cites. See Common-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           21\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. 245, 246 (1804). But those deci­\nsions nonetheless rest in significant part upon the jury’s\ntraditional larceny factfinding role. In Hope v. Common-\nwealth, 9 Metcalf 134 (1845), for example, the Massachu­\nsetts Supreme Judicial Court wrote:\n    “The well settled practice, familiar to us all, has been\n    that of stating in the indictment the value of the arti­\n    cle alleged to have been stolen. . . . The reason for re­\n    quiring this allegation and finding of value may have\n    been, originally, that a distinction might appear be­\n    tween the offences of grand and petit larceny . . . . Our\n    statutes . . . prescribe the punishment for larceny,\n    with reference to the value of the property stolen; and\n    for this reason, as well as because it is in conformity\n    with long established practice, the court are of opinion\n    that the value of the property alleged to be stolen\n    must be set forth in the indictment.” Id., at 136–137.\nThe “long established practice” to which the court refers is\nlarceny case practice, not practice in all criminal cases.\n  The New Hampshire case to which the majority refers,\nState v. Goodrich, 46 N. H. 186 (1865), ante, at 11, is also\na larceny case that relied on the “established” larceny case\npractice. The court explained:\n    “The indictment ought to state the value of the arti­\n    cles stolen that it may appear whether the offence be\n    grand or petit larceny, and such we believe is the set­\n    tled practice. . . . It has been held in some jurisdic­\n    tions, that, in case no value is alleged, the offence\n    charged may be regarded as simple larceny, and a\n    conviction be had accordingly . . . but we think it best\n    to adhere to the well established doctrine in such\n    cases . . . . It may also be suggested, that, in the case\n    of simple larceny, the respondent may be sentenced\n    to pay the owner of the goods stolen, treble the value\n    thereof, which is an additional reason for requiring\n22        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n     the character of the offence to be stated.” 46 N. H., at\n     187–188.\nThe court wrote nothing to suggest that its holding rested\non generally applicable constitutional grounds. And it was\nin the New Hampshire federal circuit court a half-century\nearlier when Justice Story had indicated that the Federal\nConstitution did not impose any such requirement. See\nMann, 26 F. Cas., at 1155 (No. 15,718).\n   That leaves the majority’s puzzling 1895 Federal Dis­\ntrict Court case from Kansas. United States v. Woodruff,\n68 F. 536 (D. Kan. 1895); ante, at 11. The circumstances\nof this case are highly unusual, and the District Court’s\nreasoning as to why no fine could be set seems to have\nrested on a combination of statutory construction and\nconstitutional principle. See Woodruff v. United States, 58\nF. 766, 767–768 (CC Kan. 1893); Woodruff, 68 F., at 538–\n539. Still, I concede this case to the majority—as the lone\nswallow that cannot make the majority’s summer.\n   Taken together, the 19th-century cases upon which the\nmajority rests its holding do not show anything about\npractice in the vast majority of States. They concede that\ncommon-law practice was to the contrary. And they tell us\nlittle about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Even\nwere that not so, I do not understand why these mid-19th­\ncentury cases should tell us more about the Constitution’s\nmeaning than, say, the common 20th-century practice\nof leaving sentencing fact determinations to the judge.\nThis Court apparently once approved the latter practice as\nconstitutional. E.g., McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.\n79 (1986); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224. And these\ncases seem more closely related to the present topic.\n                           D\n  The upshot is that both 18th-century English common\nlaw and 18th-century American law typically provided\njudges with broad discretion to assess fines. The judge,\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            23\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnot the jury, would normally determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts. In this respect, ordinary 18th-century sen­\ntencing practice related to fines was unlike sentencing\npractice in respect to felonies. In the latter case, in Ap-\nprendi’s view, punishment was normally “fixed” and the\njudge’s sentencing role was consequently minimal. 530\nU. S., at 478–480. In the former case, namely fines, the\njudge’s role was not normally minimal, but the opposite.\nFor these reasons, I believe that allowing a judge to de­\ntermine sentencing facts related to imposition of a fine\ndoes not invade the historic province of the jury. The\nhistorical test that we set forth in Ice is satisfied.\n                               V\n  In Ice, we also took account of the practical extent\nto which extending Apprendi’s rule beyond the “ ‘central\nsphere of [its] concern’ ” would “diminish” the States’ “role”\nin “devising solutions to difficult legal problems . . . absent\nimpelling reason to do so.” 555 U. S., at 171–172. In\nparticular, we feared that insisting that juries determine\nthe relevant sentencing facts (concerning concurrent, as\nopposed to consecutive, punishment) would unjustifiably\ninterfere with a State’s legislative efforts “to rein in the\ndiscretion judges possessed at common law to impose\nconsecutive sentences at will.” Id., at 171. It would in-\nhibit (indeed “straightjacke[t]”) States seeking to make\n“concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences\nthe exception.” Ibid. We said that we were “unclear how\nmany other state initiatives would fall” if Apprendi were\nextended, and that expansion would be “difficult for\nStates to administer.” Id., at 171–172. We believed that\nthese considerations argued strongly against any such\n“expansion.”\n  Here, the same kinds of considerations similarly argue\nagainst “expansion” of Apprendi’s rule. Today’s decision\napplies to the States. In the 1950’s and thereafter, States\n24        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas well as the Federal Government recognized a serious\nproblem in respect to the sentencing of corporations.\nFines, imposed as a punishment upon corporate offenders,\nwere both nonuniform (treating identical offenders differ­\nently) and too often they were set too low. Judges would\nfrequently fine corporations in amounts that failed to\napproximate the harm a corporation had caused or the\ngain that it had obtained through its illegal activity, both\nbecause often the statutory maximums were low and be-\ncause often the fines imposed tended to be substantially\nlower than those maximums. See Gruner, Towards an\nOrganizational Jurisprudence: Transforming Corporate\nCriminal Law Through Federal Sentencing Reform, 36\nAriz. L. Rev. 407, 408 (1994); Kadish, Some Observa­\ntions on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Eco­\nnomic Regulations, 30 U. Chi. L.

Q. 205, 215 (1993).\n   Consequently, the authors of the Model Penal Code\nadopted a model provision stating that, in respect to of­\nfenses involving financial gain, a court could impose an\nalternative “higher” fine “equal to double the pecuniary\ngain derived from the offense by the offender.” Model\nPenal Code §6.03(5), 10A U. L. A. 259 (2001). New York\nsoon thereafter adopted such a provision. N. Y. Penal Law\nAnn. §80.10(2)(b) (West 2009). And other States followed\nNew York’s example with similar provisions permitting\njudges to set fines equal to twice the gain to the offender\nor twice the loss to the victim, thereby helping to diminish\ndisparity while helping potential victims by increasing\ndeterrence. E.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. §53a–44 (West\n2007); Fla. Stat. §775.083(1)(f) (2010). Many of these\nstatutes say in particular that the “court” shall make the\nfinding of gain or loss, in a separate hearing if necessary.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          25\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nE.g., N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §80.00(3) (West 2009); N. J.\nStat. Ann. §2C:43–3(e) (West 2005).\n  The Federal Government followed suit. In some in­\nstances, such as RCRA, where environmental harm likely\nvaries with the length of the violation period, Congress\nadvanced its uniformity and deterrence goals by tying a\ndollar-limited fine to the length of time during which that\nviolation took place. 42 U. S. C. §6928(d)(2)(A). In other\ninstances, it did so through a new general gain-or-loss\nprovision, applying to all offenses, including such crimes\nas corporate fraud, antitrust violations, and environmen­\ntal pollution. That provision says:\n    “ALTERNATIVE FINE BASED ON GAIN OR LOSS.—If any\n    person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, or if\n    the offense results in pecuniary loss to a person other\n    than the defendant, the defendant may be fined not\n    more than the greater of twice the gross gain or twice\n    the gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this\n    subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the\n    sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C. §3571(d).\n  To apply Apprendi’s rule to the fines set forth in such\nstatutes, no less than in Ice, would weaken or destroy the\nStates’ and Federal Government’s efforts “to rein in the\ndiscretion judges possessed at common law,” Ice, 555 U. S.,\nat 171, over fines. Congress, in enacting such statutes,\nexpected judges, not juries, to determine fine-related sen­\ntencing facts because doing so will often involve highly\ncomplex determinations. Where, say, major fraud is at\nissue, the full extent of the loss (or gain) may be unknown\nat the time of indictment or at any other time prior to the\nconclusion of the trial. And in an antitrust or an environ­\nmental pollution case, the jury may have particular diffi­\nculty assessing different estimates of resulting losses.\n  The consequence of the majority’s holding, insisting that\njuries make such determinations, is likely to diminish the\n26        SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfairness of the criminal trial process. A defendant will not\nfind it easy to show the jury at trial that (1) he committed\nno environmental crime, but (2) in any event, he commit­\nted the crime only on 20 days, not 30. Moreover, the\nmajority’s holding will sometimes permit prosecutors to\nintroduce newly relevant evidence that would otherwise\nhave been kept from the jury on the ground that it was\ncumulative or unduly prejudicial. If victims’ losses are\nrelevant, the prosecutor may be able to produce witness\nafter witness testifying only about the amount of life\nsavings lost to the fraud. The defendant in this case, for\nexample, thought the introduction of evidence about the\ndiscovery of mercury and remediation and evacuation of a\nnearby apartment complex was unduly prejudicial. Brief\nfor United States 51 (citing App. 15 (defendant’s motion in\nlimine to exclude such evidence)). But even if that were\nso, that evidence might now be admitted as showing the\namount of harm caused or the number of days upon which\nthe defendant’s unlawful activity took place.\n   Administrative problems here may prove more serious\nthan where, as in Apprendi, prison terms were at stake.\nIn part, that is because corporate criminal cases often\nfocus upon complex frauds, criminal price fixing, extended\nenvironmental pollution, food-and-drug safety violations,\nand the like. Both Congress and the Sentencing Commis­\nsion have recognized as much. The federal criminal fine\nstatute to which I earlier referred specifically creates an\nexception where assessing total loss or gain “would unduly\ncomplicate or prolong the sentencing process.” 18 U. S. C.\n§3571(d). Similarly, Sentencing Guidelines applicable to\ncorporations exclude fine provisions for environmental\ncrimes (along with most crimes involving export viola­\ntions, food-and-drug safety, agricultural-and-consumer\nproducts, and RICO violations) because of the “potential\ndifficulty . . . of defining and computing loss.” Nagel &\nSwenson, supra, at 256; see USSG §8C2.1, and comment.,\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n§8C2.10. Where the defendant is a human being, the\nGovernment can avoid problems of proof simply by aban­\ndoning any effort to obtain a fine; instead, perhaps to the\nindividual defendant’s dismay, the prosecution can seek\na longer prison term. Where the criminal defendant is a\ncorporation, however, no such possibility exists.\n   If, as seems likely, it becomes too difficult to prove fine­\nrelated sentencing facts to a jury, legislatures will have\nto change their statutes. Some may choose to return to\nhighly discretionary sentencing, with its related risks of\nnonuniformity. Others may link conviction with fines\nspecified in amount, rather like the 10th-century pre-\nNorman system of three cows for perjury or more modern\nmandatory minimum penalties. As Blackstone pointed\nout, those systems produce sentences that are not propor­\ntionate; they tend to treat alike offenders who committed\nthe same crime in very different ways. See 4 Blackstone\n371–372.\n   The majority believes that 10 years of experience with\nApprendi “attenuate[s]” any legal claim of reliance on\ndifferent rule of constitutional law here. Ante, at 16.\nPerhaps so. Perhaps that experience shows that Appren-\ndi’s jury trial requirement is workable. But there is an­\nother less optimistic possibility.\n   Perhaps that experience, like the canary in a mine­\nshaft, tells us only that our criminal justice system is no\nlonger the jury-trial-based adversarial system that it once\nwas. We have noted that “[n]inety-seven percent of fed­\neral convictions and ninety-four percent of state convictions\nare the result of guilty pleas.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). We have added that today\n“ ‘plea bargaining” is “not some adjunct to the criminal\njustice system; it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract, 101\nYale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992)). And in such a system, com­\nplex jury trial requirements may affect the strength of a\n28       SOUTHERN UNION CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nparty’s bargaining position rather than the conduct of\nmany actual trials.\n  At the same time, the prosecutor in such a system,\nperhaps armed with statutes providing for mandatory\nminimum sentences, can become the ultimate adjudicator.\nThe prosecutor/adjudicator plays an important role in\nmany “European inquisitorial” systems. But those prose­\ncutors, unlike ours, typically are trained formally to be\nmore like neutral adjudicators than advocates. Cf. Lang­\nbein & Weinreb, Continental Criminal Procedure: “Myth”\nand Reality, 87 Yale L. J. 1549, 1559 (1978); see, e.g.,\nÈcole Nationale de la Magistrature. Today’s holding, by\nunnecessarily complicating the trial process, may prove\nworkable only because it nudges our system slightly fur­\nther in this direction. I see no virtue in doing so.\n  For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/802770/", "sha1": "cf773be417cb87a6245027274e10f7ef8683bfe8", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-06-21T07:13:31"}
