Argued January 10, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012\nCalifornia law permits public-sector employees in a bargaining unit to\n  decide by majority vote to create an “agency shop” arrangement un-\n  der which all the employees are represented by a union. Even em-\n  ployees who do not join the union must pay an annual fee for\n  “chargeable expenses,” i.e., the cost of nonpolitical union services re-\n  lated to collective bargaining. Under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431\n  U. S. 209, a public-sector union can bill nonmembers for chargeable\n  expenses but may not require them to fund its political or ideological\n  projects. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 302–311, sets out re-\n  quirements that a union must meet in order to collect regular fees\n  from nonmembers without violating their rights.\n    In June 2005, respondent, a public-sector union (SEIU), sent to\n  California employees its annual Hudson notice, setting and capping\n  monthly dues and estimating that 56.35% of its total expenditures in\n  the coming year would be chargeable expenses. A nonmember had 30\n  days to object to full payment of dues but would still have to pay the\n  chargeable portion. The notice stated that the fee was subject to in-\n  crease without further notice. That same month, the Governor called\n  for a special election on, inter alia, two ballot propositions opposed by\n  the SEIU. After the 30-day objection period ended, the SEIU sent a\n  letter to unit employees announcing a temporary 25% increase in\n  dues and a temporary elimination of the monthly dues cap, billing\n  the move as an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Politi-\n  cal Fight-Back Fund.” The purpose of the fund was to help achieve\n  the union’s political objectives in the special election and in the up-\n  coming November 2006 election. The union noted that the fund\n  would be used “for a broad range of political expenses, including tele-\n2                    KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    vision and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter ed-\n    ucation, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in our\n    communities across California.” Nonunion employees were not given\n    any choice as to whether they would pay into the fund.\n      Petitioners, on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into the\n    fund, brought a class action against the SEIU alleging violation of\n    their First Amendment rights. The Federal District Court granted\n    petitioners summary judgment. Ruling that the special assessment\n    was for entirely political purposes, it ordered the SEIU to send a new\n    notice giving class members 45 days to object and to provide those\n    who object a full refund of contributions to the fund. The Ninth Cir-\n    cuit reversed, concluding that Hudson prescribed a balancing test\n    under which the proper inquiry is whether the SEIU’s procedures\n    reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer,\n    and the nonmember employees.\nHeld:\n    1. This case is not moot. Although the SEIU offered a full refund to\n all class members after certiorari was granted, a live controversy re-\n mains. The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordi-\n narily render a case moot because that conduct could be resumed as\n soon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Cas-\n tle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289. Since the SEIU continues to defend the\n fund’s legality, it would not necessarily refrain from collecting similar\n fees in the future. Even if concerns about voluntary cessation were\n inapplicable because petitioners did not seek prospective relief, there\n would still be a live controversy as to the adequacy of the refund no-\n tice the SEIU sent pursuant to the District Court’s order. Pp. 6−8.\n    2. Under the First Amendment, when a union imposes a special as-\n sessment or dues increase levied to meet expenses that were not dis-\n closed when the regular assessment was set, it must provide a fresh\n notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their\n affirmative consent. Pp. 8−23.\n       (a) A close connection exists between this Nation’s commitment\n to self-government and the rights protected by the First Amendment,\n see, e.g., Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 52−53, which creates “an\n open marketplace” in which differing ideas about political, economic,\n and social issues can compete freely for public acceptance without\n improper government interference, New York State Bd. of Elections v.\n Lopez Torres, 552 U. S 196, 202. The government may not prohibit\n the dissemination of ideas it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement\n of ideas that it approves. See, e.g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,\n 382. And the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the\n purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.\n See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623.

Compulsory\nsubsidies for private speech are thus subject to exacting First\nAmendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless, first, there is a\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme involving a “mandated association”\namong those who are required to pay the subsidy, United States v.\nUnited Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, and, second, compulsory fees are\nlevied only insofar as they are a “necessary incident” of the “larger\nregulatory purpose which justified the required association,” ibid.\nPp. 8−10.\n     (b) When a State establishes an “agency shop” that exacts com-\npulsory union fees as a condition of public employment, “[t]he dis-\nsenting employee is forced to support financially an organization with\nwhose principles and demands he may disagree.” Ellis v. Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 455. This form of compelled speech and associ-\nation imposes a “significant impingement on First Amendment\nrights.” Ibid. The justification for permitting a union to collect fees\nfrom nonmembers—to prevent them from free-riding on the union’s\nefforts—is an anomaly. Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers\nto opt out of paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues―rather\nthan exempting them unless they opt in―represents a remarkable\nboon for unions, creating a risk that the fees nonmembers pay will be\nused to further political and ideological ends with which they do not\nagree. Thus, Hudson, far from calling for a balancing of rights or in-\nterests, made it clear that any procedure for exacting fees from un-\nwilling contributors must be “carefully tailored to minimize the in-\nfringement” of free speech rights, 475 U. S. 302−303, and it cited\ncases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or as-\nsociation must serve a compelling interest and must not be signifi-\ncantly broader than necessary to serve that interest. Pp. 10−13.\n     (c) There is no justification for the SEIU’s failure to provide a\nfresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers\nshould not be required to fund a union’s political and ideological pro-\njects unless they choose to do so after having “a fair opportunity” to\nassess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475\nU. S., at 303. The SEIU’s procedure cannot be considered to have\nmet Hudson’s requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully\ntailored to minimize impingement on First Amendment rights. The\nSEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assess-\nment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been\ngiven the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next\nannual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the fol-\nlowing year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special\nassessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes. But this\n4                    KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not\n    have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice. In\n    any event, even a full refund would not undo the First Amendment\n    violations, since the First Amendment does not permit a union to ex-\n    tract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later\n    paid back in full. Pp. 14−17.\n         (d) The SEIU’s treatment of nonmembers who opted out when\n    the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the First\n    Amendment. They were required to pay 56.35% of the special as-\n    sessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable,\n    electoral uses. And the SEIU’s claim that the assessment was a\n    windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is un-\n    persuasive. First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of\n    chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much re-\n    liance on its statistics. “Lobbying the electorate,” which the SEIU\n    claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for support-\n    ing political causes and candidates. Second, even if the SEIU’s sta-\n    tistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge ob-\n    jecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special\n    assessment. If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately\n    determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used\n    for an upcoming year’s chargeable purposes, there is a risk that un-\n    consenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little. That\n    risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not\n    at stake. If the nonmembers pay too much, their First Amendment\n    rights are infringed. But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right\n    of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to re-\n    ceive any payment from those employees.

SERVICE EM-\n  PLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1000\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 21, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, we decide whether the First Amendment\nallows a public-sector union to require objecting nonmem-\nbers to pay a special fee for the purpose of financing the\nunion’s political and ideological activities.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Under California law, public-sector employees in a\nbargaining unit may decide by majority vote to create an\n“agency shop” arrangement under which all the employees\nare represented by a union selected by the majority. Cal.\nGovt. Code Ann. §3502.5(a) (West 2010). While employees\nin the unit are not required to join the union, they must\nnevertheless pay the union an annual fee to cover the cost\nof union services related to collective bargaining (so-called\nchargeable expenses). See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn.,\n500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S.\n740, 760 (1961).\n   Our prior cases have recognized that such arrangements\nrepresent an “impingement” on the First Amendment\nrights of nonmembers. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292,\n2              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n307, n. 20 (1986). See also Davenport v. Washington Ed.\nAssn., 551 U. S. 177, 181 (2007) (“[A]gency-shop arrange-\nments in the public sector raise First Amendment con-\ncerns because they force individuals to contribute money\nto unions as a condition of government employment”);\nStreet, supra, at 749 (union shop presents First Amend-\nment “questions of the utmost gravity”). Thus, in Abood v.\nDetroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), we held that a\npublic-sector union, while permitted to bill nonmembers\nfor chargeable expenses, may not require nonmembers to\nfund its political and ideological projects. And in Hudson,\nwe identified procedural requirements that a union must\nmeet in order to collect fees from nonmembers without\nviolating their rights. 475 U. S., at 302–311. The First\nAmendment, we held, does not permit a public-sector\nunion to adopt procedures that have the effect of requiring\nobjecting nonmembers to lend the union money to be used\nfor political, ideological, and other purposes not germane\nto collective bargaining. Id., at 305. In the interest of\nadministrative convenience, however, we concluded that\na union “cannot be faulted” for calculating the fee that\nnonmembers must pay “on the basis of its expenses during\nthe preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.\n  Hudson concerned a union’s regular annual fees. The\npresent case, by contrast, concerns the First Amendment\nrequirements applicable to a special assessment or dues\nincrease that is levied to meet expenses that were not\ndisclosed when the amount of the regular assessment was\nset.\n                            B\n  In June 2005, respondent, the Service Employees Inter-\nnational Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), sent out its regular\nHudson notice informing employees what the agency fee\nwould be for the year ahead. The notice set monthly dues\nat 1% of an employee’s gross monthly salary but capped\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmonthly dues at $45. Based on the most recently audited\nyear, the SEIU estimated that 56.35% of its total expendi-\ntures in the coming year would be dedicated to chargeable\ncollective-bargaining activities. Thus, if a nonunion em-\nployee objected within 30 days to payment of the full\namount of union dues, the objecting employee was re-\nquired to pay only 56.35% of total dues. The SEIU’s notice\nalso included a feature that was not present in Hudson:\nThe notice stated that the agency fee was subject to in-\ncrease at any time without further notice.\n   During this time, the citizens of the State of California\nwere engaged in a wide-ranging political debate regarding\nstate budget deficits, and in particular the budget conse-\nquences of growing compensation for public employees\nbacked by powerful public-sector unions. On June 13,\n2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a special\nelection to be held in November 2005, where voters would\nconsider various ballot propositions aimed at state-level\nstructural reforms. Two of the most controversial issues\non the ballot were Propositions 75 and 76. Proposition 75\nwould have required unions to obtain employees’ affirma-\ntive consent before charging them fees to be used for polit-\nical purposes. Proposition 76 would have limited state\nspending and would have given the Governor the ability\nunder some circumstances to reduce state appropriations\nfor public-employee compensation. The SEIU joined a\ncoalition of public-sector unions in vigorously opposing\nthese measures. Calling itself the “Alliance for a Better\nCalifornia,” the group would eventually raise “more than\n$10 million, with almost all of it coming from public em-\nployee unions, including $2.75 million from state worker\nunions, $4.7 million from the California Teachers Associa-\ntion, and $700,000 from school workers unions.”1\n——————\n  1 Marinucci & Wildermuth, Schwarzenegger Adds Prop. 75 to His\n\nAgenda, San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 18, 2005, p. A–17.\n4              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   On July 30, shortly after the end of the 30-day objection\nperiod for the June Hudson notice, the SEIU proposed a\ntemporary 25% increase in employee fees, which it billed\nas an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Po-\nlitical Fight-Back Fund.” App. 25. The proposal stated\nthat the money was needed to achieve the union’s political\nobjectives, both in the special November 2005 election and\nin the November 2006 election. Id., at 26. According to\nthe proposal, money in the Fight-Back Fund would be\nused “for a broad range of political expenses, including\ntelevision and radio advertising, direct mail, voter regis-\ntration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in\nour work sites and in our communities across California.”\nIbid. The proposal specifically stated that “[t]he Fund will\nnot be used for regular costs of the union—such as office\nrent, staff salaries or routine equipment replacement, etc.”\nIbid. It noted that “all other public worker unions are in\nthe process of raising the extraordinary funds needed to\ndefeat the Governor.” Id., at 27. And it concluded: “Each\nof us must do our part to turn back these initiatives which\nwould allow the Governor to destroy our wages and bene-\nfits and even our jobs, and threaten the well-being of all\nCalifornians.” Ibid. On August 27, the SEIU’s General\nCouncil voted to implement the proposal.\n   On August 31, the SEIU sent out a letter addressed\nto “Local 1000 Members and Fair Share Fee Payers,” an-\nnouncing that, for a limited period, their fees would be\nraised to 1.25% of gross monthly salary and the $45-per-\nmonth cap on regular dues would not apply. Id., at 31.\nThe letter explained that the union would use the fund to\n“defeat Proposition 76 and Proposition 75 on November 8,”\nand to “defeat another attack on [its] pension plan” in\nJune 2006. Ibid. The letter also informed employees that,\nin the following year, the money would help “to elect a\ngovernor and a legislature who support public employees\nand the services [they] provide.” Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  After receiving this letter, one of the plaintiffs in this\ncase called the SEIU’s offices to complain that the union\nwas levying the special assessment for political purposes\nwithout giving employees a fair opportunity to object.\nAn SEIU area manager responded that “even if [the em-\nployee] objected to the payment of the full agency fee, there\nwas nothing he could do about the September increase for\nthe Assessment.” Knox v. Westly, No. 2:05–cv–02198, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">850128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (ED Cal., Mar. 28, 2008). “She also stated\nthat ‘we are in the fight of our lives,’ that the Assessment\nwas needed, and that there was nothing that could be\ndone to stop the Union’s expenditure of that Assessment\nfor political purposes.” Ibid. As a consolation, however,\nthose employees who had filed timely objections after the\nregular June Hudson notice were required to pay only\n56.35% of the temporary increase.\n  Petitioners filed this class-action suit on behalf of 28,000\nnonunion employees who were forced to contribute money\nto the Political Fight-Back Fund. Some of the class mem-\nbers had filed timely objections after receiving the regular\nHudson notice in June, and others had not. Those who\nhad objected argued that it was wrong to require them to\npay 56.35% of the temporary assessment, which had been\nbilled as intended for use in making political expenditures\nthat they found objectionable. Those who had not objected\nafter receiving the June Hudson notice contended that\nthey should have received a new opportunity to object\nwhen the SEIU levied the special assessment for its Politi-\ncal Fight-Back Fund.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment for the\npetitioners, finding that the union “fully intended to use\nthe 12 million additional dollars it anticipated to raise for\npolitical purposes.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">850128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7. “Even if every\ncent of the assessment was not intended to be used for\nentirely political purposes,” the court stated, “it is clear\nthat the Union’s intent was to depart drastically from its\n6               KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntypical spending regime and to focus on activities that\nwere political or ideological in nature.” Id., at *8. In light\nof this fact, the court held that it would be inappropriate\nfor the union to rely on previous annual expenditures to\nestimate that 56.35% of the new fee would go toward\nchargeable expenses. The court ordered the SEIU to send\nout a new notice giving all class members 45 days to object\nand to provide those who objected with a full refund of\ntheir contributions to the Political Fight-Back Fund. Id.,\nat *12.\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. Knox\nv. California State Employees Assn., Local 1000, 628 F.\n3d 1115 (2010). According to the panel majority, Hudson\nprescribed the use of a balancing test. 628 F. 3d, at 1119–\n1120. The majority therefore inquired whether the proce-\ndure that the SEIU employed reasonably accommodated\nthe interests of the union, the employer, and nonmember\nemployees. Id., at 1120–1123. Judge Wallace dissented,\narguing that the majority had misinterpreted Hudson and\nsanctioned the abridgment of the First Amendment rights\nof nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1123–1139.\n   We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   The SEIU argues that we should dismiss this case as\nmoot. In opposing the petition for certiorari, the SEIU\ndefended the decision below on the merits. After certiorari\nwas granted, however, the union sent out a notice offering\na full refund to all class members, and the union then\npromptly moved for dismissal of the case on the ground of\nmootness. Such postcertiorari maneuvers designed to\ninsulate a decision from review by this Court must be\nviewed with a critical eye. See City News & Novelty, Inc.\nv. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283–284 (2001). The vol-\nuntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinar-\nily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as\nsoon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v.\nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). And\nhere, since the union continues to defend the legality of\nthe Political Fight-Back fee, it is not clear why the union\nwould necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in\nthe future.\n    The union argues that concerns about voluntary cessa-\ntion are inapplicable in this case because petitioners do\nnot seek any prospective relief.

In United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S.\n405 (2001), we considered the constitutionality of a state\nscheme that compelled such funding. The subject of the\nspeech at issue—promoting the sale of mushrooms—was\nnot one that is likely to stir the passions of many, but the\nmundane commercial nature of that speech only high-\nlights the importance of our analysis and our holding.\n   The federal Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Con-\nsumer Information Act required that fresh mushroom\nhandlers pay assessments used primarily to fund adver-\ntisements promoting mushroom sales. A large producer\nobjected to subsidizing these generic ads, and even though\nwe applied the less demanding standard used in prior\ncases to judge laws affecting commercial speech, we held\nthat the challenged scheme violated the First Amendment.\nWe made it clear that compulsory subsidies for private\nspeech are subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny\nand cannot be sustained unless two criteria are met.\nFirst, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme\n10             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving a “mandated association” among those who are\nrequired to pay the subsidy. Id., at 414. Such situations\nare exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere,\nmandatory associations are permissible only when they\nserve a “compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be\nachieved through means significantly less restrictive of\nassociational freedoms.” Roberts, supra, at 623. Second,\neven in the rare case where a mandatory association can\nbe justified, compulsory fees can be levied only insofar as\nthey are a “necessary incident” of the “larger regulatory\npurpose which justified the required association.” United\nFoods, supra, at 414.\n                              B\n   When a State establishes an “agency shop” that ex-\nacts compulsory union fees as a condition of public employ-\nment, “[t]he dissenting employee is forced to support\nfinancially an organization with whose principles and\ndemands he may disagree.” Ellis, 466 U. S., at 455.\nBecause a public-sector union takes many positions during\ncollective bargaining that have powerful political and civic\nconsequences, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49, the compulsory\nfees constitute a form of compelled speech and association\nthat imposes a “significant impingement on First Amend-\nment rights.” Ellis, supra, at 455. Our cases to date have\ntolerated this “impingement,” and we do not revisit today\nwhether the Court’s former cases have given adequate\nrecognition to the critical First Amendment rights at\nstake.\n   “The primary purpose” of permitting unions to collect\nfees from nonmembers, we have said, is “to prevent non-\nmembers from free-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing\nthe employment benefits obtained by the union’s collective\nbargaining without sharing the costs incurred.” Daven-\nport, 551 U. S., at 181. Such free-rider arguments, however,\nare generally insufficient to overcome First Amend-\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Consider the following examples:\n    “If a community association engages in a clean-up\n    campaign or opposes encroachments by industrial de-\n    velopment, no one suggests that all residents or prop-\n    erty owners who benefit be required to contribute. If\n    a parent-teacher association raises money for the\n    school library, assessments are not levied on all par-\n    ents. If an association of university professors has as\n    a major function bringing pressure on universities to\n    observe standards of tenure and academic freedom,\n    most professors would consider it an outrage to be re-\n    quired to join. If a medical association lobbies against\n    regulation of fees, not all doctors who share in the\n    benefits share in the costs.”2\n   Acceptance of the free-rider argument as a justification\nfor compelling nonmembers to pay a portion of union dues\nrepresents something of an anomaly—one that we have\nfound to be justified by the interest in furthering “labor\npeace.” Hudson, 475 U. S., at 303. But it is an anomaly\nnevertheless.\n   Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers to opt out\nof paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues—as\nopposed to exempting them from making such payments\nunless they opt in—represents a remarkable boon for\nunions. Courts “do not presume acquiescence in the loss of\nfundamental rights.” College Savings Bank v. Florida\nPrepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.

Once it is\nrecognized, as our cases have, that a nonmember cannot\nbe forced to fund a union’s political or ideological activi-\nties, what is the justification for putting the burden on\nthe nonmember to opt out of making such a payment?\n——————\n  2 Summers, Book Review, Sheldon Leader, Freedom of Association: A\n\nStudy in Labor Law and Political Theory, 16 Comparative Labor L. J.\n262, 268 (1995).\n12             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nShouldn’t the default rule comport with the probable\npreferences of most nonmembers? And isn’t it likely that\nmost employees who choose not to join the union that\nrepresents their bargaining unit prefer not to pay the full\namount of union dues? An opt-out system creates a risk\nthat the fees paid by nonmembers will be used to further\npolitical and ideological ends with which they do not\nagree. But a “[u]nion should not be permitted to exact a\nservice fee from nonmembers without first establishing a\nprocedure which will avoid the risk that their funds will\nbe used, even temporarily, to finance ideological activities\nunrelated to collective bargaining.” Hudson, supra, at 305\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Although the difference between opt-out and opt-in\nschemes is important, our prior cases have given sur-\nprisingly little attention to this distinction. Indeed, ac-\nceptance of the opt-out approach appears to have come\nabout more as a historical accident than through the\ncareful application of First Amendment principles.\n   The trail begins with dicta in Street, where we consid-\nered whether a federal collective-bargaining statute au-\nthorized a union to impose compulsory fees for political\nactivities. 367 U. S., at 774. The plaintiffs were employ-\nees who had affirmatively objected to the way their fees\nwere being used, and so we took that feature of the case\nfor granted. We held that the statute did not authorize\nthe use of the objecting employees’ fees for ideological\npurposes, and we stated in passing that “dissent is not\nto be presumed—it must affirmatively be made known to\nthe union by the dissenting employee.” Ibid. In making\nthat offhand remark, we did not pause to consider the\nbroader constitutional implications of an affirmative opt-out\nrequirement. Nor did we explore the extent of First\nAmendment protection for employees who might not qual-\nify as active “dissenters” but who would nonetheless prefer\nto keep their own money rather than subsidizing by de-\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Thus in Hudson we did not take issue with the\nunion’s practice of giving employees annual notice and an\nopportunity to object to expected political expenditures.\nAt the same time, however, we made it clear that the\nprocedures used by a union to collect money from non-\nmembers must satisfy a high standard.\n   Contrary to the view of the Ninth Circuit panel major-\nity, we did not call for a balancing of the “right” of the\nunion to collect an agency fee against the First Amend-\nment rights of nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1119–1120.\nAs we noted in Davenport, “unions have no constitutional\nentitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.” 551\nU. S., at 185. A union’s “collection of fees from nonmem-\nbers is authorized by an act of legislative grace,” 628 F. 3d,\nat 1126 (Wallace, J., dissenting)—one that we have\ntermed “unusual” and “extraordinary,” Davenport, supra,\nat 184, 187. Far from calling for a balancing of rights or\ninterests, Hudson made it clear that any procedure for\nexacting fees from unwilling contributors must be “care-\nfully tailored to minimize the infringement” of free speech\nrights. 475 U. S., at 303. And to underscore the meaning\nof this careful tailoring, we followed that statement with a\ncitation to cases holding that measures burdening the\nfreedom of speech or association must serve a “compelling\ninterest” and must not be significantly broader than nec-\nessary to serve that interest.3\n——————\n  3 The specific citation was as follows:\n  “See Roberts v.

The SEIU, how-\never, asks us to go farther. It asks us to approve a proce-\ndure under which (a) a special assessment billed for use\nin electoral campaigns was assessed without providing a\nnew opportunity for nonmembers to decide whether they\nwished to contribute to this effort and (b) nonmembers\nwho previously opted out were nevertheless required to\npay more than half of the special assessment even\nthough the union had said that the purpose of the fund\nwas to mount a political campaign and that it would not\nbe used for ordinary union expenses. This aggressive use\nof power by the SEIU to collect fees from nonmembers is\nindefensible.\n                              A\n  First, we see no justification for the union’s failure to\nprovide a fresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the prin-\nciple that nonmembers should not be required to fund a\nunion’s political and ideological projects unless they choose\nto do so after having “a fair opportunity” to assess the im-\npact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475\nU.

When a union levies a special\nassessment or raises dues as a result of unexpected devel-\nopments, the factors influencing a nonmember’s choice\nmay change. In particular, a nonmember may take special\nexception to the uses for which the additional funds are\nsought.4\n   The present case provides a striking example. The\nspecial assessment in this case was billed for use in a\nbroad electoral campaign designed to defeat two important\nand controversial ballot initiatives and to elect sympa-\nthetic candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial and legislative\nelections. There were undoubtedly nonmembers who, for\none reason or another, chose not to opt out or neglected to\ndo so when the standard Hudson notice was sent but who\ntook strong exception to the SEIU’s political objectives and\ndid not want to subsidize those efforts. These nonmem-\nbers might have favored one or both of the ballot initia-\ntives; they might have wished to support the reelection of\nthe incumbent Governor; or they might not have wanted\nto delegate to the union the authority to decide which\ncandidates in the 2006 elections would receive a share of\ntheir money.\n   The effect on nonmembers was particularly striking\nwith respect to the union’s campaign against Proposition\n75 because that initiative would have bolstered nonmem-\nber rights. If Proposition 75 had passed, nonmembers\nwould have been exempt from paying for the SEIU’s ex-\ntensive political projects unless they affirmatively con-\n——————\n  4 The dissent suggests that the union gave fair notice because it an-\n\nnounced at the beginning of the year that “ ‘[d]ues are subject to change\nwithout further notice to fee payers.’ ” Post, at 12 (opinion of BREYER,\nJ.). But a union cannot define the scope of its own notice obligations\nsimply by promulgating a clause giving itself the power to increase fees\nat any time for any purpose without further notice.\n16                KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsented. Thus, the effect of the SEIU’s procedure was to\nforce many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort\ndesigned to restrict their own rights.\n   As Hudson held, procedures for collecting fees from\nnonmembers must be carefully tailored to minimize im-\npingement on First Amendment rights, and the procedure\nused in this case cannot possibly be considered to have\nmet that standard. After the dues increase was adopted,\nthe SEIU wrote to all employees in the relevant bargain-\ning units to inform them of this development. It would\nhave been a relatively simple matter for the union to cast\nthis letter in the form of a new Hudson notice, so that\nnonmembers could decide whether they wanted to pay for\nthe union’s electoral project.\n   The SEIU argues that we should not be troubled by its\nfailure to provide a new notice because nonmembers who\nobjected to the special assessment but were nonetheless\nrequired to pay it would have been given the chance to\nrecover the funds in question by opting out when the next\nannual notice was sent. If the special assessment was\nused entirely or in part for nonchargeable purposes, they\nsuggest, the percentage of the union’s annual expenditures\nfor chargeable purposes would decrease, and therefore the\namount of the dues payable by objecting nonmembers the\nfollowing year would also decrease. This decrease, how-\never, would not fully recompense nonmembers who did not\nopt out after receiving the regular notice but would have\nopted out if they had been permitted to do so when the\nspecial assessment was announced.5 And in any event,\neven a full refund would not undo the violation of First\nAmendment rights. As we have recognized, the First\n\n——————\n  5 These nonmembers, after paying the full amount of the special as-\nsessment, would be required during the subsequent year to pay at least\nas much as those nonmembers who did opt out when they received the\ninitial Hudson notice.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

See Hudson, supra, at 305; Ellis, 466 U. S.,\nat 444. Here, for nonmembers who disagreed with the\nSEIU’s electoral objectives, a refund provided after the\nunion’s objectives had already been achieved would be cold\ncomfort.6\n  To respect the limits of the First Amendment, the union\nshould have sent out a new notice allowing nonmembers to\nopt in to the special fee rather than requiring them to opt\nout. Our cases have tolerated a substantial impingement\non First Amendment rights by allowing unions to impose\nan opt-out requirement at all. Even if this burden can be\njustified during the collection of regular dues on an annual\nbasis, there is no way to justify the additional burden of\nimposing yet another opt-out requirement to collect special\nfees whenever the union desires.\n\n                                    B\n                         1\n  The SEIU’s treatment of nonmembers who opted out\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR contends that a new Hudson notice should be\nrequired only when a special assessment is imposed for political pur-\nposes. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as even the\ndissent acknowledges, post, at 7, such a rule would be unworkable.\nFirst, our cases have recognized that a union’s money is fungible, so\neven if the new fee were spent entirely for nonpolitical activities, it\nwould free up other funds to be spent for political purposes. See Retail\nClerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U. S. 746, 753 (1963) (noting that particu-\nlar fee earmarks are “of bookkeeping significance only rather than a\nmatter of real substance”). And second, unless we can rely on unions to\nadvertise the true purpose behind every special fee, it is not clear how a\ncourt could make a timely determination of whether each new fee is\npolitical in nature. It would be practically impossible to require the\nparties to litigate the purpose of every fee merely to determine whether\nnotice is required.\n18                KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of\nthe First Amendment. The SEIU required these employ-\nees to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, just as they\nhad been required to pay 56.35% of the regular annual\ndues. But the union proclaimed that the special assess-\nment would be used to support an electoral campaign and\nwould not be used for ordinary union expenses. Accord-\ningly, there is no reason to suppose that 56.35% of the new\nassessment was used for properly chargeable expenses.\nOn the contrary, if the union is to be taken at its word,\nvirtually all of the money was slated for nonchargeable\nuses.\n  The procedure accepted in Hudson is designed for use\nwhen a union sends out its regular annual dues notices.\nThe procedure is predicated on the assumption that a\nunion’s allocation of funds for chargeable and noncharge-\nable purposes is not likely to vary greatly from one year to\nthe next.7 No such assumption is reasonable, however,\nwhen a union levies a special assessment or raises dues as\na result of events that were not anticipated or disclosed at\nthe time when a yearly Hudson notice was sent. Accord-\ningly, use of figures based on an audit of the union’s oper-\nations during an entire previous year makes no sense.\n  Nor would it be feasible to devise a new breakdown of\nchargeable and nonchargeable expenses for the special\nassessment. Determining that breakdown is problematic\nenough when it is done on a regular annual basis because\nauditors typically do not make a legal determination as to\nwhether particular expenditures are chargeable. Instead,\n——————\n  7 The SEIU contends that “[s]ignificant fluctuations in the chargeable\n\nand nonchargeable proportions of a union’s spending are inevitable,”\nBrief for Respondent 13, and the dissent appears to agree, post, at 10.\nBut if the Hudson Court had proceeded on this assumption it is doubt-\nful that it would have found it acceptable for a union to rely solely on\nthe breakdown in the most recent year rather than computing the\naverage breakdown over a longer period.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe auditors take the union’s characterization for granted\nand perform the simple accounting function of “ensur[ing]\nthat the expenditures which the union claims it made for\ncertain expenses were actually made for those expenses.”\nAndrews v. Education Assn. of Cheshire, 829 F. 2d 335,\n340 (CA2 1987). Thus, if a union takes a very broad view\nof what is chargeable—if, for example, it believes that\nsupporting sympathetic political candidates is chargeable\nand bases its classification on that view—the auditors will\nclassify these political expenditures as chargeable. Object-\ning employees may then contest the union’s chargeability\ndeterminations, but the onus is on the employees to come\nup with the resources to mount the legal challenge in a\ntimely fashion.8 See, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 513; Jib-\nson v. Michigan Ed. Assn., 30 F. 3d 723, 730 (CA6 1994).\nThis is already a significant burden for employees to bear\nsimply to avoid having their money taken to subsidize\nspeech with which they disagree, and the burden would\nbecome insupportable if unions could impose a new as-\nsessment at any time, with a new chargeability determi-\nnation to be challenged.\n                             2\n  The SEIU argues that objecting nonmembers who were\nrequired to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, far\nfrom subsidizing the union’s political campaign, actually\nreceived a windfall. According to the union’s statistics, the\nactual percentage of regular dues and fees spent for\nchargeable purposes in 2005 turned out to be quite a bit\nhigher (66.26%), and therefore, even if all of the money\nobtained through the special assessment is classified as\nnonchargeable, the union’s total expenditures for 2005\n——————\n  8 The dissent is comforted by the fact that the union “has offered to\npay for neutral arbitration of such disputes before the American Arbi-\ntration Association,” post, at 9, but the painful burden of initiating and\nparticipating in such disputes cannot be so easily relieved.\n20              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere at least 66.26% chargeable. See Brief for Respond-\nent 5, n. 6. This argument is unpersuasive for several\nreasons.\n    First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of charge-\nable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place\nmuch reliance on its statistics. In its brief, the SEIU\nargues broadly that all funds spent on “lobbying . . . the\nelectorate” are chargeable. See id., at 51. But “lobbying\n. . . the electorate” is nothing but another term for support-\ning political causes and candidates, and we have never\nheld that the First Amendment permits a union to compel\nnonmembers to support such political activities. On the\ncontrary, as long ago as Street, we noted the important\ndifference between a union’s authority to engage in collec-\ntive bargaining and related activities on behalf of non-\nmember employees in a bargaining unit and the union’s\nuse of nonmembers’ money “to support candidates for\npublic office” or “to support political causes which [they]\noppos[e].” 367 U. S., at 768.\n    The sweep of the SEIU’s argument is highlighted by its\ndiscussion of the use of fees paid by objecting nonmembers\nto defeat Proposition 76. According to the SEIU, these\nexpenditures were “germane” to the implementation of its\ncontracts because, if Proposition 76 had passed, it would\nhave “effectively permitted the Governor to abrogate the\nUnion’s collective bargaining agreements under certain\ncircumstances, undermining the Union’s ability to perform\nits representation duty of negotiating effective collective\nbargaining agreements.” Brief for Respondent 49–50\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n    If we were to accept this broad definition of germane-\nness, it would effectively eviscerate the limitation on the\nuse of compulsory fees to support unions’ controversial\npolitical activities. Public-employee salaries, pensions,\nand other benefits constitute a substantial percentage of\nthe budgets of many States and their subdivisions. As a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult, a broad array of ballot questions and campaigns for\npublic office may be said to have an effect on present and\nfuture contracts between public-sector workers and their\nemployers. If the concept of “germaneness” were as broad\nas the SEIU advocates, public-sector employees who do\nnot endorse the unions’ goals would be essentially unpro-\ntected against being compelled to subsidize political and\nideological activities to which they object.\n  Second, even if the SEIU’s statistics are accurate, it does\nnot follow that it was proper for the union to charge object-\ning nonmembers 56.35%—or any other particular per-\ncentage—of the special assessment. Unless it is possible to\ndetermine in advance with some degree of accuracy the\npercentage of union funds that will be used during an\nupcoming year for chargeable purposes—and the SEIU\nargues that this is not possible—there is at least a risk\nthat, at the end of the year, unconsenting nonmembers\nwill have paid either too much or too little. Which side\nshould bear this risk?\n  The answer is obvious: the side whose constitutional\nrights are not at stake. “Given the existence of acceptable\nalternatives, [a] union cannot be allowed to commit dis-\nsenters’ funds to improper uses even temporarily.” Ellis,\n466 U. S., at 444. Thus, if unconsenting nonmembers pay\ntoo much, their First Amendment rights are infringed. On\nthe other hand, if unconsenting nonmembers pay less than\ntheir proportionate share, no constitutional right of the\nunion is violated because the union has no constitutional\nright to receive any payment from these employees. See\nDavenport, 551 U. S., at 185. The union has simply lost\nfor a few months the “extraordinary” benefit of being em-\npowered to compel nonmembers to pay for services that\nthey may not want and in any event have not agreed to\nfund.\n  As we have noted, by allowing unions to collect any fees\nfrom nonmembers and by permitting unions to use opt-out\n22                 KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrather than opt-in schemes when annual dues are billed,\nour cases have substantially impinged upon the First\nAmendment rights of nonmembers. In the new situation\npresented here, we see no justification for any further\nimpingement. The general rule—individuals should not\nbe compelled to subsidize private groups or private speech—\nshould prevail.\n   Public-sector unions have the right under the First\nAmendment to express their views on political and social\nissues without government interference. See, e.g., Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).\nBut employees who choose not to join a union have the\nsame rights. The First Amendment creates a forum in\nwhich all may seek, without hindrance or aid from the\nState, to move public opinion and achieve their political\ngoals. “First Amendment values [would be] at serious risk\nif the government [could] compel a particular citizen, or a\ndiscrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for\nspeech on the side that [the government] favors.” United\nFoods, 533 U. S., at 411. Therefore, when a public-sector\nunion imposes a special assessment or dues increase, the\nunion must provide a fresh Hudson notice and may not\nexact any funds from nonmembers without their affirma-\ntive consent.9\n——————\n  9 Contrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s suggestion, our holding does not\n\nventure beyond the scope of the questions on which we granted review\nor the scope of the parties’ dispute. The second question on which we\ngranted review broadly asks us to determine the circumstances under\nwhich a State may deduct from the pay of nonunion employees money\nthat is used by a union for general electioneering. See Pet. for Cert. (i)\n(“May a State, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\ncondition continued public employment on the payment of union\nagency fees for purposes of financing political expenditures for ballot\nmeasures?”). Our holding—that this may be done only when the em-\nployee affirmatively consents—falls within that question.\n  Our holding also addresses the primary remaining dispute between\nthe parties, namely, the particular procedures that must be followed on\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

See supra, at 7–8. Petitioners argue strenuously that\nthese procedures must be narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on\ntheir free-speech rights. See Brief for Petitioners 11–17. We see no\nsensible way to address this dispute without confronting the question\nwhether, in the particular context present here, an opt-out regime\nsuffices.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would apparently have us proceed on the as-\nsumption that an opt-out regime is permitted. She would then have us\ndecide what sort of opt-out procedures would be sufficient if such a\nregime were allowed at all. But that is a question that simply cannot\nbe answered. It would be like asking what sort of procedural require-\nments would be required if the government set out to do something\nelse that the First Amendment flatly prohibits—for example, requiring\nprepublication approval of newspapers.\n  There is also no merit in JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s and JUSTICE BREYER’s\ncomments about prior precedent. This case concerns the procedures\nthat must be followed when a public-sector union announces a special\nassessment or mid-year dues increase. No prior decision of this Court\nhas addressed that question, and Hudson says not one word on the\nsubject.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment.\n   I concur only in the judgment, however, because I can-\nnot agree with the majority’s decision to address unneces-\nsarily significant constitutional issues well outside the\nscope of the questions presented and briefing. By doing so,\nthe majority breaks our own rules and, more importantly,\ndisregards principles of judicial restraint that define the\nCourt’s proper role in our system of separated powers.\n                              I\n   The Political Fight-Back Fund was to be used by Service\nEmployees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), “spe-\ncifically in the political arenas of California” to defeat\nperceived antiunion initiatives and to elect a sympathetic\nGovernor and legislature. App. 25; see also id., at 31. As\nthe majority explains, such political efforts are not “ger-\nmane” to the union’s function as a bargaining represent-\native, and accordingly are not chargeable to objecting\nnonmembers. See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S.\n2                  KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n507, 519 (1991); see also Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207,\n211 (2009) (“[N]onchargeable union activities [include]\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities”). While\nthe union is free to pursue its ideological goals in the\npolitical arena, it may not subsidize its efforts with object-\ning nonmembers’ funds, lest the objector be used as “ ‘an in-\nstrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological\npoint of view he finds unacceptable.’ ” Lehnert, 500 U. S.,\nat 522 (plurality opinion) (quoting Wooley v. Maynard, 430\nU. S. 705, 715 (1977)).\n   Accordingly, when a union levies a special assessment\nor dues increase to fund political activities, the union may\nnot collect funds from nonmembers who earlier had ob-\njected to the payment of nonchargeable expenses, and may\nnot collect funds from other nonmembers without provid-\ning a new Hudson notice and opportunity to opt out. See\nTeachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986). Because SEIU\nfailed to follow these procedures, it did not satisfy its\nconstitutional obligations. That holding should end this\ncase; it is all petitioners asked this Court to decide.1\n                             II\n  The majority agrees that SEIU’s actions were at odds\nwith the First Amendment.

They did not argue that the Constitution re-\nquires an opt-in system of fee collection in the context of\nspecial assessments or dues increases or, indeed, in any\ncontext. Not surprisingly, respondents did not address\nsuch a prospect.\n   Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the questions set\nout in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be con-\nsidered by the Court.” “[W]e disregard [that rule] ‘only\nin the most exceptional cases,’ where reasons of urgency\nor economy suggest the need to address the unpresented\nquestion in the case under consideration.” Yee v. Escon-\ndido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (quoting Stone v. Powell,\n428 U. S. 465, 481, n. 15 (1976)). The majority does not claim\n any such exceptional circumstance here. Yet it reaches\nout to hold that “when a public-sector union imposes a\nspecial assessment or dues increase, the union must pro-\nvide a fresh Hudson notice and may not exact any funds\nfrom nonmembers without their affirmative consent.” Ante,\nat 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 17 (“[T]he\nunion should have sent out a new notice allowing non-\nmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring\nthem to opt out”). The majority thus decides, for the very\nfirst time, that the First Amendment does require an opt-\nin system in some circumstances: the levying of a special\nassessment or dues increase. The majority announces its\nnovel rule without any analysis of potential countervailing\narguments and without any reflection on the reliance\ninterests our old rules have engendered.\n   The majority’s choice to reach an issue not presented by\nthe parties, briefed, or argued, disregards our rules. See\nYee, 503 U. S., at 535. And it ignores a fundamental\npremise of our adversarial system: “ ‘that appellate courts\n4                  KNOX v.

The imperative of judicial\nrestraint is at its zenith here, with respect to an issue of\nsuch constitutional magnitude, for “[i]f there is one doc-\ntrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of\nconstitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass\non questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudica-\ntion is unavoidable.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 690,\nn. 11 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).2\n——————\n   2 The majority contends that its holding “does not venture beyond\n\nthe scope of the questions on which we granted review,” pointing to the\nsecond question presented. Ante, at 22, n. 9. The majority is mistaken.\nThat question concerns the chargeability of political and lobbying\nactivities under Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 522\n(1991), not the procedures by which a union may collect fees. See\nPet. for Cert. (i); id., at 20–27 (describing scope of second question pre-\nsented); id., at 23 (“There is a serious split, and confusion, among the\ncircuits on the chargeability of union political and lobbying activities”).\nIndeed, it is only petitioners’ first question presented that deals with\nfee-collection procedures. And in that question, petitioners ask this\nCourt to hold that SEIU may not collect its special assessment without\nproviding a Hudson notice that offers “an opportunity to object to” the\ndeduction of fees for the assessment. Id., at (i) (emphasis added).\n   The phrase “opt in” appears not once in petitioners’ briefing.

After\ntoday, must a union undertaking a special assessment or\ndues increase obtain affirmative consent to collect “any\nfunds” or solely to collect funds for nonchargeable ex-\npenses? May a nonmember opt not to contribute to a\nspecial assessment, even if the assessment is levied to\nfund uncontestably chargeable activities? Does the ma-\njority’s new rule allow for any distinction between non-\nmembers who had earlier objected to the payment of\nnonchargeable expenses and those who had not? What\nprocedures govern this new world of fee collection?\n   Moreover, while the majority’s novel rule is, on its face,\nlimited to special assessments and dues increases, the\nmajority strongly hints that this line may not long endure.\nThe majority pronounces the Court’s explicit holding in\nMachinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 774 (1961)—that\n“dissent is not to be presumed[,] it must affirmatively be\nmade known to the union by the dissenting employee”—\nnothing but an “offhand remark,” made by Justices who\ndid not “pause to consider the broader constitutional\nimplications of an affirmative opt-out requirement,” ante,\nat 12. The reader is told that our precedents’ “acceptance\nof the opt-out approach appears to have come about more\nas a historical accident than through the careful applica-\ntion of First Amendment principles.” Ibid. And that “[b]y\nauthorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers and\npermitting the use of an opt-out system for the collection\n——————\nmajority’s view, unconstitutional. But if the Court was dissatisfied\nwith the scope of the questions presented here it should not have\ngranted certiorari in this case. Or having granted it, the Court should\nhave asked for supplemental briefing on the question whether an opt-in\nregime is constitutionally required. What it should not have done—\ncannot do under our rules—is decide that question without having\nprovided the parties and potential amici an opportunity to weigh in\nwith their own considered views.\n6              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof fees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior\ndecisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what\nthe First Amendment can tolerate.” Ante, at 14 (emphasis\nadded); see also ante, at 21–22 (“[B]y allowing unions to\ncollect any fees from nonmembers and by permitting\nunions to use opt-out rather than opt-in schemes when\nannual dues are billed, our cases have substantially im-\npinged upon the First Amendment rights of nonmem-\nbers”); ante, at 11–12 (“Once it is recognized . . . that a\nnonmember cannot be forced to fund a union’s political or\nideological activities, what is the justification for putting\nthe burden on the nonmember to opt out of making such a\npayment? Shouldn’t the default rule comport with the\nprobable preferences of most nonmembers?”).\n   To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedent is a\nstep we historically take only with the greatest caution\nand reticence. To do so, as the majority does, on our own\ninvitation and without adversarial presentation is both\nunfair and unwise. It deprives the parties and potential\namici of the opportunity to brief and argue the question.\nIt deprives us of the benefit of argument that the parties,\nwith concrete interests in the question, are surely better\npositioned than we to set forth.

Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986), this Court\nunanimously held that “the Union cannot be faulted for\ncalculating its fee on the basis of its expenses during the\npreceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18. That is precisely what\nthe union has done in this case. I see no reason to modify\nHudson’s holding as here applied. I consequently dissent.\n                              I\n   In Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), the\nCourt held that nonunion public employees have a First\nAmendment right to prevent a union’s spending a part of\ntheir compulsory fees on contributions to political candi-\ndates or on “express[ions of ] political views unrelated to\n[the union’s] duties as exclusive bargaining representa-\ntive.” Id., at 234. A decade later in Hudson, the Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of procedures adopted to\nimplement Abood. In particular, the Court considered the\nprocedures adopted by a teachers union “to draw that\nnecessary line and to respond to nonmembers’ objections\nto the manner in which it was drawn.” 475 U. S., at 294.\n   The teachers union had calculated the fee it could\ncharge nonmembers during a particular year on the basis\nof the expenditures the union actually made during the\n2              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprior year. Those nonmembers who objected to the ap-\nportionment, believing their fee too high, could lodge an\nobjection with the union, proceed through arbitration, and\nreceive a rebate if they won. The Court found this proce-\ndure constitutionally inadequate. It thought that (1) a\nrebate “does not avoid the risk that dissenters’ funds may\nbe used temporarily for an improper purpose,” (2) the\nunion had not provided the nonmembers in advance with\n“sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the un-\nion’s fee,” and (3) the union did not provide objectors\nwith “a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial deci-\nsionmaker.” Id., at 305–307.\n   The Court then held that the Constitution requires that\na union collecting a fee from nonmembers provide “an\nadequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably\nprompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee\nbefore an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the\namounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are\npending.” Id., at 310.\n   The Court added that it “recognize[d] that there are\npractical reasons why ‘[a]bsolute precision’ in the calcula-\ntion of the charge to nonmembers cannot be ‘expected or\nrequired.’ ” Id., at 307, n. 18 (quoting Railway Clerks v.\nAllen, 373 U. S. 113, 122 (1963)). It said that the union\nretains the burden of proving that a given expense is\nchargeable to nonmembers, the “nonmember’s ‘burden’ ” be-\ning simply that of making “his objection known.” 475 U.

And it added that the union “cannot\nbe faulted for calculating its fee on the basis of its ex-\npenses during the preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.\n   For the last 25 years unions and employers across\nthe Nation have relied upon this Court’s statements in\nHudson in developing administratively workable systems\nthat (1) allow unions to pay the costs of fulfilling their\nrepresentational obligations to both members and non-\nmembers alike, while (2) simultaneously protecting the\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 447 (1984)). See also Keller v. State\nBar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 17 (1990) (explaining that Hudson\n“outlined a minimum set of procedures by which a union\nin an agency-shop relationship could meet its requirement\nunder Abood”). The Court, in my view, should not depart,\nor create an exception, from Hudson’s framework here.\n                              II\n  Because the administrative details of the fee collection\nprocess are critical, I shall begin by explaining how I un-\nderstand that process to work. The union here followed\na basic administrative system that ensures that the\nfee charged to objecting nonmembers matches their pro\nrata share of the union’s chargeable expenditures, but it\nachieves that match only over a period of several years.\nAt the end of 2004, independent auditors determined the\namount of chargeable (e.g., collective-bargaining related)\nexpenditures and the amount of nonchargeable (e.g., non-\ngermane political) expenditures that the union ac-\ntually made during 2004. The union then used the resulting\nproportion (which was about 56% chargeable, 44% non-\nchargeable) as the basis for apportioning the next year’s\ndues. Thus in June 2005, the union sent all represented\nemployees a Hudson notice setting forth that (roughly) 56\nto 44 figure. App. 96–106. It provided time for nonmem-\nbers to object or to challenge the figure or underlying data.\nId., at 98–104. And it then applied the resulting figure to\ndetermine the percentage of the total fee that objecting\nnonmembers would have to pay during the next fee-year,\nwhich ran from July 2005 to June 2006. Id., at 102. At\nthe end of 2005, auditors again examined the union’s\nactual expenditures made during 2005. And the union\nthen used those newly audited figures to determine the\n4              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nchargeable percentage for the fee-year 2006–2007. Id., at\n158. Since political expenditures during calendar year\n2005 turned out to be lower than in 2004, the new charge-\nable share amounted to about 69% of the total fee bill.\nIbid.\n   Simplifying further to illustrate, I shall describe the\nsystem as (1) using audited accounts for Year One to\ndetermine the proportion of the fee that objectors must\npay during Year Two, and (2) using audited accounts for\nYear Two to determine the proportion of the fee that ob-\njectors must pay during Year Three. If Year One’s\nchargeable share (as applied to Year Two) turns out to be\ntoo high, Year Two’s audited accounts will reflect that fact,\nand the payable share for Year Three will be reduced\naccordingly.\n   This system does not put typical objectors to any dis-\nadvantage. If, say, in Year One total expenses were\n$1 million, collective-bargaining expenses amounted to\n$600,000, and political expenses amounted to $400,000,\nthen the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more\nthan 60% of normal dues in Year Two. If in Year Two\ncollective-bargaining expenses turned out to be a lesser\nshare of total expenses, say 30%, then the union cannot\ncharge objecting nonmembers more than 30% of the total\nfee in Year Three. Normally, what the objecting nonmem-\nbers lose on the swings they will gain on the roundabouts.\n   This kind of basic administrative system is imperfect.\nThe nature of a union’s expenditures, including non-\nchargeable political expenditures, varies from year to year,\nfor political needs differ at different stages of political\ncycles. Thus, last year’s percentages will often fail to\nmatch this year’s expenditures patterns. And the possibil-\nity that an objecting nonmember’s funds will temporarily\nhelp the union pay for a nonchargeable political expendi-\nture (say, in Year Two) is always present—though in this\ncase that did not happen. See infra, at 6–7.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nonetheless this kind of system enjoys an offsetting\nadministrative virtue. It bases fees upon audited ac-\ncounts, thereby avoiding the difficulties and disagree-\nments that would surround an effort to determine the\nrelevant proportions by trying to measure union expendi-\ntures as they occur or by trying to make predictions about\nthe nature of future expenditures. It consequently gives\nworkers reliable information. It gives workers advance\nnotice of next year’s payable charge. It gives nonmembers\na “reasonably prompt” opportunity to object. Hudson, 475\nU. S., at 310. And, where the chargeable share of next\nyear’s expenses (Year Two) turns out to be lower than last\nyear’s (Year One), it provides offsetting compensation in\nthe form of a lower payable share for the following year\n(Year Three).\n  In any event, these features are characteristic of an\nadministrative system that “calculat[es]” shares of a un-\nion’s fee “on the basis of its expenses during the preceding\nyear.” Id., at 307, n. 18. Hudson stated specifically that\nthe “[u]nion cannot be faulted for calculating its fee” on\nthat basis. Ibid. And no party here has challenged the\nconstitutional validity of that basic administrative system.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.\n                             III\n  If the union’s basic administrative system does not\nviolate the Constitution, then how could its special as-\nsessment have done so? In my view, it did not violate the\nConstitution, and I shall explain my basis for thinking\nso by considering separately (1) those nonmembers who\nobjected initially to the 2005 Hudson notice, and (2) those\nnonmembers who did not initially object.\n                           A\n The special assessment as administered here has\nworked no constitutional harm upon those nonunion em-\n6              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nployees who raised a general objection at the beginning of\nthe year. The union has honored their objections by sub-\ntracting from their special payments the same 44% that it\nsubtracts from each of their ordinary monthly payments.\nApp. 309. And we know that the special assessment here\ndid not even work temporary constitutional harm. That is\nbecause audited figures showed that the union’s total\nnonchargeable (e.g., political) expenses for that year ended\nup as a lower percentage of total expenses than the pre-\nvious year. Hence the objecting nonmembers ended up\nbeing charged too little, not too much, even with the spe-\ncial assessment thrown into the mix.\n  Let me put the point more specifically. The union’s\nJune 2005 Hudson notice said that the union would\ncharge objecting nonmembers roughly 56% of the dues\npaid by union members. See App. 102. That 56% figure\nrepresented the chargeable portion of expenditures accord-\ning to the audited figures from 2004. Thus, if the fee\ncharged to a union member pursuant to the 2005 notice\nwas $400, the fee charged to an objecting nonmember was\n$224. The union similarly prorated the special assess-\nment charging objecting nonmembers 56% of the assess-\nment it imposed upon members. Thus, if the special\nassessment amounted to $50 for a member, it amounted to\n$28 for an objecting nonmember. And total dues in this\nexample would have amounted to $450 for a member and\n$252 for a nonmember.\n  In the event, the union’s chargeable expenses for 2005—\nincluding the funds raised pursuant to the special assess-\nment—amounted to more than 56% of its total expendi-\ntures. The auditor’s reports show that the union’s total\nexpenditures in 2005 amounted to $40,045,409. Id.,\nat 166. Chargeable expenses amounted to $27,552,746,\nwhich works out to 69% of the total budget. Ibid. Thus, a\nsubstantially larger portion of the union’s 2005 spending\nwas chargeable (69%) than it had been in 2004 (56%).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nObjecting nonmembers therefore paid 56% of normal fees,\neven though the chargeable share that year was 69%.\nThat is to say, they paid less than what the Constitution\nconsiders to be their fair share. See Abood, 431 U. S., at\n236–237.\n   Even were the underlying facts different, I can find no\nconstitutional basis for charging an objecting nonmember\nless than the 56% that the preceding year’s audit showed\nwas appropriate. In general, any effort to send a new\nnotice and then apply special percentages to a special\nmidyear assessment fee runs into administrative difficul-\nties that, as explained above, are avoided with a retrospec-\ntive system. See supra, at 6. And, of course, requiring the\nuse of some special proportion based on predicted expendi-\ntures would contradict Hudson’s determination that prior\nyear, not present year, expenditures can form the basis for\nthe determination of that proportion. See Hudson, supra,\nat 307, n. 18.\n   In the particular example before us these general prob-\nlems are camouflaged by the fact that the union itself said\nthat the assessment was to be used for political purposes.\nHence it is tempting to say that 100% of the assessment\nis not chargeable. But future cases are most unlikely to\nbe so clear; disputes will arise over union predictions (say,\nthat only 20% of the special assessment will be used for\npolitical purposes); and the Court will then perhaps un-\nderstand the wisdom of Hudson’s holding. In any event,\nwe have made clear in other cases that money is fungible.\nRetail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U. S. 746, 753 (1963).\nWhether a particular expenditure was funded by regular\ndues or the special assessment is “of bookkeeping signifi-\ncance only rather than a matter of real substance.” Ibid.\nAnd, the Court’s focus on the announced purposes of the\nspecial assessment, rather than yearly expenditures taken\nas a whole, is beside the point.\n   The Court’s response to these problems, particularly the\n8              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadministrative calculation problems, is apparently to de-\npart yet further from the Court’s earlier holdings. It\nseems to say that an objector can withhold 100%, not\nsimply of a special assessment made for political purposes,\nbut of any special assessment whatsoever, including an\nassessment made solely for the purpose of paying for extra\nchargeable costs, such as extended contract negotiations,\npension plan experts, or newly assessed contributions to\nreplenish a national union’s collective-bargaining assis-\ntance funds. See ante, at 21–22. Although this rule is\ncomparatively simple to administer, it cannot be recon-\nciled with the Court’s previous constitutional holdings.\nAbood, along with every related case the Court has ever\ndecided, makes clear that the Constitution allows a union\nto assess nonmembers a pro rata share of fees insofar\nas they are used to pay for these kinds of collective-\nbargaining expenses. See 431 U. S., at 234–236; see also\nLehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991);\nMachinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 760 (1961); Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 447; Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551\nU. S. 177, 181 (2007); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207, 210\n(2009). How could the majority now hold to the contrary?\n   If there are good reasons for requiring departure from\nthe basic Hudson-approved administrative system, they\nare not the reasons the Court provides. It suggests that\nthe basic Hudson administrative system gives the union\nthe freedom to misclassify, arguing, for example, that the\nunion has adopted an overly broad definition of charge-\nability. See ante, at 20–21. The 2005 proportion, however,\nrested upon audited 2004 accounts. While petitioners\nargue in this Court that the union misclassified parts\nof the special assessment (which was not imposed until\n2005), no brief filed in this case (and certainly no court\nbelow) has challenged the accuracy of the 2004 figures or\nthe resulting chargeable/nonchargeable allocation. In-\ndeed, the 2004 accounts were audited before the special\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

But California state law explicitly permits\nthe union to classify some lobbying expenses as charge-\nable. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §3515.8 (West 2010) (a\nnonmember’s fair share includes “the costs of support\nof lobbying activities designed to foster policy goals and\ncollective negotiations and contract administration”); see\nalso Lillebo v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/calctapp/c4Uu/lillebo-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

No one has attacked the constitutionality of\nCalifornia’s law; no brief argues the question; and this\nCourt does not normally find state laws unconstitutional\nwithout, at least, giving those who favor the law an oppor-\ntunity to argue the matter.\n    The Court further complains that the basic administra-\ntive system requires an objecting nonmember to “come up\nwith the resources to mount” a “legal challenge” to the\nunion’s allocation “in a timely fashion.” Ante, at 19. That\nconcern too is misplaced. The union has offered to pay for\nneutral arbitration of such disputes before the American\nArbitration Association. App. 103–104. And, again, inso-\nfar as the Court casts doubt on the constitutional validity\nof the basic system, the Court does so without the benefit\nof argument.\n    Finally, the Court argues that (Step 1) Hudson is “pred-\n10              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nicated on the assumption that a union’s allocation of funds\nfor chargeable and nonchargeable purposes is not likely to\nvary greatly from one year to the next,” ante, at 18; that\n(Step 2) this assumption does not apply to midyear as-\nsessments; hence (Step 3) what appears binding precedent\n(namely Hudson) does not bind the Court in its interpreta-\ntion of the Constitution as applied to those assessments.\nIbid.\n   I must jump this logical ship, however, at Step 1. I\ncannot find in Hudson the “assumption” of uniform ex-\npenditures that the Court says underlies it. The assump-\ntion does not appear there explicitly. And it is hard to\nbelieve any such assumption could implicitly lurk within\na case involving a union’s political expenditures. Those\nexpenditures inevitably vary from political season to\nseason. They inevitably depend upon the number and\nkind of union-related matters currently visible on the\npolitical agenda. Cf., e.g., App. 102, 158, 223 (union’s\nchargeability proportion varies significantly over three\nyears, from 56.35% in 2004, to 68.8% in 2005, to 60.3% in\n2006). And it is hard to believe that the Members of this\nCourt, when deciding Abood, were not fully aware of these\nobvious facts.\n                               B\n  A stronger case can be made for allowing nonmember\nemployees who did not object at the beginning of the dues\nyear to object (for the first time) to a special assessment.\nThat is because, unlike the nonmember who objected\ninitially, the union will not permit that initially nonobject-\ning nonmember to withhold anything from the special\nassessment fee. Nonetheless, there are powerful reasons\nnot to allow the nonmember who did not object initially to\nthe annual fee to object now for the first time to the mid-\nyear special assessment.\n  For one thing, insofar as a new objection permits the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnew objector to withhold only the portion of the fee that\nwill pay for nonchargeable expenses (as the logic of the\nconcurring Justices would suggest), the administrative\nproblems that I earlier discussed apply. See supra, at 6.\nThat is to say, unions, arbitrators, and courts will have to\ndetermine, on the basis of a prediction, how much of the\nspecial assessment the new objector can withhold. I con-\ncede that many administrative problems could be over-\ncome were the new objector allowed to withhold only the\nsame 44% of the fee that the union here permitted ini-\ntial objectors to withhold (a figure based on 2004 au-\ndited accounts). But no Member of the Court takes that\napproach.\n   For another thing, as I have previously pointed out, the\nCourt would permit nonmembers who did not object at the\nbeginning of the year (like those who did then object) to\nobject to (and to pay none of) every special assessment,\nincluding those made to raise money to pay additional\ncollective-bargaining expenses. This approach may avoid\nthe uncertainty and resulting disputes inherent in an ef-\nfort to limit withholding to the nonchargeable portion of\nthe fee. But the price of avoiding those disputes is to\nreduce the financial contribution the union will receive\neven when a special assessment pays only for unexpected\nbut perfectly legitimate collective-bargaining expenses.\nSee supra, at 8–10.\n   Moreover, to provide a new opportunity to object re-\nquires providing for explanations, potential challenges, the\ndevelopment of separate accounts, and additional adminis-\ntrative procedures. That means providing extra time and\nextra money. By definition, however, special assessments\nare special; time may matter; and unlike the annual dues\npayment, the union is unlikely to be able to provide what\nis here a 6-month delay (between the close of the 2004\naudited year and the beginning of the next mid-2005 dues\nyear) that can be used to examine accounts and process\n12             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nobjections. In a word, a new opportunity to object means\ntime, effort, and funds set aside to deal with a new layer of\nadministrative procedure.\n   I recognize that allowing objections only once a year is\nonly one possible way to administer a fee-charging system.\nIn principle, one might allow nonmembers to pose new\nobjections to their dues payments biannually, or quarterly,\nor even once a month, as actual expenses do, or do not,\ncorrespond to initial union predictions. But for constitu-\ntional purposes the critical fact is that annual objection is\nat least one reasonably practical way to permit the princi-\npled objector to avoid paying for politics with which he\ndisagrees. See Hudson, 475 U. S., at 307, n. 18. And that\nis so whether ordinary or special assessments are at stake.\n   Further, the nonmember who did not object initially is\nnot likely to be a nonmember who strongly opposes the\nunion’s politics. That many unions take political posi-\ntions and that they spend money seeking to advance those\npositions is not exactly a secret. All those whom this\nunion represents know from history that it spends money\neach year for nonchargeable purposes. And any nonmem-\nber who has significant negative views about such matters\nis likely to have objected in advance. Those who did not\nobject initially (but do so later) likely include many whose\nobjection rests, not upon constitutionally protected politi-\ncal grounds, but simply upon a desire not to pay a higher\nfee. And those who withhold fees for that reason are not\nentitled to constitutional protection in doing so. Here, the\nnonobjector cannot even claim that an increase in the total\nfee (by the amount of the special assessment) took him by\nsurprise, for in its initial Hudson notice the union said\nthat “[d]ues are subject to change without further notice to\nfee payers.” App. 98.\n   Finally, if the union will not let a nonmember object to a\nspecial assessment, that nonmember has an easy remedy.\nHe or she can simply object the first time around. After\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nall, the possibility of a special assessment is known in\nadvance; the possibility that some, or all of it, will help the\nunion make political expenditures is known in advance;\nthe fact that the union will spend a significant amount of\nordinary dues upon political matters is known in advance.\nTo obtain protection all a nonmember who believes he\nmight object to some future political expenditure has to do\nis to object in advance. His or her fees will decline from\nthe beginning. And, if the nonmember forgets to object,\nthere is always next year—when the chargeable amount of\nthe fee will be based on this year’s actual expenditures.\n   Given these considerations, I do not believe the First\nAmendment requires giving a second objection opportu-\nnity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time.\n                             IV\n   The Court also holds that, “when a public-sector union\nimposes a special assessment or dues increase,” it “may\nnot exact any funds from nonmembers without their af-\nfirmative consent.” Ante, at 22. In other words, the Court\nmandates an “opt-in” system in respect to the payment of\nspecial assessments.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurring opinion explains why\nthe Court is wrong to impose this requirement. See ante,\nat 2–6 (opinion concurring in judgment). It runs directly\ncontrary to precedent. No party asked that we do so. The\nmatter has not been fully argued in this Court or in the\ncourts below. I agree with her about this matter.\n   The decision is particularly unfortunate given the fact\nthat each reason the Court offers in support of its “opt-in”\nconclusion seems in logic to apply, not just to special as-\nsessments, but to ordinary yearly fee charges as well. At\nleast, its opinion can be so read. And that fact virtually\nguarantees that the opinion will play a central role in an\nongoing, intense political debate.\n   The debate is generally about whether, the extent to\n14             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich, and the circumstances under which a union that\nrepresents nonmembers in collective bargaining can re-\nquire those nonmembers to help pay for the union’s (con-\nstitutionally chargeable) collective-bargaining expenses.\nTwenty-three States have enacted “right to work” laws,\nwhich, in effect, prevent unions from requiring nonmem-\nbers to pay any of those costs. See Dept. of Labor, Wage\nand Hour Division, State Right-to-Work Laws (Jan. 2009),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/righttowork.htm (as\nvisited June 18, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Other States have rejected the “right to work”\napproach and permit unions to require contributions from\nnonmembers, while protecting those nonmembers’ right\nto opt out of supporting the union’s political activities.\nE.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§3502.5(a), 3515.8. Still others\nhave enacted compromise laws that assume a nonmember\ndoes not wish to pay the nonchargeable portion of the fee\nunless he or she affirmatively indicates a desire to do so.\nSee Wash. Rev. Code §42.17A.500 (2010) (providing that a\nunion cannot use a nonmember’s agency fee for political\npurposes “unless affirmatively authorized by the individ-\nual”). The debate about public unions’ collective-bargaining\nrights is currently intense.\n  The question of how a nonmember indicates a desire not\nto pay constitutes an important part of this debate. Must\nthe union assume that the nonmember does not intend to\npay unless he affirmatively indicates his desire to pay, by\n“opting in”? Or, may the union assume that the nonmem-\nber is willing to pay unless the nonmember indicates a\ndesire not to pay, by “opting out”? Where, as here, non-\nchargeable political expenses are at issue, there may be a\nsignificant number of represented nonmembers who do not\nfeel strongly enough about the union’s politics to indicate a\nchoice either way. That being so, an “opt-in” requirement\ncan reduce union revenues significantly, a matter of con-\nsiderable importance to the union, while the additional\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

See generally Sunstein & Thaler,\nLibertarian Paternalism is not an Oxymoron, 70 U. Chi.\nL. Rev. 1159, 1161 (2003) (explaining that default rules\nplay an important role when individuals do not have “well-\ndefined preferences”). Consequently, the Court, which\nheld recently that the Constitution permits a State to im-\npose an opt-in requirement, see Davenport, 551 U. S., at\n185, has never said that it mandates such a requirement.\nThere is no good reason for the Court suddenly to enter\nthe debate, much less now to decide that the Constitution\nresolves it.\n  Of course, principles of stare decisis are not absolute.\nBut the Court cannot be right when it departs from those\nprinciples without benefit of argument in a matter of such\nimportance.\n  For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 802771, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/21/knox_v._service_employees.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Even em-\n  ployees who do not join the union must pay an annual fee for\n  “chargeable expenses,” i.e., the cost of nonpolitical union services re-\n  lated to collective bargaining. Under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431\n  U. S. 209, a public-sector union can bill nonmembers for chargeable\n  expenses but may not require them to fund its political or ideological\n  projects. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 302–311, sets out re-\n  quirements that a union must meet in order to collect regular fees\n  from nonmembers without violating their rights.\n    In June 2005, respondent, a public-sector union (SEIU), sent to\n  California employees its annual Hudson notice, setting and capping\n  monthly dues and estimating that 56.35% of its total expenditures in\n  the coming year would be chargeable expenses. A nonmember had 30\n  days to object to full payment of dues but would still have to pay the\n  chargeable portion. The notice stated that the fee was subject to in-\n  crease without further notice. That same month, the Governor called\n  for a special election on, inter alia, two ballot propositions opposed by\n  the SEIU. After the 30-day objection period ended, the SEIU sent a\n  letter to unit employees announcing a temporary 25% increase in\n  dues and a temporary elimination of the monthly dues cap, billing\n  the move as an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Politi-\n  cal Fight-Back Fund.” The purpose of the fund was to help achieve\n  the union’s political objectives in the special election and in the up-\n  coming November 2006 election. The union noted that the fund\n  would be used “for a broad range of political expenses, including tele-\n2                    KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    vision and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter ed-\n    ucation, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in our\n    communities across California.” Nonunion employees were not given\n    any choice as to whether they would pay into the fund.\n      Petitioners, on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into the\n    fund, brought a class action against the SEIU alleging violation of\n    their First Amendment rights. The Federal District Court granted\n    petitioners summary judgment. Ruling that the special assessment\n    was for entirely political purposes, it ordered the SEIU to send a new\n    notice giving class members 45 days to object and to provide those\n    who object a full refund of contributions to the fund. The Ninth Cir-\n    cuit reversed, concluding that Hudson prescribed a balancing test\n    under which the proper inquiry is whether the SEIU’s procedures\n    reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer,\n    and the nonmember employees.\nHeld:\n    1. This case is not moot. Although the SEIU offered a full refund to\n all class members after certiorari was granted, a live controversy re-\n mains. The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordi-\n narily render a case moot because that conduct could be resumed as\n soon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Cas-\n tle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289. Since the SEIU continues to defend the\n fund’s legality, it would not necessarily refrain from collecting similar\n fees in the future. Even if concerns about voluntary cessation were\n inapplicable because petitioners did not seek prospective relief, there\n would still be a live controversy as to the adequacy of the refund no-\n tice the SEIU sent pursuant to the District Court’s order. Pp. 6−8.\n    2. Under the First Amendment, when a union imposes a special as-\n sessment or dues increase levied to meet expenses that were not dis-\n closed when the regular assessment was set, it must provide a fresh\n notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their\n affirmative consent. Pp. 8−23.\n       (a) A close connection exists between this Nation’s commitment\n to self-government and the rights protected by the First Amendment,\n see, e.g., Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 52−53, which creates “an\n open marketplace” in which differing ideas about political, economic,\n and social issues can compete freely for public acceptance without\n improper government interference, New York State Bd. of Elections v.\n Lopez Torres, 552 U. S 196, 202. The government may not prohibit\n the dissemination of ideas it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement\n of ideas that it approves. See, e.g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,\n 382. And the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the\n purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.\n See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623.

Compulsory\nsubsidies for private speech are thus subject to exacting First\nAmendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless, first, there is a\ncomprehensive regulatory scheme involving a “mandated association”\namong those who are required to pay the subsidy, United States v.\nUnited Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, and, second, compulsory fees are\nlevied only insofar as they are a “necessary incident” of the “larger\nregulatory purpose which justified the required association,” ibid.\nPp. 8−10.\n     (b) When a State establishes an “agency shop” that exacts com-\npulsory union fees as a condition of public employment, “[t]he dis-\nsenting employee is forced to support financially an organization with\nwhose principles and demands he may disagree.” Ellis v. Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 455. This form of compelled speech and associ-\nation imposes a “significant impingement on First Amendment\nrights.” Ibid. The justification for permitting a union to collect fees\nfrom nonmembers—to prevent them from free-riding on the union’s\nefforts—is an anomaly. Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers\nto opt out of paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues―rather\nthan exempting them unless they opt in―represents a remarkable\nboon for unions, creating a risk that the fees nonmembers pay will be\nused to further political and ideological ends with which they do not\nagree. Thus, Hudson, far from calling for a balancing of rights or in-\nterests, made it clear that any procedure for exacting fees from un-\nwilling contributors must be “carefully tailored to minimize the in-\nfringement” of free speech rights, 475 U. S. 302−303, and it cited\ncases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or as-\nsociation must serve a compelling interest and must not be signifi-\ncantly broader than necessary to serve that interest. Pp. 10−13.\n     (c) There is no justification for the SEIU’s failure to provide a\nfresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers\nshould not be required to fund a union’s political and ideological pro-\njects unless they choose to do so after having “a fair opportunity” to\nassess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475\nU. S., at 303. The SEIU’s procedure cannot be considered to have\nmet Hudson’s requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully\ntailored to minimize impingement on First Amendment rights. The\nSEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assess-\nment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been\ngiven the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next\nannual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the fol-\nlowing year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special\nassessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes. But this\n4                    KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not\n    have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice. In\n    any event, even a full refund would not undo the First Amendment\n    violations, since the First Amendment does not permit a union to ex-\n    tract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later\n    paid back in full. Pp. 14−17.\n         (d) The SEIU’s treatment of nonmembers who opted out when\n    the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the First\n    Amendment. They were required to pay 56.35% of the special as-\n    sessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable,\n    electoral uses. And the SEIU’s claim that the assessment was a\n    windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is un-\n    persuasive. First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of\n    chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much re-\n    liance on its statistics. “Lobbying the electorate,” which the SEIU\n    claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for support-\n    ing political causes and candidates. Second, even if the SEIU’s sta-\n    tistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge ob-\n    jecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special\n    assessment. If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately\n    determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used\n    for an upcoming year’s chargeable purposes, there is a risk that un-\n    consenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little. That\n    risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not\n    at stake. If the nonmembers pay too much, their First Amendment\n    rights are infringed. But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right\n    of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to re-\n    ceive any payment from those employees.

SERVICE EM-\n  PLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1000\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 21, 2012] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, we decide whether the First Amendment\nallows a public-sector union to require objecting nonmem-\nbers to pay a special fee for the purpose of financing the\nunion’s political and ideological activities.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Under California law, public-sector employees in a\nbargaining unit may decide by majority vote to create an\n“agency shop” arrangement under which all the employees\nare represented by a union selected by the majority. Cal.\nGovt. Code Ann. §3502.5(a) (West 2010). While employees\nin the unit are not required to join the union, they must\nnevertheless pay the union an annual fee to cover the cost\nof union services related to collective bargaining (so-called\nchargeable expenses). See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn.,\n500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S.\n740, 760 (1961).\n   Our prior cases have recognized that such arrangements\nrepresent an “impingement” on the First Amendment\nrights of nonmembers. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292,\n2              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n307, n. 20 (1986). See also Davenport v. Washington Ed.\nAssn., 551 U. S. 177, 181 (2007) (“[A]gency-shop arrange-\nments in the public sector raise First Amendment con-\ncerns because they force individuals to contribute money\nto unions as a condition of government employment”);\nStreet, supra, at 749 (union shop presents First Amend-\nment “questions of the utmost gravity”). Thus, in Abood v.\nDetroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), we held that a\npublic-sector union, while permitted to bill nonmembers\nfor chargeable expenses, may not require nonmembers to\nfund its political and ideological projects. And in Hudson,\nwe identified procedural requirements that a union must\nmeet in order to collect fees from nonmembers without\nviolating their rights. 475 U. S., at 302–311. The First\nAmendment, we held, does not permit a public-sector\nunion to adopt procedures that have the effect of requiring\nobjecting nonmembers to lend the union money to be used\nfor political, ideological, and other purposes not germane\nto collective bargaining. Id., at 305. In the interest of\nadministrative convenience, however, we concluded that\na union “cannot be faulted” for calculating the fee that\nnonmembers must pay “on the basis of its expenses during\nthe preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.\n  Hudson concerned a union’s regular annual fees. The\npresent case, by contrast, concerns the First Amendment\nrequirements applicable to a special assessment or dues\nincrease that is levied to meet expenses that were not\ndisclosed when the amount of the regular assessment was\nset.\n                            B\n  In June 2005, respondent, the Service Employees Inter-\nnational Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), sent out its regular\nHudson notice informing employees what the agency fee\nwould be for the year ahead. The notice set monthly dues\nat 1% of an employee’s gross monthly salary but capped\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmonthly dues at $45. Based on the most recently audited\nyear, the SEIU estimated that 56.35% of its total expendi-\ntures in the coming year would be dedicated to chargeable\ncollective-bargaining activities. Thus, if a nonunion em-\nployee objected within 30 days to payment of the full\namount of union dues, the objecting employee was re-\nquired to pay only 56.35% of total dues. The SEIU’s notice\nalso included a feature that was not present in Hudson:\nThe notice stated that the agency fee was subject to in-\ncrease at any time without further notice.\n   During this time, the citizens of the State of California\nwere engaged in a wide-ranging political debate regarding\nstate budget deficits, and in particular the budget conse-\nquences of growing compensation for public employees\nbacked by powerful public-sector unions. On June 13,\n2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a special\nelection to be held in November 2005, where voters would\nconsider various ballot propositions aimed at state-level\nstructural reforms. Two of the most controversial issues\non the ballot were Propositions 75 and 76. Proposition 75\nwould have required unions to obtain employees’ affirma-\ntive consent before charging them fees to be used for polit-\nical purposes. Proposition 76 would have limited state\nspending and would have given the Governor the ability\nunder some circumstances to reduce state appropriations\nfor public-employee compensation. The SEIU joined a\ncoalition of public-sector unions in vigorously opposing\nthese measures. Calling itself the “Alliance for a Better\nCalifornia,” the group would eventually raise “more than\n$10 million, with almost all of it coming from public em-\nployee unions, including $2.75 million from state worker\nunions, $4.7 million from the California Teachers Associa-\ntion, and $700,000 from school workers unions.”1\n——————\n  1 Marinucci & Wildermuth, Schwarzenegger Adds Prop. 75 to His\n\nAgenda, San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 18, 2005, p. A–17.\n4              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   On July 30, shortly after the end of the 30-day objection\nperiod for the June Hudson notice, the SEIU proposed a\ntemporary 25% increase in employee fees, which it billed\nas an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Po-\nlitical Fight-Back Fund.” App. 25. The proposal stated\nthat the money was needed to achieve the union’s political\nobjectives, both in the special November 2005 election and\nin the November 2006 election. Id., at 26. According to\nthe proposal, money in the Fight-Back Fund would be\nused “for a broad range of political expenses, including\ntelevision and radio advertising, direct mail, voter regis-\ntration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in\nour work sites and in our communities across California.”\nIbid. The proposal specifically stated that “[t]he Fund will\nnot be used for regular costs of the union—such as office\nrent, staff salaries or routine equipment replacement, etc.”\nIbid. It noted that “all other public worker unions are in\nthe process of raising the extraordinary funds needed to\ndefeat the Governor.” Id., at 27. And it concluded: “Each\nof us must do our part to turn back these initiatives which\nwould allow the Governor to destroy our wages and bene-\nfits and even our jobs, and threaten the well-being of all\nCalifornians.” Ibid. On August 27, the SEIU’s General\nCouncil voted to implement the proposal.\n   On August 31, the SEIU sent out a letter addressed\nto “Local 1000 Members and Fair Share Fee Payers,” an-\nnouncing that, for a limited period, their fees would be\nraised to 1.25% of gross monthly salary and the $45-per-\nmonth cap on regular dues would not apply. Id., at 31.\nThe letter explained that the union would use the fund to\n“defeat Proposition 76 and Proposition 75 on November 8,”\nand to “defeat another attack on [its] pension plan” in\nJune 2006. Ibid. The letter also informed employees that,\nin the following year, the money would help “to elect a\ngovernor and a legislature who support public employees\nand the services [they] provide.” Ibid.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  After receiving this letter, one of the plaintiffs in this\ncase called the SEIU’s offices to complain that the union\nwas levying the special assessment for political purposes\nwithout giving employees a fair opportunity to object.\nAn SEIU area manager responded that “even if [the em-\nployee] objected to the payment of the full agency fee, there\nwas nothing he could do about the September increase for\nthe Assessment.” Knox v. Westly, No. 2:05–cv–02198, 2008\nWL 850128, *3 (ED Cal., Mar. 28, 2008). “She also stated\nthat ‘we are in the fight of our lives,’ that the Assessment\nwas needed, and that there was nothing that could be\ndone to stop the Union’s expenditure of that Assessment\nfor political purposes.” Ibid. As a consolation, however,\nthose employees who had filed timely objections after the\nregular June Hudson notice were required to pay only\n56.35% of the temporary increase.\n  Petitioners filed this class-action suit on behalf of 28,000\nnonunion employees who were forced to contribute money\nto the Political Fight-Back Fund. Some of the class mem-\nbers had filed timely objections after receiving the regular\nHudson notice in June, and others had not. Those who\nhad objected argued that it was wrong to require them to\npay 56.35% of the temporary assessment, which had been\nbilled as intended for use in making political expenditures\nthat they found objectionable. Those who had not objected\nafter receiving the June Hudson notice contended that\nthey should have received a new opportunity to object\nwhen the SEIU levied the special assessment for its Politi-\ncal Fight-Back Fund.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment for the\npetitioners, finding that the union “fully intended to use\nthe 12 million additional dollars it anticipated to raise for\npolitical purposes.” 2008 WL 850128, *7. “Even if every\ncent of the assessment was not intended to be used for\nentirely political purposes,” the court stated, “it is clear\nthat the Union’s intent was to depart drastically from its\n6               KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntypical spending regime and to focus on activities that\nwere political or ideological in nature.” Id., at *8. In light\nof this fact, the court held that it would be inappropriate\nfor the union to rely on previous annual expenditures to\nestimate that 56.35% of the new fee would go toward\nchargeable expenses. The court ordered the SEIU to send\nout a new notice giving all class members 45 days to object\nand to provide those who objected with a full refund of\ntheir contributions to the Political Fight-Back Fund. Id.,\nat *12.\n   A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. Knox\nv. California State Employees Assn., Local 1000, 628 F.\n3d 1115 (2010). According to the panel majority, Hudson\nprescribed the use of a balancing test. 628 F. 3d, at 1119–\n1120. The majority therefore inquired whether the proce-\ndure that the SEIU employed reasonably accommodated\nthe interests of the union, the employer, and nonmember\nemployees. Id., at 1120–1123. Judge Wallace dissented,\narguing that the majority had misinterpreted Hudson and\nsanctioned the abridgment of the First Amendment rights\nof nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1123–1139.\n   We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                            II\n   The SEIU argues that we should dismiss this case as\nmoot. In opposing the petition for certiorari, the SEIU\ndefended the decision below on the merits. After certiorari\nwas granted, however, the union sent out a notice offering\na full refund to all class members, and the union then\npromptly moved for dismissal of the case on the ground of\nmootness. Such postcertiorari maneuvers designed to\ninsulate a decision from review by this Court must be\nviewed with a critical eye. See City News & Novelty, Inc.\nv. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283–284 (2001). The vol-\nuntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinar-\nily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as\nsoon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v.\nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). And\nhere, since the union continues to defend the legality of\nthe Political Fight-Back fee, it is not clear why the union\nwould necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in\nthe future.\n    The union argues that concerns about voluntary cessa-\ntion are inapplicable in this case because petitioners do\nnot seek any prospective relief. See Motion to Dismiss as\nMoot 11–12. But even if that is so, the union’s mootness\nargument fails because there is still a live controversy as\nto the adequacy of the SEIU’s refund notice. A case be-\ncomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant\n“ ‘ “any effectual relief whatever” to the prevailing party.’ ”\nErie v. Pap’s A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 287 (2000) (quoting\nChurch of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9,\n12 (1992), in turn quoting Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651,\n653 (1895)). “[A]s long as the parties have a concrete\ninterest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation,\nthe case is not moot.” Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.\n435, 442 (1984).\n    The District Court ordered the SEIU to send out a\n“proper” notice giving employees an adequate opportunity\nto receive a full refund. 2008 WL 850128, *12. Petitioners\nargue that the notice that the SEIU sent was improper\nbecause it includes a host of “conditions, caveats, and\nconfusions as unnecessary complications aimed at reduc-\ning the number of class members who claim a refund.”\nBrief for Petitioners in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss\n19. In particular, petitioners allege that the union has\nrefused to accept refund requests by fax or e-mail and has\nmade refunds conditional upon the provision of an original\nsignature and a Social Security number. Id., at 18–19. As\nthis dispute illustrates, the nature of the notice may affect\nhow many employees who object to the union’s special\n8              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassessment will be able to get their money back. The\nunion is not entitled to dictate unilaterally the manner in\nwhich it advertises the availability of the refund.\n  For this reason, we conclude that a live controversy\nremains, and we proceed to the merits.\n                             III\n                              A\n   Our cases have often noted the close connection between\nour Nation’s commitment to self-government and the\nrights protected by the First Amendment.

C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 797 (1988) (The First\nAmendment protects “the decision of both what to say and\nwhat not to say” (emphasis deleted)). And the ability of\nlike-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of\nexpressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.\nSee Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.

In United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S.\n405 (2001), we considered the constitutionality of a state\nscheme that compelled such funding. The subject of the\nspeech at issue—promoting the sale of mushrooms—was\nnot one that is likely to stir the passions of many, but the\nmundane commercial nature of that speech only high-\nlights the importance of our analysis and our holding.\n   The federal Mushroom Promotion, Research, and Con-\nsumer Information Act required that fresh mushroom\nhandlers pay assessments used primarily to fund adver-\ntisements promoting mushroom sales. A large producer\nobjected to subsidizing these generic ads, and even though\nwe applied the less demanding standard used in prior\ncases to judge laws affecting commercial speech, we held\nthat the challenged scheme violated the First Amendment.\nWe made it clear that compulsory subsidies for private\nspeech are subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny\nand cannot be sustained unless two criteria are met.\nFirst, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme\n10             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvolving a “mandated association” among those who are\nrequired to pay the subsidy. Id., at 414. Such situations\nare exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere,\nmandatory associations are permissible only when they\nserve a “compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be\nachieved through means significantly less restrictive of\nassociational freedoms.” Roberts, supra, at 623. Second,\neven in the rare case where a mandatory association can\nbe justified, compulsory fees can be levied only insofar as\nthey are a “necessary incident” of the “larger regulatory\npurpose which justified the required association.” United\nFoods, supra, at 414.\n                              B\n   When a State establishes an “agency shop” that ex-\nacts compulsory union fees as a condition of public employ-\nment, “[t]he dissenting employee is forced to support\nfinancially an organization with whose principles and\ndemands he may disagree.” Ellis, 466 U. S., at 455.\nBecause a public-sector union takes many positions during\ncollective bargaining that have powerful political and civic\nconsequences, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49, the compulsory\nfees constitute a form of compelled speech and association\nthat imposes a “significant impingement on First Amend-\nment rights.” Ellis, supra, at 455. Our cases to date have\ntolerated this “impingement,” and we do not revisit today\nwhether the Court’s former cases have given adequate\nrecognition to the critical First Amendment rights at\nstake.\n   “The primary purpose” of permitting unions to collect\nfees from nonmembers, we have said, is “to prevent non-\nmembers from free-riding on the union’s efforts, sharing\nthe employment benefits obtained by the union’s collective\nbargaining without sharing the costs incurred.” Daven-\nport, 551 U. S., at 181. Such free-rider arguments, however,\nare generally insufficient to overcome First Amend-\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Consider the following examples:\n    “If a community association engages in a clean-up\n    campaign or opposes encroachments by industrial de-\n    velopment, no one suggests that all residents or prop-\n    erty owners who benefit be required to contribute. If\n    a parent-teacher association raises money for the\n    school library, assessments are not levied on all par-\n    ents. If an association of university professors has as\n    a major function bringing pressure on universities to\n    observe standards of tenure and academic freedom,\n    most professors would consider it an outrage to be re-\n    quired to join. If a medical association lobbies against\n    regulation of fees, not all doctors who share in the\n    benefits share in the costs.”2\n   Acceptance of the free-rider argument as a justification\nfor compelling nonmembers to pay a portion of union dues\nrepresents something of an anomaly—one that we have\nfound to be justified by the interest in furthering “labor\npeace.” Hudson, 475 U. S., at 303. But it is an anomaly\nnevertheless.\n   Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers to opt out\nof paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues—as\nopposed to exempting them from making such payments\nunless they opt in—represents a remarkable boon for\nunions. Courts “do not presume acquiescence in the loss of\nfundamental rights.” College Savings Bank v. Florida\nPrepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.

Once it is\nrecognized, as our cases have, that a nonmember cannot\nbe forced to fund a union’s political or ideological activi-\nties, what is the justification for putting the burden on\nthe nonmember to opt out of making such a payment?\n——————\n  2 Summers, Book Review, Sheldon Leader, Freedom of Association: A\n\nStudy in Labor Law and Political Theory, 16 Comparative Labor L. J.\n262, 268 (1995).\n12             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nShouldn’t the default rule comport with the probable\npreferences of most nonmembers? And isn’t it likely that\nmost employees who choose not to join the union that\nrepresents their bargaining unit prefer not to pay the full\namount of union dues? An opt-out system creates a risk\nthat the fees paid by nonmembers will be used to further\npolitical and ideological ends with which they do not\nagree. But a “[u]nion should not be permitted to exact a\nservice fee from nonmembers without first establishing a\nprocedure which will avoid the risk that their funds will\nbe used, even temporarily, to finance ideological activities\nunrelated to collective bargaining.” Hudson, supra, at 305\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Although the difference between opt-out and opt-in\nschemes is important, our prior cases have given sur-\nprisingly little attention to this distinction. Indeed, ac-\nceptance of the opt-out approach appears to have come\nabout more as a historical accident than through the\ncareful application of First Amendment principles.\n   The trail begins with dicta in Street, where we consid-\nered whether a federal collective-bargaining statute au-\nthorized a union to impose compulsory fees for political\nactivities. 367 U. S., at 774. The plaintiffs were employ-\nees who had affirmatively objected to the way their fees\nwere being used, and so we took that feature of the case\nfor granted. We held that the statute did not authorize\nthe use of the objecting employees’ fees for ideological\npurposes, and we stated in passing that “dissent is not\nto be presumed—it must affirmatively be made known to\nthe union by the dissenting employee.” Ibid. In making\nthat offhand remark, we did not pause to consider the\nbroader constitutional implications of an affirmative opt-out\nrequirement. Nor did we explore the extent of First\nAmendment protection for employees who might not qual-\nify as active “dissenters” but who would nonetheless prefer\nto keep their own money rather than subsidizing by de-\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Thus in Hudson we did not take issue with the\nunion’s practice of giving employees annual notice and an\nopportunity to object to expected political expenditures.\nAt the same time, however, we made it clear that the\nprocedures used by a union to collect money from non-\nmembers must satisfy a high standard.\n   Contrary to the view of the Ninth Circuit panel major-\nity, we did not call for a balancing of the “right” of the\nunion to collect an agency fee against the First Amend-\nment rights of nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1119–1120.\nAs we noted in Davenport, “unions have no constitutional\nentitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.” 551\nU. S., at 185. A union’s “collection of fees from nonmem-\nbers is authorized by an act of legislative grace,” 628 F. 3d,\nat 1126 (Wallace, J., dissenting)—one that we have\ntermed “unusual” and “extraordinary,” Davenport, supra,\nat 184, 187. Far from calling for a balancing of rights or\ninterests, Hudson made it clear that any procedure for\nexacting fees from unwilling contributors must be “care-\nfully tailored to minimize the infringement” of free speech\nrights. 475 U. S., at 303. And to underscore the meaning\nof this careful tailoring, we followed that statement with a\ncitation to cases holding that measures burdening the\nfreedom of speech or association must serve a “compelling\ninterest” and must not be significantly broader than nec-\nessary to serve that interest.3\n——————\n  3 The specific citation was as follows:\n  “See Roberts v.

The SEIU, how-\never, asks us to go farther. It asks us to approve a proce-\ndure under which (a) a special assessment billed for use\nin electoral campaigns was assessed without providing a\nnew opportunity for nonmembers to decide whether they\nwished to contribute to this effort and (b) nonmembers\nwho previously opted out were nevertheless required to\npay more than half of the special assessment even\nthough the union had said that the purpose of the fund\nwas to mount a political campaign and that it would not\nbe used for ordinary union expenses. This aggressive use\nof power by the SEIU to collect fees from nonmembers is\nindefensible.\n                              A\n  First, we see no justification for the union’s failure to\nprovide a fresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the prin-\nciple that nonmembers should not be required to fund a\nunion’s political and ideological projects unless they choose\nto do so after having “a fair opportunity” to assess the im-\npact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475\nU.

When a union levies a special\nassessment or raises dues as a result of unexpected devel-\nopments, the factors influencing a nonmember’s choice\nmay change. In particular, a nonmember may take special\nexception to the uses for which the additional funds are\nsought.4\n   The present case provides a striking example. The\nspecial assessment in this case was billed for use in a\nbroad electoral campaign designed to defeat two important\nand controversial ballot initiatives and to elect sympa-\nthetic candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial and legislative\nelections. There were undoubtedly nonmembers who, for\none reason or another, chose not to opt out or neglected to\ndo so when the standard Hudson notice was sent but who\ntook strong exception to the SEIU’s political objectives and\ndid not want to subsidize those efforts. These nonmem-\nbers might have favored one or both of the ballot initia-\ntives; they might have wished to support the reelection of\nthe incumbent Governor; or they might not have wanted\nto delegate to the union the authority to decide which\ncandidates in the 2006 elections would receive a share of\ntheir money.\n   The effect on nonmembers was particularly striking\nwith respect to the union’s campaign against Proposition\n75 because that initiative would have bolstered nonmem-\nber rights. If Proposition 75 had passed, nonmembers\nwould have been exempt from paying for the SEIU’s ex-\ntensive political projects unless they affirmatively con-\n——————\n  4 The dissent suggests that the union gave fair notice because it an-\n\nnounced at the beginning of the year that “ ‘[d]ues are subject to change\nwithout further notice to fee payers.’ ” Post, at 12 (opinion of BREYER,\nJ.). But a union cannot define the scope of its own notice obligations\nsimply by promulgating a clause giving itself the power to increase fees\nat any time for any purpose without further notice.\n16                KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsented. Thus, the effect of the SEIU’s procedure was to\nforce many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort\ndesigned to restrict their own rights.\n   As Hudson held, procedures for collecting fees from\nnonmembers must be carefully tailored to minimize im-\npingement on First Amendment rights, and the procedure\nused in this case cannot possibly be considered to have\nmet that standard. After the dues increase was adopted,\nthe SEIU wrote to all employees in the relevant bargain-\ning units to inform them of this development. It would\nhave been a relatively simple matter for the union to cast\nthis letter in the form of a new Hudson notice, so that\nnonmembers could decide whether they wanted to pay for\nthe union’s electoral project.\n   The SEIU argues that we should not be troubled by its\nfailure to provide a new notice because nonmembers who\nobjected to the special assessment but were nonetheless\nrequired to pay it would have been given the chance to\nrecover the funds in question by opting out when the next\nannual notice was sent. If the special assessment was\nused entirely or in part for nonchargeable purposes, they\nsuggest, the percentage of the union’s annual expenditures\nfor chargeable purposes would decrease, and therefore the\namount of the dues payable by objecting nonmembers the\nfollowing year would also decrease. This decrease, how-\never, would not fully recompense nonmembers who did not\nopt out after receiving the regular notice but would have\nopted out if they had been permitted to do so when the\nspecial assessment was announced.5 And in any event,\neven a full refund would not undo the violation of First\nAmendment rights. As we have recognized, the First\n\n——————\n  5 These nonmembers, after paying the full amount of the special as-\nsessment, would be required during the subsequent year to pay at least\nas much as those nonmembers who did opt out when they received the\ninitial Hudson notice.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

See Hudson, supra, at 305; Ellis, 466 U. S.,\nat 444. Here, for nonmembers who disagreed with the\nSEIU’s electoral objectives, a refund provided after the\nunion’s objectives had already been achieved would be cold\ncomfort.6\n  To respect the limits of the First Amendment, the union\nshould have sent out a new notice allowing nonmembers to\nopt in to the special fee rather than requiring them to opt\nout. Our cases have tolerated a substantial impingement\non First Amendment rights by allowing unions to impose\nan opt-out requirement at all. Even if this burden can be\njustified during the collection of regular dues on an annual\nbasis, there is no way to justify the additional burden of\nimposing yet another opt-out requirement to collect special\nfees whenever the union desires.\n\n                                    B\n                         1\n  The SEIU’s treatment of nonmembers who opted out\n——————\n  6 JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR contends that a new Hudson notice should be\nrequired only when a special assessment is imposed for political pur-\nposes. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as even the\ndissent acknowledges, post, at 7, such a rule would be unworkable.\nFirst, our cases have recognized that a union’s money is fungible, so\neven if the new fee were spent entirely for nonpolitical activities, it\nwould free up other funds to be spent for political purposes. See Retail\nClerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U. S. 746, 753 (1963) (noting that particu-\nlar fee earmarks are “of bookkeeping significance only rather than a\nmatter of real substance”). And second, unless we can rely on unions to\nadvertise the true purpose behind every special fee, it is not clear how a\ncourt could make a timely determination of whether each new fee is\npolitical in nature. It would be practically impossible to require the\nparties to litigate the purpose of every fee merely to determine whether\nnotice is required.\n18                KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of\nthe First Amendment. The SEIU required these employ-\nees to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, just as they\nhad been required to pay 56.35% of the regular annual\ndues. But the union proclaimed that the special assess-\nment would be used to support an electoral campaign and\nwould not be used for ordinary union expenses. Accord-\ningly, there is no reason to suppose that 56.35% of the new\nassessment was used for properly chargeable expenses.\nOn the contrary, if the union is to be taken at its word,\nvirtually all of the money was slated for nonchargeable\nuses.\n  The procedure accepted in Hudson is designed for use\nwhen a union sends out its regular annual dues notices.\nThe procedure is predicated on the assumption that a\nunion’s allocation of funds for chargeable and noncharge-\nable purposes is not likely to vary greatly from one year to\nthe next.7 No such assumption is reasonable, however,\nwhen a union levies a special assessment or raises dues as\na result of events that were not anticipated or disclosed at\nthe time when a yearly Hudson notice was sent. Accord-\ningly, use of figures based on an audit of the union’s oper-\nations during an entire previous year makes no sense.\n  Nor would it be feasible to devise a new breakdown of\nchargeable and nonchargeable expenses for the special\nassessment. Determining that breakdown is problematic\nenough when it is done on a regular annual basis because\nauditors typically do not make a legal determination as to\nwhether particular expenditures are chargeable. Instead,\n——————\n  7 The SEIU contends that “[s]ignificant fluctuations in the chargeable\n\nand nonchargeable proportions of a union’s spending are inevitable,”\nBrief for Respondent 13, and the dissent appears to agree, post, at 10.\nBut if the Hudson Court had proceeded on this assumption it is doubt-\nful that it would have found it acceptable for a union to rely solely on\nthe breakdown in the most recent year rather than computing the\naverage breakdown over a longer period.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe auditors take the union’s characterization for granted\nand perform the simple accounting function of “ensur[ing]\nthat the expenditures which the union claims it made for\ncertain expenses were actually made for those expenses.”\nAndrews v. Education Assn. of Cheshire, 829 F. 2d 335,\n340 (CA2 1987). Thus, if a union takes a very broad view\nof what is chargeable—if, for example, it believes that\nsupporting sympathetic political candidates is chargeable\nand bases its classification on that view—the auditors will\nclassify these political expenditures as chargeable. Object-\ning employees may then contest the union’s chargeability\ndeterminations, but the onus is on the employees to come\nup with the resources to mount the legal challenge in a\ntimely fashion.8 See, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 513; Jib-\nson v. Michigan Ed. Assn., 30 F. 3d 723, 730 (CA6 1994).\nThis is already a significant burden for employees to bear\nsimply to avoid having their money taken to subsidize\nspeech with which they disagree, and the burden would\nbecome insupportable if unions could impose a new as-\nsessment at any time, with a new chargeability determi-\nnation to be challenged.\n                             2\n  The SEIU argues that objecting nonmembers who were\nrequired to pay 56.35% of the special assessment, far\nfrom subsidizing the union’s political campaign, actually\nreceived a windfall. According to the union’s statistics, the\nactual percentage of regular dues and fees spent for\nchargeable purposes in 2005 turned out to be quite a bit\nhigher (66.26%), and therefore, even if all of the money\nobtained through the special assessment is classified as\nnonchargeable, the union’s total expenditures for 2005\n——————\n  8 The dissent is comforted by the fact that the union “has offered to\npay for neutral arbitration of such disputes before the American Arbi-\ntration Association,” post, at 9, but the painful burden of initiating and\nparticipating in such disputes cannot be so easily relieved.\n20              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere at least 66.26% chargeable. See Brief for Respond-\nent 5, n. 6. This argument is unpersuasive for several\nreasons.\n    First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of charge-\nable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place\nmuch reliance on its statistics. In its brief, the SEIU\nargues broadly that all funds spent on “lobbying . . . the\nelectorate” are chargeable. See id., at 51. But “lobbying\n. . . the electorate” is nothing but another term for support-\ning political causes and candidates, and we have never\nheld that the First Amendment permits a union to compel\nnonmembers to support such political activities. On the\ncontrary, as long ago as Street, we noted the important\ndifference between a union’s authority to engage in collec-\ntive bargaining and related activities on behalf of non-\nmember employees in a bargaining unit and the union’s\nuse of nonmembers’ money “to support candidates for\npublic office” or “to support political causes which [they]\noppos[e].” 367 U. S., at 768.\n    The sweep of the SEIU’s argument is highlighted by its\ndiscussion of the use of fees paid by objecting nonmembers\nto defeat Proposition 76. According to the SEIU, these\nexpenditures were “germane” to the implementation of its\ncontracts because, if Proposition 76 had passed, it would\nhave “effectively permitted the Governor to abrogate the\nUnion’s collective bargaining agreements under certain\ncircumstances, undermining the Union’s ability to perform\nits representation duty of negotiating effective collective\nbargaining agreements.” Brief for Respondent 49–50\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n    If we were to accept this broad definition of germane-\nness, it would effectively eviscerate the limitation on the\nuse of compulsory fees to support unions’ controversial\npolitical activities. Public-employee salaries, pensions,\nand other benefits constitute a substantial percentage of\nthe budgets of many States and their subdivisions. As a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult, a broad array of ballot questions and campaigns for\npublic office may be said to have an effect on present and\nfuture contracts between public-sector workers and their\nemployers. If the concept of “germaneness” were as broad\nas the SEIU advocates, public-sector employees who do\nnot endorse the unions’ goals would be essentially unpro-\ntected against being compelled to subsidize political and\nideological activities to which they object.\n  Second, even if the SEIU’s statistics are accurate, it does\nnot follow that it was proper for the union to charge object-\ning nonmembers 56.35%—or any other particular per-\ncentage—of the special assessment. Unless it is possible to\ndetermine in advance with some degree of accuracy the\npercentage of union funds that will be used during an\nupcoming year for chargeable purposes—and the SEIU\nargues that this is not possible—there is at least a risk\nthat, at the end of the year, unconsenting nonmembers\nwill have paid either too much or too little. Which side\nshould bear this risk?\n  The answer is obvious: the side whose constitutional\nrights are not at stake. “Given the existence of acceptable\nalternatives, [a] union cannot be allowed to commit dis-\nsenters’ funds to improper uses even temporarily.” Ellis,\n466 U. S., at 444. Thus, if unconsenting nonmembers pay\ntoo much, their First Amendment rights are infringed. On\nthe other hand, if unconsenting nonmembers pay less than\ntheir proportionate share, no constitutional right of the\nunion is violated because the union has no constitutional\nright to receive any payment from these employees. See\nDavenport, 551 U. S., at 185. The union has simply lost\nfor a few months the “extraordinary” benefit of being em-\npowered to compel nonmembers to pay for services that\nthey may not want and in any event have not agreed to\nfund.\n  As we have noted, by allowing unions to collect any fees\nfrom nonmembers and by permitting unions to use opt-out\n22                 KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrather than opt-in schemes when annual dues are billed,\nour cases have substantially impinged upon the First\nAmendment rights of nonmembers. In the new situation\npresented here, we see no justification for any further\nimpingement. The general rule—individuals should not\nbe compelled to subsidize private groups or private speech—\nshould prevail.\n   Public-sector unions have the right under the First\nAmendment to express their views on political and social\nissues without government interference. See, e.g., Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).\nBut employees who choose not to join a union have the\nsame rights. The First Amendment creates a forum in\nwhich all may seek, without hindrance or aid from the\nState, to move public opinion and achieve their political\ngoals. “First Amendment values [would be] at serious risk\nif the government [could] compel a particular citizen, or a\ndiscrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for\nspeech on the side that [the government] favors.” United\nFoods, 533 U. S., at 411. Therefore, when a public-sector\nunion imposes a special assessment or dues increase, the\nunion must provide a fresh Hudson notice and may not\nexact any funds from nonmembers without their affirma-\ntive consent.9\n——————\n  9 Contrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s suggestion, our holding does not\n\nventure beyond the scope of the questions on which we granted review\nor the scope of the parties’ dispute. The second question on which we\ngranted review broadly asks us to determine the circumstances under\nwhich a State may deduct from the pay of nonunion employees money\nthat is used by a union for general electioneering. See Pet. for Cert. (i)\n(“May a State, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\ncondition continued public employment on the payment of union\nagency fees for purposes of financing political expenditures for ballot\nmeasures?”). Our holding—that this may be done only when the em-\nployee affirmatively consents—falls within that question.\n  Our holding also addresses the primary remaining dispute between\nthe parties, namely, the particular procedures that must be followed on\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

See supra, at 7–8. Petitioners argue strenuously that\nthese procedures must be narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on\ntheir free-speech rights. See Brief for Petitioners 11–17. We see no\nsensible way to address this dispute without confronting the question\nwhether, in the particular context present here, an opt-out regime\nsuffices.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would apparently have us proceed on the as-\nsumption that an opt-out regime is permitted. She would then have us\ndecide what sort of opt-out procedures would be sufficient if such a\nregime were allowed at all. But that is a question that simply cannot\nbe answered. It would be like asking what sort of procedural require-\nments would be required if the government set out to do something\nelse that the First Amendment flatly prohibits—for example, requiring\nprepublication approval of newspapers.\n  There is also no merit in JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s and JUSTICE BREYER’s\ncomments about prior precedent. This case concerns the procedures\nthat must be followed when a public-sector union announces a special\nassessment or mid-year dues increase. No prior decision of this Court\nhas addressed that question, and Hudson says not one word on the\nsubject.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

I therefore concur in the Court’s judgment.\n   I concur only in the judgment, however, because I can-\nnot agree with the majority’s decision to address unneces-\nsarily significant constitutional issues well outside the\nscope of the questions presented and briefing. By doing so,\nthe majority breaks our own rules and, more importantly,\ndisregards principles of judicial restraint that define the\nCourt’s proper role in our system of separated powers.\n                              I\n   The Political Fight-Back Fund was to be used by Service\nEmployees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), “spe-\ncifically in the political arenas of California” to defeat\nperceived antiunion initiatives and to elect a sympathetic\nGovernor and legislature. App. 25; see also id., at 31. As\nthe majority explains, such political efforts are not “ger-\nmane” to the union’s function as a bargaining represent-\native, and accordingly are not chargeable to objecting\nnonmembers. See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S.\n2                  KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n507, 519 (1991); see also Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207,\n211 (2009) (“[N]onchargeable union activities [include]\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities”). While\nthe union is free to pursue its ideological goals in the\npolitical arena, it may not subsidize its efforts with object-\ning nonmembers’ funds, lest the objector be used as “ ‘an in-\nstrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological\npoint of view he finds unacceptable.’ ” Lehnert, 500 U. S.,\nat 522 (plurality opinion) (quoting Wooley v. Maynard, 430\nU. S. 705, 715 (1977)).\n   Accordingly, when a union levies a special assessment\nor dues increase to fund political activities, the union may\nnot collect funds from nonmembers who earlier had ob-\njected to the payment of nonchargeable expenses, and may\nnot collect funds from other nonmembers without provid-\ning a new Hudson notice and opportunity to opt out. See\nTeachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986). Because SEIU\nfailed to follow these procedures, it did not satisfy its\nconstitutional obligations. That holding should end this\ncase; it is all petitioners asked this Court to decide.1\n                             II\n  The majority agrees that SEIU’s actions were at odds\nwith the First Amendment.

They did not argue that the Constitution re-\nquires an opt-in system of fee collection in the context of\nspecial assessments or dues increases or, indeed, in any\ncontext. Not surprisingly, respondents did not address\nsuch a prospect.\n   Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the questions set\nout in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be con-\nsidered by the Court.” “[W]e disregard [that rule] ‘only\nin the most exceptional cases,’ where reasons of urgency\nor economy suggest the need to address the unpresented\nquestion in the case under consideration.” Yee v. Escon-\ndido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (quoting Stone v. Powell,\n428 U. S. 465, 481, n. 15 (1976)). The majority does not claim\n any such exceptional circumstance here. Yet it reaches\nout to hold that “when a public-sector union imposes a\nspecial assessment or dues increase, the union must pro-\nvide a fresh Hudson notice and may not exact any funds\nfrom nonmembers without their affirmative consent.” Ante,\nat 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 17 (“[T]he\nunion should have sent out a new notice allowing non-\nmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring\nthem to opt out”). The majority thus decides, for the very\nfirst time, that the First Amendment does require an opt-\nin system in some circumstances: the levying of a special\nassessment or dues increase. The majority announces its\nnovel rule without any analysis of potential countervailing\narguments and without any reflection on the reliance\ninterests our old rules have engendered.\n   The majority’s choice to reach an issue not presented by\nthe parties, briefed, or argued, disregards our rules. See\nYee, 503 U. S., at 535. And it ignores a fundamental\npremise of our adversarial system: “ ‘that appellate courts\n4                  KNOX v.

The imperative of judicial\nrestraint is at its zenith here, with respect to an issue of\nsuch constitutional magnitude, for “[i]f there is one doc-\ntrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of\nconstitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass\non questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudica-\ntion is unavoidable.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 690,\nn. 11 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).2\n——————\n   2 The majority contends that its holding “does not venture beyond\n\nthe scope of the questions on which we granted review,” pointing to the\nsecond question presented. Ante, at 22, n. 9. The majority is mistaken.\nThat question concerns the chargeability of political and lobbying\nactivities under Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 522\n(1991), not the procedures by which a union may collect fees. See\nPet. for Cert. (i); id., at 20–27 (describing scope of second question pre-\nsented); id., at 23 (“There is a serious split, and confusion, among the\ncircuits on the chargeability of union political and lobbying activities”).\nIndeed, it is only petitioners’ first question presented that deals with\nfee-collection procedures. And in that question, petitioners ask this\nCourt to hold that SEIU may not collect its special assessment without\nproviding a Hudson notice that offers “an opportunity to object to” the\ndeduction of fees for the assessment. Id., at (i) (emphasis added).\n   The phrase “opt in” appears not once in petitioners’ briefing.

After\ntoday, must a union undertaking a special assessment or\ndues increase obtain affirmative consent to collect “any\nfunds” or solely to collect funds for nonchargeable ex-\npenses? May a nonmember opt not to contribute to a\nspecial assessment, even if the assessment is levied to\nfund uncontestably chargeable activities? Does the ma-\njority’s new rule allow for any distinction between non-\nmembers who had earlier objected to the payment of\nnonchargeable expenses and those who had not? What\nprocedures govern this new world of fee collection?\n   Moreover, while the majority’s novel rule is, on its face,\nlimited to special assessments and dues increases, the\nmajority strongly hints that this line may not long endure.\nThe majority pronounces the Court’s explicit holding in\nMachinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 774 (1961)—that\n“dissent is not to be presumed[,] it must affirmatively be\nmade known to the union by the dissenting employee”—\nnothing but an “offhand remark,” made by Justices who\ndid not “pause to consider the broader constitutional\nimplications of an affirmative opt-out requirement,” ante,\nat 12. The reader is told that our precedents’ “acceptance\nof the opt-out approach appears to have come about more\nas a historical accident than through the careful applica-\ntion of First Amendment principles.” Ibid. And that “[b]y\nauthorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers and\npermitting the use of an opt-out system for the collection\n——————\nmajority’s view, unconstitutional. But if the Court was dissatisfied\nwith the scope of the questions presented here it should not have\ngranted certiorari in this case. Or having granted it, the Court should\nhave asked for supplemental briefing on the question whether an opt-in\nregime is constitutionally required. What it should not have done—\ncannot do under our rules—is decide that question without having\nprovided the parties and potential amici an opportunity to weigh in\nwith their own considered views.\n6              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof fees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior\ndecisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what\nthe First Amendment can tolerate.” Ante, at 14 (emphasis\nadded); see also ante, at 21–22 (“[B]y allowing unions to\ncollect any fees from nonmembers and by permitting\nunions to use opt-out rather than opt-in schemes when\nannual dues are billed, our cases have substantially im-\npinged upon the First Amendment rights of nonmem-\nbers”); ante, at 11–12 (“Once it is recognized . . . that a\nnonmember cannot be forced to fund a union’s political or\nideological activities, what is the justification for putting\nthe burden on the nonmember to opt out of making such a\npayment? Shouldn’t the default rule comport with the\nprobable preferences of most nonmembers?”).\n   To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedent is a\nstep we historically take only with the greatest caution\nand reticence. To do so, as the majority does, on our own\ninvitation and without adversarial presentation is both\nunfair and unwise. It deprives the parties and potential\namici of the opportunity to brief and argue the question.\nIt deprives us of the benefit of argument that the parties,\nwith concrete interests in the question, are surely better\npositioned than we to set forth.

Hudson, 475 U. S. 292 (1986), this Court\nunanimously held that “the Union cannot be faulted for\ncalculating its fee on the basis of its expenses during the\npreceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18. That is precisely what\nthe union has done in this case. I see no reason to modify\nHudson’s holding as here applied. I consequently dissent.\n                              I\n   In Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), the\nCourt held that nonunion public employees have a First\nAmendment right to prevent a union’s spending a part of\ntheir compulsory fees on contributions to political candi-\ndates or on “express[ions of ] political views unrelated to\n[the union’s] duties as exclusive bargaining representa-\ntive.” Id., at 234. A decade later in Hudson, the Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of procedures adopted to\nimplement Abood. In particular, the Court considered the\nprocedures adopted by a teachers union “to draw that\nnecessary line and to respond to nonmembers’ objections\nto the manner in which it was drawn.” 475 U. S., at 294.\n   The teachers union had calculated the fee it could\ncharge nonmembers during a particular year on the basis\nof the expenditures the union actually made during the\n2              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprior year. Those nonmembers who objected to the ap-\nportionment, believing their fee too high, could lodge an\nobjection with the union, proceed through arbitration, and\nreceive a rebate if they won. The Court found this proce-\ndure constitutionally inadequate. It thought that (1) a\nrebate “does not avoid the risk that dissenters’ funds may\nbe used temporarily for an improper purpose,” (2) the\nunion had not provided the nonmembers in advance with\n“sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the un-\nion’s fee,” and (3) the union did not provide objectors\nwith “a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial deci-\nsionmaker.” Id., at 305–307.\n   The Court then held that the Constitution requires that\na union collecting a fee from nonmembers provide “an\nadequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably\nprompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee\nbefore an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the\namounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are\npending.” Id., at 310.\n   The Court added that it “recognize[d] that there are\npractical reasons why ‘[a]bsolute precision’ in the calcula-\ntion of the charge to nonmembers cannot be ‘expected or\nrequired.’ ” Id., at 307, n. 18 (quoting Railway Clerks v.\nAllen, 373 U. S. 113, 122 (1963)). It said that the union\nretains the burden of proving that a given expense is\nchargeable to nonmembers, the “nonmember’s ‘burden’ ” be-\ning simply that of making “his objection known.” 475 U. S.,\nat 306, n. 16. And it added that the union “cannot\nbe faulted for calculating its fee on the basis of its ex-\npenses during the preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.\n   For the last 25 years unions and employers across\nthe Nation have relied upon this Court’s statements in\nHudson in developing administratively workable systems\nthat (1) allow unions to pay the costs of fulfilling their\nrepresentational obligations to both members and non-\nmembers alike, while (2) simultaneously protecting the\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Railway\nClerks, 466 U. S. 435, 447 (1984)). See also Keller v. State\nBar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 17 (1990) (explaining that Hudson\n“outlined a minimum set of procedures by which a union\nin an agency-shop relationship could meet its requirement\nunder Abood”). The Court, in my view, should not depart,\nor create an exception, from Hudson’s framework here.\n                              II\n  Because the administrative details of the fee collection\nprocess are critical, I shall begin by explaining how I un-\nderstand that process to work. The union here followed\na basic administrative system that ensures that the\nfee charged to objecting nonmembers matches their pro\nrata share of the union’s chargeable expenditures, but it\nachieves that match only over a period of several years.\nAt the end of 2004, independent auditors determined the\namount of chargeable (e.g., collective-bargaining related)\nexpenditures and the amount of nonchargeable (e.g., non-\ngermane political) expenditures that the union ac-\ntually made during 2004. The union then used the resulting\nproportion (which was about 56% chargeable, 44% non-\nchargeable) as the basis for apportioning the next year’s\ndues. Thus in June 2005, the union sent all represented\nemployees a Hudson notice setting forth that (roughly) 56\nto 44 figure. App. 96–106. It provided time for nonmem-\nbers to object or to challenge the figure or underlying data.\nId., at 98–104. And it then applied the resulting figure to\ndetermine the percentage of the total fee that objecting\nnonmembers would have to pay during the next fee-year,\nwhich ran from July 2005 to June 2006. Id., at 102. At\nthe end of 2005, auditors again examined the union’s\nactual expenditures made during 2005. And the union\nthen used those newly audited figures to determine the\n4              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nchargeable percentage for the fee-year 2006–2007. Id., at\n158. Since political expenditures during calendar year\n2005 turned out to be lower than in 2004, the new charge-\nable share amounted to about 69% of the total fee bill.\nIbid.\n   Simplifying further to illustrate, I shall describe the\nsystem as (1) using audited accounts for Year One to\ndetermine the proportion of the fee that objectors must\npay during Year Two, and (2) using audited accounts for\nYear Two to determine the proportion of the fee that ob-\njectors must pay during Year Three. If Year One’s\nchargeable share (as applied to Year Two) turns out to be\ntoo high, Year Two’s audited accounts will reflect that fact,\nand the payable share for Year Three will be reduced\naccordingly.\n   This system does not put typical objectors to any dis-\nadvantage. If, say, in Year One total expenses were\n$1 million, collective-bargaining expenses amounted to\n$600,000, and political expenses amounted to $400,000,\nthen the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more\nthan 60% of normal dues in Year Two. If in Year Two\ncollective-bargaining expenses turned out to be a lesser\nshare of total expenses, say 30%, then the union cannot\ncharge objecting nonmembers more than 30% of the total\nfee in Year Three. Normally, what the objecting nonmem-\nbers lose on the swings they will gain on the roundabouts.\n   This kind of basic administrative system is imperfect.\nThe nature of a union’s expenditures, including non-\nchargeable political expenditures, varies from year to year,\nfor political needs differ at different stages of political\ncycles. Thus, last year’s percentages will often fail to\nmatch this year’s expenditures patterns. And the possibil-\nity that an objecting nonmember’s funds will temporarily\nhelp the union pay for a nonchargeable political expendi-\nture (say, in Year Two) is always present—though in this\ncase that did not happen. See infra, at 6–7.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nonetheless this kind of system enjoys an offsetting\nadministrative virtue. It bases fees upon audited ac-\ncounts, thereby avoiding the difficulties and disagree-\nments that would surround an effort to determine the\nrelevant proportions by trying to measure union expendi-\ntures as they occur or by trying to make predictions about\nthe nature of future expenditures. It consequently gives\nworkers reliable information. It gives workers advance\nnotice of next year’s payable charge. It gives nonmembers\na “reasonably prompt” opportunity to object. Hudson, 475\nU. S., at 310. And, where the chargeable share of next\nyear’s expenses (Year Two) turns out to be lower than last\nyear’s (Year One), it provides offsetting compensation in\nthe form of a lower payable share for the following year\n(Year Three).\n  In any event, these features are characteristic of an\nadministrative system that “calculat[es]” shares of a un-\nion’s fee “on the basis of its expenses during the preceding\nyear.” Id., at 307, n. 18. Hudson stated specifically that\nthe “[u]nion cannot be faulted for calculating its fee” on\nthat basis. Ibid. And no party here has challenged the\nconstitutional validity of that basic administrative system.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.\n                             III\n  If the union’s basic administrative system does not\nviolate the Constitution, then how could its special as-\nsessment have done so? In my view, it did not violate the\nConstitution, and I shall explain my basis for thinking\nso by considering separately (1) those nonmembers who\nobjected initially to the 2005 Hudson notice, and (2) those\nnonmembers who did not initially object.\n                           A\n The special assessment as administered here has\nworked no constitutional harm upon those nonunion em-\n6              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nployees who raised a general objection at the beginning of\nthe year. The union has honored their objections by sub-\ntracting from their special payments the same 44% that it\nsubtracts from each of their ordinary monthly payments.\nApp. 309. And we know that the special assessment here\ndid not even work temporary constitutional harm. That is\nbecause audited figures showed that the union’s total\nnonchargeable (e.g., political) expenses for that year ended\nup as a lower percentage of total expenses than the pre-\nvious year. Hence the objecting nonmembers ended up\nbeing charged too little, not too much, even with the spe-\ncial assessment thrown into the mix.\n  Let me put the point more specifically. The union’s\nJune 2005 Hudson notice said that the union would\ncharge objecting nonmembers roughly 56% of the dues\npaid by union members. See App. 102. That 56% figure\nrepresented the chargeable portion of expenditures accord-\ning to the audited figures from 2004. Thus, if the fee\ncharged to a union member pursuant to the 2005 notice\nwas $400, the fee charged to an objecting nonmember was\n$224. The union similarly prorated the special assess-\nment charging objecting nonmembers 56% of the assess-\nment it imposed upon members. Thus, if the special\nassessment amounted to $50 for a member, it amounted to\n$28 for an objecting nonmember. And total dues in this\nexample would have amounted to $450 for a member and\n$252 for a nonmember.\n  In the event, the union’s chargeable expenses for 2005—\nincluding the funds raised pursuant to the special assess-\nment—amounted to more than 56% of its total expendi-\ntures. The auditor’s reports show that the union’s total\nexpenditures in 2005 amounted to $40,045,409. Id.,\nat 166. Chargeable expenses amounted to $27,552,746,\nwhich works out to 69% of the total budget. Ibid. Thus, a\nsubstantially larger portion of the union’s 2005 spending\nwas chargeable (69%) than it had been in 2004 (56%).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nObjecting nonmembers therefore paid 56% of normal fees,\neven though the chargeable share that year was 69%.\nThat is to say, they paid less than what the Constitution\nconsiders to be their fair share. See Abood, 431 U. S., at\n236–237.\n   Even were the underlying facts different, I can find no\nconstitutional basis for charging an objecting nonmember\nless than the 56% that the preceding year’s audit showed\nwas appropriate. In general, any effort to send a new\nnotice and then apply special percentages to a special\nmidyear assessment fee runs into administrative difficul-\nties that, as explained above, are avoided with a retrospec-\ntive system. See supra, at 6. And, of course, requiring the\nuse of some special proportion based on predicted expendi-\ntures would contradict Hudson’s determination that prior\nyear, not present year, expenditures can form the basis for\nthe determination of that proportion. See Hudson, supra,\nat 307, n. 18.\n   In the particular example before us these general prob-\nlems are camouflaged by the fact that the union itself said\nthat the assessment was to be used for political purposes.\nHence it is tempting to say that 100% of the assessment\nis not chargeable. But future cases are most unlikely to\nbe so clear; disputes will arise over union predictions (say,\nthat only 20% of the special assessment will be used for\npolitical purposes); and the Court will then perhaps un-\nderstand the wisdom of Hudson’s holding. In any event,\nwe have made clear in other cases that money is fungible.\nRetail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U. S. 746, 753 (1963).\nWhether a particular expenditure was funded by regular\ndues or the special assessment is “of bookkeeping signifi-\ncance only rather than a matter of real substance.” Ibid.\nAnd, the Court’s focus on the announced purposes of the\nspecial assessment, rather than yearly expenditures taken\nas a whole, is beside the point.\n   The Court’s response to these problems, particularly the\n8              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadministrative calculation problems, is apparently to de-\npart yet further from the Court’s earlier holdings. It\nseems to say that an objector can withhold 100%, not\nsimply of a special assessment made for political purposes,\nbut of any special assessment whatsoever, including an\nassessment made solely for the purpose of paying for extra\nchargeable costs, such as extended contract negotiations,\npension plan experts, or newly assessed contributions to\nreplenish a national union’s collective-bargaining assis-\ntance funds. See ante, at 21–22. Although this rule is\ncomparatively simple to administer, it cannot be recon-\nciled with the Court’s previous constitutional holdings.\nAbood, along with every related case the Court has ever\ndecided, makes clear that the Constitution allows a union\nto assess nonmembers a pro rata share of fees insofar\nas they are used to pay for these kinds of collective-\nbargaining expenses. See 431 U. S., at 234–236; see also\nLehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991);\nMachinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 760 (1961); Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 447; Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551\nU. S. 177, 181 (2007); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207, 210\n(2009). How could the majority now hold to the contrary?\n   If there are good reasons for requiring departure from\nthe basic Hudson-approved administrative system, they\nare not the reasons the Court provides. It suggests that\nthe basic Hudson administrative system gives the union\nthe freedom to misclassify, arguing, for example, that the\nunion has adopted an overly broad definition of charge-\nability. See ante, at 20–21. The 2005 proportion, however,\nrested upon audited 2004 accounts. While petitioners\nargue in this Court that the union misclassified parts\nof the special assessment (which was not imposed until\n2005), no brief filed in this case (and certainly no court\nbelow) has challenged the accuracy of the 2004 figures or\nthe resulting chargeable/nonchargeable allocation. In-\ndeed, the 2004 accounts were audited before the special\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nassessment at the center of this case was even imposed.\nCompare App. 108 (reflecting that the audit of the 2004\nbudget was completed by April 25, 2005) with id., at 25\n(reflecting approval of the special assessment on July 30,\n2005).\n    More specifically, the Court suggests that the Consti-\ntution prohibits the union’s classification of money spent\n“ ‘lobbying . . . the electorate’ ” as a chargeable expense.\nSee ante, at 20. But California state law explicitly permits\nthe union to classify some lobbying expenses as charge-\nable. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §3515.8 (West 2010) (a\nnonmember’s fair share includes “the costs of support\nof lobbying activities designed to foster policy goals and\ncollective negotiations and contract administration”); see\nalso Lillebo v. Davis, 222 Cal. App. 3d 1421, 1442, 272 Cal.\nRptr. 638, 651 (1990) (construing §3515.8 narrowly, but\nexplaining that “[w]e cannot fathom how a union’s lobby-\ning the Legislature for improvement of the conditions of\nemployment of the members of its bargaining unit . . .\ncould not be considered to be part of its role as representa-\ntive . . .”). No one has attacked the constitutionality of\nCalifornia’s law; no brief argues the question; and this\nCourt does not normally find state laws unconstitutional\nwithout, at least, giving those who favor the law an oppor-\ntunity to argue the matter.\n    The Court further complains that the basic administra-\ntive system requires an objecting nonmember to “come up\nwith the resources to mount” a “legal challenge” to the\nunion’s allocation “in a timely fashion.” Ante, at 19. That\nconcern too is misplaced. The union has offered to pay for\nneutral arbitration of such disputes before the American\nArbitration Association. App. 103–104. And, again, inso-\nfar as the Court casts doubt on the constitutional validity\nof the basic system, the Court does so without the benefit\nof argument.\n    Finally, the Court argues that (Step 1) Hudson is “pred-\n10              KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nicated on the assumption that a union’s allocation of funds\nfor chargeable and nonchargeable purposes is not likely to\nvary greatly from one year to the next,” ante, at 18; that\n(Step 2) this assumption does not apply to midyear as-\nsessments; hence (Step 3) what appears binding precedent\n(namely Hudson) does not bind the Court in its interpreta-\ntion of the Constitution as applied to those assessments.\nIbid.\n   I must jump this logical ship, however, at Step 1. I\ncannot find in Hudson the “assumption” of uniform ex-\npenditures that the Court says underlies it. The assump-\ntion does not appear there explicitly. And it is hard to\nbelieve any such assumption could implicitly lurk within\na case involving a union’s political expenditures. Those\nexpenditures inevitably vary from political season to\nseason. They inevitably depend upon the number and\nkind of union-related matters currently visible on the\npolitical agenda. Cf., e.g., App. 102, 158, 223 (union’s\nchargeability proportion varies significantly over three\nyears, from 56.35% in 2004, to 68.8% in 2005, to 60.3% in\n2006). And it is hard to believe that the Members of this\nCourt, when deciding Abood, were not fully aware of these\nobvious facts.\n                               B\n  A stronger case can be made for allowing nonmember\nemployees who did not object at the beginning of the dues\nyear to object (for the first time) to a special assessment.\nThat is because, unlike the nonmember who objected\ninitially, the union will not permit that initially nonobject-\ning nonmember to withhold anything from the special\nassessment fee. Nonetheless, there are powerful reasons\nnot to allow the nonmember who did not object initially to\nthe annual fee to object now for the first time to the mid-\nyear special assessment.\n  For one thing, insofar as a new objection permits the\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnew objector to withhold only the portion of the fee that\nwill pay for nonchargeable expenses (as the logic of the\nconcurring Justices would suggest), the administrative\nproblems that I earlier discussed apply. See supra, at 6.\nThat is to say, unions, arbitrators, and courts will have to\ndetermine, on the basis of a prediction, how much of the\nspecial assessment the new objector can withhold. I con-\ncede that many administrative problems could be over-\ncome were the new objector allowed to withhold only the\nsame 44% of the fee that the union here permitted ini-\ntial objectors to withhold (a figure based on 2004 au-\ndited accounts). But no Member of the Court takes that\napproach.\n   For another thing, as I have previously pointed out, the\nCourt would permit nonmembers who did not object at the\nbeginning of the year (like those who did then object) to\nobject to (and to pay none of) every special assessment,\nincluding those made to raise money to pay additional\ncollective-bargaining expenses. This approach may avoid\nthe uncertainty and resulting disputes inherent in an ef-\nfort to limit withholding to the nonchargeable portion of\nthe fee. But the price of avoiding those disputes is to\nreduce the financial contribution the union will receive\neven when a special assessment pays only for unexpected\nbut perfectly legitimate collective-bargaining expenses.\nSee supra, at 8–10.\n   Moreover, to provide a new opportunity to object re-\nquires providing for explanations, potential challenges, the\ndevelopment of separate accounts, and additional adminis-\ntrative procedures. That means providing extra time and\nextra money. By definition, however, special assessments\nare special; time may matter; and unlike the annual dues\npayment, the union is unlikely to be able to provide what\nis here a 6-month delay (between the close of the 2004\naudited year and the beginning of the next mid-2005 dues\nyear) that can be used to examine accounts and process\n12             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nobjections. In a word, a new opportunity to object means\ntime, effort, and funds set aside to deal with a new layer of\nadministrative procedure.\n   I recognize that allowing objections only once a year is\nonly one possible way to administer a fee-charging system.\nIn principle, one might allow nonmembers to pose new\nobjections to their dues payments biannually, or quarterly,\nor even once a month, as actual expenses do, or do not,\ncorrespond to initial union predictions. But for constitu-\ntional purposes the critical fact is that annual objection is\nat least one reasonably practical way to permit the princi-\npled objector to avoid paying for politics with which he\ndisagrees. See Hudson, 475 U. S., at 307, n. 18. And that\nis so whether ordinary or special assessments are at stake.\n   Further, the nonmember who did not object initially is\nnot likely to be a nonmember who strongly opposes the\nunion’s politics. That many unions take political posi-\ntions and that they spend money seeking to advance those\npositions is not exactly a secret. All those whom this\nunion represents know from history that it spends money\neach year for nonchargeable purposes. And any nonmem-\nber who has significant negative views about such matters\nis likely to have objected in advance. Those who did not\nobject initially (but do so later) likely include many whose\nobjection rests, not upon constitutionally protected politi-\ncal grounds, but simply upon a desire not to pay a higher\nfee. And those who withhold fees for that reason are not\nentitled to constitutional protection in doing so. Here, the\nnonobjector cannot even claim that an increase in the total\nfee (by the amount of the special assessment) took him by\nsurprise, for in its initial Hudson notice the union said\nthat “[d]ues are subject to change without further notice to\nfee payers.” App. 98.\n   Finally, if the union will not let a nonmember object to a\nspecial assessment, that nonmember has an easy remedy.\nHe or she can simply object the first time around. After\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nall, the possibility of a special assessment is known in\nadvance; the possibility that some, or all of it, will help the\nunion make political expenditures is known in advance;\nthe fact that the union will spend a significant amount of\nordinary dues upon political matters is known in advance.\nTo obtain protection all a nonmember who believes he\nmight object to some future political expenditure has to do\nis to object in advance. His or her fees will decline from\nthe beginning. And, if the nonmember forgets to object,\nthere is always next year—when the chargeable amount of\nthe fee will be based on this year’s actual expenditures.\n   Given these considerations, I do not believe the First\nAmendment requires giving a second objection opportu-\nnity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time.\n                             IV\n   The Court also holds that, “when a public-sector union\nimposes a special assessment or dues increase,” it “may\nnot exact any funds from nonmembers without their af-\nfirmative consent.” Ante, at 22. In other words, the Court\nmandates an “opt-in” system in respect to the payment of\nspecial assessments.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurring opinion explains why\nthe Court is wrong to impose this requirement. See ante,\nat 2–6 (opinion concurring in judgment). It runs directly\ncontrary to precedent. No party asked that we do so. The\nmatter has not been fully argued in this Court or in the\ncourts below. I agree with her about this matter.\n   The decision is particularly unfortunate given the fact\nthat each reason the Court offers in support of its “opt-in”\nconclusion seems in logic to apply, not just to special as-\nsessments, but to ordinary yearly fee charges as well. At\nleast, its opinion can be so read. And that fact virtually\nguarantees that the opinion will play a central role in an\nongoing, intense political debate.\n   The debate is generally about whether, the extent to\n14             KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich, and the circumstances under which a union that\nrepresents nonmembers in collective bargaining can re-\nquire those nonmembers to help pay for the union’s (con-\nstitutionally chargeable) collective-bargaining expenses.\nTwenty-three States have enacted “right to work” laws,\nwhich, in effect, prevent unions from requiring nonmem-\nbers to pay any of those costs. See Dept. of Labor, Wage\nand Hour Division, State Right-to-Work Laws (Jan. 2009),\nonline at http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/righttowork.htm (as\nvisited June 18, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Other States have rejected the “right to work”\napproach and permit unions to require contributions from\nnonmembers, while protecting those nonmembers’ right\nto opt out of supporting the union’s political activities.\nE.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§3502.5(a), 3515.8. Still others\nhave enacted compromise laws that assume a nonmember\ndoes not wish to pay the nonchargeable portion of the fee\nunless he or she affirmatively indicates a desire to do so.\nSee Wash. Rev. Code §42.17A.500 (2010) (providing that a\nunion cannot use a nonmember’s agency fee for political\npurposes “unless affirmatively authorized by the individ-\nual”). The debate about public unions’ collective-bargaining\nrights is currently intense.\n  The question of how a nonmember indicates a desire not\nto pay constitutes an important part of this debate. Must\nthe union assume that the nonmember does not intend to\npay unless he affirmatively indicates his desire to pay, by\n“opting in”? Or, may the union assume that the nonmem-\nber is willing to pay unless the nonmember indicates a\ndesire not to pay, by “opting out”? Where, as here, non-\nchargeable political expenses are at issue, there may be a\nsignificant number of represented nonmembers who do not\nfeel strongly enough about the union’s politics to indicate a\nchoice either way. That being so, an “opt-in” requirement\ncan reduce union revenues significantly, a matter of con-\nsiderable importance to the union, while the additional\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)         15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nprotection it provides primarily helps only those who are\npolitically near neutral. See generally Sunstein & Thaler,\nLibertarian Paternalism is not an Oxymoron, 70 U. Chi.\nL. Rev. 1159, 1161 (2003) (explaining that default rules\nplay an important role when individuals do not have “well-\ndefined preferences”). Consequently, the Court, which\nheld recently that the Constitution permits a State to im-\npose an opt-in requirement, see Davenport, 551 U. S., at\n185, has never said that it mandates such a requirement.\nThere is no good reason for the Court suddenly to enter\nthe debate, much less now to decide that the Constitution\nresolves it.\n  Of course, principles of stare decisis are not absolute.\nBut the Court cannot be right when it departs from those\nprinciples without benefit of argument in a matter of such\nimportance.\n  For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/802771/", "sha1": "78378b0e31c0b49a3ef7d41d845d76b83ddfe6e6", "source": "C", "time_retrieved": "2012-06-21T07:13:33"}
